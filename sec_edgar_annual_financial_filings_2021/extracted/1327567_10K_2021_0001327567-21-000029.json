While we instituted a global work-from-home policy beginning in March 2020, which has been modified to provide employees with the choice to work in certain of our offices when and as they feel comfortable, we did not incur significant disruptions in our work operations during fiscal 2021. We are conducting business as usual with restrictions to employee travel, and we have transitioned in-person marketing events to virtual formats, among other modifications. We expect these changes will substantially remain in effect in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 and could extend to future quarters. We will continue to actively monitor the situation, including progress made through vaccinations, and we will make further changes to our business operations as may be required by federal, state, or local authorities and that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, end-customers, partners, suppliers, and stockholders. Our focus remains on the safety of our employees, and we strive to protect the health and well-being of the communities in which we operate, in part, by providing technology to our employees, end-customers, and partners to help them do their best work while remote.\nAlthough some end-customers adopted Prisma Access as their secure work-from-home solution for the longer term, COVID-19\n- 4 -\nhas affected our end-customers\u2019 spending and could lead them to delay or defer purchasing decisions, and lengthen sales cycles and payment terms, which could materially adversely impact our business, results of operations, and overall financial performance. Also, certain of our end-customers or partners may be or may become credit or cash constrained, making it difficult for them to fulfill their payment obligations to us. The extent of the impact of COVID-19 on our operational and financial performance will depend on developments, including the duration and spread of the virus and its variants, impact on our end-customers\u2019 spending, volume of sales and length of our sales cycles, impact on our partners, suppliers, and employees, actions that may be taken by governmental authorities, and other factors identified in Part I,",
    "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nOur operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties including those described below. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we currently believe are not material, also may become important factors that affect us. If any of the following risks or others not specified below materialize, our business, financial condition, and operating results could be materially adversely affected, and the market price of our common stock could decline. In addition, the impacts of COVID-19 and any worsening of the economic environment may exacerbate the risks described below, any of which could have a material impact on us. This situation is changing rapidly, and additional impacts may arise that we are not currently aware of.\nRISK FACTOR SUMMARY\nOur business is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. These risks include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022The ongoing global COVID-19 outbreak could harm our business and results of operations.\n\u2022Our business and operations have experienced growth in recent periods, and if we do not effectively manage any future growth or are unable to improve our systems, processes, and controls, our operating results could be adversely affected.\n\u2022Our operating results may vary significantly from period to period and be unpredictable, which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\n\u2022Ongoing global economic uncertainty could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results.\n\u2022Our revenue growth rate in recent periods may not be indicative of our future performance.\n\u2022We have a history of losses, anticipate increasing our operating expenses in the future, and may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability or maintain or increase cash flow on a consistent basis, which could cause our business, financial condition, and operating results to suffer.\n\u2022If we are unable to sell new and additional product, subscription, and support offerings to our end-customers, our future revenue and operating results will be harmed.\n\u2022We face intense competition in our market and we may lack sufficient financial or other resources to maintain or improve our competitive position.\n\u2022A network or data security incident may allow unauthorized access to our network or data, harm our reputation, create additional liability, and adversely impact our financial results.\n\u2022Reliance on shipments at the end of the quarter could cause our revenue for the applicable period to fall below expected levels.\n\u2022Seasonality may cause fluctuations in our revenue.\n\u2022If we are unable to hire, integrate, train, retain, and motivate qualified personnel and senior management, our business could suffer.\n\u2022If we are not successful in executing our strategy to increase sales of our products, subscriptions and support offerings to new and existing medium and large enterprise end-customers, our operating results may suffer.\n\u2022We rely on revenue from subscription and support offerings, and because we recognize revenue from subscription and support over the term of the relevant service period, downturns or upturns in sales of these subscription and support offerings are not immediately reflected in full in our operating results.\n\u2022Defects, errors, or vulnerabilities in our products, subscriptions, or support offerings, the failure of our products or subscriptions to block a virus or prevent a security breach or incident, misuse of our products, or risks of product liability claims could harm our reputation and adversely impact our operating results.\n\u2022False detection of applications, viruses, spyware, vulnerability exploits, data patterns, or URL categories could adversely affect our business.\n\u2022We rely on our channel partners to sell substantially all of our products, including subscriptions and support, and if these channel partners fail to perform, our ability to sell and distribute our products and subscriptions will be limited, and our operating results will be harmed.\n\u2022If we do not accurately predict, prepare for, and respond promptly to rapidly evolving technological and market developments and successfully manage product and subscription introductions and transitions to meet changing end-customer needs in the enterprise security industry, our competitive position and prospects will be harmed.\n\u2022Our current research and development efforts may not produce successful products, subscriptions, or features that result in significant revenue, cost savings or other benefits in the near future, if at all.\n- 14 -\n\u2022We may acquire other businesses, which could subject us to adverse claims or liabilities, require significant management attention, disrupt our business, and adversely affect our operating results, may not result in the expected benefits of such acquisitions and may dilute stockholder value.\n\u2022Because we depend on manufacturing partners to build and ship our products, we are susceptible to manufacturing and logistics delays and pricing fluctuations that could prevent us from shipping customer orders on time, if at all, or on a cost-effective basis, which may result in the loss of sales and end-customers.\n\u2022Managing the supply of our products and product components is complex. Insufficient supply and inventory may result in lost sales opportunities or delayed revenue, while excess inventory may harm our gross margins.\n\u2022Because some of the key components in our products come from limited sources of supply, we are susceptible to supply shortages or supply changes, which could disrupt or delay our scheduled product deliveries to our end-customers and may result in the loss of sales and end-customers.\n\u2022The sales prices of our products and subscriptions may decrease, which may reduce our gross profits and adversely impact our financial results.\n\u2022We generate a significant amount of revenue from sales to distributors, resellers, and end-customers outside of the United States, and we are therefore subject to a number of risks associated with international sales and operations.\n\u2022We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which could negatively affect our financial condition and operating results.\n\u2022We are exposed to the credit and liquidity risk of some of our channel partners and end-customers, and to credit exposure in weakened markets, which could result in material losses.\n\u2022A portion of our revenue is generated by sales to government entities, which are subject to a number of challenges and risks.\n\u2022Our ability to sell our products and subscriptions is dependent on the quality of our technical support services and those of our channel partners, and the failure to offer high-quality technical support services could have a material adverse effect on our end-customers\u2019 satisfaction with our products and subscriptions, our sales, and our operating results.\n\u2022Claims by others that we infringe their proprietary technology or other rights could harm our business.\n\u2022Our proprietary rights may be difficult to enforce or protect, which could enable others to copy or use aspects of our products or subscriptions without compensating us.\n\u2022Our use of open source software in our products and subscriptions could negatively affect our ability to sell our products and subscriptions and subject us to possible litigation.\n\u2022We license technology from third parties, and our inability to maintain those licenses could harm our business.\n\u2022Our failure to adequately protect personal information could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\u2022We face risks associated with having operations and employees located in Israel.\n\u2022We are subject to governmental export and import controls that could subject us to liability or impair our ability to compete in international markets.\n\u2022Our failure to raise additional capital or generate the significant capital necessary to expand our operations and invest in new products and subscriptions could reduce our ability to compete and could harm our business.\n\u2022We have a corporate structure aligned with the international nature of our business activities, and if we do not achieve increased tax benefits as a result of our corporate structure, our financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected.\n\u2022We may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to settle conversions of our Notes, repurchase our Notes upon a fundamental change, or repay our Notes in cash at their maturity, and our future debt may contain limitations on our ability to pay cash upon conversion or repurchase of our Notes.\n\u2022Our charter documents and Delaware law, as well as certain provisions contained in the indentures governing our Notes, could discourage takeover attempts and lead to management entrenchment, which could also reduce the market price of our common stock.\n- 15 -\nRisks Related to Our Business and Our Industry\nThe ongoing global COVID-19 outbreak could harm our business and results of operations.\nThe novel strain of COVID-19 identified in late 2019 has spread globally, including within the United States, and has resulted in government authorities implementing numerous measures to try to contain the virus, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter in place orders, and shutdowns. This outbreak has negatively impacted and will likely continue to have a negative impact on, worldwide economic activity and financial markets and has impacted, and will further impact, our workforce and operations, the operations of our end-customers, and those of our respective channel partners, vendors and suppliers. In light of the uncertain and rapidly evolving situation relating to the spread of this virus and various government restrictions and guidelines, we have taken measures intended to mitigate the spread of the virus and minimize the risk to our employees, channel partners, end-customers, and the communities in which we operate. These measures include transitioning our employee population to work remotely from home beginning in March 2020, which continued through the fiscal year ended July 31, 2021, and may continue into future quarters. Although we continue to monitor the situation and may adjust our current policies as more information and public health guidance become available, including progress made through vaccinations, these precautionary measures that we have adopted could negatively affect our customer success efforts, sales and marketing efforts, delay and lengthen our sales cycles, and create operational or other challenges, any of which could harm our business and results of operations. In addition, COVID-19 may continue to disrupt the operations of our end-customers and channel partners for an indefinite period of time, including as a result of travel restrictions and/or business shutdowns, all of which could negatively impact our business and results of operations, including cash flows.\nThe ongoing impact of COVID-19 is fluid and uncertain, but it has caused and may continue to cause various negative effects, including an inability to meet with our existing or potential end-customers; our end-customers deciding to delay or abandon their planned purchases; increased requests for delayed payment terms or product discounts by our end-customers and channel partners; us delaying, canceling, or withdrawing from user and industry conferences and other marketing events, including some of our own; changes in the demand for our products, which has caused us to reprioritize our engineering and research and development efforts and make changes to our original offering roadmap; and delays or possible disruptions in our supply chain. As a result, we may experience extended sales cycles; our demand generation activities, and our ability to close transactions with end-customers and partners may be negatively impacted; our ability to provide 24x7 worldwide support and/or replacement parts to our end-customers may be adversely affected; and it has been and, until the COVID-19 outbreak is contained and global economic activity stabilizes, will continue to be more difficult for us to forecast our operating results.\nMore generally, the outbreak has not only significantly and adversely increased economic and demand uncertainty, but it has caused a global economic slowdown, and continuing global economic uncertainty which could decrease technology spending and adversely affect demand for our offerings and harm our business and results of operations.\nOur business and operations have experienced growth in recent periods, and if we do not effectively manage any future growth or are unable to improve our systems, processes, and controls, our operating results could be adversely affected.\nWe have experienced growth and increased demand for our products and subscriptions over the last few years. As a result, our employee headcount has increased significantly, and we expect it to continue to grow over the next year. For example, from the end of fiscal 2020 to the end of fiscal 2021, our headcount increased from 8,014 to 10,473 employees. In addition, as we have grown, our number of end-customers has also increased significantly, and we have increasingly managed more complex deployments of our products and subscriptions with larger end-customers. The growth and expansion of our business and product, subscription, and support offerings places a significant strain on our management, operational, and financial resources. To manage any future growth effectively, we must continue to improve and expand our information technology and financial infrastructure, our operating and administrative systems and controls, and our ability to manage headcount, capital, and processes in an efficient manner, all of which may be more difficult to accomplish the longer that our employees must work remotely from home.\nWe may not be able to successfully implement or scale improvements to our systems, processes, and controls in an efficient or timely manner. In addition, our existing systems, processes, and controls may not prevent or detect all errors, omissions, or fraud. We may also experience difficulties in managing improvements to our systems, processes, and controls or in connection with third-party software licensed to help us with such improvements. Any future growth would add complexity to our organization and require effective coordination throughout our organization. Failure to manage any future growth effectively could result in increased costs, disrupt our existing end-customer relationships, reduce demand for or limit us to smaller deployments of our products, or harm our business performance and operating results.\n- 16 -\nOur operating results may vary significantly from period to period and be unpredictable, which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nOur operating results, in particular, our revenues, gross margins, operating margins, and operating expenses, have historically varied from period to period, and even though we have experienced growth, we expect variation to continue as a result of a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control and may be difficult to predict, including:\n\u2022our ability to attract and retain new end-customers or sell additional products and subscriptions to our existing end-customers;\n\u2022the budgeting cycles, seasonal buying patterns, and purchasing practices of our end-customers, including the likely slowdown in technology spending due to the global economic downturn;\n\u2022changes in end-customer, distributor or reseller requirements, or market needs;\n\u2022price competition;\n\u2022the timing and success of new product and service introductions by us or our competitors or any other change in the competitive landscape of our industry, including consolidation among our competitors or end-customers and strategic partnerships entered into by and between our competitors;\n\u2022changes in the mix of our products, subscriptions, and support, including changes in multi-year subscriptions and support;\n\u2022our ability to successfully and continuously expand our business domestically and internationally, particularly in the current global economic slowdown;\n\u2022changes in the growth rate of the enterprise security industry;\n\u2022deferral of orders from end-customers in anticipation of new products or product enhancements announced by us or our competitors;\n\u2022the timing and costs related to the development or acquisition of technologies or businesses or strategic partnerships;\n\u2022lack of synergy or the inability to realize expected synergies, resulting from acquisitions or strategic partnerships;\n\u2022our inability to execute, complete, or integrate efficiently any acquisitions that we may undertake;\n\u2022increased expenses, unforeseen liabilities, or write-downs and any impact on our operating results from any acquisitions we consummate;\n\u2022our ability to increase the size and productivity of our distribution channel;\n\u2022decisions by potential end-customers to purchase security solutions from larger, more established security vendors or from their primary network equipment vendors;\n\u2022changes in end-customer penetration or attach and renewal rates for our subscriptions;\n\u2022timing of revenue recognition and revenue deferrals;\n\u2022our ability to manage production and manufacturing related costs, global customer service organization costs, inventory excess and obsolescence costs, and warranty costs, especially due to potential disruptions in our supply chain as a result of COVID-19;\n\u2022our ability to manage cloud hosting service costs and scale the cloud-based subscription offerings;\n\u2022insolvency or credit difficulties confronting our end-customers, which could increase due to the effects of COVID-19 and adversely affect their ability to purchase or pay for our products and subscription and support offerings in a timely manner or at all, or confronting our key suppliers, including our sole source suppliers, which could disrupt our supply chain;\n\u2022any disruption in our channel or termination of our relationships with important channel partners, including as a result of consolidation among distributors and resellers of security solutions;\n\u2022our inability to fulfill our end-customers\u2019 orders due to supply chain delays or events that impact our manufacturers or their suppliers, which may be adversely affected by the effects of COVID-19;\n\u2022the cost and potential outcomes of litigation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business;\n\u2022seasonality or cyclical fluctuations in our markets;\n\u2022future accounting pronouncements or changes in our accounting policies;\n- 17 -\n\u2022increases or decreases in our expenses caused by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, as an increasing amount of our expenses is incurred and paid in currencies other than the U.S. dollar;\n\u2022political, economic and social instability caused by the United Kingdom\u2019s exit from the European Union (\u201cBrexit\u201d), continued hostilities in the Middle East, terrorist activities, any disruptions from COVID-19 and any disruption these events may cause to the broader global industrial economy; and\n\u2022general macroeconomic conditions, both domestically and in our foreign markets that could impact some or all regions where we operate, including the expected global economic slowdown, increased risk of inflation, and potential global recession caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAny one of the factors above, or the cumulative effect of some of the factors referred to above, may result in significant fluctuations in our financial and other operating results. This variability and unpredictability could result in our failure to meet our revenue, margin, or other operating result expectations or those of securities analysts or investors for a particular period. If we fail to meet or exceed such expectations for these or any other reasons, the market price of our common stock could fall substantially, and we could face costly lawsuits, including securities class action suits.\nOngoing global economic uncertainty could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nWe operate globally and as a result our business and revenues are impacted by global macroeconomic conditions. The multinational efforts to contain the spread of COVID-19 have had a significant adverse effect on the global macroeconomic environment that continues to cause economic uncertainty. In addition, the instability in the global credit markets, falling demand for oil and other commodities, uncertainties regarding the effects of Brexit, uncertainties related to the timing of the lifting of governmental restrictions to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, changes in public policies such as domestic and international regulations, taxes, or international trade agreements, international trade disputes, government shutdowns, geopolitical turmoil and other disruptions to global and regional economies and markets continue to add uncertainty to global economic conditions.\nThese adverse conditions could result in reductions in sales of our products and subscriptions, longer sales cycles, reductions in subscription or contract duration and value, slower adoption of new technologies, and increased price competition. As a result, any continued or further uncertainty, weakness or deterioration in global macroeconomic and market conditions may cause our end-customers to modify spending priorities or delay purchasing decisions, and result in lengthened sales cycles, any of which could harm our business and operating results.\nOur revenue growth rate in recent periods may not be indicative of our future performance.\nWe have experienced revenue growth rates of 24.9% and 17.5% in fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020, respectively. Our revenue for any prior quarterly or annual period should not be relied upon as an indication of our future revenue or revenue growth for any future period. If we are unable to maintain consistent or increasing revenue or revenue growth, the market price of our common stock could be volatile, and it may be difficult for us to achieve and maintain profitability or maintain or increase cash flow on a consistent basis.\nWe have a history of losses, anticipate increasing our operating expenses in the future, and may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability or maintain or increase cash flow on a consistent basis, which could cause our business, financial condition, and operating results to suffer.\nOther than fiscal 2012, we have incurred losses in all fiscal years since our inception. As a result, we had an accumulated deficit of $1.7 billion as of July 31, 2021. We anticipate that our operating expenses will continue to increase in the foreseeable future as we continue to grow our business. Our growth efforts may prove more expensive than we currently anticipate, and we may not succeed in increasing our revenues sufficiently, or at all, to offset increasing expenses. Revenue growth may slow or revenue may decline for a number of possible reasons, including the downturn in the global and U.S. economy due to COVID-19, slowing demand for our products or subscriptions, increasing competition, a decrease in the growth of, or a demand shift in, our overall market, or a failure to capitalize on growth opportunities. Any failure to increase our revenue as we grow our business could prevent us from achieving or maintaining profitability or maintaining or increasing cash flow on a consistent basis. In addition, we may have difficulty achieving profitability under U.S. GAAP due to share-based compensation expense and other non-cash charges. If we are unable to navigate these challenges as we encounter them, our business, financial condition, and operating results may suffer.\nIf we are unable to sell new and additional product, subscription, and support offerings to our end-customers, our future revenue and operating results will be harmed.\nOur future success depends, in part, on our ability to expand the deployment of our portfolio with existing end-customers and create demand for our new offerings, including cloud security, AI, and analytics offerings. This may require increasingly sophisticated and costly sales efforts that may not result in additional sales. The rate at which our end-customers purchase additional products, subscriptions, and support depends on a number of factors, including the perceived need for additional security products, including subscription and support offerings, as well as general economic conditions. Further, existing end-customers have no contractual obligation to and may not renew their subscription and support contracts after the completion of their initial contract period. Our end-customers\u2019 renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including their level of satisfaction with our\n- 18 -\nsubscriptions and our support offerings, the frequency and severity of subscription outages, our product uptime or latency, and the pricing of our, or competing, subscriptions. Additionally, our end-customers may renew their subscription and support agreements for shorter contract lengths or on other terms that are less economically beneficial to us. We also cannot be certain that our end-customers will renew their subscription and support agreements. If our efforts to sell additional products and subscriptions to our end-customers are not successful or our end-customers do not renew their subscription and support agreements or renew them on less favorable terms, our revenues may grow more slowly than expected or decline.\nWe face intense competition in our market and we may lack sufficient financial or other resources to maintain or improve our competitive position.\nThe industry for enterprise security products is intensely competitive, and we expect competition to increase in the future from established competitors and new market entrants. Our main competitors fall into five categories:\n\u2022large companies that incorporate security features in their products, such as Cisco Systems, Inc. (\u201cCisco\u201d) or those that have acquired, or may acquire, large network and endpoint security vendors and have the technical and financial resources to bring competitive solutions to the market;\n\u2022independent security vendors such as Check Point Software Technologies Ltd. (\u201cCheck Point\u201d), Fortinet, Inc. (\u201cFortinet\u201d), and Zscaler, Inc. (\u201cZscaler\u201d) that offer a mix of network and endpoint security products;\n\u2022startups and single-vertical vendors that offer independent or emerging solutions across various areas of security;\n\u2022public cloud vendors and startups that offer solutions for cloud security (private, public and hybrid cloud); and\n\u2022large and small companies, such as Crowdstrike, Inc (\u201cCrowdstrike\u201d) that offer solutions for security operations and endpoint security.\nMany of our existing competitors have, and some of our potential competitors could have, substantial competitive advantages such as:\n\u2022greater name recognition and longer operating histories;\n\u2022larger sales and marketing budgets and resources;\n\u2022broader distribution and established relationships with distribution partners and end-customers;\n\u2022greater customer support resources;\n\u2022greater resources to make strategic acquisitions or enter into strategic partnerships;\n\u2022lower labor and development costs;\n\u2022newer or disruptive products or technologies;\n\u2022larger and more mature intellectual property portfolios; and\n\u2022substantially greater financial, technical, and other resources.\nIn addition, some of our larger competitors have substantially broader and more diverse product and services offerings, which may make them less susceptible to downturns in a particular market and allow them to leverage their relationships based on other products or incorporate functionality into existing products to gain business in a manner that discourages users from purchasing our products and subscriptions, including through selling at zero or negative margins, offering concessions, product bundling, or a closed technology offering. Many of our smaller competitors that specialize in providing protection from a single type of security threat are often able to deliver these specialized security products to the market more quickly than we can.\nOrganizations that use legacy products and services may believe that these products and services are sufficient to meet their security needs or that our offerings only serve the needs of a portion of the enterprise security industry. Accordingly, these organizations may continue allocating their information technology budgets for legacy products and services and may not adopt our security offerings. Further, many organizations have invested substantial personnel and financial resources to design and operate their networks and have established deep relationships with other providers of networking and security products. As a result, these organizations may prefer to purchase from their existing suppliers rather than add or switch to a new supplier such as us, regardless of product performance, features, or greater services offerings or may be more willing to incrementally add solutions to their existing security infrastructure from existing suppliers than to replace it wholesale with our solutions.\nConditions in our market could change rapidly and significantly as a result of technological advancements, partnering or acquisitions by our competitors, or continuing market consolidation. New start-up companies that innovate and large competitors that are making significant investments in research and development may invent similar or superior products and technologies that compete with our products and subscriptions. Some of our competitors have made or could make acquisitions of businesses that may allow them to offer more directly competitive and comprehensive solutions than they had previously offered and adapt more quickly\n- 19 -\nto new technologies and end-customer needs. Our current and potential competitors may also establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties that may further enhance their resources.\nThese competitive pressures in our market or our failure to compete effectively may result in price reductions, fewer orders, reduced revenue and gross margins, and loss of market share. Any failure to meet and address these factors could seriously harm our business and operating results.\nA network or data security incident may allow unauthorized access to our network or data, harm our reputation, create additional liability and adversely impact our financial results.\nIncreasingly, companies are subject to a wide variety of attacks on their networks on an ongoing basis. In addition to traditional computer \u201chackers,\u201d malicious code (such as viruses and worms), phishing attempts, employee theft or misuse, and denial of service attacks, sophisticated nation-state and nation-state supported actors engage in intrusions and attacks (including advanced persistent threat intrusions) and add to the risks to our internal networks, cloud-deployed enterprise and customer-facing environments and the information they store and process. The incidence of cybersecurity breaches have increased. Despite significant efforts to create security barriers to such threats, it is virtually impossible for us to entirely mitigate these risks. We and our third-party service providers may face security threats and attacks from a variety of sources. Our data, corporate systems, third-party systems and security measures may be breached due to the actions of outside parties, employee error, malfeasance, a combination of these, or otherwise, and, as a result, an unauthorized party may obtain access to our data. Furthermore, as a well-known provider of security solutions, we may be a more attractive target for such attacks. A breach in our data security or an attack against our service availability, or that of our third-party service providers, could impact our networks or networks secured by our products and subscriptions, creating system disruptions or slowdowns and exploiting security vulnerabilities of our products, and the information stored on our networks or those of our third-party service providers could be accessed, publicly disclosed, altered, lost, or stolen, which could subject us to liability and cause us financial harm. Although we have not yet experienced significant damages from unauthorized access by a third party of our internal network, any actual or perceived breach of network security in our systems or networks, or any other actual or perceived data security incident we or our third-party service providers suffer, could result in damage to our reputation, negative publicity, loss of channel partners, end-customers and sales, loss of competitive advantages over our competitors, increased costs to remedy any problems and otherwise respond to any incident, regulatory investigations and enforcement actions, costly litigation, and other liability. In addition, we may incur significant costs and operational consequences of investigating, remediating, eliminating and putting in place additional tools and devices designed to prevent actual or perceived security breaches and other security incidents, as well as the costs to comply with any notification obligations resulting from any security incidents. While we maintain cybersecurity insurance, our insurance may be insufficient to cover all liabilities incurred by these incidents, and any incidents may result in loss of, or increased costs of, our cybersecurity insurance. Any of these negative outcomes could adversely impact the market perception of our products and subscriptions and end-customer and investor confidence in our company and could seriously harm our business or operating results.\nReliance on shipments at the end of the quarter could cause our revenue for the applicable period to fall below expected levels.\nAs a result of end-customer buying patterns and the efforts of our sales force and channel partners to meet or exceed their sales objectives, we have historically received a substantial portion of sales orders and generated a substantial portion of revenue during the last few weeks of each fiscal quarter. If expected revenue at the end of any fiscal quarter is delayed for any reason, including the failure of anticipated purchase orders to materialize (particularly for large enterprise end-customers with lengthy sales cycles), our logistics partners\u2019 inability to ship products prior to fiscal quarter-end to fulfill purchase orders received near the end of a fiscal quarter (including due to the effects of COVID-19), our failure to manage inventory to meet demand, any failure of our systems related to order review and processing, or any delays in shipments based on trade compliance requirements (including new compliance requirements imposed by new or renegotiated trade agreements), revenue could fall below our expectations and the estimates of analysts for that quarter, which could adversely impact our business and operating results and cause a decline in the market price of our common stock.\nSeasonality may cause fluctuations in our revenue.\nWe believe there are significant seasonal factors that may cause our second and fourth fiscal quarters to record greater revenue sequentially than our first and third fiscal quarters. We believe that this seasonality results from a number of factors, including:\n\u2022end-customers with a December 31 fiscal year-end choosing to spend remaining unused portions of their discretionary budgets before their fiscal year-end, which potentially results in a positive impact on our revenue in our second fiscal quarter;\n\u2022our sales compensation plans, which are typically structured around annual quotas and commission rate accelerators, which potentially results in a positive impact on our revenue in our fourth fiscal quarter;\n\u2022seasonal reductions in business activity during August in the United States, Europe and certain other regions, which potentially results in a negative impact on our first fiscal quarter revenue; and\n- 20 -\n\u2022the timing of end-customer budget planning at the beginning of the calendar year, which can result in a delay in spending at the beginning of the calendar year potentially resulting in a negative impact on our revenue in our third fiscal quarter.\nAs we continue to grow, seasonal or cyclical variations in our operations may become more pronounced, and our business, operating results and financial position may be adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to hire, integrate, train, retain, and motivate qualified personnel and senior management, our business could suffer.\nOur future success depends, in part, on our ability to continue to hire, integrate, train, and retain qualified and highly skilled personnel. We are substantially dependent on the continued service of our existing engineering personnel because of the complexity of our offerings. Additionally, any failure to hire, integrate, train, and adequately incentivize our sales personnel or the inability of our recently hired sales personnel to effectively ramp to target productivity levels could negatively impact our growth and operating margins. Competition for highly skilled personnel, particularly in engineering, is often intense, especially in the San Francisco Bay Area, where we have a substantial presence and need for such personnel. Additionally, potential changes in U.S. immigration and work authorization laws and regulations, including in reaction to COVID-19, may make it difficult to renew or obtain visas for any highly skilled personnel that we have hired or are actively recruiting.\nIn addition, the industry in which we operate generally experiences high employee attrition. Although we have entered into employment offer letters with our key personnel, these agreements have no specific duration and constitute at-will employment. We do not maintain key person life insurance policies on any of our employees. The loss of one or more of our key employees, and any failure to have in place and execute an effective succession plan for key executives, could seriously harm our business. If we are unable to hire, integrate, train, or retain the qualified and highly skilled personnel required to fulfill our current or future needs, our business, financial condition, and operating results could be harmed.\nOur future performance also depends on the continued services and continuing contributions of our senior management to execute on our business plan and to identify and pursue new opportunities and product innovations. The loss of services of senior management, the decrease in the effectiveness of such services due to working remotely from home, or the ineffective management of any leadership transitions, especially within our sales organization, could significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our development and strategic objectives, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nFurther, we believe that a critical contributor to our success and our ability to retain highly skilled personnel has been our corporate culture, which we believe fosters innovation, inclusion, teamwork, passion for end-customers, focus on execution, and the facilitation of critical knowledge transfer and knowledge sharing. As we grow and change, we may find it difficult to maintain these important aspects of our corporate culture. While we are taking steps to develop a more inclusive and diverse workforce, there is no guarantee that we will be able to do so. Any failure to preserve our culture as we grow could limit our ability to innovate and could negatively affect our ability to retain and recruit personnel, continue to perform at current levels or execute on our business strategy.\nIf we are not successful in executing our strategy to increase sales of our products, subscriptions and support offerings to new and existing medium and large enterprise end-customers, our operating results may suffer.\nOur growth strategy is dependent, in part, upon increasing sales of our products, services, subscriptions and offerings to new and existing medium and large enterprise end-customers. Sales to these end-customers involve risks that may not be present, or that are present to a lesser extent, with sales to smaller entities. These risks include:\n\u2022competition from competitors, such as Cisco and Check Point, that traditionally target larger enterprises, service providers, and government entities and that may have pre-existing relationships or purchase commitments from those end-customers;\n\u2022increased purchasing power and leverage held by large end-customers in negotiating contractual arrangements with us;\n\u2022more stringent requirements in our worldwide support contracts, including stricter support response times and penalties for any failure to meet support requirements; and\n\u2022longer sales cycles, particularly during the current economic slowdown and in some cases over 12 months, and the associated risk that substantial time and resources may be spent on a potential end-customer that elects not to purchase our products and subscriptions.\nIn addition, product purchases by large enterprises are frequently subject to budget constraints, multiple approvals, and unplanned administrative, processing, and other delays. Finally, large enterprises typically have longer implementation cycles, require greater product functionality and scalability and a broader range of services, demand that vendors take on a larger share of risks, sometimes require acceptance provisions that can lead to a delay in revenue recognition, and expect greater payment flexibility from vendors. All of these factors can add further risk to business conducted with these end-customers. If we fail to realize an expected sale from a large end-customer in a particular quarter or at all, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\n- 21 -\nWe rely on revenue from subscription and support offerings, and because we recognize revenue from subscription and support over the term of the relevant service period, downturns or upturns in sales of these subscription and support offerings are not immediately reflected in full in our operating results.\nSubscription and support revenue accounts for a significant portion of our revenue, comprising 73.7% of total revenue in fiscal 2021, 68.8% of total revenue in fiscal 2020, and 62.2% of total revenue in fiscal 2019. Sales of new or renewal subscription and support contracts may decline and fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including end-customers\u2019 level of satisfaction with our products and subscriptions (including newly integrated products and services), the prices of our products and subscriptions, the prices of products and services offered by our competitors, and reductions in our end-customers\u2019 spending levels. If our sales of new or renewal subscription and support contracts decline, our total revenue and revenue growth rate may decline, and our business will suffer. In addition, we recognize subscription and support revenue over the term of the relevant service period, which is typically one to five years. As a result, much of the subscription and support revenue we report each fiscal quarter is the recognition of deferred revenue from subscription and support contracts entered into during previous fiscal quarters. Consequently, a decline in new or renewed subscription or support contracts in any one fiscal quarter will not be fully or immediately reflected in revenue in that fiscal quarter but will negatively affect our revenue in future fiscal quarters. Also, it is difficult for us to rapidly increase our subscription and support revenue through additional subscription and support sales in any period, as revenue from new and renewal subscription and support contracts must be recognized over the applicable service period.\nDefects, errors, or vulnerabilities in our products, subscriptions, or support offerings, the failure of our products or subscriptions to block a virus or prevent a security breach or incident, misuse of our products, or risks of product liability claims could harm our reputation and adversely impact our operating results.\nBecause our products and subscriptions are complex, they have contained and may contain design or manufacturing defects or errors that are not detected until after their commercial release and deployment by our end-customers. For example, from time to time, certain of our end-customers have reported defects in our products related to performance, scalability, and compatibility. Additionally, defects may cause our products or subscriptions to be vulnerable to security attacks, cause them to fail to help secure networks, or temporarily interrupt end-customers\u2019 networking traffic. Because the techniques used by computer hackers to access or sabotage networks change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques and provide a solution in time to protect our end-customers\u2019 networks. Furthermore, as a well-known provider of security solutions, our networks, products, including cloud-based technology, and subscriptions could be targeted by attacks specifically designed to disrupt our business and harm our reputation. In addition, defects or errors in our subscription updates or our products could result in a failure of our subscriptions to effectively update end-customers\u2019 hardware and cloud-based products. Our data centers and networks may experience technical failures and downtime, may fail to distribute appropriate updates, or may fail to meet the increased requirements of a growing installed end-customer base, any of which could temporarily or permanently expose our end-customers\u2019 networks, leaving their networks unprotected against the latest security threats. Moreover, our products must interoperate with our end-customers\u2019 existing infrastructure, which often have different specifications, utilize multiple protocol standards, deploy products from multiple vendors, and contain multiple generations of products that have been added over time. As a result, when problems occur in a network, it may be difficult to identify the sources of these problems.\nThe occurrence of any such problem in our products and subscriptions, whether real or perceived, could result in:\n\u2022expenditure of significant financial and product development resources in efforts to analyze, correct, eliminate, or work-around errors or defects or to address and eliminate vulnerabilities;\n\u2022loss of existing or potential end-customers or channel partners;\n\u2022delayed or lost revenue;\n\u2022delay or failure to attain market acceptance;\n\u2022an increase in warranty claims compared with our historical experience, or an increased cost of servicing warranty claims, either of which would adversely affect our gross margins; and\n\u2022litigation, regulatory inquiries, or investigations, each of which may be costly and harm our reputation.\nFurther, our products and subscriptions may be misused by end-customers or third parties that obtain access to our products and subscriptions. For example, our products and subscriptions could be used to censor private access to certain information on the Internet. Such use of our products and subscriptions for censorship could result in negative press coverage and negatively affect our reputation.\nThe limitation of liability provisions in our standard terms and conditions of sale may not fully or effectively protect us from claims as a result of federal, state, or local laws or ordinances, or unfavorable judicial decisions in the United States or other countries. The sale and support of our products and subscriptions also entails the risk of product liability claims. Although we may be indemnified by our third-party manufacturers for product liability claims arising out of manufacturing defects, because we control the design of our products and subscriptions, we may not be indemnified for product liability claims arising out of design defects. We\n- 22 -\nmaintain insurance to protect against certain claims associated with the use of our products and subscriptions, but our insurance coverage may not adequately cover any claim asserted against us. In addition, even claims that ultimately are unsuccessful could result in our expenditure of funds in litigation, divert management\u2019s time and other resources, and harm our reputation.\nFalse detection of applications, viruses, spyware, vulnerability exploits, data patterns, or URL categories could adversely affect our business.\nOur classifications of application type, virus, spyware, vulnerability exploits, data, or URL categories may falsely detect, report and act on applications, content, or threats that do not actually exist. This risk is heightened by the inclusion of a \u201cheuristics\u201d feature in our products and subscriptions, which attempts to identify applications and other threats not based on any known signatures but based on characteristics or anomalies which indicate that a particular item may be a threat. These false positives may impair the perceived reliability of our products and subscriptions and may therefore adversely impact market acceptance of our products and subscriptions. If our products and subscriptions restrict important files or applications based on falsely identifying them as malware or some other item that should be restricted, this could adversely affect end-customers\u2019 systems and cause material system failures. Any such false identification of important files or applications could result in damage to our reputation, negative publicity, loss of channel partners, end-customers and sales, increased costs to remedy any problem, and costly litigation.\nWe rely on our channel partners to sell substantially all of our products, including subscriptions and support, and if these channel partners fail to perform, our ability to sell and distribute our products and subscriptions will be limited, and our operating results will be harmed.\nSubstantially all of our revenue is generated by sales through our channel partners, including distributors and resellers. We provide our channel partners with specific training and programs to assist them in selling our products, including subscriptions and support offerings, but there can be no assurance that these steps will be utilized or effective. In addition, our channel partners may be unsuccessful in marketing, selling, and supporting our products and subscriptions. We may not be able to incentivize these channel partners to sell our products and subscriptions to end-customers and, in particular, to large enterprises. These channel partners may also have incentives to promote our competitors\u2019 products and may devote more resources to the marketing, sales, and support of competitive products. Our channel partners operations may also be negatively impacted by other effects COVID-19 is having on the global economy, such as increased credit risk of end-customers and the uncertain credit markets. Our agreements with our channel partners may generally be terminated for any reason by either party with advance notice prior to each annual renewal date. We cannot be certain that we will retain these channel partners or that we will be able to secure additional or replacement channel partners. In addition, any new channel partner requires extensive training and may take several months or more to achieve productivity. Our channel partner sales structure could subject us to lawsuits, potential liability, and reputational harm if, for example, any of our channel partners misrepresent the functionality of our products or subscriptions to end-customers or violate laws or our corporate policies. If we fail to effectively manage our sales channels or channel partners, our ability to sell our products and subscriptions and operating results will be harmed.\nIf we do not accurately predict, prepare for, and respond promptly to rapidly evolving technological and market developments and successfully manage product and subscription introductions and transitions to meet changing end-customer needs in the enterprise security industry, our competitive position and prospects will be harmed.\nThe enterprise security industry has grown quickly and is expected to continue to evolve rapidly. Moreover, many of our end-customers operate in markets characterized by rapidly changing technologies and business plans, which require them to add numerous network access points and adapt increasingly complex enterprise networks, incorporating a variety of hardware, software applications, operating systems, and networking protocols. We must continually change our products and expand our business strategy in response to changes in network infrastructure requirements, including the expanding use of cloud computing. For example, organizations are moving portions of their data to be managed by third parties, primarily infrastructure, platform and application service providers, and may rely on such providers\u2019 internal security measures. In 2019, we announced our new cloud security offerings for securing access to the cloud (Prisma), and our security offerings for securing the future of security operations (Cortex). While we have historically been successful in developing, acquiring, and marketing new products and product enhancements that respond to technological change and evolving industry standards, we may not be able to continue to do so, and there can be no assurance that our new or future offerings will be successful or will achieve widespread market acceptance. If we fail to accurately predict end-customers\u2019 changing needs and emerging technological trends in the enterprise security industry, including in the areas of mobility, virtualization, cloud computing, and software defined networks (\u201cSDN\u201d), our business could be harmed. In addition, COVID-19 and the resulting increase in customer demand for work-from-home technologies and other technologies have caused us to reprioritize our engineering and R&D efforts and there can be no assurance that any product enhancements or new features will be successful or address our end-customer needs.\nThe technology in our portfolio is especially complex because it needs to effectively identify and respond to new and increasingly sophisticated methods of attack, while minimizing the impact on network performance. Additionally, some of our new features and related enhancements may require us to develop new hardware architectures that involve complex, expensive, and time-consuming research and development processes. The development of our portfolio is difficult and the timetable for commercial release and availability is uncertain as there can be long time periods between releases and availability of new features. If we experience\n- 23 -\nunanticipated delays in the availability of new products, features and subscriptions, and fail to meet customer expectations for such availability, our competitive position and business prospects will be harmed.\nAdditionally, we must commit significant resources to developing new features and new cloud security, AI/analytics and other offerings before knowing whether our investments will result in products, subscriptions, and features the market will accept. The success of new features depends on several factors, including appropriate new product definition, differentiation of new products, subscriptions, and features from those of our competitors, and market acceptance of these products, services and features. Moreover, successful new product introduction and transition depends on a number of factors, including our ability to manage the risks associated with new product production ramp-up issues, the availability of application software for new products, the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory, the availability of products in appropriate quantities and costs to meet anticipated demand, and the risk that new products may have quality or other defects or deficiencies, especially in the early stages of introduction. There can be no assurance that we will successfully identify opportunities for new products and subscriptions, develop and bring new products and subscriptions to market in a timely manner, or achieve market acceptance of our products and subscriptions, including our product enhancement efforts in connection with COVID-19, or that products, subscriptions, and technologies developed by others will not render our products, subscriptions, or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive.\nOur current research and development efforts may not produce successful products, subscriptions, or features that result in significant revenue, cost savings or other benefits in the near future, if at all.\nDeveloping our products, subscriptions, features, and related enhancements is expensive. Our investments in research and development may not result in significant design improvements, marketable products, subscriptions, or features, or may result in products, subscriptions, or features that are more expensive than anticipated. Additionally, we may not achieve the cost savings or the anticipated performance improvements we expect, and we may take longer to generate revenue, or generate less revenue, than we anticipate. Our future plans include significant investments in research and development and related product and subscription opportunities. We believe that we must continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to our research and development efforts to maintain our competitive position. However, we may not receive significant revenue from these investments in the near future, if at all, or these investments may not yield the expected benefits, either of which could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nWe may acquire other businesses, which could subject us to adverse claims or liabilities, require significant management attention, disrupt our business, adversely affect our operating results, may not result in the expected benefits of such acquisitions and may dilute stockholder value.\nAs part of our business strategy, we may acquire or make investments in complementary companies, products, or technologies. The identification of suitable acquisition candidates is difficult, and we may not be able to complete such acquisitions on favorable terms, if at all. In addition, we may be subject to claims or liabilities assumed from an acquired company, product, or technology; acquisitions we complete could be viewed negatively by our end-customers, investors, and securities analysts; and we may incur costs and expenses necessary to address an acquired company\u2019s failure to comply with laws and governmental rules and regulations. Additionally, we may be subject to litigation or other claims in connection with the acquired company, including claims from terminated employees, customers, former stockholders, or other third parties, which may differ from or be more significant than the risks our business faces.\nIf we are unsuccessful at integrating past or future acquisitions in a timely manner, or the technologies and operations associated with such acquisitions, into our company, our revenue and operating results could be adversely affected. Any integration process may require significant time and resources, which may disrupt our ongoing business and divert management\u2019s attention, and we may not be able to manage the integration process successfully or in a timely manner. We may not successfully evaluate or utilize the acquired technology or personnel, realize anticipated synergies from the acquisition, or accurately forecast the financial impact of an acquisition transaction and integration of such acquisition, including accounting charges and any potential impairment of goodwill and intangible assets recognized in connection with such acquisitions.\nOur completed or future acquisitions may not ultimately strengthen our competitive position or achieve our goals and business strategy. We may find that the acquired businesses, products, or technologies do not further our business strategy as we expected. Our acquisitions may be viewed negatively by our customers, financial markets, or investors. We may experience difficulty integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired business, and we may have difficulty retaining the key personnel of the acquired business. We may have difficulty integrating the acquired technologies or products with our existing product lines and we may have difficulty maintaining uniform standards, controls, procedures, and policies across diverse or expanding geographic locations.\nWe may have to pay cash, incur debt, or issue equity or equity-linked securities to pay for any future acquisitions, each of which could adversely affect our financial condition or the market price of our common stock. Furthermore, the sale of equity or issuance of equity-linked debt to finance any future acquisitions could result in dilution to our stockholders. See the risk factors entitled \u201cOur failure to raise additional capital or generate the significant capital necessary to expand our operations and invest in new products and subscriptions could reduce our ability to compete and could harm our business.\u201d and \u201cThe issuance of additional stock in connection with financings, acquisitions, investments, our stock incentive plans, the conversion of our Notes or exercise of the\n- 24 -\nrelated Warrants, or otherwise will dilute all other stockholders.\u201d The occurrence of any of these risks could harm our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nRisks Related to our Supply Chain\nBecause we depend on manufacturing partners to build and ship our products, we are susceptible to manufacturing and logistics delays and pricing fluctuations that could prevent us from shipping customer orders on time, if at all, or on a cost-effective basis, which may result in the loss of sales and end-customers.\nWe depend on manufacturing partners, primarily our EMS provider, Flex, as our sole source manufacturers for our product lines. Our reliance on these manufacturing partners reduces our control over the manufacturing process and exposes us to risks, including reduced control over quality assurance, product costs, product supply, timing and transportation risk. Our products are manufactured by our manufacturing partners at facilities located in the United States. Some of the components in our products are sourced either through Flex or directly by us from component suppliers outside the United States. The portion of our products that are sourced outside the United States may subject us to additional logistical risks (which may increase due to the global impact of COVID-19) or risks associated with complying with local rules and regulations in foreign countries. Significant changes to existing international trade agreements could lead to sourcing or logistics disruption resulting from import delays or the imposition of increased tariffs on our sourcing partners. For example, the United States and Chinese governments have each enacted, and discussed additional, import tariffs. These tariffs, depending on their ultimate scope and how they are implemented, could negatively impact our business by increasing our costs. For example, some components that we import for final manufacturing in the United States have been impacted by these recent tariffs. As a result, our costs have increased and we have raised, and may be required to further raise, prices on our hardware products. Each of these factors could severely impair our ability to fulfill orders.\nIn addition, we are subject to requirements under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the \u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d) to diligence, disclose, and report whether or not our products contain minerals originating from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and adjoining countries, or conflict minerals. Although the SEC has provided guidance with respect to a portion of the conflict minerals filing requirements that may somewhat reduce our reporting practices, we have incurred and expect to incur additional costs to comply with these disclosure requirements, including costs related to determining the source of any of the relevant minerals and metals used in our products. These requirements could adversely affect the sourcing, availability, and pricing of minerals used in the manufacture of semiconductor devices or other components used in our products. We may also encounter end-customers who require that all of the components of our products be certified as conflict free. If we are not able to meet this requirement, such end-customers may choose not to purchase our products.\nOur manufacturing partners typically fulfill our supply requirements on the basis of individual purchase orders. We do not have long-term contracts with these manufacturers that guarantee capacity, the continuation of particular pricing terms, or the extension of credit limits. Accordingly, they are not obligated to continue to fulfill our supply requirements and the prices we pay for manufacturing services could be increased on short notice. Our contract with Flex permits them to terminate the agreement for their convenience, subject to prior notice requirements. If we are required to change manufacturing partners, our ability to meet our scheduled product deliveries to our end-customers could be adversely affected, which could cause the loss of sales to existing or potential end-customers, delayed revenue or an increase in our costs which could adversely affect our gross margins. COVID-19 and the global semiconductor shortage have in certain cases caused delays and challenges in obtaining components and inventory, as well as increases to freight and shipping costs, and may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Any production interruptions for any reason, such as a natural disaster, epidemic or pandemic such as COVID-19, capacity shortages, or quality problems at one of our manufacturing partners would negatively affect sales of our product lines manufactured by that manufacturing partner and adversely affect our business and operating results.\nManaging the supply of our products and product components is complex. Insufficient supply and inventory may result in lost sales opportunities or delayed revenue, while excess inventory may harm our gross margins.\nOur manufacturing partners procure components and build our products based on our forecasts, and we generally do not hold inventory for a prolonged period of time. These forecasts are based on estimates of future demand for our products, which are in turn based on historical trends and analyses from our sales and product management organizations, adjusted for overall market conditions. COVID-19 has made forecasting more difficult and we may experience increased challenges to our supply chain due to the unpredictability of the impacts of COVID-19. In order to reduce manufacturing lead times and plan for adequate component supply, from time to time we may issue forecasts for components and products that are non-cancelable and non-returnable.\nOur inventory management systems and related supply chain visibility tools may be inadequate to enable us to forecast accurately and effectively manage supply of our products and product components. If we ultimately determine that we have excess supply, we may have to reduce our prices and write-down inventory, which in turn could result in lower gross margins. If our actual component usage and product demand are lower than the forecast we provide to our manufacturing partners, we accrue for losses on manufacturing commitments in excess of forecasted demand. Alternatively, insufficient supply levels, including due to the recent global shortage of semiconductors, may lead to shortages that result in delayed product revenue or loss of sales opportunities\n- 25 -\naltogether as potential end-customers turn to competitors\u2019 products that are readily available. If we are unable to effectively manage our supply and inventory, our operating results could be adversely affected.\nBecause some of the key components in our products come from limited sources of supply, we are susceptible to supply shortages or supply changes, which could disrupt or delay our scheduled product deliveries to our end-customers and may result in the loss of sales and end-customers.\nOur products rely on key components, including integrated circuit components, which our manufacturing partners purchase on our behalf from a limited number of component suppliers, including sole source providers. The manufacturing operations of some of our component suppliers are geographically concentrated in Asia and elsewhere, which makes our supply chain vulnerable to regional disruptions, such as natural disasters, fire, political instability, civil unrest, a power outage, or health risks, such as epidemics and pandemics like COVID-19, and as a result have impaired, and could impair in the future, the volume of components that we are able to obtain. Lead times for components have also been adversely impacted by factors outside of our control, including COVID-19 and the recent global shortage of semiconductors. For example, we have experienced, and could continue to experience, increased difficulties in obtaining a sufficient amount of materials in the semiconductor market, which could reduce our flexibility to react to product mix changes and unforecasted orders.\nFurther, we do not have volume purchase contracts with any of our component suppliers, and they could cease selling to us at any time. If we are unable to obtain a sufficient quantity of these components in a timely manner for any reason, sales of our products could be delayed or halted, or we could be forced to expedite shipment of such components or our products at dramatically increased costs. Our component suppliers also change their selling prices frequently in response to market trends, including industry-wide increases in demand, and because we do not have volume purchase contracts with these component suppliers, we are susceptible to price fluctuations related to raw materials and components and may not be able to adjust our prices accordingly. Additionally, poor quality in any of the sole-sourced components in our products could result in lost sales or sales opportunities.\nIf we are unable to obtain a sufficient volume of the necessary components for our products on commercially reasonable terms or the quality of the components do not meet our requirements, we could also be forced to redesign our products and qualify new components from alternate component suppliers. The resulting stoppage or delay in selling our products and the expense of redesigning our products could result in lost sales opportunities and damage to customer relationships, which would adversely affect our business and operating results.\nRisks Related to Sales of our Products, Subscriptions and Support Offerings\nThe sales prices of our products, subscriptions and support offerings may decrease, which may reduce our gross profits and adversely impact our financial results.\nThe sales prices for our products, subscriptions and support offerings may decline for a variety of reasons, including competitive pricing pressures, discounts, a change in our mix of products, subscriptions and support offerings, anticipation of the introduction of new products, subscriptions or support offerings, or promotional programs or pricing pressures as a result of the economic downturn resulting from COVID-19. Competition continues to increase in the market segments in which we participate, and we expect competition to further increase in the future, thereby leading to increased pricing pressures. Larger competitors with more diverse product and service offerings may reduce the price of products or subscriptions that compete with ours or may bundle them with other products and subscriptions. Additionally, although we price our products, subscriptions and support offerings worldwide in U.S. dollars, currency fluctuations in certain countries and regions may negatively impact actual prices that channel partners and end-customers are willing to pay in those countries and regions. Furthermore, we anticipate that the sales prices and gross profits for our products could decrease over product life cycles. We cannot guarantee that we will be successful in developing and introducing new offerings with enhanced functionality on a timely basis, or that our products, subscriptions and support offerings, if introduced, will enable us to maintain our prices and gross profits at levels that will allow us to achieve and maintain profitability.\nWe generate a significant amount of revenue from sales to distributors, resellers, and end-customers outside of the United States, and we are therefore subject to a number of risks associated with international sales and operations.\nWe have a limited history of marketing, selling, and supporting our products, subscriptions and support offerings internationally. We may experience difficulties in recruiting, training, managing, and retaining an international staff, and specifically staff related to sales management and sales personnel. We also may not be able to maintain successful strategic distributor relationships internationally or recruit additional companies to enter into strategic distributor relationships. Business practices in the international markets that we serve may differ from those in the United States and may require us in the future to include terms other than our standard terms related to payment, warranties, or performance obligations in end-customer contracts.\nAdditionally, our international sales and operations are subject to a number of risks, including the following:\n\u2022political, economic and social uncertainty around the world, health risks such as epidemics and pandemics like COVID-19, macroeconomic challenges in Europe, terrorist activities, and continued hostilities in the Middle East;\n\u2022greater difficulty in enforcing contracts and accounts receivable collection and longer collection periods;\n- 26 -\n\u2022the uncertainty of protection for intellectual property rights in some countries;\n\u2022greater risk of unexpected changes in foreign and domestic regulatory practices, tariffs, and tax laws and treaties, including regulatory and trade policy changes adopted by the current administration or foreign countries in response to regulatory changes adopted by the current administration;\n\u2022risks associated with trade restrictions and foreign legal requirements, including the importation, certification, and localization of our products required in foreign countries;\n\u2022greater risk of a failure of foreign employees, channel partners, distributors, and resellers to comply with both U.S. and foreign laws, including antitrust regulations, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act, U.S. or foreign sanctions regimes and export or import control laws, and any trade regulations ensuring fair trade practices, which non-compliance could include increased costs;\n\u2022heightened risk of unfair or corrupt business practices in certain geographies and of improper or fraudulent sales arrangements;\n\u2022increased expenses incurred in establishing and maintaining office space and equipment for our international operations;\n\u2022management communication and integration problems resulting from cultural and geographic dispersion; and\n\u2022fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies in markets where we do business and related impact on sales cycles.\nThese and other factors could harm our future international revenues and, consequently, materially impact our business, operating results, and financial condition. The expansion of our existing international operations and entry into additional international markets will require significant management attention and financial resources. Our failure to successfully manage our international operations and the associated risks effectively could limit the future growth of our business.\nFurther, we are subject to risks associated with changes in economic and political conditions in countries in which we operate or sell our products and subscriptions. For instance, Brexit creates an uncertain political and economic environment in the United Kingdom (\u201cU.K.\u201d) and across European Union (\u201cE.U.\u201d) member states for the foreseeable future. On January 31, 2020 the U.K. left the E.U. The rules governing the new relationship between the E.U. and the U.K. were set out in the E.U.-U.K. Trade and Cooperation Agreement (i.e., the Brexit deal) and came into force on January 1, 2021. At this time, we cannot predict the impact that the Brexit deal and any future agreements will have on our business. Our financial condition and operating results may be impacted by such uncertainty with potential disruptions to our relationships with existing and future customers, suppliers and employees all possibly having a material adverse impact on our business, prospects, financial condition and/or operating results.\nWe are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which could negatively affect our financial condition and operating results.\nOur sales contracts are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars, and therefore, substantially all of our revenue is not subject to foreign currency risk. However, there has been, and may continue to be, significant volatility in global stock markets and foreign currency exchange rates that result in the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies in which we conduct business. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar increases the real cost of our products to our end-customers outside of the United States and may lead to delays in the purchase of our products, subscriptions, and support, and the lengthening of our sales cycle. If the U.S. dollar continues to strengthen, this could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results. In addition, increased international sales in the future, including through our channel partners and other partnerships, may result in greater foreign currency denominated sales, increasing our foreign currency risk.\nOur operating expenses incurred outside the United States and denominated in foreign currencies are increasing and are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. If we are not able to successfully hedge against the risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations, our financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected. We have entered into forward contracts in an effort to reduce our foreign currency exchange exposure related to our foreign currency denominated expenditures. As of July 31, 2021, the total notional amount of our outstanding foreign currency forward contracts was $531.9 million. For more information on our hedging transactions, refer to Note 6. Derivative Instruments in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The effectiveness of our existing hedging transactions and the availability and effectiveness of any hedging transactions we may decide to enter into in the future may be limited and we may not be able to successfully hedge our exposure, which could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nWe are exposed to the credit and liquidity risk of some of our channel partners and end-customers, and to credit exposure in weakened markets, which could result in material losses.\nMost of our sales are made on an open credit basis. Beyond our open credit arrangements, we have also experienced demands for customer financing due to COVID-19 and our competitors\u2019 offerings. The majority of these demands are currently facilitated by leasing and other financing arrangements provided by our distributors and resellers. To respond to this demand, our customer\n- 27 -\nfinancing activities may increase in the future. We also provide financings to certain end-customers. We monitor customer payment capability in granting such financing arrangements, seek to limit such open credit to amounts we believe the end-customers can pay and maintain reserves we believe are adequate to cover exposure for doubtful accounts to mitigate credit risks of these end-customers. However, there can be no assurance that these programs will be effective in reducing our credit risks.\nWe believe customer financing is a competitive factor in obtaining business. The loan financing arrangements provided by our distributors and resellers may include not only financing the acquisition of our products and services but also providing additional funds for other costs associated with network installation and integration of our products and services.\nOur exposure to the credit risks relating to the financing activities described above may increase if our customers are adversely affected by a global economic downturn or periods of economic uncertainty. Although we have programs in place with our distributors and resellers that are designed to monitor and mitigate these risks, we cannot guarantee these programs will be effective in reducing the credit risks, especially as we expand our business internationally. If we are unable to adequately control these risks, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be harmed.\nIn the past, we have experienced non-material losses due to bankruptcies among customers. If these losses increase due to COVID-19 or global economic conditions, they could harm our business and financial condition. A material portion of our sales is derived through our distributors.\nFor fiscal 2021, three distributors individually represented 10% or more of our total revenue, and in the aggregate represented 56.0% of our total revenue. As of July 31, 2021, four distributors individually represented 10% or more of our gross accounts receivable, and in the aggregate represented 56.6% of our gross accounts receivable.\nAdditionally, to the degree that turmoil in the credit markets makes it more difficult for some customers to obtain financing, those customers\u2019 ability to pay could be adversely impacted, which in turn could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nA portion of our revenue is generated by sales to government entities, which are subject to a number of challenges and risks.\nSales to government entities are subject to a number of risks. Selling to government entities can be highly competitive, expensive, and time-consuming, often requiring significant upfront time and expense without any assurance that these efforts will generate a sale. The substantial majority of our sales to date to government entities have been made indirectly through our channel partners. Government certification requirements for products and subscriptions like ours may change, thereby restricting our ability to sell into the federal government sector until we have attained the revised certification. If our products and subscriptions are late in achieving or fail to achieve compliance with these certifications and standards, or our competitors achieve compliance with these certifications and standards, we may be disqualified from selling our products, subscriptions and support offerings to such governmental entity, or be at a competitive disadvantage, which would harm our business, operating results, and financial condition. Government demand and payment for our products, subscriptions and support offerings may be impacted by government shutdowns, public sector budgetary cycles, contracting requirements, and funding authorizations, with funding reductions or delays adversely affecting public sector demand for our products, subscriptions and support offerings. Government entities may have statutory, contractual, or other legal rights to terminate contracts with our distributors and resellers for convenience or due to a default, and any such termination may adversely impact our future operating results. Governments routinely investigate and audit government contractors\u2019 administrative processes, and any unfavorable audit could result in the government refusing to continue buying our products, subscriptions and support offerings, a reduction of revenue, or fines or civil or criminal liability if the audit uncovers improper or illegal activities, which could adversely impact our operating results in a material way. Additionally, the U.S. government may require certain of the products that it purchases to be manufactured in the United States and other relatively high cost manufacturing locations, and we may not manufacture all products in locations that meet such requirements, affecting our ability to sell these products, subscriptions and support offerings to the U.S. government.\nOur ability to sell our products and subscriptions is dependent on the quality of our technical support services and those of our channel partners, and the failure to offer high-quality technical support services could have a material adverse effect on our end-customers\u2019 satisfaction with our products and subscriptions, our sales, and our operating results.\nAfter our products and subscriptions are deployed within our end-customers\u2019 networks, our end-customers depend on our technical support services, as well as the support of our channel partners, to resolve any issues relating to our products. Our channel partners often provide similar technical support for third parties\u2019 products and may therefore have fewer resources to dedicate to the support of our products and subscriptions. If we or our channel partners do not effectively assist our end-customers in deploying our products and subscriptions, succeed in helping our end-customers quickly resolve post-deployment issues, or provide effective ongoing support, our ability to sell additional products and subscriptions to existing end-customers would be adversely affected and our reputation with potential end-customers could be damaged. While we have been able to meet increased demand for support services in fiscal 2021, failure to do so in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nMany larger enterprise, service provider, and government entity end-customers have more complex networks and require higher levels of support than smaller end-customers. If we or our channel partners fail to meet the requirements of these larger end-customers,\n- 28 -\nit may be more difficult to execute on our strategy to increase our coverage with larger end-customers. Additionally, if our channel partners do not effectively provide support to the satisfaction of our end-customers, we may be required to provide direct support to such end-customers, which would require us to hire additional personnel and to invest in additional resources. It can take several months to recruit, hire, and train qualified technical support employees. We may not be able to hire such resources fast enough to keep up with unexpected demand, particularly if the sales of our products exceed our internal forecasts. As a result, our ability, and the ability of our channel partners to provide adequate and timely support to our end-customers will be negatively impacted, and our end-customers\u2019 satisfaction with our products and subscriptions will be adversely affected. Additionally, to the extent that we may need to rely on our sales engineers to provide post-sales support while we are ramping our support resources, our sales productivity will be negatively impacted, which would harm our revenues. Our failure or our channel partners\u2019 failure to provide and maintain high-quality support services could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property and Technology Licensing\nClaims by others that we infringe their proprietary technology or other rights could harm our business.\nCompanies in the enterprise security industry own large numbers of patents, copyrights, trademarks, domain names, and trade secrets and frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of infringement, misappropriation, or other violations of intellectual property or other rights. Third parties are currently asserting, have asserted and may in the future assert claims of infringement of intellectual property rights against us. For example, in December 2011, Juniper, one of our competitors, filed a lawsuit against us alleging patent infringement. In September 2013, we filed a lawsuit against Juniper alleging patent infringement. In May 2014, we entered into a Settlement, Release and Cross-License Agreement with Juniper to resolve all pending disputes between Juniper and us, including dismissal of all pending litigation.\nThird parties may also assert such claims against our end-customers or channel partners, whom our standard license and other agreements obligate us to indemnify against claims that our products and subscriptions infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties. In addition, to the extent we hire personnel from competitors, we may be subject to allegations that they have been improperly solicited, that they have divulged proprietary or other confidential information, or that their former employers own their inventions or other work product. Furthermore, we may be unaware of the intellectual property rights of others that may cover some or all of our technology or products and subscriptions. As the number of products and competitors in our market increases and overlaps occur, infringement claims may increase. While we intend to increase the size of our patent portfolio, our competitors and others may now and in the future have significantly larger and more mature patent portfolios than we have. In addition, litigation has involved and will likely continue to involve patent holding companies or other adverse patent owners who have no relevant product revenue and against whom our own patents may therefore provide little or no deterrence or protection. In addition, we have not registered our trademarks in all of our geographic markets and failure to secure those registrations could adversely affect our ability to enforce and defend our trademark rights. Any claim of infringement by a third party, even those without merit, could cause us to incur substantial costs defending against the claim, could distract our management from our business, and could require us to cease use of such intellectual property. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. A successful claimant could secure a judgment, or we may agree to a settlement that prevents us from distributing certain products or performing certain services or that requires us to pay substantial damages, royalties, or other fees. Any of these events could seriously harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nOur proprietary rights may be difficult to enforce or protect, which could enable others to copy or use aspects of our products or subscriptions without compensating us.\nWe rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of confidentiality and license agreements with our employees, consultants, and third parties with whom we have relationships, as well as trademark, copyright, patent, and trade secret protection laws, to protect our proprietary rights. We have filed various applications for certain aspects of our intellectual property. Valid patents may not issue from our pending applications, and the claims eventually allowed on any patents may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology or products and subscriptions. We cannot be certain that we were the first to make the inventions claimed in our pending patent applications or that we were the first to file for patent protection, which could prevent our patent applications from issuing as patents or invalidate our patents following issuance. Additionally, the process of obtaining patent protection is expensive and time-consuming, and we may not be able to prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. Any issued patents may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, and any rights granted under these patents may not actually provide adequate defensive protection or competitive advantages to us. Additional uncertainty may result from changes to patent-related laws and court rulings in the United States and other jurisdictions. As a result, we may not be able to obtain adequate patent protection or effectively enforce any issued patents.\nDespite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or subscriptions or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. We generally enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees, consultants, vendors, and end-customers, and generally limit access to and distribution of our proprietary information. However, we cannot be certain that we have entered into such agreements with all parties who may have or have had\n- 29 -\naccess to our confidential information or that the agreements we have entered into will not be breached. We cannot guarantee that any of the measures we have taken will prevent misappropriation of our technology. Because we may be an attractive target for computer hackers, we may have a greater risk of unauthorized access to, and misappropriation of, our proprietary information. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as the laws of the United States, and many foreign countries do not enforce these laws as diligently as government agencies and private parties in the United States. From time to time, we may need to take legal action to enforce our patents and other intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity. Such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could negatively affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. Attempts to enforce our rights against third parties could also provoke these third parties to assert their own intellectual property or other rights against us or result in a holding that invalidates or narrows the scope of our rights, in whole or in part. If we are unable to protect our proprietary rights (including aspects of our software and products protected other than by patent rights), we may find ourselves at a competitive disadvantage to others who need not incur the additional expense, time, and effort required to create the innovative products that have enabled us to be successful to date. Any of these events would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nOur use of open source software in our products and subscriptions could negatively affect our ability to sell our products and subscriptions and subject us to possible litigation.\nOur products and subscriptions contain software modules licensed to us by third-party authors under \u201copen source\u201d licenses. Some open source licenses contain requirements that we make available applicable source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon the type of open source software we use. If we combine our proprietary software with open source software in a certain manner, we could, under certain open source licenses, be required to release the source code of our proprietary software to the public. This would allow our competitors to create similar products or subscriptions with lower development effort and time and ultimately could result in a loss of product sales for us.\nAlthough we monitor our use of open source software to avoid subjecting our products and subscriptions to conditions we do not intend, the terms of many open source licenses have not been interpreted by United States courts, and there is a risk that these licenses could be construed in a way that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products and subscriptions. From time to time, there have been claims against companies that distribute or use open source software in their products and subscriptions, asserting that open source software infringes the claimants\u2019 intellectual property rights. We could be subject to suits by parties claiming infringement of intellectual property rights in what we believe to be licensed open source software. If we are held to have breached the terms of an open source software license, we could be required to seek licenses from third parties to continue offering our products and subscriptions on terms that are not economically feasible, to reengineer our products and subscriptions, to discontinue the sale of our products and subscriptions if reengineering could not be accomplished on a timely basis, or to make generally available, in source code form, our proprietary code, any of which could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nIn addition to risks related to license requirements, usage of open source software can lead to greater risks than use of third-party commercial software, as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or assurance of title or controls on origin of the software. In addition, many of the risks associated with usage of open source software, such as the lack of warranties or assurances of title, cannot be eliminated, and could, if not properly addressed, negatively affect our business. We have established processes to help alleviate these risks, including a review process for screening requests from our development organizations for the use of open source software, but we cannot be sure that our processes for controlling our use of open source software in our products and subscriptions will be effective.\nWe license technology from third parties, and our inability to maintain those licenses could harm our business.\nWe incorporate technology that we license from third parties, including software, into our products and subscriptions. We cannot be certain that our licensors are not infringing the intellectual property rights of third parties or that our licensors have sufficient rights to the licensed intellectual property in all jurisdictions in which we may sell our products and subscriptions. In addition, some licenses may be non-exclusive, and therefore our competitors may have access to the same technology licensed to us. Some of our agreements with our licensors may be terminated for convenience by them. We may also be subject to additional fees or be required to obtain new licenses if any of our licensors allege that we have not properly paid for such licenses or that we have improperly used the technologies under such licenses, and such licenses may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to continue to license any of this technology because of intellectual property infringement claims brought by third parties against our licensors or against us, or claims against us by our licensors, or if we are unable to continue our license agreements or enter into new licenses on commercially reasonable terms, our ability to develop and sell products and subscriptions containing such technology would be severely limited, and our business could be harmed. Additionally, if we are unable to license necessary technology from third parties, we may be forced to acquire or develop alternative technology, which we may be unable to do in a commercially feasible manner or at all, and we may be required to use alternative technology of lower quality or performance standards. This would limit and delay our ability to offer new or competitive products and subscriptions and increase our costs of production. As a result, our margins, market share, and operating results could be significantly harmed.\n- 30 -\nRisks Related to Privacy and Data Protection\nOur failure to adequately protect personal information could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nA wide variety of provincial, state, national, and international laws and regulations apply to the collection, use, retention, protection, disclosure, transfer, and other processing of personal data. These data protection and privacy-related laws and regulations are evolving and being tested in courts and may result in ever-increasing regulatory and public scrutiny, as well as escalating levels of enforcement and sanctions. Further, the interpretation and application of foreign laws and regulations in many cases is uncertain, and our legal and regulatory obligations in foreign jurisdictions are subject to frequent and unexpected changes, including the potential for various regulatory or other governmental bodies to enact new or additional laws or regulations, to issue rulings that invalidate prior laws or regulations, or to increase penalties significantly.\nFor example, the E.U. General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cE.U. GDPR\u201d), which became effective in May 2018, imposes more stringent data protection requirements, provides for greater penalties for noncompliance than E.U. laws that previously applied (up to the greater of \u20ac20 million or 4% of the total worldwide annual turnover), and confers a private right of action on data subjects and consumer associations to lodge complaints with supervisory authorities, seek judicial remedies and obtain compensation for damages resulting from violations of the E.U. GDPR. The E.U. GDPR requires, among other things, that personal data only be transferred outside of the E.U. to the United States and other jurisdictions that the European Commission has not yet recognized as having \u201cadequate\u201d data protection laws (a \u201cthird country\u201d), unless a data transfer mechanism under the E.U. GDPR has been put in place. Historically, we have relied on the E.U.-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield programs, and the use of model contractual clauses approved by the E.U. Commission, to legitimize these transfers (also referred to as standard contractual clauses or SCCs). In July 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union in its \u201cSchrems II\u201d decision invalidated the E.U.-U.S. Privacy Shield for purposes of transfers to the U.S. and imposed a requirement for companies to carry out an assessment of the laws and practices governing access to personal data in the third country to ensure an essentially equivalent level of data protection to that afforded in the E.U. We are dealing with the recent \u201cSchrems II\u201d decision by the Court of Justice of the European Union and its impact on our data transfer mechanisms. The effects of this decision are highly uncertain and difficult to predict. Among other effects, we may experience additional costs associated with increased compliance burdens, putting in place any additional data transfer mechanisms to ensure compliance with the E.U. GDPR and the \u201cSchrems II\u201d decision and new contract negotiations with third parties that aid in processing data on our behalf. We may experience reluctance or refusal by current or prospective European customers to use our products, and we may find it necessary or desirable to make further changes to our handling of personal data of residents of the European Economic Area (\u201cEEA\u201d). The regulatory environment applicable to the handling of EEA residents\u2019 personal data, and our actions taken in response, may cause us to assume additional liabilities or incur additional costs and could result in our business, operating results and financial condition being harmed. Additionally, we and our customers may face a risk of enforcement actions by data protection authorities in the EEA relating to personal data transfers to us and by us from the EEA. Any such enforcement actions could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources, distract management and technical personnel and negatively affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nFollowing the withdrawal of the U.K. from the E.U. (i.e., Brexit), and the expiry of the Brexit transition period, which ended on December 31, 2020, the E.U. GDPR has been implemented in the U.K. (as the \u201cU.K. GDPR\u201d). The U.K. GDPR sits alongside the U.K. Data Protection Act 2018, which implements certain derogations in the E.U. GDPR into English law. The requirements of the U.K. GDPR, which are (at this time) largely aligned with those under the E.U. GDPR, may lead to similar compliance and operational costs with potential fines of up to \u00a317.5 million or 4% of total worldwide annual turnover.\nIn the United States, companies that do business in California are subject to the California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d), which requires, among other things, covered companies to provide new disclosures to California consumers, afford such consumers certain rights regarding their personal information, and also affords a private right of action to individuals affected by a data breach, if the breach was caused by a lack of reasonable security. The enforcement of the CCPA by the California Attorney General commenced on July 1, 2020. The CCPA has been amended on multiple occasions and the California Attorney General has issued initial and revised regulations that also govern the CCPA, which could be subject to additional modifications. It remains unclear what, if any, additional modifications will be made to this legislation or how it will be interpreted and enforced. The effects of the CCPA potentially are significant, however, and may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and to incur substantial costs and expenses for compliance. Moreover, additional state-based privacy laws have been passed and will require potentially substantial efforts to obtain compliance. This includes the California Privacy Rights Act (\u201cCPRA\u201d) which was approved by California voters, and significantly modifies the CCPA.\nWe may also from time to time be subject to, or face assertions that we are subject to, additional obligations relating to personal data by contract or due to assertions that self-regulatory obligations or industry standards apply to our practices. Additionally, the Federal Trade Commission and many state attorneys general are interpreting federal and state consumer protection laws to impose standards for the online collection, use, dissemination, and security of data. Further, we may be or become subject to data localization laws mandating that data collected in a foreign country be processed and stored within that country. Each of these privacy, security, and data protection laws and regulations, and any other such changes or new laws or regulations, could impose significant limitations,\n- 31 -\nor require changes to our business model or practices or growth strategy, which may increase our compliance expenses and make our business more costly or less efficient to conduct.\nOur actual or perceived failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations or other obligations to which we are now or which we may be subject relating to personal data, or to protect personal data from unauthorized acquisition, use or other processing, could result in consequences such as enforcement actions and regulatory investigations against us, fines, public censure, claims for damages by end-customers and other affected individuals, damage to our reputation and loss of goodwill (both in relation to existing end-customers and prospective end-customers), any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial performance, and business. Evolving and changing definitions of personal data and personal information, within the E.U., the United States, and elsewhere, especially relating to classification of Internet Protocol (\u201cIP\u201d) addresses, machine identification, location data, and other information, may limit or inhibit our ability to operate or expand our business, including limiting strategic partnerships that may involve the sharing or uses of data, and may require significant expenditures and efforts in order to comply. Even the perception of privacy, data protection or information security concerns, whether or not valid, may harm our reputation and inhibit adoption of our products and subscriptions by current and future end-customers.\nRisks Related to Operations Outside the United States\nWe face risks associated with having operations and employees located in Israel.\nAs a result of various of our acquisitions, including Secdo, PureSec and Twistlock, we have offices and employees located in Israel. Accordingly, political, economic, and military conditions in Israel directly affect our operations. The future of peace efforts between Israel and its Arab neighbors remains uncertain. There has been a significant increase in hostilities and political unrest between Hamas and Israel recently. The effects of these hostilities and violence on the Israeli economy and our operations in Israel are unclear, and we cannot predict the effect on us of further increases in these hostilities or future armed conflict, political instability or violence in the region. Current or future tensions and conflicts in the Middle East could adversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows.\nIn addition, many of our employees in Israel are obligated to perform annual reserve duty in the Israeli military and are subject to being called for active duty under emergency circumstances. We cannot predict the full impact of these conditions on us in the future, particularly if emergency circumstances or an escalation in the political situation occurs. If many of our employees in Israel are called for active duty for a significant period of time, our operations and our business could be disrupted and may not be able to function at full capacity. Any disruption in our operations in Israel could adversely affect our business.\nWe are subject to governmental export and import controls that could subject us to liability or impair our ability to compete in international markets.\nBecause we incorporate encryption technology into our products, certain of our products are subject to U.S. export controls and may be exported outside the United States only with the required export license or through an export license exception. If we were to fail to comply with U.S. export licensing requirements, U.S. customs regulations, U.S. economic sanctions, or other laws, we could be subject to substantial civil and criminal penalties, including fines, incarceration for responsible employees and managers, and the possible loss of export or import privileges. Obtaining the necessary export license for a particular sale may be time-consuming and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities. Furthermore, U.S. export control laws and economic sanctions prohibit the shipment of certain products to U.S. embargoed or sanctioned countries, governments, and persons. Even though we take precautions to ensure that our channel partners comply with all relevant regulations, any failure by our channel partners to comply with such regulations could have negative consequences for us, including reputational harm, government investigations, and penalties.\nIn addition, various countries regulate the import of certain encryption technology, including through import permit and license requirements, and have enacted laws that could limit our ability to distribute our products or could limit our end-customers\u2019 ability to implement our products in those countries. Changes in our products or changes in export and import regulations may create delays in the introduction of our products into international markets, prevent our end-customers with international operations from deploying our products globally or, in some cases, prevent or delay the export or import of our products to certain countries, governments, or persons altogether. Any change in export or import regulations, economic sanctions or related legislation, shift in the enforcement or scope of existing regulations, or change in the countries, governments, persons, or technologies targeted by such regulations, could result in decreased use of our products by, or in our decreased ability to export or sell our products to, existing or potential end-customers with international operations. Any decreased use of our products or limitation on our ability to export to or sell our products in international markets would likely adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nTax, Accounting, Compliance and Regulatory Risks\nWe have a corporate structure aligned with the international nature of our business activities, and if we do not achieve increased tax benefits as a result of our corporate structure, our financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected.\nWe have reorganized our corporate structure and intercompany relationships to more closely align with the international nature of our business activities. This corporate structure may allow us to reduce our overall effective tax rate through changes in how we use\n- 32 -\nour intellectual property, international procurement, and sales operations. This corporate structure may also allow us to obtain financial and operational efficiencies. These efforts require us to incur expenses in the near term for which we may not realize related benefits. If the structure is not accepted by the applicable tax authorities, if there are any changes in, or interpretations of, domestic and international tax laws that negatively impact the structure, or if we do not operate our business consistent with the structure and applicable tax provisions, we may fail to achieve the reduction in our overall effective tax rate and the other financial and operational efficiencies that we anticipate as a result of the structure and our future financial condition and operating results may be negatively impacted. In addition, we continue to evaluate our corporate structure in light of current and pending tax legislation, and any changes to our corporate structure may require us to incur additional expenses and may impact our overall effective tax rate.\nWe may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities.\nOur income tax obligations are based in part on our corporate structure and intercompany arrangements, including the manner in which we develop, value, and use our intellectual property and the valuations of our intercompany transactions. The tax laws applicable to our business, including the laws of the United States and other jurisdictions, are subject to interpretation and certain jurisdictions may aggressively interpret their laws in an effort to raise additional tax revenue. The tax authorities of the jurisdictions in which we operate may challenge our methodologies for valuing developed technology or intercompany arrangements, which could increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our financial position and operating results. It is possible that tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken, and any adverse outcome of such a review or audit could have a negative effect on our financial position and operating results. Further, the determination of our worldwide provision for or benefit from income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment by management, and there are transactions where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Although we believe that our estimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made.\nIn addition, our future income tax obligations could be adversely affected by changes in, or interpretations of, tax laws in the United States or in other jurisdictions in which we operate.\nIf our estimates or judgments relating to our critical accounting policies are based on assumptions that change or prove to be incorrect, our operating results could fall below our publicly announced guidance or the expectations of securities analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in the market price of our common stock.\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets, liabilities, equity, revenue, and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. For more information, refer to the section entitled \u201cCritical Accounting Estimates\u201d in \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In general, if our estimates, judgments or assumptions relating to our critical accounting policies change or if actual circumstances differ from our estimates, judgments or assumptions, including uncertainty in the current economic environment due to COVID-19, our operating results may be adversely affected and could fall below our publicly announced guidance or the expectations of securities analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in the market price of our common stock.\nFailure to comply with governmental laws and regulations could harm our business.\nOur business is subject to regulation by various federal, state, local, and foreign governmental agencies, including agencies responsible for monitoring and enforcing employment and labor laws, workplace safety, product safety, environmental laws, consumer protection laws, privacy and data-protection laws, anti-bribery laws (including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Anti-Bribery Act), import/export controls, federal securities laws, and tax laws and regulations. In certain jurisdictions, these regulatory requirements may be more stringent than those in the United States. Noncompliance with applicable regulations or requirements could subject us to investigations, sanctions, mandatory product recalls, enforcement actions, disgorgement of profits, fines, damages, civil and criminal penalties, or injunctions. If any governmental sanctions are imposed, or if we do not prevail in any possible civil or criminal litigation resulting from any alleged noncompliance, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. In addition, responding to any action will likely result in a significant diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources and an increase in professional fees. Enforcement actions, litigation, and sanctions could harm our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nIf we fail to comply with environmental requirements, our business, financial condition, operating results, and reputation could be adversely affected.\nWe are subject to various environmental laws and regulations including laws governing the hazardous material content of our products and laws relating to the collection of and recycling of electrical and electronic equipment. Examples of these laws and regulations include the E.U. Restriction on the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive (\u201cRoHS\u201d) and the E.U. Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive (\u201cWEEE Directive\u201d), as well as the implementing\n- 33 -\nlegislation of the E.U. member states. Similar laws and regulations have been passed or are pending in China, South Korea, Norway, and Japan and may be enacted in other regions, including in the United States, and we are, or may in the future be, subject to these laws and regulations.\nThe E.U. RoHS and the similar laws of other jurisdictions limit the content of certain hazardous materials such as lead, mercury, and cadmium in the manufacture of electrical equipment, including our products. Our current products comply with the E.U. RoHS requirements. However, if there are changes to this or other laws (or their interpretation) or if new similar laws are passed in other jurisdictions, we may be required to reengineer our products to use components compatible with these regulations. This reengineering and component substitution could result in additional costs to us or disrupt our operations or logistics.\nThe WEEE Directive requires electronic goods producers to be responsible for the collection, recycling, and treatment of such products. Changes in interpretation of the directive may cause us to incur costs or have additional regulatory requirements to meet in the future in order to comply with this directive, or with any similar laws adopted in other jurisdictions.\nWe are also subject to environmental laws and regulations governing the management of hazardous materials, which we use in small quantities in our engineering labs. Our failure to comply with past, present, and future similar laws could result in reduced sales of our products, substantial product inventory write-offs, reputational damage, penalties, and other sanctions, any of which could harm our business and financial condition. We also expect that our products will be affected by new environmental laws and regulations on an ongoing basis. To date, our expenditures for environmental compliance have not had a material impact on our operating results or cash flows, and although we cannot predict the future impact of such laws or regulations, they will likely result in additional costs and may increase penalties associated with violations or require us to change the content of our products or how they are manufactured, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Our Notes\nWe may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to settle conversions of our Notes, repurchase our Notes upon a fundamental change, or repay our Notes in cash at their maturity, and our future debt may contain limitations on our ability to pay cash upon conversion or repurchase of our Notes.\nIn July 2018 we issued our 2023 Notes (the \u201c2023 Notes\u201d) and in June 2020 we issued our 2025 Notes (the \u201c2025 Notes,\u201d together with the \u201c2023 Notes,\u201d the \u201cNotes\u201d). We will need to make cash payments (1) if holders of our Notes require us to repurchase all or a portion of their Notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change (e.g., a change of control of Palo Alto Networks, Inc.) before the maturity date, (2) upon conversion of our Notes, (3) to repay our Notes in cash at their maturity, unless earlier converted or repurchased. However, we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to make payments.\nIn addition, our ability to repurchase or to pay cash upon conversion of our Notes may be limited by law, regulatory authority or agreements governing our future indebtedness. Our failure to repurchase our Notes at a time when the repurchase is required by the applicable indenture governing such Notes or to pay cash upon conversion of such Notes as required by the applicable indenture would constitute a default under the indenture. A default under the applicable indenture or the fundamental change itself could also lead to a default under agreements governing our future indebtedness. If the payment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and repurchase our Notes or to pay cash upon conversion of our Notes.\nWe may still incur substantially more debt or take other actions that would diminish our ability to make payments on our Notes when due.\nWe and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional debt in the future, subject to the restrictions contained in our debt instruments, some of which may be secured debt. We are not restricted under the terms of the indenture governing our Notes from incurring additional debt, securing existing or future debt, recapitalizing our debt or taking a number of other actions that are not limited by the terms of such indenture governing our Notes that could have the effect of diminishing our ability to make payments on our Notes when due. While the terms of any future indebtedness we may incur could restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness, any such restrictions will indirectly benefit holders of our Notes only to the extent any such indebtedness or credit facility is not repaid or does not mature while our Notes are outstanding.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nOur actual operating results may differ significantly from our guidance.\nFrom time to time, we have released, and may continue to release, guidance in our quarterly earnings releases, quarterly earnings conference calls, or otherwise, regarding our future performance that represents our management\u2019s estimates as of the date of release. This guidance, which includes forward-looking statements, has been and will be based on projections prepared by our management. These projections are not prepared with a view toward compliance with published guidelines of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and neither our registered public accountants nor any other independent expert or outside party\n- 34 -\ncompiles or examines the projections. Accordingly, no such person expresses any opinion or any other form of assurance with respect to the projections.\nProjections are based upon a number of assumptions and estimates that, while presented with numerical specificity, are inherently subject to significant business, economic, and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control, such as COVID-19, and are based upon specific assumptions with respect to future business decisions, some of which will change. The rapidly evolving market in which we operate may make it difficult to evaluate our current business and our future prospects, including our ability to plan for and model future growth. We intend to state possible outcomes as high and low ranges which are intended to provide a sensitivity analysis as variables are changed. However, actual results will vary from our guidance and the variations may be material. The principal reason that we release guidance is to provide a basis for our management to discuss our business outlook as of the date of release with analysts and investors. We do not accept any responsibility for any projections or reports published by any such persons. Investors are urged not to rely upon our guidance in making an investment decision regarding our common stock.\nAny failure to successfully implement our operating strategy or the occurrence of any of the events or circumstances set forth in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section in this Annual Report on Form 10-K could result in our actual operating results being different from our guidance, and the differences may be adverse and material.\nThe market price of our common stock historically has been volatile and the value of your investment could decline.\nThe market price of our common stock has been volatile since our initial public offering (\u201cIPO\u201d) in July 2012. The reported high and low sales prices of our common stock during the last 12 months have ranged from $406.92 to $219.34 per share, as measured through August 23, 2021. The market price of our common stock may fluctuate widely in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. These factors include:\n\u2022announcements of new products, subscriptions or technologies, commercial relationships, strategic partnerships, acquisitions, or other events by us or our competitors;\n\u2022price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to time;\n\u2022news announcements that affect investor perception of our industry, including reports related to the discovery of significant cyberattacks;\n\u2022significant volatility in the market price and trading volume of technology companies in general and of companies in our industry;\n\u2022fluctuations in the trading volume of our shares or the size of our public float;\n\u2022actual or anticipated changes in our operating results or fluctuations in our operating results;\n\u2022whether our operating results meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors;\n\u2022actual or anticipated changes in the expectations of securities analysts or investors, whether as a result of our forward- looking statements, our failure to meet such expectations or otherwise;\n\u2022inaccurate or unfavorable research reports about our business and industry published by securities analysts or reduced coverage of our company by securities analysts;\n\u2022litigation involving us, our industry, or both;\n\u2022actions instituted by activist shareholders or others;\n\u2022regulatory developments in the United States, foreign countries or both;\n\u2022major catastrophic events, such as COVID-19;\n\u2022sales or repurchases of large blocks of our common stock or substantial future sales by our directors, executive officers, employees and significant stockholders;\n\u2022sales of our common stock by investors who view our Notes as a more attractive means of equity participation in us;\n\u2022hedging or arbitrage trading activity involving our common stock as a result of the existence of our Notes;\n\u2022departures of key personnel; or\n\u2022economic uncertainty around the world.\nThe market price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business, operating results, or financial condition and as a result of events that do not directly affect us. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company. Securities litigation could result in\n- 35 -\nsubstantial costs and divert our management\u2019s attention and resources from our business. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nThe convertible note hedge and warrant transactions may affect the value of our common stock.\nIn connection with the sale of our 2023 Notes and 2025 Notes, we entered into convertible note hedge transactions (the \u201cNote Hedges\u201d) with certain counterparties. In connection with each such sale of the Notes, we also entered into warrant transactions with the counterparties pursuant to which we sold warrants (the \u201cWarrants\u201d) for the purchase of our common stock. The Note Hedges for our 2023 Notes and 2025 Notes are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution to our common stock upon any conversion of our Notes and/or offset any cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of any such converted Notes. The Warrants could separately have a dilutive effect to the extent that the market price per share of our common stock exceeds the applicable strike price of the Warrants unless, subject to certain conditions, we elect to cash settle such Warrants.\nThe applicable counterparties or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to our common stock and/or purchasing or selling our common stock or other securities of ours in secondary market transactions prior to the maturity of the outstanding Notes (and are likely to do so during any applicable observation period related to a conversion of our Notes). This activity could also cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in the market price of our common stock or our Notes, which could affect a note holder\u2019s ability to convert its Notes and, to the extent the activity occurs during any observation period related to a conversion of our Notes, it could affect the amount and value of the consideration that the note holder will receive upon conversion of our Notes.\nWe do not make any representation or prediction as to the direction or magnitude of any potential effect that the transactions described above may have on the price of our Notes or our common stock. In addition, we do not make any representation that the counterparties or their respective affiliates will engage in these transactions or that these transactions, once commenced, will not be discontinued without notice.\nThe issuance of additional stock in connection with financings, acquisitions, investments, our stock incentive plans, the conversion of our Notes or exercise of the related Warrants, or otherwise will dilute all other stockholders.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue up to 1.0 billion shares of common stock and up to 100.0 million shares of preferred stock with such rights and preferences as may be determined by our board of directors. Subject to compliance with applicable rules and regulations, we may issue shares of common stock or securities convertible into shares of our common stock from time to time in connection with a financing, acquisition, investment, our stock incentive plans, the conversion of our Notes, the settlement of our Warrants related to each such series of the Notes, or otherwise. Any such issuance could result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders and cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nWe cannot guarantee that our share repurchase program will be fully consummated, or that it will enhance shareholder value, and share repurchases could affect the price of our common stock.\nAs of July 31, 2021, we had $323.9 million available under our share repurchase program. On August 17, 2021, our board of directors authorized another $676.1 million increase to this share repurchase program, bringing the total authorization to $2.4 billion, with $1.0 billion remaining, and extended the expiration date to December 31, 2022. Such share repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued by the Company at any time without prior notice. Although our board of directors has authorized a share repurchase program, we are not obligated to repurchase any specific dollar amount or to acquire any specific number of shares under the program. The share repurchase program could affect the price of our common stock, increase volatility and diminish our cash reserves. In addition, the program may be suspended or terminated at any time, which may result in a decrease in the price of our common stock.\nWe are subject to risks associated with our strategic investments. Impairments in the value of our investments could negatively impact our financial results.\nIn July 2017, we formed the $20.0 million Palo Alto Networks Venture Fund. The fund is aimed at seed-, early-, and growth-stage security companies with a cloud-based application approach. We may not realize a return on our capital investments. Many such private companies generate net losses and the market for their products, services or technologies may be slow to develop, and, therefore, are dependent on the availability of later rounds of financing from banks or investors on favorable terms to continue their operations. The financial success of our investment in any company is typically dependent on a liquidity event, such as a public offering, acquisition or other favorable market event reflecting appreciation in the cost of our initial investment. The capital markets for public offerings and acquisitions are dynamic and the likelihood of liquidity events for the companies we have invested in, and intend to invest in, could significantly change. Further, valuations of privately-held companies are inherently complex due to the lack of readily available market data and as such, the basis for these valuations is subject to the timing and accuracy of the data received from these companies. If we determine that any of our investments in such companies have experienced a decline in value, we may be required to record an impairment, which could be material and negatively impact our financial results. All of our investments are subject to a risk of a partial or total loss of investment capital.\n- 36 -\nWe do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared or paid any dividends on our common stock. We intend to retain any earnings to finance the operation and expansion of our business, and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the future. As a result, you may only receive a return on your investment in our common stock if the market price of our common stock increases.\nOur charter documents and Delaware law, as well as certain provisions contained in the indentures governing our Notes, could discourage takeover attempts and lead to management entrenchment, which could also reduce the market price of our common stock.\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our company or changes in our management. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws include provisions that:\n\u2022establish that our board of directors is divided into three classes, Class I, Class II and Class III, with three-year staggered terms;\n\u2022authorize our board of directors to issue shares of preferred stock and to determine the price and other terms of those shares, including preferences and voting rights, without stockholder approval;\n\u2022provide our board of directors with the exclusive right to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of our board of directors or the resignation, death or removal of a director;\n\u2022prohibit our stockholders from taking action by written consent;\n\u2022specify that special meetings of our stockholders may be called only by the chairman of our board of directors, our president, our secretary, or a majority vote of our board of directors;\n\u2022require the affirmative vote of holders of at least 66 2/3% of the voting power of all of the then outstanding shares of the voting stock, voting together as a single class, to amend the provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation relating to the issuance of preferred stock and management of our business or our amended and restated bylaws;\n\u2022authorize our board of directors to amend our bylaws by majority vote; and\n\u2022establish advance notice procedures with which our stockholders must comply to nominate candidates to our board of directors or to propose matters to be acted upon at a stockholders\u2019 meeting.\nThese provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for our stockholders to replace members of our board of directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of management. In addition, as a Delaware corporation, we are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. These provisions may prohibit large stockholders, in particular those owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock, from merging or combining with us for a certain period of time. Additionally, certain provisions contained in the indenture governing our Notes could make it more difficult or more expensive for a third party to acquire us. The application of Section 203 or certain provisions contained in the indenture governing our Notes also could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of us. Any of these provisions could, under certain circumstances, depress the market price of our common stock.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nOur business is subject to the risks of earthquakes, fire, power outages, floods, health risks and other catastrophic events, and to interruption by man-made problems such as terrorism.\nBoth our corporate headquarters and the location where our products are manufactured are located in the San Francisco Bay Area, a region known for seismic activity. In addition, other natural disasters, such as fire or floods, a significant power outage, telecommunications failure, terrorism, an armed conflict, cyberattacks, epidemics and pandemics such as COVID-19, or other geo-political unrest could affect our supply chain, manufacturers, logistics providers, channel partners, or end-customers or the economy as a whole and such disruption could impact our shipments and sales. These risks may be further increased if the disaster recovery plans for us and our suppliers prove to be inadequate. To the extent that any of the above should result in delays or cancellations of customer orders, the loss of customers, or the delay in the manufacture, deployment, or shipment of our products, our business, financial condition, and operating results would be adversely affected.\nOur failure to raise additional capital or generate the significant capital necessary to expand our operations and invest in new products and subscriptions could reduce our ability to compete and could harm our business.\nWe intend to continue to make investments to support our business growth and may require additional funds to respond to business challenges, including the need to develop new features to enhance our portfolio, improve our operating infrastructure, or acquire complementary businesses and technologies. Accordingly, we may need to engage in equity or debt financings to secure\n- 37 -\nadditional funds. If we raise additional equity or equity-linked financing, our stockholders may experience significant dilution of their ownership interests and the market price of our common stock could decline. Any conversion of the outstanding Notes into common stock will dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders to the extent we deliver shares upon conversion of such Notes. See the risk factor entitled \u201cThe issuance of additional stock in connection with financings, acquisitions, investments, our stock incentive plans, the conversion of our Notes or exercise of the related Warrants, or otherwise will dilute all other stockholders.\u201d The holders of our Notes have priority over holders of our common stock, and if we engage in future debt financings, the holders of such additional debt would also have priority over the holders of our common stock. Current and future indebtedness may also contain terms that, among other things, restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness. We may also be required to take other actions that would otherwise be in the interests of the debt holders and would require us to maintain specified liquidity or other ratios, any of which could harm our business, operating results, and financial condition. We may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us, if at all. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when we require it, our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges could be significantly impaired, and our business may be adversely affected.\nThe requirements of being a public company may strain our resources, divert management\u2019s attention, and affect our ability to attract and retain qualified board members.\nAs a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Act, the listing requirements of the New York Stock Exchange (\u201cNYSE\u201d), and other applicable securities rules and regulations. Compliance with these rules and regulations have increased our legal and financial compliance costs, made some activities more difficult, time-consuming or costly, and increased demand on our systems and resources. Among other things, the Exchange Act requires that we file annual, quarterly, and current reports with respect to our business and operating results. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. In order to meet the requirements of this standard, significant resources and management oversight may be required. As a result, management\u2019s attention may be diverted from other business concerns, which could harm our business and operating results. Although we have already hired additional employees to comply with these requirements, we may need to hire even more employees in the future, which will increase our costs and expenses.\nIn addition, changing laws, regulations, and standards related to corporate governance and public disclosure are creating uncertainty for public companies, increasing legal and financial compliance costs, and making some activities more time-consuming. These laws, regulations, and standards are subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. We intend to invest resources to comply with evolving laws, regulations, and standards, and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expense and a diversion of management\u2019s time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. If our efforts to comply with new laws, regulations, and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us and our business may be harmed.\nWe are obligated to maintain proper and effective internal control over financial reporting. We may not complete our analysis of our internal control over financial reporting in a timely manner, or this internal control may not be determined to be effective, which may adversely affect investor confidence in our company and, as a result, the value of our common stock.\nWhile we were able to determine in our management\u2019s report for fiscal 2021 that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, as well as provide an unqualified attestation report from our independent registered public accounting firm to that effect, we may not be able to complete our evaluation, testing, and any required remediation in a timely fashion, may be unable to assert that our internal controls are effective, or our independent registered public accounting firm may not be able to formally attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in the future. In the event that our chief executive officer, chief financial officer, or independent registered public accounting firm determines in the future that our internal control over financial reporting is not effective as defined under Section 404, we could be subject to one or more investigations or enforcement actions by state or federal regulatory agencies, stockholder lawsuits or other adverse actions requiring us to incur defense costs, pay fines, settlements or judgments and causing investor perceptions to be adversely affected and potentially resulting in a decline in the market price of our stock.",

Any future determination as to the declaration and payment of dividends, if any, will be at the discretion of our board of directors, subject to applicable laws and will depend on then existing conditions, including our financial condition, operating results, contractual restrictions, capital requirements, business prospects, and other factors our board of directors may deem relevant.\nSecurities Authorized for Issuance under Equity Compensation Plans\nSee Part III, Item 12 \u201cSecurity Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information regarding securities authorized for issuance.\nRecent Sales of Unregistered Equity Securities\nIn June 2021, we issued a total of 11,114 shares of our unregistered common stock pursuant to post-closing obligations in connection with our previous acquisition of Aporeto, Inc. (the \u201cAporeto Transaction\u201d).\nThe Aporeto Transaction did not involve any underwriters, any underwriting discounts or commissions, or any public offering.

We deliver cybersecurity products covering a broad range of use cases, enabling our end-customers to secure their networks, remote and hybrid workforces, branch locations, and public and private clouds, and to advance their Security Operations Centers (\u201cSOC\u201d). We believe our portfolio offers advanced prevention and security, while reducing the total cost of ownership for organizations by improving operational efficiency and eliminating the need for siloed point products. We do this with solutions focused on delivering value in five fundamental areas:\nZero Trust Network Security:\n\u2022Enabling zero trust network security through our ML-Powered Next-Generation Firewalls, available in a number of form factors, including physical, virtual, and containerized appliances, as well as a cloud-delivered service. This also includes our add-on Cloud-Delivered Security Services, such as Threat Prevention, WildFire, URL Filtering, Advanced URL Filtering, DNS Security, IoT Security, GlobalProtect, SD-WAN, Enterprise Data Loss Prevention (\u201cEnterprise DLP\u201d), SaaS Security API and SaaS Security Inline that secure content, applications, users, and devices across our ML-Powered Next-Generation Firewalls, Prisma, and Cortex product lines, to enable best-in-class security across a broad range of applications. Panorama, our network security management solution, available as hardware or virtual machine, can centrally manage all of our firewalls irrespective of their form factor, location, or scale.\nCloud Security:\n\u2022Enabling cloud security through our Prisma security offerings. Prisma Cloud, the industry\u2019s most comprehensive Cloud Native Security Platform (\u201cCNSP\u201d), secures multi- and hybrid-cloud environments and cloud native applications, integrating security across the full deployment lifecycle. VM-Series and CN-Series enforce in-line network security in multi- and hybrid-cloud environments.\n- 43 -\nSecure Access Service Edge:\n\u2022Prisma Access, the industry\u2019s most complete cloud-delivered security platform, together with Prisma SD-WAN, SaaS Security API and SaaS Security Inline, provide a comprehensive Secure Access Service Edge (\u201cSASE\u201d) offering that is used to secure remote workforces and enable the cloud-delivered branch.\nSecurity Analytics and Automation:\n\u2022Delivering the next generation of endpoint security, security analytics and security automation solutions through our Cortex portfolio. These include our industry-leading extended detection and response platform Cortex XDR to prevent, detect, and respond to complex cybersecurity attacks, Cortex XSOAR for security orchestration, automation, and response (\u201cSOAR\u201d), Cortex Xpanse for attack surface management (\u201cASM\u201d) and Cortex Data Lake allowing our customers to collect and analyze large amounts of context-rich data across endpoints, networks, and clouds. These products are delivered as software or SaaS subscriptions.\nThreat Intelligence and Security Consulting (Unit 42):\n\u2022Enabling security teams with up-to-date threat intelligence and deep cybersecurity expertise before, during and after attacks through our Unit 42 threat research and security consulting team. Unit 42 offers incident response, risk management, board advisory and proactive cybersecurity assessment services.\nFor fiscal 2021 and 2020, total revenue was $4.3 billion and $3.4 billion, respectively, representing year-over-year growth of 24.9%. Our growth reflects the increased adoption of our portfolio, which consists of product, subscriptions, and support. We believe our portfolio will enable us to benefit from recurring revenues as we continue to grow our installed end-customer base. As of July 31, 2021, we had end-customers in over 170 countries. Our end-customers represent a broad range of industries including education, energy, financial services, government entities, healthcare, Internet and media, manufacturing, public sector, and telecommunications, and include some of the largest Fortune 100 and Global 2000 companies in the world. We maintain a field sales force that works closely with our channel partners in developing sales opportunities. We primarily use a two-tiered, indirect fulfillment model whereby we sell our products, subscriptions, and support to our distributors, which, in turn, sell to our resellers, which then sell to our end-customers.\nOur product revenue was $1.1 billion or 26.3% of total revenue for fiscal 2021, representing year-over-year growth of 5.3%. Product revenue is generated from sales of our appliances, primarily our ML-Powered Next-Generation Firewall, which is available in a number of form factors, including as physical, virtual, and containerized appliances. Our ML-Powered Next-Generation Firewall incorporates our PAN-OS operating system, which provides a consistent set of capabilities across our entire network security product line. Our products are designed for different performance requirements throughout an organization, ranging from our PA-410, which is designed for small organizations and remote or branch offices, to our top-of-the-line PA-7080, which is designed for large-scale data centers and service provider use. The same firewall functionality that is delivered in our physical appliances is also available in our VM-Series virtual firewalls, which secure virtualized and cloud-based computing environments, and in our CN-Series container firewalls, which secure container environments and traffic.\nOur subscription and support revenue grew to $3.1 billion or 73.7% of total revenue for fiscal 2021, representing year-over-year growth of 33.8%. Our subscriptions provide our end-customers with near real-time access to the latest antivirus, intrusion prevention, web filtering, modern malware prevention, data loss prevention, and cloud access security broker capabilities across the network, endpoints, and the cloud. When end-customers purchase our physical, virtual, or container firewall appliances, or certain cloud offerings, they typically purchase support in order to receive ongoing security updates, upgrades, bug fixes, and repairs. In addition to the subscriptions purchased with these appliances, end-customers may also purchase other subscriptions on a per-user, per-endpoint, or capacity-based basis. We also offer professional services, including incident response, risk management, and digital forensic services.\nWe continue to invest in innovation and acquire businesses as we evolve and further extend the capabilities of our portfolio, as we believe that innovation and timely development of new features and products is essential to meeting the needs of our end-customers and improving our competitive position. During fiscal 2021, we introduced several new offerings, including: Cortex XDR 2.5, Next Generation SD-WAN, Prisma Cloud 2.0, Enterprise DLP, 5G Security, IoT Healthcare Security, Prisma Access 2.0 and Complete Zero Trust Network Security. Additionally, we acquired productive investments that we believe fit well within our long-term strategy. For example, in September 2020, we acquired Crypsis, which we expect will expand our incident response capabilities and strengthen our Cortex strategy; in November 2020, we acquired Sinefa, which we expect will extend our Prisma Access offering; in December 2020, we acquired Expanse, which we expect will enrich our Cortex offerings and provide organizations an integrated view of the enterprise to combine external, internal, and threat data; and in March 2021, we acquired Bridgecrew, which we expect will expand our Prisma Cloud offering to deliver security across the full application lifecycle.\nWe believe that the growth of our business and our short-term and long-term success are dependent upon many factors, including our ability to extend our technology leadership, grow our base of end-customers, expand deployment of our portfolio and support offerings within existing end-customers, and focus on end-customer satisfaction. To manage any future growth effectively, we must continue to improve and expand our information technology and financial infrastructure, our operating and administrative\n- 44 -\nsystems and controls, and our ability to manage headcount, capital, and processes in an efficient manner. While these areas present significant opportunities for us, they also pose challenges and risks that we must successfully address in order to sustain the growth of our business and improve our operating results. For additional information regarding the challenges and risks we face, see the \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nImpact of COVID-19 on Our Business\nWe are actively monitoring, evaluating, and responding to developments relating to COVID-19, which has resulted in and is expected to continue to result in continued significant global, social, and business disruption. As described in \u201cImpacts of COVID-19 on our Business\u201d included in Part I, Item 1 Business in this Annual Report, we have made some changes to our business including instituting a global work-from-home policy beginning in March 2020 and adopting our FLEXWORK initiative in fiscal 2021, which did not incur significant disruptions in our work operations during fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2021. We will continue to actively monitor the situation, including progress made through vaccinations, and we will make further changes to our business operations as may be required by federal, state, or local authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, end-customers, partners, suppliers, and stockholders. Our focus remains on the safety of our employees, and we strive to protect the health and well-being of the communities in which we operate, in part, by providing technology to our employees, end-customers, and partners to help them do their best work while remote.\nAlthough some end-customers adopted Prisma Access as their secure work-from-home solution for the longer term, there continues to be uncertainty regarding the business outlook due to COVID-19, which may curtail our end-customers\u2019 spending and could lead them to delay or defer purchasing decisions, and lengthen sales cycles and payment terms, which could materially adversely impact our business, results of operations, and overall financial performance. Also, certain of our end-customers or partners may be or may become credit or cash constrained, making it difficult for them to fulfill their payment obligations to us. The extent of the impact of COVID-19 on our operational and financial performance will depend on developments, including the duration and spread of the virus (including variants), impact on our end-customers\u2019 spending, volume of sales and length of our sales cycles, impact on our partners, suppliers, and employees, actions that may be taken by governmental authorities, and other factors identified in Part I, Item 1A \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in this Form 10-K. Given the dynamic nature of these circumstances, the full impact of COVID-19 on our ongoing business, results of operations, and overall financial performance cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.\nKey Financial Metrics\nWe monitor the key financial metrics set forth in the tables below to help us evaluate growth trends, establish budgets, measure the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts, and assess operational efficiencies. We discuss revenue, gross margin, and the components of operating loss and margin below under \u201cResults of Operations.\u201d\nJuly 31,\n2021 2020\n(in millions)\nTotal deferred revenue $ 5,024.0 $ 3,810.2\nCash, cash equivalents, and investments $ 3,789.4 $ 4,302.2\nYear Ended July 31,\n2021 2020 2019\n(dollars in millions)\nTotal revenue $ 4,256.1 $ 3,408.4 $ 2,899.6\nTotal revenue year-over-year percentage increase 24.9 % 17.5 % 27.5 %\nGross margin 70.0 % 70.7 % 72.1 %\nOperating loss $ (304.1) $ (179.0) $ (54.1)\nOperating margin (7.1) % (5.3) % (1.9) %\nBillings $ 5,452.2 $ 4,301.7 $ 3,489.8\nBillings year-over-year percentage increase 26.7 % 23.3 % 22.2 %\nCash flow provided by operating activities $ 1,503.0 $ 1,035.7 $ 1,055.6\nFree cash flow (non-GAAP) $ 1,387.0 $ 821.3 $ 924.4\n\u2022Deferred Revenue. Our deferred revenue primarily consists of amounts that have been invoiced but have not been recognized as revenue as of the period end. The majority of our deferred revenue balance consists of subscription and support revenue that is recognized ratably over the contractual service period. We monitor our deferred revenue balance because it represents a significant portion of revenue to be recognized in future periods.\n- 45 -\n\u2022Billings. We define billings as total revenue plus the change in total deferred revenue, net of acquired deferred revenue, during the period. We consider billings to be a key metric used by management to manage our business. We believe billings provides investors with an important indicator of the health and visibility of our business because it includes subscription and support revenue, which is recognized ratably over the contractual service period, and product revenue, which is recognized at the time of shipment, provided that all other conditions for revenue recognition have been met. We consider billings to be a useful metric for management and investors, particularly if we continue to experience increased sales of subscriptions and strong renewal rates for subscription and support offerings, and as we monitor our near-term cash flows. While we believe that billings provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management, it is important to note that other companies, including companies in our industry, may not use billings, may calculate billings differently, may have different billing frequencies, or may use other financial measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of billings as a comparative measure. We calculate billings in the following manner:\nYear Ended July 31,\n2021 2020 2019\n(in millions)\nBillings:\nTotal revenue $ 4,256.1 $ 3,408.4 $ 2,899.6\nAdd: change in total deferred revenue, net of acquired deferred revenue 1,196.1 893.3 590.2\nBillings $ 5,452.2 $ 4,301.7 $ 3,489.8\n\u2022 Cash Flow Provided by Operating Activities. We monitor cash flow provided by operating activities as a measure of our overall business performance. Our cash flow provided by operating activities is driven in large part by sales of our products and from up-front payments for subscription and support offerings. Monitoring cash flow provided by operating activities enables us to analyze our financial performance without the non-cash effects of certain items such as depreciation, amortization, and share-based compensation costs, thereby allowing us to better understand and manage the cash needs of our business.\n\u2022 Free Cash Flow (non-GAAP). We define free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, as cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property, equipment, and other assets. We consider free cash flow to be a profitability and liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business after necessary capital expenditures. A limitation of the utility of free cash flow as a measure of our financial performance and liquidity is that it does not represent the total increase or decrease in our cash balance for the period. In addition, it is important to note that other companies, including companies in our industry, may not use free cash flow, may calculate free cash flow in a different manner than we do, or may use other financial measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of free cash flow as a comparative measure. A reconciliation of free cash flow to cash flow provided by operating activities, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, is provided below:\nYear Ended July 31,\n2021 2020 2019\n(in millions)\nFree cash flow (non-GAAP):\nNet cash provided by operating activities $ 1,503.0 $ 1,035.7 $ 1,055.6\nLess: purchases of property, equipment, and other assets 116.0 214.4 131.2\nFree cash flow (non-GAAP) $ 1,387.0 $ 821.3 $ 924.4\nNet cash provided by (used in) investing activities $ (1,480.6) $ 288.0 $ (1,825.9)\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities $ (1,104.0) $ 673.0 $ (773.9)\n- 46 -\nResults of Operations\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for the periods presented and as a percentage of our total revenue for those periods based on our consolidated statements of operations data.

Revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of the corresponding promised products and subscriptions and support to our customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled in exchange for those products and subscriptions and support. We expect our revenue to vary from quarter to quarter based on seasonal and cyclical factors.\nProduct Revenue\nProduct revenue is derived primarily from sales of our appliances. Product revenue also includes revenue derived from software licenses of Panorama and the VM-Series. Our appliances and software licenses include a broad set of built-in networking and security features and functionalities. We recognize product revenue at the time of hardware shipment or delivery of software license.\nYear Ended July 31, Year Ended July 31,\n2021 2020 Change 2020 2019 Change\nAmount Amount Amount % Amount Amount Amount %\n(dollars in millions)\nProduct $ 1,120.3 $ 1,064.2 $ 56.1 5.3 % $ 1,064.2 $ 1,096.2 $ (32.0) (2.9) %\nProduct revenue increased for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020, largely driven by increases in software sales, reflecting increased demand for our products.\nSubscription and Support Revenue\nSubscription and support revenue is derived primarily from sales of our subscription and support offerings. Our contractual subscription and support contracts are typically one to five years. We recognize revenue from subscriptions and support over time as the services are performed. As a percentage of total revenue, we expect our subscription and support revenue to vary from quarter to quarter and increase over the long term as we introduce new subscriptions, renew existing subscription and support contracts, and expand our installed end-customer base.\nYear Ended July 31, Year Ended July 31,\n2021 2020 Change 2020 2019 Change\nAmount Amount Amount % Amount Amount Amount %\n(dollars in millions)\nSubscription $ 1,898.8 $ 1,405.3 $ 493.5 35.1 % $ 1,405.3 $ 1,032.7 $ 372.6 36.1 %\nSupport 1,237.0 938.9 298.1 31.7 % 938.9 770.7 168.2 21.8 %\nTotal subscription and support $ 3,135.8 $ 2,344.2 $ 791.6 33.8 % $ 2,344.2 $ 1,803.4 $ 540.8 30.0 %\nSubscription and support revenue increased year-over-year for fiscal 2021 due to increased demand for our subscription and support offerings from both new and existing end-customers. The mix between subscription revenue and support revenue will vary over time, depending on the introduction of new subscription offerings, renewals of support services, and our ability to increase sales to new and existing end-customers.\nRevenue by Geographic Theater\nYear Ended July 31, Year Ended July 31,\n2021 2020 Change 2020 2019 Change\nAmount Amount Amount % Amount Amount Amount %\n(dollars in millions)\nAmericas $ 2,937.5 $ 2,318.0 $ 619.5 26.7 % $ 2,318.0 $ 1,977.0 $ 341.0 17.2 %\nEMEA 817.3 671.9 145.4 21.6 % 671.9 568.6 103.3 18.2 %\nAPAC 501.3 418.5 82.8 19.8 % 418.5 354.0 64.5 18.2 %\nTotal revenue\n$ 4,256.1 $ 3,408.4 $ 847.7 24.9 % $ 3,408.4 $ 2,899.6 $ 508.8 17.5 %\nWith respect to geographic theaters, the Americas contributed the largest portion of the year-over-year increases in revenue for fiscal 2021 due to its larger and more established sales force compared to our other theaters. Revenue from both Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (\u201cEMEA\u201d) and Asia Pacific and Japan (\u201cAPAC\u201d) increased year-over-year for fiscal 2021 due to our increasing investment in global sales force in order to support our growth and innovation.\n- 48 -\nCost of Revenue\nOur cost of revenue consists of cost of product revenue and cost of subscription and support revenue.\nCost of Product Revenue\nCost of product revenue primarily includes costs paid to our manufacturing partners. Our cost of product revenue also includes personnel costs, which consist of salaries, benefits, bonuses, share-based compensation, and travel and entertainment associated with our operations organization, amortization of intellectual property licenses, product testing costs, shipping and tariff costs, and allocated costs. Allocated costs consist of certain facilities, depreciation, benefits, recruiting, and information technology costs that we allocate based on headcount. We expect our cost of product revenue to fluctuate with our product revenue.\nYear Ended July 31, Year Ended July 31,\n2021 2020 Change 2020 2019 Change\nAmount Amount Amount % Amount Amount Amount %\n(dollars in millions)\nCost of product revenue $ 308.5 $ 294.4 $ 14.1 4.8 % $ 294.4 $ 315.9 $ (21.5) (6.8) %\nNumber of employees at period end 127 117 10 8.5 % 117 102 15 14.7 %\nCost of product revenue increased for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 primarily due to an increase in the volume of product sold, partially offset by product mix. The remaining increase was largely due to increased overhead costs to support the growth of our product revenue.\nCost of Subscription and Support Revenue\nCost of subscription and support revenue includes personnel costs for our global customer support and technical operations organizations, customer support and repair costs, third-party professional services costs, data center and cloud hosting service costs, amortization of acquired intangible assets and capitalized software development costs, and allocated costs. We expect our cost of subscription and support revenue to increase as our installed end-customer base grows and adoption of our cloud-based subscription offerings increases.\nYear Ended July 31, Year Ended July 31,\n2021 2020 Change 2020 2019 Change\nAmount Amount Amount % Amount Amount Amount %\n(dollars in millions)\nCost of subscription and support revenue $ 966.4 $ 705.1 $ 261.3 37.1 % $ 705.1 $ 492.5 $ 212.6 43.2 %\nNumber of employees at period end 2,108 1,402 706 50.4 % 1,402 1,219 183 15.0 %\nCost of subscription and support revenue increased for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 primarily due to increased costs to support the growth of our subscription and support offerings. Personnel costs grew $97.1 million to $412.4 million for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 primarily due to headcount growth. Cloud hosting service costs, which support the adoption of our cloud-based subscription offerings increased $45.6 million for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020. The remaining increase was primarily due to increased outside service costs for global customer support resulting from the expansions of our customer base and product portfolio, as well as the amortization of intangible assets from our recent acquisitions.\nGross Margin\nGross margin, or gross profit as a percentage of revenue, has been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors, including the introduction of new products, manufacturing costs, tariff costs, the average sales price of our products, cloud hosting service costs, personnel costs, the mix of products sold, and the mix of revenue between product and subscription and support offerings. For sales of our products, our higher-end firewall products generally have higher gross margins than our lower-end firewall products within each product series. We expect our gross margins to vary over time depending on the factors described above.\nYear Ended July 31,\n2021 2020 2019\nAmount Gross\nMargin Amount Gross\nMargin Amount Gross\nMargin\n(dollars in millions)\nProduct $ 811.8 72.5 % $ 769.8 72.3 % $ 780.3 71.2 %\nSubscription and support 2,169.4 69.2 % 1,639.1 69.9 % 1,310.9 72.7 %\nTotal gross profit\n$ 2,981.2 70.0 % $ 2,408.9 70.7 % $ 2,091.2 72.1 %\n- 49 -\nProduct gross margin was relatively flat for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020.\nSubscription and support gross margin decreased for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020, primarily due to increased costs to fulfill professional services arrangements.\nOperating Expenses\nOur operating expenses consist of research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses. Personnel costs are the most significant component of operating expenses and consist of salaries, benefits, bonuses, share-based compensation, travel and entertainment, and with regard to sales and marketing expense, sales commissions. Our operating expenses also include allocated costs, which consist of certain facilities, depreciation, benefits, recruiting, and information technology costs that we allocate based on headcount. We expect operating expenses generally to increase in absolute dollars and decrease over the long term as a percentage of revenue as we continue to scale our business. In response to COVID-19, we instituted a global work-from-home policy, which has been modified to provide employees with the choice to work in certain of our offices when and as they feel comfortable, and limited employee travel beginning in March 2020. Further, we have canceled in-person events and either replaced them with virtual events or postponed them to future periods. As of July 31, 2021, we expect to recognize approximately $2.0 billion of share-based compensation expense over a weighted-average period of approximately 2.6 years, excluding additional share-based compensation expense related to any future grants of share-based awards. Share-based compensation expense is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expense consists primarily of personnel costs. Research and development expense also includes prototype related expenses and allocated costs. We expect research and development expense to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to invest in our future products and services, although our research and development expense may fluctuate as a percentage of total revenue.\nYear Ended July 31, Year Ended July 31,\n2021 2020 Change 2020 2019 Change\nAmount Amount Amount % Amount Amount Amount %\n(dollars in millions)\nResearch and development $ 1,140.4 $ 768.1 $ 372.3 48.5 % $ 768.1 $ 539.5 $ 228.6 42.4 %\nNumber of employees at period end 2,595 1,821 774 42.5 % 1,821 1,507 314 20.8 %\nResearch and development expense increased for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 due to an increase in personnel costs, which grew $321.2 million to $911.0 million for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020. The increase in personnel costs was primarily due to headcount growth.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expense consists primarily of personnel costs, including commission expense. Sales and marketing expense also includes costs for market development programs, promotional and other marketing costs, professional services, and allocated costs. We continue to thoughtfully invest in headcount and have substantially grown our international sales presence. We expect sales and marketing expense to continue to increase in absolute dollars as we increase the size of our sales and marketing organizations to increase touch points with end-customers and to expand our global presence, although our sales and marketing expense may fluctuate as a percentage of total revenue.\nYear Ended July 31, Year Ended July 31,\n2021 2020 Change 2020 2019 Change\nAmount Amount Amount % Amount Amount Amount %\n(dollars in millions)\nSales and marketing $ 1,753.8 $ 1,520.2 $ 233.6 15.4 % $ 1,520.2 $ 1,344.0 $ 176.2 13.1 %\nNumber of employees at period end 4,493 3,800 693 18.2 % 3,800 3,382 418 12.4 %\nSales and marketing expense increased for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 primarily due to an increase in personnel costs, which grew $186.9 million to $1.3 billion for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020. The increase in personnel costs was largely due to headcount growth, partially offset by decreased travel expenses due to COVID-19. In addition, expenses increased as a result of go-to-market initiatives, including advertising, which were partially offset by a decrease in trade shows and convention expenses as in-person events were replaced with virtual events due to COVID-19.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expense consists primarily of personnel costs for our executive, finance, human resources, legal, and information technology organizations, and professional services costs, which consist primarily of legal, auditing, accounting, and other\n- 50 -\nconsulting costs. General and administrative expense also includes certain non-recurring general expenses and impairment losses. Certain facilities, depreciation, benefits, recruiting, and information technology costs are allocated to other organizations based on headcount. We expect general and administrative expense to increase in absolute dollars due to additional costs associated with accounting, compliance, and insurance, although our general and administrative expense may fluctuate as a percentage of total revenue.\nYear Ended July 31, Year Ended July 31,\n2021 2020 Change 2020 2019 Change\nAmount Amount Amount % Amount Amount Amount %\n(dollars in millions)\nGeneral and administrative $ 391.1 $ 299.6 $ 91.5 30.5 % $ 299.6 $ 261.8 $ 37.8 14.4 %\nNumber of employees at period end 1,150 874 276 31.6 % 874 804 70 8.7 %\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 primarily due to personnel costs, which grew $48.9 million to $244.0 million for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020, due primarily to an increase in share-based compensation expense related to accelerated vesting of certain equity awards in connection with our acquisitions and headcount growth. Other increases included increased professional services expense to support our business growth.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense primarily consists of non-cash interest expense from the amortization of the debt discount and debt issuance costs related to our 0.0% Convertible Senior Notes due 2019 (the \u201c2019 Notes\u201d), the 0.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023 (the \u201c2023 Notes\u201d) and the 0.375% Convertible Senior Notes due 2025 (the \u201c2025 Notes\u201d, and together with \u201c2023 Notes\u201d, the \u201cNotes\u201d), and also includes the contractual interest expense related to our Notes.\nYear Ended July 31, Year Ended July 31,\n2021 2020 Change 2020 2019 Change\nAmount Amount Amount % Amount Amount Amount %\n(dollars in millions)\nInterest expense $ 163.3 $ 88.7 $ 74.6 84.1 % $ 88.7 $ 83.9 $ 4.8 5.7 %\nInterest expense increased for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 due to the issuance of our 2025 Notes in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. Refer to Note 10. Debt in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information on our series of convertible senior notes.\nOther Income, Net\nOther income, net includes interest income earned on our cash, cash equivalents, and investments, foreign currency remeasurement gains and losses, and foreign currency transaction gains and losses.\nYear Ended July 31, Year Ended July 31,\n2021 2020 Change 2020 2019 Change\nAmount Amount Amount % Amount Amount Amount %\n(dollars in millions)\nOther income, net $ 2.4 $ 35.9 $ (33.5) (93.3) % $ 35.9 $ 63.4 $ (27.5) (43.4) %\nOther income, net decreased for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 primarily due to lower interest income earned on our cash, cash equivalent, and investment balances as a result of lower interest rates for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nProvision for income taxes consists primarily of income taxes in foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct business and withholding taxes. We maintain a full valuation allowance for domestic and certain foreign deferred tax assets, including net operating loss carryforwards and certain domestic tax credits. In recent years, we reorganized our corporate structure and intercompany relationships to more closely align with the international nature of our business activities. Our corporate structure has caused, and may continue to cause, disproportionate relationships between our overall effective tax rate and other jurisdictional measures. To the extent\n- 51 -\nwe revisit our corporate structure, it may have an impact on our tax provision.\nYear Ended July 31, Year Ended July 31,\n2021 2020 Change 2020 2019 Change\nAmount Amount Amount % Amount Amount Amount %\n(dollars in millions)\nProvision for income taxes $ 33.9 $ 35.2 $ (1.3) (3.7) % $ 35.2 $ 7.3 $ 27.9 382.2 %\nEffective tax rate (7.3) % (15.2) % (15.2) % (9.8) %\nWe recorded an income tax provision for fiscal 2021. The provision for income taxes for fiscal 2021 was primarily due to income taxes in profitable foreign jurisdictions and withholding taxes. Our provision for income taxes slightly decreased for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020, primarily due to changes in our valuation allowances. Refer to Note 15. Income Taxes in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information.\n- 52 -\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nJuly 31,\n2021 2020\n(in millions)\nWorking capital $ (469.4) $ 2,437.5\nCash, cash equivalents, and investments:\nCash and cash equivalents $ 1,874.2 $ 2,958.0\nInvestments 1,915.2 1,344.2\nTotal cash, cash equivalents, and investments $ 3,789.4 $ 4,302.2\nAs of July 31, 2021, our total cash, cash equivalents, and investments of $3.8 billion were held for general corporate purposes, of which approximately $942.3 million was held outside of the United States. As of July 31, 2021, we had no unremitted earnings when evaluating our outside basis difference relating to our U.S. investment in foreign subsidiaries. However, there could be local withholding taxes payable due to various foreign countries if certain lower tier earnings are distributed. Withholding taxes that would be payable upon remittance of these lower tier earnings are not expected to be material.\nIn June 2014, we issued the 2019 Notes with an aggregate principal amount of $575.0 million. The 2019 Notes were converted prior to or settled on the maturity date of July 1, 2019. During fiscal 2019, we repaid in cash $575.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2019 Notes and issued 2.5 million shares of common stock to the holders for the conversion value in excess of the principal amount of the 2019 Notes converted, which were fully offset by shares received from our exercise of the associated note hedges. In July 2018, we issued the 2023 Notes with an aggregate principal amount of $1.7 billion. In June 2020, we issued the 2025 Notes with an aggregate principal amount of $2.0 billion. The 2023 Notes mature on July 1, 2023 and the 2025 Notes mature on June 1, 2025; however, under certain circumstances, holders may surrender their Notes of a series for conversion prior to the applicable maturity date. Upon conversion of the Notes of a series, we will pay cash equal to the aggregate principal amount of the Notes of such series to be converted, and, at our election, will pay or deliver cash and/or shares of our common stock for the amount of our conversion obligation in excess of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes of such series being converted. The sale price condition was met for the 2023 Notes during the fiscal quarter ended July 31, 2021, and as a result, holders may convert their 2023 Notes at any time during the fiscal quarter ending October 31, 2021. We believe that our cash provided by operating activities, together with our existing cash, cash equivalents and investments will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs should the holders choose to convert their 2023 Notes during the fiscal quarter ending October 31, 2021. As of July 31, 2021, substantially all of our 2023 Notes and 2025 Notes remained outstanding. Refer to Note 10. Debt in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information on the Notes.\nIn September 2018, we entered into a credit agreement (the \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d) that provides for a $400.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility (the \u201cCredit Facility\u201d), with an option to increase the amount of the credit facility by up to an additional $350.0 million, subject to certain conditions. As of July 31, 2021, there were no amounts outstanding, and we were in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Agreement. Refer to Note 10. Debt in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information on the Credit Agreement.\nIn February 2019, our board of directors authorized a $1.0 billion share repurchase program, and, in December 2020, our board of directors authorized a $700.0 million increase to our share repurchase program, bringing the total authorization to $1.7 billion (our \u201ccurrent authorization\u201d). As of July 31, 2021, $323.9 million remained available for future share repurchases under this current authorization. On August 17, 2021, our board of directors authorized another $676.1 million increase to our current authorization, bringing the total remaining authorization for future share repurchases to $1.0 billion. Repurchases will be funded from available working capital and may be made at management\u2019s discretion from time to time. The expiration date of our current authorization was extended to December 31, 2022, and this program may be suspended or discontinued at any time. In February 2020, our board of directors approved the repurchase of $1.0 billion of our common stock through an accelerated share repurchase (\u201cASR\u201d) transaction, which was in addition to our current authorization. During fiscal 2020, we completed the ASR transaction with an aggregate of 5.2 million shares of our common stock repurchased and retired. Refer to Note 13. Stockholders\u2019 Equity in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information on these repurchase programs.\n- 53 -\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the years ended July 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019:\nYear Ended July 31,\n2021 2020 2019\n(in millions)\nNet cash provided by operating activities $ 1,503.0 $ 1,035.7 $ 1,055.6\nNet cash provided by (used in) investing activities (1,480.6) 288.0 (1,825.9)\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities (1,104.0) 673.0 (773.9)\nNet increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash $ (1,081.6) $ 1,996.7 $ (1,544.2)\nCash from operations could be affected by various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the effects of COVID-19 and other risks detailed in Part I, Item 1A \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in this Form 10-K. We believe that our cash flow from operations with existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including our growth rate, the timing and extent of spending to support development efforts, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, the introduction of new and enhanced products and subscription and support offerings, the costs to acquire or invest in complementary businesses and technologies, the costs to ensure access to adequate manufacturing capacity, the investments in our infrastructure to support the adoption of our cloud-based subscription offerings, the investments in our new corporate headquarters, the continuing market acceptance of our products and subscription and support offerings and macroeconomic events such as COVID-19. In addition, from time to time we may incur additional tax liability in connection with certain corporate structuring decisions.\nWe may also choose to seek additional equity or debt financing. In the event that additional financing is required from outside sources, we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired, our business, operating results, and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nOperating Activities\nOur operating activities have consisted of net losses adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in assets and liabilities.\nCash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2021 was $1.5 billion, an increase of $467.3 million compared to fiscal 2020. The increase was primarily due to growth of our business as reflected by an increase in billings, and an increase in collections during fiscal 2021, partially offset by higher cash expenditure to support our business growth.\nInvesting Activities\nOur investing activities have consisted of capital expenditures, net investment purchases, sales, and maturities, and business acquisitions. We expect to continue such activities as our business grows.\nCash used in investing activities during fiscal 2021 was $1.5 billion, a net change of $1.8 billion compared to cash provided by investing activities of $288.0 million in fiscal 2020. The change was primarily due to a decrease in proceeds from maturities and sales of investments and higher purchases of investments during fiscal 2021.\nFinancing Activities\nOur financing activities have consisted of proceeds from sales of shares through employee equity incentive plans, cash used to repurchase shares of our common stock, and payments for tax withholding obligations of certain employees related to the net share settlement of equity awards.\nCash used in financing activities during fiscal 2021 was $1.1 billion, a net change of $1.8 billion compared to cash provided by financing activities of 673.0 million in fiscal 2020. The change was primarily due to net proceeds of $1.8 billion from the issuance of our 2025 Notes, issuance of warrants, and purchase of note hedges during fiscal 2020.\n- 54 -\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nThe following summarizes our contractual obligations and commitments as of July 31, 2021:\nPayments Due by Period\nTotal Less Than 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years More Than 5 Years\n(in millions)\n0.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023\n$ 1,692.0 $ - $ 1,692.0 $ - $ -\n0.375% Convertible Senior Notes due 2025\n2,000.0 - - 2,000.0 -\nOperating lease obligations\n426.6 78.8 134.2 116.1 97.5\nPurchase obligations(1)\n1,831.7 251.3 609.0 971.4 -\nTotal(2)\n$ 5,950.3 $ 330.1 $ 2,435.2 $ 3,087.5 $ 97.5\n______________\n(1) Consists of minimum purchase commitments of products and components with our manufacturing partners and component suppliers, as well as minimum or fixed purchase commitments for our use of certain cloud and other services with third-party providers. Obligations under contracts that we can cancel without a significant penalty are not included in the table above.\n(2) No amounts related to income taxes are included. As of July 31, 2021, we had approximately $80.6 million of tax liabilities recorded related to uncertainty in income tax positions.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of July 31, 2021, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated organizations or financial partnerships, such as structured finance or special purpose entities that would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates due to risks and uncertainties, including uncertainty in the current economic environment due to the global impact of COVID-19. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and our actual results, our future financial statements will be affected.\nWe believe that of our significant accounting policies described in Note 1. Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the critical accounting policies requiring estimates, assumptions, and judgments that have the most significant impact on our consolidated financial statements are described below.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe majority of our contracts with our customers include various combinations of our products and subscriptions and support. Our appliances and software licenses have significant standalone functionalities and capabilities and, accordingly, are distinct from our subscriptions and support services, as the customer can benefit from the product without these services and such services are separately identifiable within the contract. We account for multiple agreements with a single customer as a single contract if the contractual terms and/or substance of those agreements indicate that they may be so closely related that they are, in effect, parts of a single contract. The amount we are due in exchange for delivering on the contract is allocated to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price.\nWe establish standalone selling price using the prices charged for a deliverable when sold separately. If not observable through past transactions, we estimate the standalone selling price based on our pricing model and our go-to-market strategy, which include factors such as type of sales channel (reseller, distributor, or end-customer), the geographies in which our offerings were sold (domestic or international) and offering type (products, subscriptions, or support). As our business offerings evolve over time, we may be required to modify our estimated standalone selling prices, and as a result the timing and classification of our revenue could be affected.\nDeferred Contract Costs\nWe defer contract costs that are recoverable and incremental to obtaining customer sales contracts. Contract costs, which primarily consist of sales commissions, are amortized on a systematic basis that is consistent with the transfer to the customer of the goods or services to which the asset relates. Sales commissions for initial contracts that are not commensurate with renewal\n- 55 -\ncommissions are amortized over a benefit period of five years, consistent with the revenue recognition pattern of the performance obligations in the related contracts including expected renewals. The benefit period is determined by taking into consideration contract length, technology life, and other quantitative and qualitative factors. The expected renewals are estimated based on historical renewal trends. Sales commissions for initial contracts that are commensurate and sales commissions for renewal contracts are amortized over the related contractual period in proportion to the revenue recognized.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes using the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. In addition, deferred tax assets are recorded for the future benefit of utilizing net operating losses and research and development credit carryforwards. Valuation allowances are provided when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.\nSignificant judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider all available evidence, including past operating results, estimates of future taxable income, and the feasibility of tax planning strategies. In the event that we change our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized, we will adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made.\nWe apply the authoritative accounting guidance prescribing a threshold and measurement attribute for the financial recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. We recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two-step process. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement.\nSignificant judgment is also required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. Although we believe our reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences may impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made.\nManufacturing Partner and Supplier Liabilities\nWe outsource most of our manufacturing, repair, and supply chain management operations to our EMS provider, which procures components and assembles our products based on our demand forecasts. These forecasts of future demand are based upon historical trends and analysis from our sales and product management functions as adjusted for overall market conditions. We accrue for costs for manufacturing purchase commitments in excess of our forecasted demand, including costs for excess components or for carrying costs incurred by our manufacturing partners and component suppliers. Actual component usage and product demand may be materially different from our forecast and could be caused by factors outside of our control, which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. To date, we have not accrued significant costs associated with this exposure.\nLoss Contingencies\nWe are subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business. We accrue for loss contingencies when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. If we determine that a loss is possible and the range of the loss can be reasonably determined, then we disclose the range of the possible loss. We regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether an accrual is required, an accrual should be adjusted, or a range of possible loss should be disclosed.\nFrom time to time, we are involved in disputes, litigation, and other legal actions. However, there are many uncertainties associated with any litigation, and these actions or other third-party claims against us may cause us to incur substantial settlement charges, which are inherently difficult to estimate and could adversely affect our results of operations. The actual liability in any such matters may be materially different from our estimates, which could result in the need to adjust our liability and record additional expenses.\nGoodwill, Intangibles, and Other Long-Lived Assets\nWe make significant estimates, assumptions, and judgments when valuing goodwill and other purchased intangible assets in connection with the initial purchase price allocation of an acquired entity, as well as when evaluating impairment of goodwill and other purchased intangible assets on an ongoing basis. These estimates are based upon a number of factors, including historical experience, market conditions, and information obtained from the management of the acquired company. Critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future, discount rates, the time and expense that would be necessary to recreate the assets, and the profit margin a market participant would receive. The amounts and useful lives assigned to identified intangible assets impacts the amount and timing of future amortization expense.\n- 56 -\nWe evaluate goodwill for impairment on an annual basis in our fourth fiscal quarter or more frequently if we believe impairment indicators exist. We have elected to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. The qualitative assessment includes our evaluation of relevant events and circumstances affecting our single reporting unit, including macroeconomic, industry, and market conditions, our overall financial performance, and trends in the market price of our common stock. If qualitative factors indicate that it is more likely than not that our reporting unit\u2019s fair value is less than its carrying amount, then we will perform the quantitative impairment test by comparing our reporting unit\u2019s carrying amount, including goodwill, to its fair value. If the carrying amount of our reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss will be recognized in an amount equal to that excess. To date, the results of our qualitative assessment have indicated that the quantitative goodwill impairment test is not necessary.\nWe evaluate long-lived assets, such as property, equipment, and purchased intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. Such events or changes in circumstances include, but are not limited to, a significant decrease in the fair value of the underlying asset or asset group, a significant decrease in the benefits realized from the acquired assets, difficulty and delays in integrating the business, or a significant change in the operations of the acquired assets or use of an asset or asset group. A long-lived asset is considered impaired if its carrying amount exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows the asset or asset group is expected to generate. Critical estimates in determining whether a long-lived asset is considered impaired include the amount and timing of future cash flows that the asset or asset group is expected to generate. If a long-lived asset is considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset or asset group, which is estimated using a present value technique. Critical estimates in determining the fair value of an asset or asset group and the amount of impairment to recognize include, but are not limited to, the amount and timing of future cash flows that the asset or asset group is expected to generate and the discount rate. Determining the fair value of an asset or asset group is highly judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions for market participants. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain. Actual future results may differ from those estimates.\nConvertible Senior Notes\nIn accounting for the issuance of our convertible senior notes, we separate the notes into liability and equity components. The carrying amount of the liability component is calculated by measuring the fair value of a similar liability that does not have an associated convertible feature, using a discounted cash flow model with a risk adjusted yield. The carrying amount of the equity component representing the conversion option is determined by deducting the fair value of the liability component from the par value of the notes as a whole. This difference represents a debt discount that is amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the notes. The equity component is not remeasured as long as it continues to meet the conditions for equity classification. In accounting for the transaction costs related to the issuance of the notes, we allocate the total amount incurred to the liability and equity components using the same proportions as the proceeds from the notes.

    "item_7A": "ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk\nOur sales contracts are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. A portion of our operating expenses are incurred outside of the United States and are denominated in foreign currencies and are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly changes in the euro, Israeli shekel, British pound, Singapore dollar, Australian dollar, and Japanese yen. Additionally, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may cause us to recognize transaction gains and losses in our statement of operations. The effect of an immediate 10% adverse change in foreign exchange rates on monetary assets and liabilities at July 31, 2021 would not be material to our financial condition or results of operations. As of July 31, 2021, foreign currency transaction gains and losses and exchange rate fluctuations have not been material to our financial statements. We enter into foreign currency derivative contracts with maturities of 16 months or less which we designate as cash flow hedges to manage the foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with our foreign currency denominated expenditures. The effectiveness of our existing hedging transactions and the availability and effectiveness of any hedging transactions we may decide to enter into in the future may be limited, and we may not be able to successfully hedge our exposure, which could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nINDEX TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nReports of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nManagement\u2019s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\nConsolidated Statements of Operations\nConsolidated Statements of Comprehensive Loss\nConsolidated Statements of Stockholders\u2019 Equity\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n- 59 -\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Palo Alto Networks, Inc.\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (the Company) as of July 31, 2021 and 2020, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, stockholders\u2019 equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended July 31, 2021, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the \u201cconsolidated financial statements\u201d). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at July 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended July 31, 2021, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of July 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated September 3, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company\u2019s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\n- 60 -\nRevenue Recognition\nDescription of the Matter\nAs described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company\u2019s contracts with customers sometimes contain multiple performance obligations, which are accounted for separately if they are distinct. In such cases, the transaction price is then allocated to the distinct performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price basis, and revenue is recognized when control of the distinct performance obligation is transferred. For example, product revenue is recognized at the time of hardware shipment or delivery of software license, and subscription and support revenue is recognized over time as the services are performed.\nAuditing the Company\u2019s revenue recognition was complex, including the identification and determination of distinct performance obligations and the timing of revenue recognition. For example, there were nonstandard terms and conditions that required judgment to determine the distinct performance obligations and the impact on the timing of revenue recognition.\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of the Company\u2019s process and controls to identify and determine the distinct performance obligations and the timing of revenue recognition.\nTo test the identification and determination of the distinct performance obligations and the timing of revenue recognition, our audit procedures included, among others, reading the executed contract and purchase order to understand the contract, identifying the performance obligation(s), determining the distinct performance obligations, and evaluating the timing of revenue recognition for a sample of individual sales transactions. We evaluated the accuracy of the Company\u2019s contract summary documentation, specifically related to the identification and determination of distinct performance obligations and the timing of revenue recognition.\nBusiness Combinations\nDescription of the Matter\nAs described in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company completed an acquisition of Expanse Inc. for net consideration of $797.2 million in the year ended July 31, 2021. The Company accounted for this acquisition as a business combination.\nAuditing the accounting for the acquisition was complex due to the significant estimation uncertainty in determining the fair values of identified intangible assets, which consisted of developed technology of $123.4 million and customer relationships of $36.9 million. The significant estimation uncertainty was primarily due to the sensitivity of the respective fair values to underlying assumptions about future performance of the acquired business and due to the limited historical data on which to base these assumptions. The significant assumptions used to form the basis of the forecasted results included revenue growth rates and technology migration curves. These significant assumptions were forward-looking and could be affected by future economic and market conditions.\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of the Company\u2019s controls over its accounting for the acquisition. This included testing controls over the estimation process supporting the recognition and measurement of identified intangible assets, and management\u2019s judgment and evaluation of underlying assumptions and estimates with regards to the fair values of the identified intangible assets.\nTo test the estimated fair values of the identified intangible assets, our audit procedures included, among others, reading the underlying agreements, testing management\u2019s application of the relevant accounting guidance, and involving a specialist to assist us in the evaluation of the Company\u2019s valuation methodology and testing of the significant assumptions. For example, we compared the revenue growth rates and technology migration curves to current industry, market and economic trends. Additionally, we tested the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data supporting the significant assumptions and estimates.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nWe have served as the Company\u2019s auditor since 2009.\nSan Jose, California\nSeptember 3, 2021\n- 61 -\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Palo Alto Networks, Inc.\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Palo Alto Networks, Inc.\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of July 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of July 31, 2021, based on the COSO criteria.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of July 31, 2021 and 2020, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, stockholders\u2019 equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended July 31, 2021, and the related notes and our report dated September 3, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company\u2019s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management\u2019s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nSan Jose, California\nSeptember 3, 2021\n- 62 -\nManagement\u2019s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nManagement\u2019s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThe management of Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (the \u201cCompany\u201d) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 for the Company. The Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of the Company\u2019s principal executive and principal financial officers to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the Company\u2019s financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nThe Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nManagement assessed the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of July 31, 2021, based on the framework set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (\u201cCOSO\u201d) in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013 framework). Based on that assessment, management concluded that, as of July 31, 2021, the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting was effective.\nThe effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of July 31, 2021, has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audits the Company\u2019s Consolidated Financial Statements, as stated in their report preceding this report, which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of July 31, 2021.\n- 63 -\nPALO ALTO NETWORKS, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(In millions, except per share data)\nJuly 31,\n2021 2020\nAssets\nCurrent assets:\nCash and cash equivalents $ 1,874.2 $ 2,958.0\nShort-term investments 1,026.9 789.8\nAccounts receivable, net of allowance for credit losses of $11.2 and $2.3 at July 31, 2021 and July 31, 2020, respectively\n1,240.4 1,037.1\nShort-term deferred contract costs 276.5 206.0\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets 229.3 138.3\nTotal current assets 4,647.3 5,129.2\nProperty and equipment, net 318.4 348.1\nOperating lease right-of-use assets 262.9 258.7\nLong-term investments 888.3 554.4\nLong-term deferred contract costs 494.6 422.3\nGoodwill 2,710.1 1,812.9\nIntangible assets, net 498.6 358.2\nOther assets 421.4 181.6\nTotal assets $ 10,241.6 $ 9,065.4\nLiabilities, temporary equity and stockholders\u2019 equity\nCurrent liabilities:\nAccounts payable $ 56.9 $ 63.6\nAccrued compensation 430.6 322.2\nAccrued and other liabilities 329.4 256.8\nDeferred revenue 2,741.9 2,049.1\nConvertible senior notes, net 1,557.9 -\nTotal current liabilities 5,116.7 2,691.7\nConvertible senior notes, net 1,668.1 3,084.1\nLong-term deferred revenue 2,282.1 1,761.1\nLong-term operating lease liabilities 313.4 336.6\nOther long-term liabilities 97.7 90.1\nCommitments and contingencies (Note 12)\nTemporary equity 129.1 -\nStockholders\u2019 equity:\nPreferred stock; $0.0001 par value; 100.0 shares authorized; none issued and outstanding at July 31, 2021 and July 31, 2020\n- -\nCommon stock and additional paid-in capital; $0.0001 par value; 1,000.0 shares authorized; 97.3 and 96.3 shares issued and outstanding at July 31, 2021 and July 31, 2020, respectively\n2,311.2 2,259.2\nAccumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (9.9) 10.5\nAccumulated deficit (1,666.8) (1,167.9)\nTotal stockholders\u2019 equity 634.5 1,101.8\nTotal liabilities, temporary equity and stockholders\u2019 equity $ 10,241.6 $ 9,065.4\nSee notes to consolidated financial statements.\n- 64 -\nPALO ALTO NETWORKS, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS\n(In millions, except per share data)\nYear Ended July 31,\n2021 2020 2019\nRevenue:\nProduct $ 1,120.3 $ 1,064.2 $ 1,096.2\nSubscription and support 3,135.8 2,344.2 1,803.4\nTotal revenue 4,256.1 3,408.4 2,899.6\nCost of revenue:\nProduct 308.5 294.4 315.9\nSubscription and support 966.4 705.1 492.5\nTotal cost of revenue 1,274.9 999.5 808.4\nTotal gross profit 2,981.2 2,408.9 2,091.2\nOperating expenses:\nResearch and development 1,140.4 768.1 539.5\nSales and marketing 1,753.8 1,520.2 1,344.0\nGeneral and administrative 391.1 299.6 261.8\nTotal operating expenses 3,285.3 2,587.9 2,145.3\nOperating loss\n(304.1) (179.0) (54.1)\nInterest expense (163.3) (88.7) (83.9)\nOther income, net 2.4 35.9 63.4\nLoss before income taxes\n(465.0) (231.8) (74.6)\nProvision for income taxes 33.9 35.2 7.3\nNet loss\n$ (498.9) $ (267.0) $ (81.9)\nNet loss per share, basic and diluted $ (5.18) $ (2.76) $ (0.87)\nWeighted-average shares used to compute net loss per share, basic and diluted 96.4 96.9 94.5\nSee notes to consolidated financial statements.\n- 65 -\nPALO ALTO NETWORKS, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF COMPREHENSIVE LOSS\n(In millions)\nYear Ended July 31,\n2021 2020 2019\nNet loss\n$ (498.9) $ (267.0) $ (81.9)\nOther comprehensive income (loss), net of tax:\nChange in unrealized gains (losses) on investments\n(3.0) 1.0 10.4\nChange in unrealized gains (losses) on cash flow hedges\n(17.4) 13.2 2.3\nOther comprehensive income (loss)\n(20.4) 14.2 12.7\nComprehensive loss\n$ (519.3) $ (252.8) $ (69.2)\nSee notes to consolidated financial statements.\n- 66 -\nPALO ALTO NETWORKS, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF STOCKHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY\n(In millions)\nCommon Stock\nand\nAdditional Paid-In Capital Accumulated\nOther\nComprehensive Income (Loss) Accumulated\nDeficit Total\nStockholders\u2019\nEquity\nShares Amount\nBalance as of July 31, 2018 93.6 $ 1,967.4 $ (16.4) $ (790.7) $ 1,160.3\nCumulative-effect adjustment from adoption of new accounting pronouncement -

Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nDescription of Business\nPalo Alto Networks, Inc. (the \u201cCompany,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cus,\u201d or \u201cour\u201d), headquartered in Santa Clara, California, was incorporated in March 2005 under the laws of the State of Delaware and commenced operations in April 2005. We empower enterprises, service providers, and government entities to secure all users, applications, data, networks, clouds and devices with comprehensive visibility and context, continuously, across all locations.\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d). The consolidated financial statements include all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of our annual results. All adjustments are of a normal recurring nature.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include our accounts and our wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Such management estimates include, but are not limited to, the standalone selling price for our products and services, share-based compensation, fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations, identified intangibles and goodwill, valuation allowance against deferred tax assets, manufacturing partner and supplier liabilities, fair value of debt component of convertible notes, interest rate for operating lease liabilities, deferred contract cost benefit period, and loss contingencies. We base our estimates on historical experience and also on assumptions that we believe are reasonable. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates due to risks and uncertainties, including uncertainty in the current economic environment due to the global impact of COVID-19.\nConcentrations\nFinancial instruments that subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, investments, derivative contracts, accounts receivable and financing receivables.\nWe invest only in high-quality credit instruments and maintain our cash and cash equivalents and available-for-sale investments in fixed income securities. Management believes that the financial institutions that hold our investments are financially sound and, accordingly, are subject to minimal credit risk. Deposits held with banks may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits.\nOur derivative contracts expose us to credit risk to the extent that the counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the arrangement. We mitigate this credit risk by transacting with major financial institutions with high credit ratings and also enter into master netting arrangements, which permit net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty. We are not required to pledge, and are not entitled to receive, cash collateral related to these derivative instruments. We do not enter into derivative contracts for trading or speculative purposes.\nOur accounts receivable are primarily derived from our distributors in various geographical locations. Our financing receivables are with certain qualified end-customers. We perform ongoing credit evaluations and generally do not require collateral on accounts receivable or financing receivables.\nAs of July 31, 2021, four distributors individually represented 10% or more of our gross accounts receivable, and in the aggregate represented 56.6% of our gross accounts receivable. As of July 31, 2021, four end-customers represented 10% or more of our gross financing receivables, and in aggregate represented 67.0% of our gross financing receivables.\nFor fiscal 2021, three distributors represented 10% or more of our total revenue, representing 33.2%, 12.2%, and 10.6%, respectively. No single end-customer accounted for more than 10% of our total revenue in fiscal 2021, 2020, or 2019.\nWe rely on an electronics manufacturing services provider (\u201cEMS provider\u201d) to assemble most of our products and sole source component suppliers for a certain number of our components.\nComprehensive Loss\nComprehensive loss is comprised of net loss and other comprehensive income (loss). Our other comprehensive income (loss) includes unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale investments and unrealized gains and losses on cash flow hedges.\n- 69 -\nForeign Currency Transactions\nThe functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies have been remeasured into U.S. dollars using the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet dates. Foreign currency remeasurement gains and losses and foreign currency transaction gains and losses are not significant to the financial statements.\nFair Value\nWe define fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities which are required to be recorded at fair value, we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which to transact and the market-based risk. We apply fair value accounting for all financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. Goodwill, intangible assets, and other long-lived assets are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, only if impairment is indicated. The carrying amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements approximate the fair value for cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities, due to their short-term nature.\nCash, Cash Equivalents, and Investments\nWe consider all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. Investments not considered cash equivalents, and with maturities of one year or less from the consolidated balance sheet date, are classified as short-term investments. Investments with maturities greater than one year from the consolidated balance sheet date are classified as long-term investments.\nWe classify our investments in marketable debt securities as available-for-sale at the time of purchase. When the fair value of a security is below its amortized cost, the amortized cost will be reduced to its fair value if it is more likely than not that we are required to sell the impaired security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, or we have the intention to sell the security. If neither of these conditions are met, we determine whether the impairment is due to credit losses by comparing the present value of the expected cash flows of the security with its amortized cost basis. The amount of impairment recognized is limited to the excess of the amortized cost over the fair value of the security. An allowance for credit losses for the excess of amortized cost over the expected cash flows is recorded in other income, net in our consolidated statements of operations. Impairment losses that are not credit-related are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (\u201cAOCI\u201d) in stockholders\u2019 equity.\nAccounts Receivable\nTrade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount, net of allowances for credit losses for any potential uncollectible amounts. The allowance for credit losses is based on our assessment of the collectability of accounts. Management regularly reviews the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses on a collective basis by considering the age of each outstanding invoice, each customer\u2019s expected ability to pay and collection history, current market conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions to determine whether the allowance is appropriate. Accounts receivable deemed uncollectible are charged against the allowance for credit losses when identified. For the years ended July 31, 2021 and 2020, the allowance for credit losses activity was not significant.\nFinancing Receivables\nWe provide financing arrangements, primarily loans, for certain qualified end-user customers to purchase our products and services. Payment terms on these financing arrangements are up to five years. We evaluate our allowance for credit losses by assessing the risks and losses inherent in our financing receivables on either an individual or a collective basis. Our assessment considers various factors, including lifetime expected losses determined using customer risk profile, current economic conditions that may affect a customer\u2019s ability to pay, and forward-looking economic considerations. Financing receivables are written off when they are considered uncollectible, and related outstanding balances are reversed and charged against the allowance for credit losses. Short-term financing receivables are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets, and long-term financing receivables are included in other assets on our consolidated balance sheets. For the years ended July 31, 2021 and 2020, the allowance for credit losses activity was not significant. Refer to Note 5. Financing Receivables for additional information.\nDerivatives\nAs a global business, we are exposed to currency exchange rate risk. Substantially all of our revenue is transacted in U.S. dollars, however, a portion of our operating expenditures are incurred outside of the United States and are denominated in foreign currencies, making them subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We enter into foreign currency derivative contracts with maturities of 16 months or less, which we designate as cash flow hedges, to manage the foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with these expenditures.\nOur derivative financial instruments are recorded at fair value, on a gross basis, as either assets or liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. Gains or losses related to our cash flow hedges are recorded as a component of AOCI in our consolidated balance sheets and are reclassified into the financial statement line item associated with the underlying hedged transaction in our consolidated\n- 70 -\nstatements of operations when the underlying hedged transaction is recognized in earnings. If it becomes probable that the hedged transaction will not occur, the cumulative unrealized gain or loss is reclassified immediately from AOCI into the financial statement line item associated with the underlying hedged transaction in our consolidated statements of operations. Gains or losses related to non-designated derivative instruments are recognized in other income, net in our consolidated statements of operations for each period until the instrument matures, is terminated, is re-designated as a qualified cash flow hedge, or is sold. Derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are classified in our consolidated statements of cash flows in the same manner as the underlying hedged transaction, primarily within cash flows from operating activities.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally three to ten years. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the improvements or the remaining lease term. Land is not depreciated.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe include the results of operations of the businesses that we acquire as of the respective dates of acquisition. We allocate the fair value of the purchase price of our acquisitions to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and intangible assets acquired, based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. Additional information existing as of the acquisition date but unknown to us may become known during the remainder of the measurement period, not to exceed 12 months from the acquisition date, which may result in changes to the amounts and allocations recorded.\nIntangible Assets\nPurchased intangible assets with finite lives are carried at cost, less accumulated amortization. Amortization is computed over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets.\nImpairment of Goodwill, Intangible Assets, and Other Long-Lived Assets\nGoodwill is evaluated for impairment on an annual basis in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year, and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable. We have elected to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of our single reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. If we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of our single reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then the quantitative impairment test will be performed. Under the quantitative impairment test, if the carrying amount of our single reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we will recognize an impairment loss in an amount equal to that excess but limited to the total amount of goodwill.\nWe evaluate events and changes in circumstances that could indicate carrying amounts of purchased intangible assets and other long-lived assets may not be recoverable. When such events or changes in circumstances occur, we assess the recoverability of these assets by determining whether or not the carrying amount will be recovered through undiscounted expected future cash flows. If the total of the future undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of an asset, we record an impairment loss for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset.\nWe did not recognize any impairment losses on our goodwill, intangible assets, or other long-lived assets during the years ended July 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019.\nManufacturing Partner and Supplier Liabilities\nWe outsource most of our manufacturing, repair, and supply chain management operations to our EMS provider and payments to it are a significant portion of our cost of product revenue. Although we could be contractually obligated to purchase manufactured products and components, we generally do not own the manufactured products and components. Product title transfers from our EMS provider to us and immediately to our customers upon shipment. Our EMS provider assembles our products using design specifications, quality assurance programs, and standards that we establish, and it procures components and assembles our products based on our demand forecasts. These forecasts represent our estimates of future demand for our products based upon historical trends and analysis from our sales and product management functions as adjusted for overall market conditions. If the actual component usage and product demand are significantly lower than forecast, we record a liability for manufacturing purchase commitments in excess of our forecasted demand including costs for excess components or for carrying costs incurred by our manufacturing partners and component suppliers. Through July 31, 2021, we have not accrued any significant costs associated with this exposure.\nConvertible Senior Notes\nIn accounting for the issuance of our convertible senior notes, we separate the notes into liability and equity components. The carrying amount of the liability component is calculated by measuring the fair value of a similar liability that does not have an associated convertible feature, using a discounted cash flow model with a risk adjusted yield. The carrying amount of the equity component representing the conversion option is determined by deducting the fair value of the liability component from the par value of the notes as a whole. This difference represents a debt discount that is amortized to interest expense using the effective interest\n- 71 -\nmethod over the term of the notes. The equity component is not remeasured as long as it continues to meet the conditions for equity classification. In accounting for the transaction costs related to the issuance of the notes, we allocate the total amount incurred to the liability and equity components using the same proportions as the proceeds from the notes. Transaction costs attributable to the liability component are netted with the liability component and amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the notes. Transaction costs attributable to the equity component are netted with the equity component of the notes in additional paid-in capital in the consolidated balance sheets. When the notes are convertible, the net carrying amount of the notes is classified as a current liability and a portion of the equity component representing the conversion option is reclassified to temporary equity in our consolidated balance sheets. The portion of the equity component classified as temporary equity is measured as the difference between the principal and net carrying amount of the notes, excluding debt issuance costs.\nRevenue Recognition\nOur revenue consists of product revenue and subscription and support revenue. Revenue is recognized when control of promised products, subscriptions and support services are transferred to customers, in an amount that reflects the expected consideration in exchange for those products and services.\nWe determine revenue recognition through the following steps:\n\u2022Identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer.\n\u2022Identification of the performance obligations in the contract.\n\u2022Determination of the transaction price.\n\u2022Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract.\n\u2022Recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation.\nRevenues are reported net of sales taxes. Shipping charges billed to channel partners are included in revenues and related costs are included in cost of revenue.\nProduct Revenue\nProduct revenue is derived primarily from sales of our appliances. Product revenue also includes revenue derived from software licenses of Panorama and the VM-Series. Our appliances and software licenses include a broad set of built-in networking and security features and functionalities. We recognize product revenue at the time of hardware shipment or delivery of software license.\nSubscription and Support Revenue\nSubscription and support revenue is derived primarily from sales of our subscription and support offerings. We recognize subscription and support revenue over time as the services are performed. Our contractual subscription and support contracts are typically one to five years.\nContracts with Multiple Performance Obligations\nThe majority of our contracts with our customers include various combinations of our products and subscriptions and support. Our appliances and software licenses have significant standalone functionalities and capabilities. Accordingly, these appliances and software licenses are distinct from our subscriptions and support services as the customer can benefit from the product without these services and such services are separately identifiable within the contract. We account for multiple agreements with a single customer as a single contract if the contractual terms and/or substance of those agreements indicate that they may be so closely related that they are, in effect, parts of a single contract. The amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for delivering on the contract is allocated to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. If a contract contains a single performance obligation, no allocation is required.\nWe establish standalone selling price using the prices charged for a deliverable when sold separately. If the standalone selling price is not observable through past transactions, we estimate the standalone selling price based on our pricing model and our go-to-market strategy, which include factors such as type of sales channel (reseller, distributor, or end-customer), the geographies in which our offerings were sold (domestic or international), and offering type (products, subscriptions, or support).\nDeferred Revenue\nWe record deferred revenue when cash payments are received or due in advance of our performance. Our payment terms typically require payment within 30 to 45 days of the date we issue an invoice. The current portion of deferred revenue represents the amounts that are expected to be recognized as revenue within one year of the consolidated balance sheet date.\nDeferred Contract Costs\nWe defer contract costs that are recoverable and incremental to obtaining customer sales contracts. Contract costs, which primarily consist of sales commissions, are amortized on a systematic basis that is consistent with the transfer to the customer of the goods or services to which the asset relates. Sales commissions paid for initial contracts are generally not commensurate with the\n- 72 -\ncommissions paid for renewal contracts, given the substantive difference in commission rates in proportion to their respective contract values. Sales commissions for initial contracts that are not commensurate are amortized over a benefit period of five years, consistent with the revenue recognition pattern of the performance obligations in the related contracts including expected renewals. The benefit period is determined by taking into consideration contract length, technology life, and other quantitative and qualitative factors. The expected renewals are estimated based on historical renewal trends. Sales commissions for initial contracts that are commensurate and sales commissions for renewal contracts are amortized over the related contractual period in proportion to the revenue recognized.\nWe classify deferred contract costs as short-term or long-term based on when we expect to recognize the expense. The amortization of deferred contract costs is included in sales and marketing expense in our consolidated statements of operations. Deferred contract costs are periodically reviewed for impairment. We did not recognize any impairment losses on our deferred contract costs during the years ended July 31, 2021, 2020, or 2019.\nSoftware Development Costs\nInternally developed software includes security software developed to meet our internal needs to provide cloud-based subscription offerings to our end-customers and business software that we customize to meet our specific operational needs. These capitalized costs consist of internal compensation related costs and external direct costs incurred during the application development stage and will be amortized over a useful life of three to five years. As of July 31, 2021 and 2020, we capitalized as other assets on our consolidated balance sheets $114.8 million and $90.1 million in costs, respectively, net of accumulated amortization, for security software developed to meet our internal needs to provide our cloud-based subscription offerings. We recognized amortization expense of $47.8 million, $31.3 million, and $12.9 million related to these capitalized costs as cost of subscription and support revenue in our consolidated statements of operations during the years ended July 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.\nThe costs to develop software that is marketed externally have not been capitalized as we believe our current software development process is essentially completed concurrent with the establishment of technological feasibility. As such, all related software development costs are expensed as incurred and included in research and development expense in our consolidated statements of operations.\nShare-Based Compensation\nCompensation expense related to share-based transactions, including employee and non-employee director awards, is measured and recognized in the financial statements based on fair value on the grant date. We recognize share-based compensation expense for awards with only service conditions on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the related award. We recognize share-based compensation expense for awards with market conditions and awards with performance conditions on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for each separately vesting portion of the award and, for awards with performance conditions, when it is probable that the performance condition will be achieved. We account for forfeitures of all share-based payment awards when they occur.\nLeases\nWe determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. We evaluate the classification of leases at commencement and, as necessary, at modification. Operating leases are included in operating lease right-of-use assets, accrued and other liabilities, and long-term operating lease liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. We did not have any material finance leases in any of the periods presented.\nOperating lease right-of-use assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term. Operating lease liabilities represent our obligation to make payments arising from the lease. Operating lease right-of-use assets and liabilities are recognized at the present value of the future lease payments at the lease commencement date. The interest rate used to determine the present value of the future lease payments is our incremental borrowing rate, because the interest rates implicit in most of our leases are not readily determinable. Our incremental borrowing rate is estimated to approximate the interest rate on a collateralized basis with similar terms and payments, and in economic environments where the leased asset is located. Operating lease right-of-use assets also include adjustments related to lease incentives, prepaid or accrued rent and initial direct lease costs. Operating lease right-of-use assets are subject to evaluation for impairment or disposal on a basis consistent with other long-lived assets.\nOur lease terms may include periods under options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. We generally use the base, non-cancelable lease term when determining the lease assets and liabilities. Operating lease cost is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nWe account for lease and non-lease components as a single lease component and do not recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for leases with a term of 12 months or less. Payments under our lease arrangements are primarily fixed, however, certain lease agreements contain variable payments, which are expensed as incurred and not included in the operating lease right-of-use assets and liabilities. Variable lease payments are primarily comprised of real estate taxes, common area maintenance, and insurance.\n- 73 -\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes using the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. In addition, deferred tax assets are recorded for the future benefit of utilizing net operating losses and research and development credit carryforwards. Valuation allowances are provided when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.\nSignificant judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider all available evidence, including past operating results, estimates of future taxable income, and the feasibility of tax planning strategies. In the event that we change our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized, we will adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made.\nWe apply the authoritative accounting guidance prescribing a threshold and measurement attribute for the financial recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. We recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two-step process. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement.\nLoss Contingencies\nWe are subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business. In determining loss contingencies, we consider the likelihood of loss or impairment of an asset, or the incurrence of a liability, as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss. An estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired, or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. If we determine that a loss is possible and the range of the loss can be reasonably determined, then we disclose the range of the possible loss. We regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether an accrual is required, an accrual should be adjusted, or a range of possible loss should be disclosed.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nCredit Losses\nIn June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) issued new authoritative guidance on the accounting for credit losses on most financial assets and certain financial instruments. The standard replaces the incurred loss model with an expected credit loss model for off-balance sheet credit exposures and financial assets measured at amortized cost, including trade accounts receivables and financing receivables. Credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities are required to be recorded through an allowance rather than as a write-down.\nWe adopted this standard in our first quarter of fiscal 2021 using the modified-retrospective approach. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nDebt with Conversion Options\nIn August 2020, the FASB issued new authoritative guidance to simplify the accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of liabilities and equity, including convertible instruments and contracts on an entity\u2019s own equity. The standard reduces the number of models used to account for convertible instruments and simplifies both the classification of debt on the balance sheet and the earnings per share calculation.\nWe intend to early adopt this standard in our first quarter of fiscal 2022 using the modified-retrospective approach, under which, financial results reported in periods prior to fiscal 2022 will not be adjusted. We expect the adoption of this standard to result in a decrease to accumulated deficit of $266.6 million, a decrease to additional paid-in capital of $711.0 million, and an increase to convertible senior notes, net of $444.4 million. Interest expense recognized in future periods will be reduced as a result of accounting for our convertible debt instrument as a single liability measured at its amortized cost.\n- 74 -\n2.

Fair Value Measurements\nWe categorize assets and liabilities recorded or disclosed at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets based upon the level of judgment associated with inputs used to measure their fair value. The categories are as follows:\n\u2022Level 1-Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n\u2022Level 2-Inputs are quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable for the assets or liabilities, either directly or indirectly through market corroboration, for substantially the full term of the financial instruments.\n\u2022Level 3-Inputs are unobservable inputs based on our own assumptions used to measure assets and liabilities at fair value.

The 2019 Notes were converted prior to or settled on the maturity date of July 1, 2019, in accordance with their terms. The 2023 Notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 0.75% per year, payable semi-annually in arrears on January 1 and July 1 of each year, beginning on January 1, 2019. The 2025 Notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 0.375% per year, payable semi-annually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year, beginning on December 1, 2020. Each series of the convertible notes is governed by an indenture between us, as the issuer, and U.S. Bank National Association, as Trustee (individually, each an \u201cIndenture,\u201d and together, the \u201cIndentures\u201d). The Notes of each series are unsecured, unsubordinated obligations and the applicable Indenture governing each series of Notes does not contain any financial covenants or restrictions on the payments of dividends, the incurrence of indebtedness, or the issuance or repurchase of securities by us or any of our subsidiaries. The 2023 Notes and the 2025 Notes mature on July 1, 2023 and June 1, 2025, respectively. We cannot redeem the 2023 Notes prior to maturity. We may redeem for cash all or any portion of the 2025 Notes, at our option, on or after June 5, 2023, and prior to the 31st scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date if the last reported sale price of our common stock has been at least 130% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days during any 30 consecutive trading day period ending on and including the trading day preceding the date on which we provide notice of redemption. The redemption will be at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2025 Notes and adjusted for interest. If we call any or all of the 2025 Notes for redemption, holders may convert such 2025 Notes called for redemption at any time prior to the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the redemption date.\nThe following table presents details of our Notes (number of shares in millions):\nConversion Rate per $1,000 Principal Initial Conversion Price Convertible Date Initial Number of Shares\n2023 Notes 3.7545 $ 266.35 April 1, 2023 6.4\n2025 Notes 3.3602 $ 297.60 March 1, 2025 6.7\nHolders of the Notes may surrender their Notes for conversion at their option at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding their respective convertible dates only under the following circumstances:\n\u2022during any fiscal quarter commencing after the fiscal quarters ending on October 31, 2018 and October 31, 2020 for the 2023 Notes and the 2025 Notes, respectively (and only during such fiscal quarter), if the last reported sale price of our common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the applicable conversion price for the respective Notes on each applicable trading day (the \u201csale price condition\u201d);\n\u2022during the five business day period after any five consecutive trading day period (the \u201cmeasurement period\u201d) in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of the applicable series of Notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of our common stock and the applicable conversion rate for the respective Notes on each such trading day; or\n\u2022upon the occurrence of specified corporate events.\nOn or after the respective convertible date, holders may surrender all or any portion of their Notes for conversion at any time prior to the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the applicable maturity date regardless of the foregoing conditions, and such conversions will be settled upon the applicable maturity date. Upon conversion, holders of the Notes of a series will receive cash equal to the aggregate principal amount of the Notes of such series to be converted, and, at our election, cash and/or shares of our common stock for any amounts in excess of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes of such series being converted.\nThe conversion price will be subject to adjustment in some events. Holders of the Notes of a series who convert their Notes of such series in connection with certain corporate events that constitute a \u201cmake-whole fundamental change\u201d under the applicable Indenture are, under certain circumstances, entitled to an increase in the conversion rate for such series of Notes. Additionally, upon the occurrence of a corporate event that constitutes a \u201cfundamental change\u201d under the applicable Indenture, holders of the Notes of such series may require us to repurchase for cash all or a portion of the Notes of such series at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes of such series plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date.\nThe sale price condition was met for the 2023 Notes during the fiscal quarter ended July 31, 2021, and as a result, holders may convert their 2023 Notes at any time during the fiscal quarter ending October 31, 2021. Accordingly, the net carrying amount of the 2023 Notes was reclassified into current liabilities and the portion of the equity component representing the conversion option was reclassified into temporary equity in our consolidated balance sheet as of July 31, 2021.\n- 87 -\nThe sale price condition was not met for the 2025 Notes during the fiscal quarters ended July 31, 2021 or July 31, 2020, and was not met for the 2023 Notes during the fiscal quarter ended July 31, 2020. Since the 2025 Notes for both periods and the 2023 Notes as of July 31, 2020 were not convertible, the associated net carrying amount was classified as a long-term liability and the equity component was included in additional paid-in capital in our consolidated balance sheets.\nDuring the year ended July 31, 2019, we repaid $575.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2019 Notes and issued 2.5 million shares of common stock to the holders of the 2019 Notes for the conversion value in excess of the principal amount. These shares were fully offset by shares received from the corresponding exercise of the associated note hedges.\nThe following table sets forth the components of the Notes as of July 31, 2021 and July 31, 2020 (in millions):\nJuly 31, 2021 July 31, 2020\n2023 Notes 2025 Notes Total 2023 Notes 2025 Notes Total\nLiability component:\nPrincipal $ 1,692.0 $ 2,000.0 $ 3,692.0 $ 1,693.0 $ 2,000.0 $ 3,693.0\nLess: debt discount and debt issuance costs, net of amortization (134.1) (331.9) (466.0) (200.0) (408.9) (608.9)\nNet carrying amount $ 1,557.9 $ 1,668.1 $ 3,226.0 $ 1,493.0 $ 1,591.1 $ 3,084.1\nEquity component (including amounts classified as temporary equity) $ 315.0 $ 403.0 $ 718.0 $ 315.0 $ 403.0 $ 718.0\nThe total estimated fair value of the Notes was $5.5 billion and $4.1 billion at July 31, 2021 and July 31, 2020, respectively. The fair value was determined based on the closing trading price per $100 of the Notes as of the last day of trading for the period. We consider the fair value of the Notes at July 31, 2021 and July 31, 2020 to be a Level 2 measurement. The fair value of the Notes is primarily affected by the trading price of our common stock and market interest rates. Based on the closing price of our common stock on July 31, 2021, the if-converted values of the 2023 Notes and 2025 Notes exceeded their principal amounts by $754.4 million and $587.8 million, respectively.\nThe following table sets forth interest expense recognized related to our convertible senior notes (dollars in millions):\nYear Ended July 31, 2021 Year Ended July 31, 2020 Year Ended July 31, 2019\n2023 Notes 2025 Notes Total 2023 Notes 2025 Notes Total 2019 Notes 2023 Notes Total\nContractual interest expense $ 12.7 $ 7.5 $ 20.2 $ 12.7 $ 1.1 $ 13.8 $ - $ 12.7 $ 12.7\nAmortization of debt discount 63.5 74.3 137.8 60.9 10.5 71.4 8.7 58.5 67.2\nAmortization of debt issuance costs 2.3 2.8 5.1 2.1 0.4 2.5 1.1 1.9 3.0\nTotal interest expense recognized $ 78.5 $ 84.6 $ 163.1 $ 75.7 $ 12.0 $ 87.7 $ 9.8 $ 73.1 $ 82.9\nEffective interest rate of the liability component 5.2 % 5.4 % 5.2 % 5.4 % 4.8 % 5.2 %\nNote Hedges\nTo minimize the impact of potential economic dilution upon conversion of our convertible senior notes, we entered into separate convertible note hedge transactions (the \u201c2019 Note Hedges,\u201d with respect to the 2019 Notes, the \u201c2023 Note Hedges,\u201d with respect to the 2023 Notes, the \u201c2025 Note Hedges,\u201d with respect to the 2025 Notes and the 2023 Notes Hedgers together with 2025 Note Hedges, the \u201cNote Hedges\u201d) with respect to our common stock concurrent with the issuance of each series of our convertible senior notes. Upon the settlement of the 2019 Notes, we exercised the corresponding portion of our 2019 Note Hedges during the year ended July 31, 2019 and received shares of our common stock that fully offset the shares issued in excess of the principal amount of the converted 2019 Notes. The 2019 Note Hedges expired upon maturity of the 2019 Notes.\nThe following table presents details of our Note Hedges (in millions):\nInitial Number of Shares Aggregate Purchase\n2023 Note Hedges 6.4 $ 332.0\n2025 Note Hedges 6.7 $ 370.8\nThe Note Hedges cover shares of our common stock at a strike price per share that corresponds to the initial applicable conversion price of the applicable series of Notes, which are also subject to adjustment, and are exercisable upon conversion of the applicable series of the Notes. The Note Hedges will expire upon maturity of the applicable series of Notes. The Note Hedges are separate transactions and are not part of the terms of the applicable series of the Notes. Holders of the Notes of either series will not have any rights with respect to the Note Hedges. Any shares of our common stock receivable by us under the Note Hedges are\n- 88 -\nexcluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share as they are antidilutive. The aggregate amounts paid for the Note Hedges are included in additional paid-in capital in our consolidated balance sheets.\nWarrants\nSeparately, but concurrently with the issuance of each series of our convertible senior notes, we entered into transactions whereby we sold warrants (the \u201c2019 Warrants,\u201d with respect to the 2019 Notes, the \u201c2023 Warrants,\u201d with respect to the 2023 Notes, the \u201c2025 Warrants,\u201d with respect to the 2025 Notes, and the 2023 Warrants together with the 2025 Warrants, the \u201cWarrants\u201d) to acquire shares of our common stock, subject to anti-dilution adjustments. During the year ended July 31, 2020, we net settled all 2019 Warrants with 2.0 million shares or $462.0 million in fair value of our common stock. The 2023 Warrants and 2025 Warrants are exercisable beginning October 2023 and September 2025, respectively.\nThe following table presents details of our Warrants (in millions, except per share data):\nInitial Number of Shares Strike Price per Share Aggregate Proceeds\n2023 Warrants 6.4 $ 417.80 $ 145.4\n2025 Warrants 6.7 $ 408.47 $ 202.8\nThe shares issuable under the Warrants will be included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share when the average market value per share of our common stock for the reporting period exceeds the applicable strike price for such series of Warrants. The Warrants are separate transactions and are not part of either series of Notes or Note Hedges and are not remeasured through earnings each reporting period. Holders of the Notes of either series will not have any rights with respect to the Warrants. The aggregate proceeds received from the sale of the Warrants are included in additional paid-in capital in our consolidated balance sheets.\nRevolving Credit Facility\nOn September 4, 2018, we entered into a credit agreement (the \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d) with certain institutional lenders that provides for a $400.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility (the \u201cCredit Facility\u201d), with an option to increase the amount of the Credit Facility by up to an additional $350.0 million, subject to certain conditions. The Credit Facility matures on the earlier of (i) September 4, 2023 and (ii) the date that is 91 days prior to the stated maturity of our 2023 Notes if (a) any of the 2023 Notes are still outstanding and (b) our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents are less than the then outstanding principal amount of our 2023 Notes plus $400.0 million.\nThe borrowings under the Credit Facility currently bear interest, at our option, at a base rate plus a spread of 0.00% to 0.75%, or an adjusted LIBO Rate plus a spread of 1.00% to 1.75%, in each case with such spread being determined based on our leverage ratio. We are obligated to pay an ongoing commitment fee on undrawn amounts at a rate of 0.125% to 0.250%, depending on our leverage ratio. Regulatory authorities that oversee financial markets have announced that after the end of 2021, they would no longer compel banks currently reporting information used to set the LIBO Rate to continue to make rate submissions. As a result, it is possible that beginning in 2022, the LIBO Rate will no longer be available as a reference rate. Under the terms of our Credit Facility, in the event of the discontinuance of the LIBO Rate, a mutually agreed-upon alternative benchmark rate will be established to replace the LIBO Rate, which may include the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d). We do not anticipate that the discontinuance of the LIBO Rate will materially impact our liquidity or financial position.\nAs of July 31, 2021, there were no amounts outstanding, and we were in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Agreement.\n11. Leases\nWe have entered into various non-cancelable operating leases primarily for our facilities with original lease periods expiring through the year ending July 31, 2028, with the most significant leases relating to corporate headquarters in Santa Clara.\nIn May 2015 and October 2015, we entered into a total of three lease agreements for approximately 941,000 square feet of corporate office space in Santa Clara, California, which serves as our current corporate headquarters. The leases contain rent holiday periods, scheduled rent increases, lease incentives, and renewal options which allow the lease terms to be extended beyond their expiration dates of July 2028 through July 2046. Rental payments under the three lease agreements are approximately $412.0 million over the lease term.\nIn September 2012, we entered into two lease agreements for a total of approximately 300,000 square feet of space in Santa Clara, California, which served as our previous corporate headquarters through August 2017, when we relocated to our current corporate campus. The leases contain rent holiday periods and two separate five-year options to extend the lease term beyond their expiration dates of July 2023. Rental payments under these lease agreements are approximately $94.3 million over the lease term. In August 2017, we exited our previous corporate headquarter facilities and relocated to our new corporate campus, which resulted in the recognition of a cease-use loss of $39.2 million during the year ended July 31, 2018. Due to changes in market conditions, and the resulting changes to the amount and timing of estimated cash flows from sublease rentals that could be reasonably obtained, we recognized an additional cease-use loss of $7.0 million as general and administrative expense in our consolidated statements of operations during the year ended July 31, 2019. In December 2019, we terminated these leases prior to their expiration date. The early\n- 89 -\ntermination fee is $25.0 million, payable in equal quarterly installments from April 2020 through July 2023. Upon termination, we recorded a decrease of $13.6 million in operating lease liabilities based on the payment schedule of the early termination fee discounted by the incremental borrowing rate for the remaining payment term. We also decreased right-of-use assets by $8.7 million upon surrendering possession of the properties. As a result, during the year ended July 31, 2020, we recorded a gain of $3.1 million net of other related fees of $1.8 million in general and administrative expense in our consolidated statements of operations.\nDuring the years ended July 31, 2021 and July 31, 2020, our net cost for operating leases was $75.2 million and $80.4 million, respectively, primarily consisting of operating lease costs of $59.3 million and $63.5 million, respectively. Our net cost for operating leases also included variable lease costs, short-term lease costs and sublease income in both periods. We recognized rent expense of $43.0 million for the year ended July 31, 2019, prior to our adoption of the new lease guidance.\nThe following tables present additional information for our operating leases (in millions, except for years and percentages):\nYear Ended July 31,\n2021 2020\nOperating cash flows used in payments of operating lease liabilities $ 81.7 $ 78.3\nRight-of-use assets obtained in exchange for new operating lease liabilities $ 48.6 $ 28.4\nJuly 31, 2021 July 31, 2020\nWeighted-average remaining lease term 6.1 years 7.0 years\nWeighted-average discount rate 3.8 % 3.9 %\nThe following table presents maturities of operating lease liabilities as of July 31, 2021 (in millions):\nAmount\nFiscal years ending July 31:\n2022 $ 78.8\n2023 72.6\n2024 61.6\n2025 58.7\n2026 57.4\n2027 and thereafter 97.5\nTotal operating lease payments 426.6\nLess: imputed interest (47.4)\nPresent value of operating lease liabilities $ 379.2\nCurrent portion of operating lease liabilities(1)\n$ 65.8\nLong-term operating lease liabilities $ 313.4\n________________________\n(1) Current portion of operating lease liabilities is included in accrued and other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet.\n12. Commitments and Contingencies\nManufacturing Purchase Commitments\nIn order to reduce manufacturing lead times and plan for adequate supply, we enter into agreements with manufacturing partners and component suppliers to procure inventory based on our demand forecasts. We are committed to minimum or fixed purchases through the year ending July 31, 2026. The following table presents details of the aggregate future purchase commitments under these arrangements excluding obligations under contracts that we can cancel without a significant penalty as of July 31, 2021 (in millions):\nFiscal years ending July 31,\nTotal 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026\nManufacturing purchase commitments\n$ 359.9 $ 219.3 $ 35.6 $ 30.0 $ 35.0 $ 40.0\n- 90 -\nOther Purchase Commitments\nWe have entered into various non-cancelable agreements with certain service providers, under which we are committed to minimum or fixed purchases through the year ending July 31, 2026. The following table presents details of the aggregate future non-cancelable purchase commitments under these agreements as of July 31, 2021 (in millions):\nFiscal years ending July 31,\nTotal 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026\nOther purchase commitments\n$ 1,471.8 $ 32.0 $ 241.3 $ 302.1 $ 345.3 $ 551.1\nMutual Covenant Not to Sue and Release Agreement\nIn January 2020, we executed a Mutual Covenant Not to Sue and Release Agreement for $50.0 million to extend an existing covenant not to sue for seven years. As the primary benefit of the arrangement was attributable to future use, the amount was recorded in other assets on our consolidated balance sheets and is amortized to cost of product revenue in our consolidated statements of operations over the estimated period of benefit of seven years.\nLitigation\nWe are subject to legal proceedings, claims, and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business, including intellectual property litigation. Such matters are subject to many uncertainties and outcomes are not predictable with assurance. We accrue for contingencies when we believe that a loss is probable and that we can reasonably estimate the amount of any such loss.\nTo the extent there is a reasonable possibility that a loss exceeding amounts already recognized may be incurred and the amount of such additional loss would be material, we will either disclose the estimated additional loss or state that such an estimate cannot be made. As of July 31, 2021, we have not recorded any significant accruals for loss contingencies associated with such legal proceedings, determined that an unfavorable outcome is probable or reasonably possible, or determined that the amount or range of any possible loss is reasonably estimable.\nIndemnification\nUnder the indemnification provisions of our standard sales related contracts, we agree to defend our end-customers against third-party claims asserting infringement of certain intellectual property rights, which may include patents, copyrights, trademarks, or trade secrets, and to pay judgments entered on such claims. Our exposure under these indemnification provisions is generally limited to payments made to us for the alleged infringing products over the preceding twelve months under the agreement. However, certain agreements include indemnification provisions that could potentially expose us to losses in excess of these payments. In addition, we indemnify our officers, directors, and certain key employees while they are serving in good faith in their company capacities. To date, we have not recorded any accruals for loss contingencies associated with indemnification claims or determined that an unfavorable outcome is probable or reasonably possible.\n13. Stockholders\u2019 Equity\nShare Repurchase Program\nIn August 2016, our board of directors authorized a $500.0 million share repurchase program and in February 2017 authorized a $500.0 million increase to the repurchase program, bringing the total authorization to $1.0 billion (our \u201coriginal authorization\u201d). This repurchase program expired on December 31, 2018. In February 2019, our board of directors authorized a $1.0 billion share repurchase program and in December 2020 authorized a $700.0 million increase to this share repurchase program, bringing the total authorization to $1.7 billion (our \u201ccurrent authorization\u201d). The expiration date of our current authorization was extended to December 31, 2021, and our repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time. Repurchases may be made at management\u2019s discretion from time to time on the open market, through privately negotiated transactions, transactions structured through investment banking institutions, block purchase techniques, 10b5-1 trading plans, or a combination of the foregoing.\nDuring the year ended July 31, 2019, we repurchased and retired 1.9 million shares of our common stock under our original authorization for an aggregate purchase price of $330.0 million and an average price per share of $177.64, including transaction costs.\nDuring the years ended July 31, 2021 and 2020, we repurchased and retired 4.0 million shares and 0.9 million shares of our common stock under our current authorization for an aggregate purchase price of $1.2 billion and $198.1 million, and an average price per share of $294.87 and $209.12, respectively, including transaction costs. As of July 31, 2021, we have $323.9 million remaining for future share repurchases under our current repurchase authorization. The total price of the shares repurchased and related transaction costs are reflected as a reduction to common stock and additional paid-in capital on our consolidated balance sheets.\nAccelerated Stock Repurchase\nIn February 2020, our board of directors approved the repurchase of $1.0 billion of our common stock through an accelerated share repurchase (\u201cASR\u201d) transaction with a financial institution. This ASR transaction was in addition to our share repurchase program.\n- 91 -\nDuring the fiscal year ended July 31, 2020, we completed the ASR transaction with an aggregate of 5.2 million shares of our common stock repurchased and retired. The total price of the ASR transaction is reflected as a reduction to common stock and additional paid-in capital on our consolidated balance sheet.\n14. Equity Award Plans\nShare-Based Compensation Plans\n2012 Equity Incentive Plan\nOur 2012 Equity Incentive Plan (our \u201c2012 Plan\u201d) was adopted by our board of directors and approved by the stockholders on June 5, 2012 and was effective one business day prior to the effectiveness of our registration statement for our initial public offering (\u201cIPO\u201d). Our 2012 Plan replaced our 2005 Equity Incentive Plan (our \u201c2005 Plan\u201d), which terminated upon the completion of our IPO, however, awards that were outstanding upon termination remained outstanding pursuant to their original terms. Our 2012 Plan provides for the granting of stock options, restricted stock award (\u201cRSA\u201d), restricted stock unit (\u201cRSU\u201d), stock appreciation rights, performance shares (\u201cPSAs\u201d), performance-based stock units (\u201cPSUs\u201d) and performance stock options (\u201cPSOs\u201d) to our employees, directors, and consultants.\nAwards granted under our 2012 Plan vest over the periods determined by the board of directors, generally three to four years from the date of grant, and our options expire no more than ten years after the date of grant. Since our IPO in 2012, awards granted under our 2012 Plan consist primarily of RSUs. Until vested, RSUs do not have the voting and dividend participation rights of common stock and the shares underlying the awards are not considered issued and outstanding.\nWe grant awards with performance conditions (PSAs and PSUs) to certain employees, which vest over a period of one to four years from the date of grant. The actual number of PSAs and PSUs earned and eligible to vest is determined based on the level of achievement against revenue growth, pre-established billings and operating margin goals, or pre-defined individual performance targets for the fiscal year.\nWe have also granted PSOs with both a market condition and a service condition to certain executives. The market condition for PSOs granted in the fiscal years 2018 and 2019 requires the price of our common stock to equal or exceed $297.75, $397.00, $496.25, and $595.50 based on the average closing price for 30 consecutive trading days during the four-, five-, six-, and seven-and-a-half-year periods following the date of grant in fiscal year 2018 and 2019, respectively. The market condition for PSOs granted in the fiscal year 2021 requires the price of our common stock to equal or exceed $397.00, $496.25, $595.50 and $700.00 based on the average closing price for 30 consecutive trading days during the three-, four-, five-, and six-and-a-half-year periods following the date of grant. To the extent that the market condition has been met, one-fourth of the PSOs will vest on the anniversary date of the grant date for such PSOs, subject to continued service. Certain outstanding PSOs may be exercised prior to vesting (\u201cearly exercise\u201d). Shares of common stock issued upon early exercise of the PSOs will be restricted and, at our option, subject to repurchase if the option holder ceases to be a service provider. The maximum contractual term of our PSOs ranged from six and a half years to seven and a half years from the date of grant, depending on vesting period. During the fiscal year ended July 31, 2021, 0.4 million shares of our PSOs vested as the first stock price target for our PSOs granted in fiscal years 2018 and 2019 was satisfied and the service condition was met.\nWe net-share settle equity awards held by certain employees by withholding shares upon vesting to satisfy tax withholding obligations. The shares withheld to satisfy employee tax withholding obligations are returned to our 2012 Plan and will be available for future issuance. Payments for employees\u2019 tax obligations to the tax authorities are recognized as a reduction to additional paid-in capital and reflected as financing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows.\nA total of 21.9 million shares of our common stock are reserved for issuance pursuant to our 2012 Plan as of July 31, 2021. This includes shares that are (i) reserved but unissued under our 2005 Plan on the effective date of our 2012 Plan or (ii) returned to our 2005 Plan as a result of expiration or termination of options. On the first day of each fiscal year, the number of shares in the reserve may be increased by the lesser of (i) 8,000,000 shares, (ii) 4.5% of the outstanding shares of common stock on the last day of our immediately preceding fiscal year, or (iii) such other amount as determined by our board of directors.\n2012 Employee Stock Purchase Plan\nOur 2012 Employee Stock Purchase Plan was adopted by our board of directors and approved by the stockholders on June 5, 2012, and was effective upon completion of our IPO. On August 29, 2017, we amended and restated our 2012 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (our \u201c2012 ESPP\u201d) to extend the length of our offering periods from 6 to 24 months.\nOur 2012 ESPP permits eligible employees to acquire shares of our common stock at 85% of the lower of the fair market value of our common stock on the first trading day of each offering period or on the purchase date. If the fair market value of our common stock on the purchase date is lower than the first trading day of the offering period, the current offering period will be cancelled after purchase and a new 24-month offering period will begin. Under our 2012 ESPP, each 24-month offering period consists of four consecutive 6-month purchase periods, with purchase dates on the first trading day on or after February 28 and August 31 of each year. Participants may purchase shares of common stock through payroll deductions of up to 15% of their eligible compensation, subject to purchase limits of 625 shares per six-month purchase period and $25,000 worth of stock for each calendar year. Shares\n- 92 -\npurchased under our 2012 ESPP during the fiscal years ended July 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 were 0.6 million, 0.6 million and 0.5 million, at an average exercise price of $161.07 per share, $146.90 per share and $128.81 per share respectively.\nA total of 4.6 million shares of our common stock are available for sale under our 2012 ESPP as of July 31, 2021. On the first day of each fiscal year, the number of shares in the reserve may be increased by the lesser of (i) 2,000,000 shares, (ii) 1% of the outstanding shares of our common stock on the first day of the fiscal year, or (iii) such other amount as determined by our board of directors.\nAcquisition-related Activities\nAssumed Share-based Compensation Plans\nIn connection with our acquisitions of Bridgecrew, Expanse, Sinefa and Crypsis during the year ended July 31, 2021, we assumed the Bridgecrew, Inc. 2019 Stock Incentive Plan, the Expanse Holding Company, Inc.

The fair value of RSUs, PSUs, RSAs, and PSAs is based on the closing market price of our common stock on the date of grant.\nThe fair value of PSOs is estimated on the grant date using a Monte Carlo simulation model, which predicts settlement of the options midway between the vesting term and the contractual term. No PSOs were granted during the year ended July 31, 2020. The following table summarizes the assumptions used and the resulting grant-date fair values of our PSOs granted during the years ended July 31, 2021 and 2019:\nYear Ended July 31,\n2021 2019\nVolatility\n35.9 % 35.6% - 36.5%\nDividend yield\n-% - %\nRisk-free interest rate\n0.6 % 3.1% - 3.2%\nWeighted-average grant-date fair value per share $ 82.12 $ 59.11\nThe expected volatility is based on a combination of implied volatility from traded options on our common stock and the historical volatility of our common stock. The dividend yield assumption is based on our current expectations about our anticipated dividend policy. The risk-free interest rate is based on the implied yield available on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with terms equal to the contractual terms of each tranche.\nThe fair value of shares issued under our 2012 ESPP are estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.

The expected term represents the term from the first day of the offering period to the purchase dates within each offering period. The dividend yield assumption is based on our expectations about our anticipated dividend\n- 96 -\npolicy. The risk-free interest rate is based on the implied yield available on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with maturities that approximate the expected term.\nThe following table summarizes share-based compensation included in costs and expenses (in millions):\nYear Ended July 31,\n2021 2020 2019\nCost of product revenue\n$ 6.2 $ 5.7 $ 5.6\nCost of subscription and support revenue\n93.0 77.7 71.3\nResearch and development\n428.9 274.6 186.8\nSales and marketing\n269.9 214.5 221.9\nGeneral and administrative\n128.9 92.0 102.1\nTotal share-based compensation $ 926.9 $ 664.5 $ 587.7\nDuring the year ended July 31, 2021, we accelerated the vesting of certain equity awards in connection with our acquisitions of Bridgecrew, Expanse, Sinefa and Crypsis and recorded $9.8 million, $5.7 million, $9.8 million and $7.1 million, respectively. During the year ended July 31, 2020, we accelerated the vesting of certain equity awards in connection with our acquisitions of Zingbox, Aporeto and CloudGenix and recorded $1.3 million, $4.4 million and $0.3 million, respectively, and during the year ended July 31, 2019, we accelerated the vesting of certain equity awards in connection with our acquisitions of RedLock and Twistlock and recorded $14.2 million and $5.8 million, respectively, of share-based compensation within general and administrative expense.\nAs of July 31, 2021, total compensation cost related to unvested share-based awards not yet recognized was $2.0 billion. This cost is expected to be amortized over a weighted-average period of approximately 2.6 years. Future grants will increase the amount of compensation expense to be recorded in these periods.\n15. Income Taxes\nThe following table presents the components of income (loss) before income taxes (in millions):\nYear Ended July 31,\n2021 2020 2019\nUnited States $ (482.2) $ (56.1) $ (198.1)\nForeign 17.2 (175.7) 123.5\nTotal $ (465.0) $ (231.8) $ (74.6)\nThe following table summarizes our provision for income taxes (in millions):\nYear Ended July 31,\n2021 2020 2019\nFederal:\nCurrent $ 3.3 $ 3.8 $ (1.3)\nDeferred (5.9) (1.3) (11.3)\nState:\nCurrent 1.7 1.3 (0.9)\nDeferred 0.1 0.1 (3.0)\nForeign:\nCurrent 41.3 39.2 27.5\nDeferred (6.6) (7.9) (3.7)\nTotal $ 33.9 $ 35.2 $ 7.3\nFor the year ended July 31, 2021, our provision for income taxes decreased slightly compared to the year ended July 31, 2020, primarily due to tax benefits from changes in our valuation allowances.\nFor the year ended July 31, 2020, our provision for income taxes increased compared to the year ended July 31, 2019, primarily due to an increase in foreign income as a result of increased business operations and withholding taxes from an increase in billings in the relevant jurisdictions. We also had a change in our valuation allowance related to acquisitions completed during fiscal 2019.\n- 97 -\nThe following table presents the items accounting for the difference between income taxes computed at the federal statutory income tax rate and our provision for income taxes:\nYear Ended July 31,\n2021 2020 2019\nFederal statutory rate 21.0 % 21.0 % 21.0 %\nEffect of:\nState taxes, net of federal tax benefit 1.3 3.0 7.9\nEffects of non-U.S. operations (3.1) 667.5 89.3\nChange in valuation allowance (40.7) (714.1) (196.9)\nEffect of U.S. tax law change - - 0.6\nShare-based compensation 5.0 (5.1) 44.9\nTax credits 9.9 17.9 35.0\nNon-deductible expenses (1.3) (3.9) (11.5)\nOther, net 0.6 (1.5) (0.1)\nTotal (7.3) % (15.2) % (9.8) %\nIn fiscal 2020, we transferred certain intellectual property rights to a wholly owned United Kingdom subsidiary, primarily to align our legal structure to our evolving operations. The tax benefit from an increase in the tax basis of intellectual property rights resulted in an increase in effects of non-U.S. operations and was fully offset by a full valuation.\nThe following table presents the components of our deferred tax assets and liabilities as of July 31, 2021 and July 31, 2020 (in millions):\nJuly 31,\n2021 2020\nDeferred tax assets:\nAccruals and reserves $ 125.0 $ 116.5\nDeferred revenue 364.9 272.5\nNet operating loss carryforwards 575.9 348.0\nTax credits 230.8 179.6\nShare-based compensation 53.9 33.7\nFixed assets and intangible assets 1,789.6 1,458.8\nGross deferred tax assets 3,140.1 2,409.1\nValuation allowance (2,933.3) (2,240.4)\nTotal deferred tax assets 206.8 168.7\nDeferred tax liabilities:\nDeferred commissions (165.4) (130.8)\nOther deferred tax liabilities (32.3) (28.9)\nTotal deferred tax liabilities (197.7) (159.7)\nNet deferred tax assets $ 9.1 $ 9.0\nOur increase in deferred tax assets relating to net operating losses and fixed assets and intangible assets is largely due to an impact from the United Kingdom tax rate increase from 19% to 25% effective April 1, 2023. As of July 31, 2021, it is not more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will be realizable, and therefore, are offset by a full valuation allowance.\nA valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized. Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon future taxable income, if any, the amount and timing of which are uncertain. At such time, if it is determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets are realizable, the valuation allowance will be adjusted. As of July 31, 2021, we have provided a valuation allowance for our federal, state, United Kingdom and certain other foreign deferred tax assets that we believe will, more likely than not, be unrealizable. The net valuation allowance increased by $0.7 billion from the year\n- 98 -\nended July 31, 2020 to the year ended July 31, 2021, primarily due to a change in the United Kingdom tax rate as discussed above and an increase in our operations.\nAs of July 31, 2021, we had federal, state, and foreign NOL carryforwards of approximately $1.8 billion, $0.9 billion, and $1.1 billion, respectively, as reported on our tax returns, available to reduce future taxable income, if any. If not utilized, our federal and state NOL carryforwards will expire in various amounts at various dates beginning in the years ending July 31, 2034 and July 31, 2022, respectively. Our foreign NOL will carry forward indefinitely.\nAs of July 31, 2021, we had federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately $172.8 million and $144.7 million, respectively, as reported on our tax returns. If not utilized, the federal credit carryforwards will expire in various amounts at various dates beginning in the year ending July 31, 2026. The state credit will carry forward indefinitely.\nAs of July 31, 2021, we had foreign tax credit carryforwards of $3.6 million as reported on our tax returns. If not utilized, the foreign tax credit carryforwards will expire in various amounts at various dates beginning in the year ending July 31, 2022.\nUtilization of the NOL carryforwards and credits may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations provided by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and similar state provisions. The annual limitation may result in the expiration of NOLs and credits before utilization.\nAs of July 31, 2021, we had $372.9 million of unrecognized tax benefits, $68.7 million of which would affect income tax expense if recognized, after consideration of our valuation allowance in the United States and other assets. As of July 31, 2020, we had $326.4 million of unrecognized tax benefits, $63.9 million of which would affect income tax expense if recognized, after consideration of our valuation allowance in the United States and other assets. As of July 31, 2021, our federal, state, and foreign returns for the tax years 2009 through the current period remain subject to adjustment due to current and future examinations. Fiscal years outside the normal statute of limitation remain open to audit by tax authorities due to tax attributes generated in earlier years, which have been carried forward and may be audited in subsequent years when utilized. We do not expect the amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of July 31, 2021 to change significantly over the next 12 months. We recognize both interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense. During the years ended July 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, we recognized income tax expense related to interest and penalties of $3.5 million, $1.6 million, and $2.3 million, respectively. We had accrued interest and penalties on our consolidated balance sheets related to unrecognized tax benefits of $15.7 million and $12.2 million as of July 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The ultimate amount and timing of any future cash settlements cannot be predicted with reasonable certainty.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of our gross unrecognized tax benefits (in millions):\nYear Ended July 31,\n2021 2020 2019\nUnrecognized tax benefits at the beginning of the period $ 326.4 $ 314.5 $ 337.7\nAdditions for tax positions taken in prior years 26.5 3.2 0.3\nReductions for tax positions taken in prior years (2.5) (1.6) (33.4)\nAdditions for tax positions taken in the current year 22.5 10.3 9.9\nUnrecognized tax benefits at the end of the period $ 372.9 $ 326.4 $ 314.5\nDuring the year ended July 31, 2021, our additions for tax positions taken in the given year were primarily attributable to uncertain tax positions related to tax credits.\nDuring the year ended July 31, 2020 and July 31, 2019, our additions for tax positions taken in the given year were primarily attributable to intercompany transactions.\nAs of July 31, 2021, we had no unremitted earnings when evaluating our outside basis difference relating to our U.S. investment in foreign subsidiaries. However, there could be local withholding taxes payable due to various foreign countries if certain lower tier earnings are distributed. Withholding taxes that would be payable upon remittance of these lower tier earnings are not material.\n16.

Employee Benefit Plan\nWe have established a 401(k) tax-deferred savings plan which permits participants to make contributions by salary deduction pursuant to Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. We make matching contributions based upon the amount of employees\u2019 contributions, subject to certain limitations. Our matching contributions to the plan were immaterial for the years ended July 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019.\n19. Segment Information\nWe conduct business globally and are primarily managed on a geographic theater basis. Our chief operating decision maker reviews financial information presented on a consolidated basis accompanied by information about revenue by geographic region for purposes of allocating resources and evaluating financial performance. We have one business activity and there are no segment managers who are held accountable for operations, operating results, and plans for levels, components, or types of products or services below the consolidated unit level. Accordingly, we are considered to be in a single reportable segment and operating unit structure.\n- 100 -\nThe following table presents our long-lived assets, which consist of property and equipment, net and operating lease right-of-use assets, by geographic region (in millions):\nYear Ended July 31,\n2021 2020\nLong-lived assets:\nUnited States $ 461.1 $ 502.3\nIsrael 61.9 52.1\nOther countries 58.3 52.4\nTotal long-lived assets $ 581.3 $ 606.8\nRefer to Note 2.

Related Party Transactions\nCertain members of our board of directors are affiliated with Greylock Partners (\u201cGreylock\u201d), a venture capital firm. Entities affiliated with Greylock owned a portion of the outstanding shares of Demisto immediately prior to completion of our acquisition of Demisto on March 28, 2019 and, as a result, received purchase consideration valued at $85.6 million during the year ended July 31, 2019. Refer to Note 7. Acquisitions for more information on our acquisition of Demisto.\n21. Subsequent Events\nShare Repurchase\nOn August 17, 2021, our board of directors authorized a $676.1 million increase to our share repurchase program under the current authorization, bringing the total remaining authorization for future share repurchases to $1.0 billion. Repurchases may be made at management\u2019s discretion from time to time on the open market, through privately negotiated transactions, transactions structured through investment banking institutions, block purchase techniques, 10b5-1 trading plans, or a combination of the foregoing. The repurchase authorization will expire on December 31, 2022, and may be suspended or discontinued at any time.\nBusiness Combination\nOn August 11, 2021, we completed our acquisition of Gamma Networks, Inc. (\u201cGamma\u201d), a privately-held AI powered company, for total consideration of approximately $36 million, subject to adjustment. We expect the acquisition will expand our data loss prevention offerings. We will complete the initial accounting for the acquisition of Gamma, including the allocation of purchase consideration, during our first quarter of fiscal 2022.\n- 101 -",

In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.\nBased on our evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that, as of July 31, 2021, our disclosure controls and procedures are designed at a reasonable assurance level and are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nManagement\u2019s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nFor \u201cManagement\u2019s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\u201d see the report under Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which report is incorporated herein by reference.\nFor the \u201cReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm,\u201d see the report under Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which report is incorporated herein by reference.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nAs a result of COVID-19, most of our workforce has been working from home since March 2020. However there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rule 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act that occurred during the quarter ended July 31, 2021 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.",
