Global manufacturers are facing unprecedented levels of disruption and turbulence. COVID-19, as an example, has accelerated digital transformation. Responding to these changes requires a level of agility that legacy ERP solutions fail to deliver. QAD's Adaptive ERP offers greater fit out of the box, rapid deployment and the ability to easily adapt and extend systems to meet the challenge of accelerating change.\nOur growth strategy is supported by the following key priorities:\nDominate disrupted markets for new cloud customer acquisitions. The accelerating pace of change in our customers\u2019 markets has created a disconnect between their business requirements and what their systems are able to support. Legacy ERP systems were not designed to support today\u2019s rapid pace of change. The QAD Enterprise Platform was designed to provide greater fit and flexibility to meet tomorrow\u2019s requirements. As such, disruption in our customers\u2019 markets becomes a compelling reason for changing their ERP systems and one that we are well positioned to address. We selected three strategic areas with the greatest disruption to actively pursue new customers where we can provide the best product fit. These areas, called Strategic Business Segments, include: Automotive, Life Sciences and Packaging. Over the last several years we have increased our investment in sales, marketing and lead generation activities to facilitate new customer acquisition growth.\nGrow our cloud business and expand our footprint within existing customers. We believe there is substantial opportunity to grow our cloud-based enterprise solutions within our global manufacturing customer base. Our cloud solutions allow our customers to focus on their products and services without the distraction of administering their enterprise applications or maintaining their infrastructure. With approximately 75% of our users currently on-premises, we have many opportunities to increase cloud revenue across our existing installed base by converting our on-premises customers to our cloud-based solution, selling additional modules and users to our existing cloud customers, extending our existing offerings and reducing customer attrition by delivering an excellent customer experience.\nDeliver continuous product development and rapid response to change. Manufacturers are facing a swiftly-changing business environment fueled by exponential growth in underlying technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT), Machine Learning (ML), Artificial Intelligence (AI), Additive Manufacturing (3D Printing), Blockchain, Augmented Reality and Predictive Analytics. Collectively these technologies are driving trends such as digital transformation and smart manufacturing. We believe delivering a focused, flexible ERP system will be increasingly attractive to pragmatic manufacturers seeking a long-term fit of their business systems in support of their digital strategies in changing markets. We are committed to continuous investment in product development, our platform and advanced technologies to ensure our products have the necessary capabilities to meet the needs of our global customers and enhance our competitive position in the vertical markets we serve.\nFocus on global manufacturing and leverage expertise within key vertical markets.

We continue to see the global trend toward electronic invoicing and registration of shipments and invoices with government agencies to prevent falsification and tax evasion expand across the world. We strive to support our customers through these changes without interruption to their businesses using our software to assist them in meeting the legal requirements of the countries in which they do business.\nOur global R&D organization consists of 475 employees primarily located in the United States, Ireland, China, India, Spain, Germany, France, Australia, Belgium, United Kingdom, Indonesia, Poland, and Brazil. We believe that our ability to conduct research and development at various locations throughout the world allows us to optimize product development at lower costs and integrate local market knowledge into our development activities. While our software is primarily developed internally, we also use independent companies and contractors to perform some of our product development activities when we require additional resources or specific skills or knowledge. All outside development is overseen by our internal R&D organization.\nWe also acquire products or technology developed by others, as needed, by purchasing or licensing products and technology from third parties. We continually review these investments in an effort to ensure that we are generating sufficient revenue or gaining enough competitive advantage to justify their costs. We routinely translate our product suite into fourteen languages. Our development focus is on cloud deployments first, hence, some functionality that is available to our cloud customers may not be available to our on-premises customers on the same timeframe, if at all, or may have an additional fee associated with it.\nDIRECT SALES\nQAD sells its products and services through direct and indirect sales channels located throughout the regions of North America, Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA), Asia Pacific and Latin America. Each region leverages global standards and systems to enhance consistency when interacting with global customers. Additionally, we have global account teams and strategic business teams focused on sectors facing the greatest level of disruption where we can provide the greatest product fit.\nThe Company\u2019s direct sales organization includes approximately 68 commissioned salespeople. Supporting our commissioned salespeople are vertical market experts, business development representatives, business consultants, pre-sales employees responsible for leading demonstrations of our software solutions, and customer service representatives supporting our existing customers.\nIncentive pay is a significant portion of the total compensation package for our sales staff. We continually align our sales organization and business strategies with market conditions to maintain an effective sales process. We cultivate the industries we serve within each territory through marketing, local product development and sales training.\nMARKETING\nThe QAD marketing strategy is to differentiate our offerings by focusing on our role in enabling manufacturers to overcome the change and uncertainty they face and to support them in achieving the vision of the Adaptive Manufacturing Enterprise. We do this by highlighting QAD\u2019s next generation Adaptive ERP and its five rapid response technologies that deliver greater fit for today and the flexibility to meet tomorrow\u2019s business requirements.\nWe target sectors within our primary verticals facing the greatest disruption, where we can provide the best fit and support those companies with the greatest need.\nOur main marketing objectives are to leverage the measurable success in business outcomes our customers have achieved and highlight hidden costs prospects may face with legacy ERP, to increase awareness and drive leads in target sectors. We do this by openly and consistently communicating with QAD customers, prospects, partners, investors and other key audiences. Our primary marketing activities include:\n\u25cf\nAccount based marketing (ABM) for targeting, assessing buying intent, and display advertising\n\u25cf\nInfluencer Press and industry analyst relations to garner third-party validation and generate positive coverage for our company offerings and value proposition\n\u25cf\nPhysical and virtual user conferences and events, such as Explore, as well as participation in other industry events, to create customer and prospect awareness\n\u25cf\nContent marketing and engagement on social channels like Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and YouTube\n\u25cf\nSearch engine optimization and focused retargeting\n\u25cf\nWebsite development to engage and educate prospects and generate interest through a deep understanding of the challenges manufactures face and how our solutions can help to overcome them\n\u25cf\nCase studies, white papers, and marketing collateral\n\u25cf\nCustomer testimonials, references, and referrals\n\u25cf\nSales tools and field marketing events to enable our sales organization to more effectively convert leads into customers\nWe recognize that buying dynamics are changing and we are focused on engaging with prospects early in the sales cycle to help set the buying criteria and specifications in a way that uniquely leads to QAD. We seek to accelerate prospects through the buying journey by demonstrating the value of our products, answering questions and removing roadblocks. A prospect\u2019s successful implementation of enterprise solutions is typically embedded in a larger change management project. The decision to buy enterprise solutions is, in part, based on a prospect\u2019s belief they can be successful in their change management efforts. We are increasing our scope beyond the enterprise solution to increase the prospect\u2019s confidence in their ability to overcome change management challenges in an effort to increase win rates and reduce \u201cno decision\u201d outcomes.\nA critical role of marketing is to bring the voice of the customer into QAD. Vertical and Solutions Marketing work directly with customers and R&D to drive a market-driven roadmap resulting in products that deliver greater value, making them easier to market and sell.\nCorporate Marketing supports our regional and strategic business marketing teams, working closely with their respective business development and sales teams.\nCOMPETITION\nOur business is affected by strong competition from both enterprise software application vendors and cloud computing application services providers. The markets for our offerings are rapidly evolving, highly competitive and are subject to changing technology, shifting customer needs and frequent introductions of new applications. Our customers demand greater performance and reliability with lower complexity. Fit, cost, speed, and flexibility are primary criteria in our customers\u2019 decision-making processes.\nWe compete with large, well-established enterprise application vendors, such as SAP, Oracle and Infor, among others, who hold significant market share in the traditional ERP marketplace. These companies have considerable financial resources and name recognition, and have established broad market solutions by developing applications targeted at many industries, not just manufacturing. Internationally, we face competition from local companies, as well as the large enterprise application competitors, many of which have products tailored for those local markets. Certain modules and functionality included in our ERP offering may also compete with cloud solutions and software companies providing a point solution.\nMost enterprise application vendors today have some focus on cloud solutions, in addition to on-premises sales, which creates an environment in which we face competition from a variety of vendors that address one or more of our applications. As a result, our cloud solutions compete with both large enterprise software vendors and cloud computing application service providers. In addition, other vendors that provide services in different markets may develop solutions in our target markets and some potential customers may elect to develop their own internal solutions.\nWe believe the key competitive factors in our markets are:\n\u25cf\nSolution fit, breadth and functionality\n\u25cf\nFlexibility, integration, security and scalability\n\u25cf\nSpeed and ease of initial deployment and version upgrades\n\u25cf\nTotal cost of ownership\n\u25cf\nPerformance and reliability\n\u25cf\nTechnological innovation and ability to respond to customer needs rapidly\n\u25cf\nReputation of the vendor\n\u25cf\nCustomer satisfaction\nTo continue our market success, we must respond promptly and effectively to technological change and competitors\u2019 innovation. Our ability to remain competitive will depend on our efforts in the areas of product development and sales, services and support operations.\nHUMAN CAPITAL\nAs of January 31, 2021, we had approximately 1,930 full-time employees, including 805 in support, subscription and professional services, 475 in research and development, 375 in sales and marketing and 275 in administration. Generally, our employees are not represented by collective bargaining agreements. However, certain employees in our Dutch, French and Italian subsidiaries are represented by statutory works councils as required under local law. Employees of our Brazilian subsidiary are represented by a collective bargaining agreement with the Data Processing Union.\nOur employees play a central role in the success of our long-term strategy. Our values - Driving for Results, Doing the Right Thing, Extreme Ownership, Commit to the Team, and Challenge the Status Quo - are built on the foundation that our people and the way we treat one another promote inclusion, creativity, innovation and productivity, which drives the company\u2019s success. We are continually investing in our global workforce to further drive inclusion, equity, and diversity. In 2020, we launched QAD\u2019s Inclusion and Diversity program (I&D). As a company, QAD has always endeavored to create a work environment where employees could bring their entire selves to work and perform at their very best. Through our I&D strategy we are formalizing our approach to inclusiveness and building upon our values to ensure we focus on maintaining a high performance culture that maximizes and leverages the unique skills and talents of every employee across our enterprise.\nWe believe we offer fair, competitive compensation and benefits that support our employees\u2019 overall well-being and foster their growth and development. To ensure alignment with our short-term and long-term goals, our compensation programs for employees include base pay, short-term incentives, and opportunities for long-term incentives. We offer a wide array of benefits including comprehensive health and welfare insurance; generous time-off and leave; and retirement programs. We provide emotional, physical, legal and financial well-being services through our Employee Assistance Program. Our emotional well-being support offers help with a wide range of issues including stress management, work/life balance, grief and loss, self-esteem and personal development. In addition, our financial education and financial wellness coaches offer employees tools and resources to reach their personal financial goals.\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented significant changes that we determined were in the best interest of our employees as well as the communities in which we operate. These changes include having the vast majority of our employees work from home until the pandemic eases, while implementing additional safety measures for employees continuing critical on-site work during the pandemic. We have also added several company-wide paid days off and caregiving support to help employees balance their work and life responsibilities.\nINTELLECTUAL PROPERTY\nWe rely on a combination of trademark, copyright, trade secret and patent laws in the United States and other jurisdictions, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology and our brands and we maintain programs to protect and grow our rights. We also enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements with our employees, consultants and other third parties and control access to software, services, documentation and other proprietary information.\nSEASONALITY\nOur fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business and maintenance renewals. For a more detailed discussion, see the \u201cSeasonal Nature of Deferred Revenue, Accounts Receivable and Operating Cash Flow\u201d discussion in Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis.\nSEGMENT REPORTING\nWe operate in a single reporting segment. Geographical financial information for fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019 is presented in Note 15 within the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nAVAILABLE INFORMATION\nOur Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and amendments filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, are available free of charge on our website at www.qad.com, as soon as reasonably practicable after such reports have been electronically filed or otherwise furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission.

    "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThe environment in which we operate involves significant risks and is subject to factors beyond our control. You should consider the risk factors described below before investing in our stock as such risks may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition and could cause the price of our stock to decline. Please note that the risk factors described below are not exhaustive.\nRisks Related to Our Company\nA significant portion of our revenue is derived from subscription and maintenance renewals with our existing customers.\nSubscription and maintenance renewals are at the customer\u2019s discretion, and customers may elect not to renew or renew at a lower annual renewal value than the prior year. Further, it is our strategy to convert existing customers to our cloud services offering, which, if successful, will reduce maintenance revenue. If our existing customers discontinue maintenance or subscription to a significant degree, our revenues and results of operations will be adversely affected. Our cloud customers have the option to renew a lower number of users and/or a reduced number of modules which would also have a negative impact on revenue and results of operations.\nWe have risks regarding our pricing and pricing models.\nWe are occasionally obliged to offer deep discounts and other favorable terms in order to match or exceed the product and service offerings of our competitors. Furthermore, we may be faced with general downward pricing pressure from competitors and the market in the future. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic caused downward pricing pressure from customers requesting additional discounts or other pricing concessions. If we do not adapt our pricing models to reflect changes in customer demand resulting from rapid technological advances, such as those leading to alternative hosting and cloud service delivery offerings, our revenues could decrease. For example, if customer software usage evolves in ways that maintain or increase the value they derive from our products while decreasing traditional licensing metrics, such as individual users, and if we do not adjust our pricing models accordingly, then our revenues could decrease. Further, broad-based changes to our pricing models could adversely affect our revenues and operating results if our sales force is not able to successfully sell the new pricing models to new customers or transition existing customers to the new pricing models effectively. Failed pricing models and our inability to establish or maintain standalone selling prices (SSP) may result in negative revenue recognition impacts.\nRisks associated with our solutions.\nOur solutions, including licensed software, cloud services and other services, may contain defects, including security flaws, especially when first introduced or when new versions are released. The detection and correction of defects can be time consuming and costly. Defects in our solutions, including licensed third-party software, could affect our products\u2019 compatibility with other hardware or software products. Defects could delay the development or release of new products or new versions of products and could adversely affect market acceptance of our products and our ability to conduct our cloud operations. Defects may also impair our ability to complete services implementations on time and within budget. Customers who rely on our solutions for applications that are critical to their businesses may have a greater sensitivity to such defects than customers for software products generally. Defects could expose us to product liability, performance and warranty claims as well as harm our reputation, which could adversely impact our future sales and operating results.\nWe are dependent on Progress Software Corporation.\nThe majority of QAD Adaptive Applications are written in a programming language that is proprietary to Progress Software Corporation (or Progress). QAD Adaptive Applications do not run within programming environments other than Progress and therefore our customers must acquire rights to Progress software in order to use QAD Adaptive Applications. We have an agreement with Progress under which Progress licenses us to distribute and use Progress software related to our products. This agreement remains in effect unless terminated either by a written ten-year advance notice or due to a material breach that is not remedied. If Progress were to provide notice that it was terminating its agreement with us, this could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects.\nOur success is also dependent upon Progress continuing to develop, support and enhance its programming language, its toolset and its database, as well as the continued market acceptance of Progress products. A change in Progress\u2019 control, management or direction may adversely impact our relationship with Progress and our ability to rely on Progress products in our business. We have in the past, and may in the future, experience product release delays because of delays in the release of Progress products or product enhancements. Any of these delays could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are dependent on other third-party suppliers.\nWe resell certain software which we license from third parties other than Progress. There can be no assurance that these third-party software arrangements and licenses will continue to be available to us on terms that provide us with the third-party software we require or provide adequate functionality with our products on terms that adequately protect our proprietary rights or are commercially favorable to us.\nCertain QAD Adaptive Applications are developed using embedded programming tools from Microsoft and Sun Microsystems (owned by our competitor Oracle) for the Microsoft .NET framework and Java Programming environments, respectively. We rely on these environments\u2019 continued compatibility with customers\u2019 desktop and server operating systems. In the event that this compatibility is limited, some of our customers may not be able to easily upgrade their QAD software. If the present method of licensing the .NET framework as part of Microsoft\u2019s Desktop Operating systems is changed and a separate price were applied to the .NET framework, our expenses could increase substantially. Similarly, if Oracle decided to charge fees or otherwise change the historical licensing terms for Java technology, our expenses could increase substantially. For both of the .Net and Java elements, we rely on market acceptance and maintenance of these environments and we may be adversely affected if these were withdrawn or superseded in the market.\nOur partner agreements, including development, product acquisition and reseller agreements, contain confidentiality, indemnity and non-disclosure provisions for the third party and end user. Failure to establish or maintain successful relationships with these third parties or failure of these parties to develop and support their software, provide appropriate services and fulfill confidentiality, indemnity and non-disclosure obligations could have an adverse effect on us. We have been in the past, and expect to be in the future, party to disputes about ownership, license scope and royalty or fee terms with respect to intellectual property. Failure to prevail in any such dispute could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe market in which we participate is highly competitive and if we do not compete effectively our operating results could be harmed.\nThe market for enterprise software solutions is highly competitive and subject to changing technology, shifting customer needs and introductions of new products and services. Many of our current and potential competitors enjoy substantial competitive advantages, such as greater name recognition, larger marketing budgets and substantially greater financial, technical and other resources, or enjoy advantages from narrower niche or point solution focus. Any of these competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or changing opportunities, technologies and market trends, and devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products. Our competitors may also offer extended payment terms or price reductions for their products and services, either of which could materially and adversely affect our ability to compete successfully. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors or that the competitive pressures that we may face will not materially adversely affect our business, revenue and results of operations.\nWe are dependent upon achieving success in certain concentrated markets.\nWe have made a strategic decision to concentrate our product development, as well as our sales and marketing efforts, in certain manufacturing verticals: automotive, life sciences, consumer products, food and beverage, high technology and industrial products. We also concentrate our efforts on certain geographies, where costs to expand our market or stay in compliance with local requirements could be extensive and require a large amount of resources. An important element of our strategy is the achievement of technological and market leadership recognition for our software products in these manufacturing verticals and geographies. The failure of our products to achieve or maintain substantial market acceptance in one or more of these verticals or geographies could have an adverse effect on us. If any of these targeted verticals or geographies experience a material slowdown or reduced growth, those conditions may adversely affect the demand for our products and have a more pronounced adverse impact on our revenue compared to competitors who sell products to many industries beyond manufacturing across many geographies.\nRisks associated with acquisitions we may make.\nAs part of our business strategy, we have made, and expect to continue to make, acquisitions of businesses or investments in companies that offer complementary products, services and technologies or expand our geographical presence. Such acquisitions or investments involve a number of risks which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results. Such risks include failing to efficiently integrate the new business and failing to realize the benefits anticipated from the acquisition.\nIn addition such acquisitions may cause our future quarterly financial results to fluctuate due to costs related to an acquisition, such as the elimination of redundant expenses or write-offs of impaired assets recorded in connection with acquisitions. Also, consideration paid for any future acquisitions could include our stock. As a result, future acquisitions could cause dilution to existing stockholders and to earnings per share, though the likelihood of voting dilution is limited by the ability of the Company to use low-voting Class A common stock as consideration for potential acquisitions. Furthermore, we may incur significant debt to pay for future acquisitions or investments or our use of cash to pay for acquisitions may limit other potential uses of our cash, including stock repurchases, dividend payments and retirement of outstanding indebtedness.\nOur operations are international in scope, exposing us to additional risk.\nWe derive about half of our total revenue from sales outside the United States. A significant aspect of our strategy is to focus on developing business in foreign and emerging markets. Our operating results could be negatively impacted by a variety of factors affecting our foreign operations, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include currency fluctuations, economic, political or regulatory conditions in a specific country or region, trade protection measures and other regulatory requirements. Additional risks inherent in international business activities generally include, among others:\n\u25cf\nLonger accounts receivable collection cycles;\n\u25cf\nCosts and difficulties of managing international operations and alliances;\n\u25cf\nGreater difficulty enforcing intellectual property rights;\n\u25cf\nImport or export requirements;\n\u25cf\nUncertainty related to the Brexit withdrawal could disrupt the sale of our products and services and the movement of our people between the United Kingdom and the European Union;\n\u25cf\nCompliance with multiple, conflicting, ambiguous or evolving governmental laws and regulations, including employment, tax, privacy, anti-corruption, import/export, antitrust, data transfer, storage and protection, and industry-specific laws and regulations, including rules related to compliance by our third-party resellers and our ability to identify and respond timely to compliance issues when they occur;\n\u25cf\nOperating in geographies with a higher inherent risk of corruption, which could adversely affect our ability to maintain compliance with domestic and international laws, including, but not limited to, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-corruption laws; and\n\u25cf\nOther factors beyond our control, such as terrorism, war, natural disasters and pandemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic.\nRisks Related to Our Industry\nDefects and disruptions in our services could diminish demand for our services and subject us to liability.\nOur cloud service offerings are complex and incorporate a variety of hardware, network infrastructure and proprietary and third-party software, and may have errors or defects that could result in unanticipated downtime and disruptions for our customers and harm to our reputation and our business. We have from time to time found defects in our services and new defects may be discovered in the future, especially in connection with the integration of new technologies and the introduction of new services. As a result, we could lose future sales and existing customers could elect to cancel or make warranty or other claims against us and potentially expose us to the expense and risk of litigation.\nOur revenue and profitability will be adversely affected if we do not properly manage our cloud service offerings.\nWe expend significant resources to improve the reliability and security of our cloud offerings and the cost of these investments could reduce our revenue and profitability. The pricing and other terms of some of our cloud agreements require us to make estimates and assumptions at the time we enter into these contracts that could differ from actual results. Early termination, increased costs or unanticipated delays could have an adverse effect on our profit margin and generate negative cash flow. Further, if we experience delays in implementing new cloud customers (whether due to product defects, system complexities or other factors) then customers may request discounts or other concessions, delay the deployment of additional users and sites, or decide to not go live and cancel their subscription after the initial term; all of which could adversely affect our revenue growth. If we fail to meet our system availability commitments or other customer obligations then we may be required to give credits or refund fees, and we may be subject to litigation and loss of customer business. For example, if we were to miss our system availability commitments then we are obligated under our standard customer contracts to issue one day\u2019s credit against future fees for each hour of system unavailability.\nOur subscription retention and net dollar retention rates are dependent upon a number of factors that may impact our ability to accurately predict growth in our cloud business.\nOur cloud customers typically enter into subscription agreements with an initial term of 24 to 60 months. Our customers have no obligation to renew their subscriptions after the expiration of their initial subscription period, and some customers may elect (for a variety of reasons, including a business downturn) not to renew, or may elect to renew a lower number of users or modules. Growth in our cloud business may be affected by our inability to maintain high retention rates and sell additional features and services to our current customers, which could depend on a number of factors, including customers\u2019 satisfaction with our products and services, the prices of our offerings and general economic conditions. Growth of our cloud business is also contingent on the growth in our customers\u2019 businesses and downturns in our customers\u2019 businesses will negatively impact our revenue as customers lower the number of users. Specifically, with the COVID-19 pandemic, customers may renew their cloud agreements with a lower number of users or choose to cancel some of the functionality they are using. We cannot provide assurance that our subscriptions will be renewed at the same or higher levels of service and functionality, for the same number of users or for the same duration of time, if at all, or that we will be able to accurately predict future customer retention and net dollar retention rates. If our customers do not renew their subscriptions or if they renew on terms less favorable to us, the rate at which our cloud business grows may decline and our revenue may be reduced.\nWe rely on third-party hosting and other service providers.\nWe currently serve our cloud customers from third-party data center hosting facilities located in the United States and other countries. We do not control the operations of any of these facilities, and they may be subject to damage or interruption from earthquakes, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunications failures, public health issues such as the COVID-19 pandemic and similar events. They may also be subject to breaches of computer hardware and software security, break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism and similar misconduct. And while we rely on service level agreements with these vendors, if they do not properly maintain their infrastructure or if they incur unplanned outages, our customers may experience performance issues or unexpected interruptions and we will not meet our service level agreement terms with our customers. Despite precautions taken at these facilities, the occurrence of a natural disaster or pandemic or an act of terrorism, a decision to close the facilities without adequate notice or other unanticipated problems at these facilities could result in lengthy interruptions in our service. Even with our disaster recovery precautions, our services could be interrupted. Any loss or interruption of these services could result in us not meeting our service level agreements with our customers which would significantly increase our expenses, reduce our ability to generate revenue and/or result in errors or a failure of our services which could adversely affect our business. These vendor services may not continue to be available at reasonable prices or on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Additionally, our service level agreements with our customers are not the same terms as our service level agreements with our hosting vendors. Our agreements with our customers are generally more restrictive and result in higher fees paid to customers for unplanned outages than credits we may receive from our hosting vendors.\nWe may be exposed to liability and loss from cyber security breaches.\nOur cloud services involve the storage and transmission of customers\u2019 proprietary information, and security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss of this information, resulting in litigation and possible liability. Security breaches may also include \u201cdenial-of-service\u201d attacks, which can potentially disrupt our operations and our customers\u2019 operations. Security measures may be breached in numerous ways, such as remote or on-site break-ins by computer hackers, disgruntled employees or employee error during transfer of data to additional data centers or at any time, and result in unauthorized access to our own and our customers\u2019 data, intellectual property and other confidential business information. Additionally, third parties may attempt to induce employees or customers into disclosing sensitive information such as usernames, passwords or other information in order to gain access to our own and our customers\u2019 data, intellectual property and other confidential business information. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, or to sabotage systems, change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. A security breach could cause a loss of confidence in the security of our services, damage our reputation, disrupt our business, create legal liability and cause severe and potentially irreparable impact to our business. In the normal course of business, we are and have been the target of malicious cyber-attack attempts and have experienced other security incidents. To date, such identified security events have not had a material impact on our business operations or financial results, but there can be no assurance that future cyber-attacks will not have a material adverse impact.\nWe or our third-party service providers may experience a security breach, or unauthorized parties may otherwise obtain access to our customers\u2019 data, our data or our cloud services.\nSolarWinds, an information technology company, was the subject of a cyberattack that created security vulnerabilities for thousands of its clients. We identified a compromised SolarWinds server and promptly took steps to contain the incident. While we believe that no customer operations were disrupted as a result of this attack, similar attacks could have a significant negative impact on our systems and operations. In addition, third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce our employees, vendors, partners, or users to disclose information to gain access to our data or our users\u2019 data and there is the risk of employee, contractor or vendor error or malfeasance impacting our data or our users\u2019 data. Despite efforts to create security barriers to such threats, it is impossible for us to entirely eliminate these risks. If there are future security breaches, our offerings may be perceived as not being secure, our reputation may be harmed, demand for our offerings may be reduced, additional liabilities may be created and our financial results may be adversely impacted.\nThe market for our products and services is characterized by rapid technological change.\nCustomer requirements for products can change rapidly as a result of innovation or change within the computer hardware and software industries, the introduction of new products and technologies and changes to industry standards. Our future success, including our cloud service offerings, will depend upon our ability to continue to enhance our current product line and to develop and introduce new products and services that keep pace with technological developments, satisfy increasingly sophisticated customer requirements, keep pace with industry and compliance standards and achieve market acceptance. Our failure to successfully develop or acquire, and market, product enhancements or new products could have a material adverse effect on our business. Despite our significant investments in research and development, we may not realize significant new revenue from these investments for several years, if at all.\nNew software releases and enhancements may adversely affect our subscription and license sales.\nThe actual or anticipated introduction of new products, technologies and industry standards can render existing products obsolete or unmarketable or result in delays in the purchase of those products. Significant delays in launching new products may also jeopardize our ability to compete. If we fail to anticipate or respond to developments in technology or customer requirements, have significant delays in the introduction of new products or fail to maintain overall customer satisfaction, this could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nServices engagements are complex and pose material risks.\nServices engagements may involve complex technological challenges, including those related to customer customization requests and our cloud environments, and such challenges demand a significant number of specialized technical resources. Our failure to successfully address these issues could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe margins in our services business may fluctuate.\nServices revenue is dependent upon the timing and size of customer orders, as well as upon our related license and subscription sales. If we are unable to keep our services employees engaged on billable matters then our profit margins may suffer. In addition, certain engagements may involve fixed price arrangements and significant staffing and subcontracting which require us to make estimates and assumptions at the time we enter into these contracts as well as throughout the contract to determine percent completion and revenue recognition. Variances between these estimates and assumptions and actual results could have an adverse effect on our profit margin and generate negative cash flow and negative services margins. To the extent that we are not successful in securing orders from customers to provide services, or to the extent we are not successful in achieving the expected margin on such services, our results of operations may be adversely affected.\nThe margins in our cloud service offerings may fluctuate.\nOur cloud service offerings may involve fixed price arrangements, fixed and up-front costs and significant staffing which require us to make estimates and assumptions at the time we enter into these contracts. Variances between these estimates and assumptions and actual results could have an adverse effect on our profit margin and/or generate negative cash flow. To the extent that we are not successful in securing orders from customers to provide cloud services, or to the extent we are not successful in achieving the expected margin on such solutions, our results may be adversely affected.\nBecause we recognize revenue from cloud services over the term of the subscription, downturns or upturns in new business may not be immediately reflected in our operating results.\nWe generally recognize subscription revenue from customers ratably over the term of their subscription agreements. As a result, most of the subscription revenue we report in each quarter is the result of subscription agreements entered into during prior quarters. Consequently, a decline in new or renewed subscriptions in any one quarter may not be reflected in our revenue results for that quarter. Any such decline, however, will negatively affect our revenue in future quarters. Accordingly, the effect of significant downturns in sales and market acceptance of our cloud services, and potential changes in our attrition rate, may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods. Our subscription model also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our subscription revenue through additional sales in any period, as subscription revenue from new customers must be recognized over the applicable subscription term.\nOur subscription and maintenance retention rate is dependent upon a number of factors such as our ability to continue to develop and maintain our products, continue to recruit and retain qualified personnel to assist our customers, and promote the value of maintenance for our products to our customers.\nOur subscription and maintenance retention rate is also dependent upon factors beyond our control such as technology changes and their adoption by our customers, budgeting decisions by our customers, changes in our customers\u2019 strategy or ownership and plans by our customers to replace our products with competing products. If our subscription or maintenance retention rate decreases, our revenue and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nRisks associated with our sales cycle.\nOur products involve a long sales cycle and the timing of sales is difficult to predict. Because the licensing or subscription of our primary products generally involves a significant commitment of capital or a long-term commitment by our customers, the sales cycle associated with a purchase of our products is generally lengthy.\nThis cycle varies from customer to customer and is subject to a number of significant risks over which we have little or no control, for example the COVID-19 (novel coronavirus) pandemic. The evaluation process that our customers follow generally involves many of their personnel and requires complex demonstrations and presentations to satisfy their needs. Significant effort is required by us to support this process, whether we are ultimately successful or not. If sales forecasted for a particular quarter are not realized in that quarter, then we are unlikely to be able to generate revenue from alternative sources in time to compensate for the shortfall. As a result, a lost or delayed sale could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and operating results.\nOur intellectual property may be at risk as a result of a variety of different factors.\nWe rely on a combination of protections provided by applicable copyright, trademark, patent and trade secret laws, as well as on confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements, to establish and protect our rights in our software and related materials and information. We enter into agreements with each of our customers and partners to whom we grant access to QAD Adaptive Applications. These agreements contain confidentiality and non-disclosure provisions, a limited warranty covering our applications and indemnification from infringement actions related to our applications. In addition, we have in certain circumstances licensed our software to end-users and partners in both object code (machine-readable) and source code (human-readable) formats. While this practice facilitates customization, making software available in source code also makes it possible for others to copy or modify our software for impermissible purposes.\nDespite our efforts, it may be possible for others to copy portions of our products, reverse engineer them or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary, all of which could adversely affect our competitive position. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that our competitors will not independently develop technology similar to ours. In addition, we maintain significant intellectual property assets outside the United States, including in countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as in the United States.\nThe unauthorized use of our intellectual property rights may increase the cost of protecting these rights or reduce our revenues. We may initiate, or be subject to, claims or litigation for infringement of proprietary rights or to establish the validity of our proprietary rights, which could result in significant expense to us, cause product shipment delays, require us to enter royalty or licensing agreements and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel from productive tasks, whether or not such litigation were determined in our favor.\nWe may be exposed to claims for infringement of intellectual property rights and breach of contract, and we may experience impairment of our own intellectual property rights.\nThird parties may initiate proceedings against us claiming infringement or other misuse of their intellectual property rights and/or breach of our agreements with them. Further, while we actively monitor the adoption of open source software in our software development process, it is possible that our use of open source software may inadvertently subject our proprietary software to public disclosure and impairment of our intellectual property rights. The likelihood of such instances may increase as the use of open source and other third-party code becomes more prevalent in the industry. Any such instances, regardless of validity, may cause us to:\n\u25cf\nPay license fees or monetary damages;\n\u25cf\nIncur high legal fees in defense of such claims;\n\u25cf\nAlter or stop selling our products;\n\u25cf\nSatisfy indemnification obligations to our customers;\n\u25cf\nRelease source code to third parties, possibly under open source license terms; and\n\u25cf\nDivert management\u2019s time and attention from operating our business.\nWe may be exposed to product liability claims and other liabilities.\nWhile our customer agreements typically contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to product liability claims and other liability, we may still be exposed to liability in the event such provisions may not apply.\nWe have an errors and omissions insurance policy which may not totally protect us.\nThe Company has an errors and omissions insurance policy. However, this insurance may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or a claim otherwise covered by our insurance may exceed our coverage limits, or a claim may not be covered at all. We may be subject to product liability claims or errors or omissions claims that could have an adverse effect on us. Moreover, defending a suit, regardless of its merits, could entail substantial expense and require the time and attention of key management personnel.\nWe are dependent upon the development and maintenance of sales, services and marketing channels.\nWe sell and support our products through direct and indirect sales, services and support organizations throughout the world. We also maintain relationships with a number of consulting and systems integration organizations that we believe are important to our worldwide sales, marketing, service and support activities and to the implementation of our products. We also intend to actively increase and deepen such relationships to support growth in our business. We believe this strategy allows for additional flexibility in ensuring our customers\u2019 needs for services are met in a cost effective, timely and high-quality manner. We are aware that these third-party service providers do not work exclusively with our products and in many instances have similar, and often more established, relationships with our principal competitors. If these third parties exclusively pursue products or technology other than QAD software products or technology, or if these third parties fail to adequately implement and support QAD software products and technology or increase support for competitive products or technology, we could be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Laws and Regulations\nOur solutions can be used to collect and store personal information of our customers\u2019 employees or customers, and therefore privacy concerns and governmental regulations could result in additional cost and liability to us or inhibit sales of our solutions.\nRegulatory focus on privacy issues continues to increase and worldwide laws and regulations concerning the handling of personal information are expanding and becoming more complex. Many federal, state and foreign government bodies and agencies have adopted, or are considering adopting, laws and regulations regarding the collection, use, disclosure and retention of personal information. In July 2020, the European Union (EU) invalidated the Privacy Shield framework with the United States, which previously provided a mechanism for companies to transfer data from EU member states to the U.S. This action generated uncertainty about the legal basis for data transfers to the U.S. or interruption of such transfers. In the event a court blocks transfers to or from a particular jurisdiction on the basis that transfer mechanisms are not legally adequate, this could cause operational interruptions, liabilities and reputational harm. These and other requirements could increase the cost of compliance for us and our customers, restrict our and our customers\u2019 ability to store and process data, negatively impact our ability to offer our solutions in certain locations and limit our customers' ability to deploy our solutions globally. These consequences may be more significant in countries with legislation that requires data to remain localized \u201cin country\u201d, as this could require us or our customers to establish data storage in other jurisdictions or apply local operational processes that are difficult and costly to integrate with global processes.\nIf we fail to comply with such laws and regulations, we may be subject to significant fines, penalties or liabilities for noncompliance, thereby harming our business. For example, the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), establishes requirements regarding the handling of personal data. Non-compliance with the GDPR may result in monetary penalties of up to 4% of worldwide revenue. Further, the United Kingdom\u2019s departure from the European Union has created uncertainty with regard to the requirements for data transfers between the United Kingdom and the EU and other jurisdictions. In addition, domestic data privacy laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), continue to evolve and could expose us to further regulatory burdens.\nChanges in laws and regulations may negatively impact our business.\nFederal, state or foreign government bodies or agencies have in the past adopted, and may in the future adopt, laws or regulations that affect our business and the industries that we serve, including life sciences. Changes in these laws or regulations could require us to modify our offerings, increase the cost of supporting those offerings, limit our customers\u2019 adoption of those offerings, and increase the length and cost of sales cycles. Such events can have negative tax consequences and an adverse effect on our business and results.\nWe do not collect sales and use, value added and similar taxes in all jurisdictions in which we have sales, based on our belief that such taxes are not applicable. Sales and use, value added and similar tax laws and rates vary greatly by jurisdiction. Certain jurisdictions in which we do not collect such taxes may assert or may adopt laws that such taxes are applicable or that our presence in such jurisdictions is sufficient to require us to collect taxes, which could result in tax assessments, penalties and interest, and we may be required to collect such taxes in the future. Such tax assessments, penalties and interest or future requirements may adversely affect our financial results.\nFederal, state and foreign governments have enacted various laws in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and we continue to examine the impacts such laws may have on our business. Furthermore, governments have and may continue to offer support to companies who operate in those countries. We are examining the impact of government subsidies, tax credits or other support in countries where QAD has operations.\nChanges in accounting principles, or interpretations thereof, could have a significant impact on our financial position and results of operations.\nWe prepare our Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). A change in these principles can have a significant impact on our reported results and may even retroactively affect previously reported transactions. The adoption of new or revised accounting principles may require that we make significant changes to our systems, processes and controls.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Stock\nThe dual class structure of our common stock as set forth in our charter documents could adversely impact the market for our common stock.\nOur dual-class stock structure could adversely impact the market for our stock. The liquidity of our common stock may be adversely impacted by our dual-class structure because each class has less of a public float than it would if we had a single class of common stock. In addition, there are fewer Class B shares than Class A shares and Class B shares may be less desirable to the public due to the 20% higher dividend on Class A shares. Also, the holding of lower voting Class A common stock may not be permitted by the investment policies of certain institutional investors or may be less attractive to managers of certain institutional investors.\nIf we are unable to pay quarterly dividends, our reputation and stock price may be harmed.\nOur payment of dividends may require the use of a significant portion of our cash earnings. As a result, we may not retain a sufficient amount of cash to fund our operations or finance future growth opportunities, new product development initiatives and unanticipated capital expenditures which could adversely affect our financial performance. Additionally, our board of directors may, at its discretion, decrease or entirely discontinue the payment of dividends at any time. Our ability to pay dividends will depend on our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations in the future. This ability may be subject to certain economic, financial, competitive and other factors that are beyond our control. Any failure to pay dividends may negatively impact our reputation and investor confidence in us and may negatively impact the price of our common stock.\nThe dual class structure of our common stock as set forth in our charter documents has the effect of concentrating voting control with certain stockholders, including Pamela Lopker, thus limiting our other stockholders\u2019 ability to influence corporate matters.\nOur Class B common stock has one vote per share and our Class A common stock has 1/20th vote per share. Stockholders who hold shares of our Class B common stock collectively have approximately 79% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock as of January 31, 2021. As of January 31, 2021, Pamela Lopker beneficially owned approximately 31% of the outstanding shares of our Class A common stock and approximately 77% of the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock, representing approximately 67% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock. Currently she has sufficient voting control to determine the outcome of a stockholder vote concerning:\n\u25cf\nThe election and removal of all members of our board of directors;\n\u25cf\nThe merger, consolidation or sale of the Company or all of our assets; and\n\u25cf\nAll other matters requiring stockholder approval, regardless of how our other stockholders vote their shares.\nIn addition, the holders of our Class B common stock collectively will continue to be able to control all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval even if their stock holdings represent less than 50% of the outstanding shares of our common stock because of the 20-to-1 voting ratio between our Class B and Class A common stock. This concentrated control will limit the ability of our Class A stockholders to influence corporate matters for the foreseeable future, and, as a result, the market price of our Class A common stock could be adversely affected.\nThis concentrated control limits the ability of our other stockholders to influence corporate matters and also limits the liquidity of the shares owned by other stockholders. Should the interests of Pamela Lopker differ from those of other stockholders, the other stockholders may not be afforded the protections of having a majority of directors on the board who are independent from our principal stockholders or our management. For example, Pamela Lopker\u2019s concentrated control could discourage others from initiating potential merger, takeover or other change of control transactions; and, transactions could be pursued that our other stockholders do not view as beneficial. As a result, the market price of our Class A and Class B common stock could be adversely affected.\nWe are not required to comply with certain corporate governance rules of NASDAQ that would otherwise apply to us as a company listed on NASDAQ, because we are a controlled company.\nSpecifically, we are not required to have a majority of independent directors or a compensation committee comprised solely of independent directors; select, or recommend for the board\u2019s selection, director nominees by a majority of independent directors or a nominating committee comprised solely of independent directors; determine officer compensation by a compensation committee comprised solely of independent directors or by a majority of the board upon recommendation of a compensation committee comprised solely of independent directors; and satisfy certain responsibilities of the compensation committee prior to retaining or receiving advice from a compensation consultant, legal counsel or other advisor to the compensation committee.\nProvisions in the Company's charter documents or Delaware law could discourage a takeover that stockholders may consider favorable.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation contains certain other provisions that may have an \u201canti-takeover\u201d effect. The Certificate of Incorporation contains authority for the Board to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock without stockholder approval. Although the Company has no present intention to issue any such shares, we could issue such shares in a manner that deters or seeks to prevent an unsolicited bid for us. The Certificate of Incorporation also does not provide for cumulative voting and, accordingly, a significant minority stockholder could not necessarily elect any designee to the board of directors. In addition, Section 203 of the Delaware Corporation Law may discourage, delay, or prevent a change in control of us by imposing certain restrictions on various business combinations. Furthermore, our dual class structure concentrates the voting power of our stock in Pamela Lopker who would have the ability to control the outcome of a stockholder vote. As a result of these provisions in the Company's Certificate of Incorporation, including our dual class structure, and Delaware law, our stockholders may be deprived of an opportunity to sell their shares at a premium over prevailing market prices and it would be more difficult to replace our directors and management.\nGeneral Risks\nContinuation of the COVID-19 pandemic may adversely affect our business, operations and financial results.\nThe continuation of the global COVID-19 pandemic may negatively impact our business, operations and financial results in future years, depending on the length of the pandemic and its economic repercussions. As the virus has spread, it has significantly impacted health and the economic environment around the world and governments have instituted measures to control its spread. Our customers are global manufacturers and the closure of manufacturing sites and country borders, and the increase in unemployment, are having and will continue to have negative implications on demand for goods, supply chain effectiveness, production of goods and transportation.\nThe future impacts of the ongoing pandemic on our business, operations and financial results could include, but are not limited to:\n\u25cf\nDeferral or cancellation of new purchases of cloud services, professional services and licenses;\n\u25cf\nRenewal of cloud services and maintenance at lower amounts, or not at all;\n\u25cf\nDisruptions in our ability to deliver our cloud services to our customers resulting in failure to meet service level agreement commitments;\n\u25cf\nCancellation or delay of existing professional services projects;\n\u25cf\nReduced effectiveness of professional services that are more effective when performed directly with the customer onsite;\n\u25cf\nRequests for changes to payment terms; and\n\u25cf\nExisting customers going out of business.\nSuch impacts may trigger fees owed to customers and negatively impact our revenue, customer satisfaction and ultimately customer retention.\nThe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, results of operations, overall financial performance and liquidity is unpredictable due to the continued evolution in the severity and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and the effectiveness of governmental control measures. The effect of the COVID-19 pandemic may not be fully reflected in our results of operations and overall financial performance until future periods and may have a material negative impact.\nOther catastrophic events may disrupt our business.\nOur corporate headquarters, including network infrastructure, internal technology systems and certain of our research and development activities, is located in Southern California, a region susceptible to fires, mudslides and seismic activity. Additionally, certain of our other facilities and those of our suppliers and third-party data hosting services, may be located in regions affected by natural disasters. Our corporate headquarters has been disrupted in the past, and any of the aforementioned facilities, suppliers and hosting services may be disrupted in the future, by significant natural disasters. Such a natural disaster, as well as a terrorist attack, cyber-attack, war or other catastrophic event, may result in power loss, telecommunications failure, loss of access to the Internet, software or hardware malfunction, or physical access restrictions that our disaster recovery plans do not adequately address. Such disruptions can result in delays or cancellations of sales cycles, reductions or cancellations of the services we currently provide our customers, delays in our product development, interruptions in our customer services, breaches of data security and loss of critical data, all of which may have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition, and negatively impact our reputation.\nContinued growth could strain our infrastructure, and if we are unable to scale our operations and increase productivity, we may not be able to successfully implement our business plan.\nWe continue to experience significant growth in our customer base, which has placed a strain on our management, administrative, operational and financial infrastructure. We anticipate that additional investments or modifications and enhancements to our existing infrastructures will be required to scale our operations and increase productivity, to address the needs of our customers, to further develop and enhance our services, and to scale with our overall growth. Our success will depend in part upon our ability to manage our projected growth effectively. To do so, we must continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls, our reporting systems and procedures. We may also experience a decline in our revenue growth rate as our revenues increase to higher levels. If we fail to successfully scale our operations and infrastructure, we may be unable to execute our business plan.\nOur financial forecasts are subject to uncertainty to the extent they are based on estimated sales forecasts.\nOur revenues, and particularly our new cloud bookings business, software license revenue and services revenue, are difficult to forecast, and, as a result, our financial forecasts are subject to uncertainty. Specifically, our sales forecasts are based on estimates that our sales personnel make regarding the likelihood of potential sales, including their expected closing date and fee amounts. If these estimates are inaccurate then our financial forecasts may also be inaccurate.\nWe may have exposure to additional tax liabilities.\nAs a multinational organization, we are subject to income taxes as well as non-income taxes in the United States and in various foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision and other tax liabilities. Although we believe that our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits or tax disputes may differ from what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals.\nOur tax rate could be adversely affected by several factors, many of which are outside of our control, including:\n\u25cf\nChanges in jurisdictional revenue mix;\n\u25cf\nChanging tax laws, regulations and interpretations thereof, including the changing landscape around digital taxation and the new US Tax Reform laws;\n\u25cf\nChanges in tax rates;\n\u25cf\nChanges to the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets; and\n\u25cf\nAssessments and any related tax, interest or penalties.\nIf we are deemed to owe additional taxes, our results of operations may be adversely affected.\nWe report our results based on our calculations of the amount of taxes owed in the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate but taxing authorities may believe we owe a greater amount of income tax than we have reported.\nPeriodically, we may receive notices that a tax authority in a particular jurisdiction believes that we owe a greater amount of income tax than we have reported, in which case we may engage in discussions or possible dispute resolutions with these tax authorities. If the ultimate determination of our income taxes owed in any of these jurisdictions is for an amount in excess of the tax provision we have recorded or reserved for, our operating results, cash flows, and financial condition could be adversely affected. We are also subject to non-income taxes, such as payroll, sales, use, value-added, net worth, property and goods and services taxes, in the United States and in various foreign jurisdictions. Audits or disputes relating to non-income taxes may result in additional liabilities that could negatively affect our operating results, cash flows and financial condition.\nUnfavorable economic conditions may adversely impact our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur operations and performance are subject to the risks arising from worldwide economic conditions, which are themselves impacted by other events, such as financial crises, natural disasters, epidemics and political turmoil. These include adverse economic conditions associated with the COVID-19 (novel coronavirus) pandemic or other catastrophic events that may disrupt our business. In particular, the negative impact of economic conditions on manufacturing companies could have a substantial adverse effect on our sales, because our products are focused on supporting manufacturing companies. Uncertainty about global economic conditions may result in reductions in sales of our products, longer sales cycles, slower adoption of new technologies and increased price competition as manufacturing companies may delay, reduce or forego spending in response to declining asset values, tight credit, high unemployment, natural disasters, political unrest and negative financial news. Such economic conditions may also result in our customers extending their payment periods or experiencing reduced ability to pay amounts owed to us. Uncertainty about global economic conditions could also increase the volatility of our stock price. If any of the foregoing occurs, our results of operations may be adversely affected.\nWe may experience foreign currency gains and losses.\nWe conduct a portion of our business in currencies other than the United States dollar. Our revenues and operating results may be negatively affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Changes in the value of major foreign currencies, including the euro, Australian dollar, Mexican peso and British pound, relative to the United States dollar can significantly and adversely affect our revenues, expenses and operating results.\nOur stock price could become more volatile and investments in our stock could lose value.\nThe market price of our common stock and the number of shares of each class traded each day has experienced significant fluctuations and may continue to fluctuate significantly. The market price for our common stock may be affected by a number of factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u25cf\nShortfalls in our expected net revenue, earnings or key performance metrics;\n\u25cf\nChanges in recommendations or estimates by securities analysts;\n\u25cf\nThe announcement of new products by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf\nQuarterly variations in our or our competitors\u2019 results of operations;\n\u25cf\nA change in our dividend or stock repurchase activities;\n\u25cf\nDevelopments in our industry or changes in the market for technology stocks;\n\u25cf\nChanges in rules or regulations applicable to our business; and\n\u25cf\nOther factors, including economic instability, global pandemics such as COVID-19 and changes in political or market conditions.\nIf research analysts do not publish research about our business or if they issue unfavorable commentary or downgrade our common stock, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that research analysts publish about us and our business. If we do not maintain adequate research coverage, or if one or more analysts who covers us downgrades our stock or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, the price of our common stock could decline. If one or more of the research analysts ceases coverage of our company or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our common stock could decrease, which could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nWe are obligated to maintain proper and effective internal control over financial reporting. We may not complete our analysis of our internal control over financial reporting in a timely manner, or this internal control may not be determined to be effective, which may adversely affect investor confidence in our company and, as a result, the value of our common stock.\nWe are required, pursuant to the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), to furnish a report by management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. This assessment includes disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our management in our internal control over financial reporting, as well as a statement that our auditors have issued an attestation report on our internal controls.\nWhile we were able to determine in our management\u2019s report for fiscal 2021 that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, as well as provide an unqualified attestation report from our independent registered public accounting firm to that effect, we may not be able to complete our evaluation, testing, and any required remediation in a timely fashion or our independent registered public accounting firm may not be able to formally attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in the future. In addition, we may be unable to maintain our current effective internal controls due to the current volatility in the market or due to the difficulties surrounding any acquisitions we may make in the future. During the evaluation and testing process, if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting that we are unable to remediate before the end of the same fiscal year in which the material weakness is identified, we will be unable to assert that our internal controls are effective. If we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our auditors are unable to attest to the effectiveness of our internal controls or determine we have a material weakness in our internal controls, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which could cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nWe are dependent upon highly skilled personnel.\nOur performance depends on the talents and efforts of highly skilled employees, including the continued service of a relatively small number of key technical and senior management personnel. All of our executive officers and key employees are at-will employees and we do not have key-person insurance covering any of our employees. Our future success depends on our continuing ability to attract and retain highly skilled personnel in all areas of our organization. Competition for such personnel is intense and many of our competitors are larger and have greater financial resources for attracting skilled personnel. The loss of key technical and senior management personnel or the inability to attract and retain additional qualified personnel could have an adverse effect on our continued ability to compete effectively.\nWe have hired personnel in countries where advanced technical expertise and other expertise are available at lower costs to improve our cost structure. We may experience competition for employees in these countries, which may negatively affect our employee retention efforts and increase our expenses in an effort to offer a competitive compensation program.",

Our architecture, called the QAD Enterprise Platform, allows manufacturers to upgrade existing functionality by module; and extend or create new applications, providing manufacturers with the flexibility they need to innovate and rapidly adapt to change.\nWe have four principal sources of revenue:\n\u25cf\nSubscription of QAD Adaptive Applications through our cloud offering in a Software as a Service (SaaS) model as well as other hosted applications;\n\u25cf\nLicense purchases of QAD Adaptive Applications;\n\u25cf\nMaintenance and support, including technical support, training materials, product enhancements and upgrades; and\n\u25cf\nProfessional services, including implementations, technical and application consulting, training, migrations and upgrades.\nWe operate primarily in the following four geographic regions: North America, EMEA, Asia Pacific and Latin America. In fiscal 2021, approximately 51% of our total revenue was generated in North America, 30% in EMEA, 13% in Asia Pacific and 6% in Latin America. The majority of our revenue is generated from global customers who have operations in multiple countries throughout the world. A significant portion of our revenue and expenses are derived from international operations which are primarily conducted in foreign currencies. As a result, changes in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar have impacted our results of operations and may impact our future results of operations. At January 31, 2021, we employed approximately 1,930 employees worldwide, of which 615 employees were based in North America, 650 employees in EMEA, 555 employees in Asia Pacific and 110 employees in Latin America.\nOur customer base and our target markets are primarily global manufacturing companies; therefore, our results are heavily influenced by the state of the manufacturing economy on a global basis. As a result, our management team monitors several economic indicators, with particular attention to the Global and Country Purchasing Managers\u2019 Indexes (PMI). The PMI is a survey conducted on a monthly basis by polling businesses that represent the makeup of respective sectors. Since most of our customers are manufacturers, our revenue has historically correlated with fluctuations in the manufacturing PMI. Global macro-economic trends and manufacturing spending are important barometers for our business, and the health of the U.S., Western European and Asian economies have a meaningful impact on our financial results.\nWe have transitioned our business model from selling perpetual licenses to providing access to our software on a subscription basis as part of our cloud offering. During fiscal 2021, we closed most of our new customer deals in the cloud. Subscription revenue grew 22% in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 and our twelve-month trailing subscription billings grew by 18%, with a three-year compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 21%. In addition, we have converted approximately 25% of our existing customers from on-premises licenses to our cloud solutions. Recurring revenue, which we define as subscription revenue plus maintenance revenue, accounted for 78% of total revenue in fiscal 2021. By reducing our customers\u2019 up-front costs and providing QAD Adaptive Applications with continuous application and infrastructure support in secure and resilient environments, we expect our cloud business model will continue to be more attractive than perpetual licenses. We expect recurring revenue to remain a majority of total revenue as our subscription revenue continues to grow.\nIn late 2019, a novel strain of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was identified in China, and in March 2020, the World Health Organization characterized the COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in authorities implementing numerous measures to try to contain and mitigate the virus, including travel bans and restrictions; business shut-downs and limitations; quarantines and shelter-in-place; and social distancing orders.\nOur customers are global manufacturers and the closure of manufacturing sites and country borders, and the increase in unemployment due to the COVID-19 global pandemic, are having and will continue to have negative implications on demand for some goods, the supply chain, production of goods and transportation. Furthermore, the future impact to our manufacturing customers depends on the duration and spread of the virus. The negative impact on some of our manufacturing customers has caused some of them to delay purchasing decisions, postpone services projects, reduce users or modules, cancel their maintenance or subscription contracts, request extended payment terms, or request higher discounts.\nOur priorities during the pandemic have been the health and well-being of our employees, our customers and their respective families and communities as well as maintaining continuity of service for our cloud and on-premises customers and those customers with implementation or upgrade projects. Beginning in the first fiscal quarter and through the remainder of fiscal 2021, we took actions in response to the pandemic that focused on maintaining business continuity, supporting our employees, helping our customers and communities and preparing for the long-term success of our business. We are continuing to conduct business during the COVID-19 pandemic with substantial modifications to employee travel, employee work locations, and virtualization, postponement or cancellation of certain sales and marketing events, among other modifications.\nThe extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may impact our financial condition or results of operations in future periods remains uncertain. The effect of the COVID-19 pandemic may not be fully reflected in our results of operations and overall financial performance until future periods. We have experienced, and may continue to experience, decreased customer demand, reduced customer spending, customer bankruptcies and other non-payment situations, shorter contract duration, longer sales cycles and extended payment terms, any of which could materially adversely impact our business, results of operations and overall financial performance in future periods. The extent and continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operational and financial performance will depend in part on future developments and conditions, including the duration and spread of the outbreak; government responses; the impact on our customers and our sales cycles; delays in hiring and onboarding new employees; and the effect on our partners, vendors and supply chains, all of which are uncertain and difficult to predict. In the first quarter of fiscal 2021, we closed our offices globally and our employees worked remotely. These actions remained in effect throughout fiscal 2021 and is expected to extend into future quarters. The impact, if any, of these and any additional operational changes we may implement is uncertain, but actions we have taken to date in response to the pandemic have not materially impaired, and are not expected to materially impair our ability to maintain operations, including financial reporting systems, internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. See the section \u201cRisk Factors\u201d for further discussion of the possible impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nWe operate in several geographical regions as described in Note 15 \u201cBusiness Segment Information\u201d within the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In order to present our results of operations without the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, we provide certain financial information on a \u201cconstant currency basis\u201d, which is in addition to the actual financial information presented in the following tables. In order to calculate our constant currency results, we apply the current foreign currency exchange rates to the prior period results.\nRevenue\nYear Ended\nJanuary 31,\nYear Ended\nJanuary 31,\nChange in\nConstant\nChange due\nto Currency\nTotal Change\nas Reported\n(in thousands)\nCurrency\nFluctuations\n$\n%\nRevenue\nSubscription\n$ 131,133\n$ 107,168\n$ 24,303\n$ (338 )\n$ 23,965\n%\nPercentage of total revenue\n%\n%\nLicense\n11,152\n16,570\n(5,470 )\n(5,418 )\n%\nPercentage of total revenue\n%\n%\nMaintenance\n107,083\n117,896\n(10,541 )\n(272 )\n(10,813 )\n%\nPercentage of total revenue\n%\n%\nProfessional services\n58,497\n69,138\n(9,981 )\n(660 )\n(10,641 )\n%\nPercentage of total revenue\n%\n%\nTotal revenue\n$ 307,865\n$ 310,772\n$ (1,689 )\n$ (1,218 )\n$ (2,907 )\n%\nYear Ended\nJanuary 31,\nYear Ended\nJanuary 31,\nChange in\nConstant\nChange due\nto Currency\nTotal Change\nas Reported\n(in thousands)\nCurrency\nFluctuations\n$\n%\nRevenue\nSubscription\n$ 107,168\n$ 91,861\n$ 16,473\n$ (1,166 )\n$ 15,307\n%\nPercentage of total revenue\n%\n%\nLicense\n16,570\n25,568\n(8,479 )\n(519 )\n(8,998 )\n%\nPercentage of total revenue\n%\n%\nMaintenance\n117,896\n122,936\n(2,734 )\n(2,306 )\n(5,040 )\n%\nPercentage of total revenue\n%\n%\nProfessional services\n69,138\n92,651\n(21,310 )\n(2,203 )\n(23,513 )\n%\nPercentage of total revenue\n%\n%\nTotal revenue\n$ 310,772\n$ 333,016\n$ (16,050 )\n$ (6,194 )\n$ (22,244 )\n%\nTotal Revenue. On a constant currency basis, total revenue was $307.9 million for fiscal 2021, representing a $1.7 million, or 1%, decrease from $309.6 million for fiscal 2020. When comparing categories within total revenue at constant currency rates, our results for fiscal 2021 when compared to the prior year included decreases in maintenance, professional services and license due in part to the global pandemic and in part due to our continued strategy to convert existing customers to the cloud. These decreases were partially offset by a 23% increase in subscription revenue, on a constant currency basis, as we focused on selling our software solutions to new customers in the cloud. Revenue outside the North America region as a percentage of total revenue was 49% and 51% for fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively. On a constant currency basis, total revenue decreased across the Asia Pacific region and increased across the North America, Latin America and EMEA regions when compared to fiscal 2020.\nOn a constant currency basis, total revenue was $310.8 million for fiscal 2020, representing a $16.0 million, or 5%, decrease from $326.8 million for fiscal 2019. The primary reason for the decrease in total revenue was due to lower professional services revenue. Our results for fiscal 2020 also included decreases in license and maintenance revenue. These decreases were offset by an 18% increase in subscription revenue, on a constant currency basis, as we focused on selling our software solutions to new customers in the cloud. Revenue outside the North America region as a percentage of total revenue was 51% and 52% for fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively. On a constant currency basis, total revenue decreased across all regions during fiscal 2020 when compared to the prior year.\nIn fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020, no single customer accounted for more than 10% of total revenue. In fiscal 2019, one customer accounted for 10% of total revenue. During fiscal 2019, we performed a large implementation project with a customer which included significant consulting services. Without these services, the revenue from this customer would have been less than 10%.\nOur products are sold to manufacturing companies that operate mainly in the following six vertical industries: automotive, consumer products, food and beverage, high technology, industrial products and life sciences. Given the similarities between consumer products and food and beverage as well as between high technology and industrial products, we aggregate them for management review. The following table presents revenue by vertical industry for fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019:\nYears Ended January 31,\nAutomotive\n%\n%\n%\nConsumer products and food and beverage\n%\n%\n%\nHigh technology and industrial products\n%\n%\n%\nLife sciences and other\n%\n%\n%\nTotal revenue\n%\n%\n%\nThe decrease in percentage of revenue for automotive in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 and 2019 was primarily related to a reduction in professional services revenue following the completion of a large, multisite global implementation project for a customer in the automotive industry.\nSubscription Revenue. Subscription revenue consists of recurring fees from customers to access our products via the cloud and other subscription offerings. Our cloud offerings typically include access to QAD software, hosting, application support, maintenance support and product updates, when and if available. Included in subscription revenue are one-time set up fees for technical services such as configuration of the database and access to the environment.\nOn a constant currency basis, subscription revenue was $131.1 million for fiscal 2021, representing a $24.3 million, or 23%, increase from $106.8 million for fiscal 2020. Our subscription revenue represented 43% and 35% of our total revenue in fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively. On a constant currency basis, subscription revenue increased across all regions during fiscal 2021 when compared to the prior year. One of the metrics that management uses to monitor subscription performance is the number of new subscription deals that have been signed in the period. In fiscal 2021 we closed 95 new subscription deals, including 48 new customers and 47 conversions from existing customers who previously purchased on-premises licenses. This compared to fiscal 2020 when we closed 119 new subscription deals, including 68 new customers and 51 conversions from existing customers who previously purchased on-premises licenses. Subscription billings grew 18% in fiscal 2021 from the prior year with a three-year CAGR of 21%. Subscription backlog as of January 31, 2021 was $156.4 million, a 4% increase from $150.4 million as of January 31, 2020. The increase in subscription revenue consists of new customer sites, existing customers converting from on-premises, and additional users and modules purchased by our existing cloud customers.\nThe following table presents subscription revenue by region for fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019:\nYears Ended January 31,\nNorth America\n%\n%\n%\nEMEA\n%\n%\n%\nAsia Pacific\n%\n%\n%\nLatin America\n%\n%\n%\nTotal subscription revenue\n%\n%\n%\nThe following table presents subscription revenue by industry for fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019:\nYears Ended January 31,\nAutomotive\n%\n%\n%\nConsumer products and food and beverage\n%\n%\n%\nHigh technology and industrial products\n%\n%\n%\nLife sciences and other\n%\n%\n%\nTotal subscription revenue\n%\n%\n%\nOn a constant currency basis, subscription revenue was $107.2 million for fiscal 2020, representing a $16.5 million, or 18%, increase from $90.7 million for fiscal 2019. Our subscription revenue represented 35% and 28% of our total revenue in fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively. On a constant currency basis, subscription revenue increased across all regions during fiscal 2020 when compared to the prior year. One of the metrics that management uses to monitor subscription performance is the number of new subscription deals that have been signed in the period. In fiscal 2020 we closed 119 new subscription deals, including 68 new customers and 51 conversions from existing customers who previously purchased on-premises licenses. This compared to fiscal 2019 when we closed 97 new subscription deals, including 71 new customers and 26 conversions from existing customers who previously purchased on-premises licenses. Subscription billings grew 23% in fiscal 2020 from the prior year and subscription backlog as of January 31, 2020 was $150.4 million, a 31% increase from $114.7 million as of January 31, 2019. The increase in subscription revenue consisted of new customer sites; existing customers converting from on-premises; and additional users and modules purchased by our existing cloud customers.\nWe track our retention rate of subscription by calculating the annualized subscription revenue of customer sites with contracts up for renewal at the beginning of the period compared to the annualized subscription revenue associated with the customer sites that have canceled during the period. The percentage of revenue not canceled is our retention rate. Our subscription customer retention rate is in excess of 95% in each of the fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019. We also track net dollar retention rate for our subscription revenue, which we calculate by comparing subscription revenue of our existing customers from a year ago to subscription revenue of the same customers in the current year. Net dollar retention rate of our subscription revenue was 105% for fiscal 2021, compared to 108% for fiscal 2020. The net dollar retention rate metric calculates the additional subscription revenue generated from existing customers paying for additional users, functionality and price increases. We believe the reduction in the net dollar retention rate was a result of the global economic downturn caused by the COVID-19 pandemic as many of our customers' manufacturing facilities, supply chains and transportation modes were negatively impacted.\nLicense Revenue. License revenue is derived from software license fees that customers pay for our software products. Our revenue mix has continued to shift from license to subscription revenue as a result of our business model transition. New customers subscribe to our cloud-based offerings rather than purchase traditional on-premises licenses. While we expect license revenue to decline over time, we continue to experience quarterly fluctuations, because most of our license revenue is now generated by existing on-premises customers adding new users and modules to their on-premises licenses.\nOn a constant currency basis, license revenue was $11.2 million for fiscal 2021, representing a $5.4 million, or 33%, decrease from $16.6 million for fiscal 2020. On a constant currency basis, license revenue decreased across all regions except Latin America during fiscal 2021 when compared to the prior year. We believe license revenue was negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic as our existing customers were not adding users or modules as they dealt with negative impacts to their business. In addition, as more customers convert to the cloud, we expect to generate less license revenue. During fiscal 2021, nineteen customers placed license orders totaling more than $0.1 million, two of which exceeded $1 million. This compared to fiscal 2020 in which thirty-three customers placed license orders totaling more than $0.1 million, one of which exceeded $1 million. The majority of our license revenue is generated from our existing customers purchasing additional users and modules.\nOn a constant currency basis, license revenue was $16.6 million for fiscal 2020, representing a $8.4 million, or 34%, decrease from $25 million for fiscal 2019. On a constant currency basis, license revenue decreased across all regions during fiscal 2020 when compared to the prior year. During fiscal 2020, six customers placed license orders totaling more than $0.3 million, one of which exceeded $1.0 million. This compared to fiscal 2019 in which 14 customers placed license orders totaling more than $0.3 million, two of which exceeded $1.0 million.\nMaintenance Revenue. We offer our on-premises customers maintenance which includes support services 24 hours a day, seven days a week in addition to providing software upgrades, which include additional or improved functionality, when and if available.\nWe track our retention rate of maintenance by calculating the annualized revenue of customer sites with contracts up for renewal at the beginning of the period compared to the annualized revenue associated with the customer sites that have canceled during the period. The percentage of revenue not canceled is our retention rate. Over the last three years, our maintenance retention rate has remained in excess of 90%. Conversions to the cloud are not considered cancellations for purposes of this calculation.\nOn a constant currency basis, maintenance revenue was $107.1 million for fiscal 2021, representing a $10.5 million, or 9%, decrease from $117.6 million for fiscal 2020. On a constant currency basis, maintenance revenue decreased in our North America, EMEA, and Asia Pacific regions and increased in our Latin America region during fiscal 2021 when compared to the prior year. The decrease in maintenance revenue period over period is primarily due to customer cancellations and continued conversions of existing customers\u2019 on-premises licenses to cloud subscriptions. When customers convert to the cloud they no longer pay for maintenance as those support services are included as a component of the subscription offering. Though we continue to see renewal rates above 90%, some of our customers have been impacted by the pandemic and therefore, we have seen some increase in maintenance cancellations or maintenance revenue reductions. Conversions to the cloud are not considered cancellations for purposes of the renewal rate calculation.\nOn a constant currency basis, maintenance revenue was $117.9 million for fiscal 2020, representing a $2.7 million, or 2%, decrease from $120.6 million for fiscal 2019. On a constant currency basis, maintenance revenue decreased in our North America, EMEA, and Asia Pacific regions and increased in our Latin America region during fiscal 2020 when compared to the prior year. The decrease in maintenance revenue period over period was primarily due to continued conversions of existing customers\u2019 on-premises licenses to cloud subscription, in addition to our historical attrition rates.\nProfessional Services Revenue. Our professional services business includes technical and application consulting in addition to training, implementations, migrations and upgrades related to our solutions. Although our professional services are optional, our customers use these services when planning, implementing or upgrading our solutions whether in the cloud or on-premises. Professional services revenue growth is contingent upon subscription and license revenue growth and customer upgrade cycles, which are influenced by the strength of general economic and business conditions. In fiscal 2021, services projects were postponed, cancelled or extended due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, we continued to execute on our strategy to increase our partner network and use more partners for services implementations and upgrades.\nOn a constant currency basis, professional services revenue was $58.5 million for fiscal 2021, representing a $10.0 million, or 15%, decrease from $68.5 million for fiscal 2020. On a constant currency basis, professional services revenue decreased across all regions during fiscal 2021 when compared to the prior year. The decrease is primarily related to a reduction in professional services revenue following the completion of a large, multisite global implementation project. In addition, the decrease related to fewer engagements in fiscal 2021 when compared to the prior year.\nOn a constant currency basis, professional services revenue was $69.1 million for fiscal 2020, representing a $21.3 million, or 24%, decrease from $90.4 million for fiscal 2019. On a constant currency basis, professional services revenue decreased across all regions during fiscal 2020 when compared to the prior year. The decrease primarily related to a reduction in professional services revenue following the completion of a large, multisite global implementation project.\nTotal Cost of Revenue\nYear Ended\nJanuary 31,\nYear Ended\nJanuary 31,\nChange in\nConstant\nChange due\nto Currency\nTotal Change\nas Reported\n(in thousands)\nCurrency\nFluctuations\n$\n%\nCost of revenue\nCost of subscription\n$ 42,369\n$ 38,451\n$ (3,993 )\n$\n$ (3,918 )\n%\nCost of license\n2,300\n2,308\n%\nCost of maintenance\n26,039\n29,702\n3,348\n3,663\n%\nCost of professional services\n54,664\n69,448\n14,319\n14,784\n%\nTotal cost of revenue\n$ 125,372\n$ 139,909\n$ 13,676\n$\n$ 14,537\n%\nPercentage of revenue\n%\n%\nYear Ended January 31,\nYear Ended January 31,\nChange in\nConstant\nChange due\nto Currency\nTotal Change\nas Reported\n(in thousands)\nCurrency\nFluctuations\n$\n%\nCost of revenue\nCost of subscription\n$ 38,451\n$ 34,128\n$ (4,455 )\n$\n$ (4,323 )\n%\nCost of license\n2,308\n2,714\n%\nCost of maintenance\n29,702\n31,307\n1,197\n1,605\n%\nCost of professional services\n69,448\n87,735\n16,379\n1,908\n18,287\n%\nTotal cost of revenue\n$ 139,909\n$ 155,884\n$ 13,520\n$ 2,455\n$ 15,975\n%\nPercentage of revenue\n%\n%\nTotal cost of revenue consists of cost of subscription, cost of license, cost of maintenance and cost of professional services. Cost of subscription includes salaries, benefits, bonuses and other personnel expenses of our cloud operations employees, stock-based compensation for those employees, hosting and hardware costs, third-party contractor expense, royalties, professional fees, travel expense, and an allocation of information technology and facilities costs. Cost of license includes license royalties and amortization of capitalized software costs. Cost of maintenance includes salaries, benefits, bonuses and other personnel expenses of our support group, stock-based compensation for those employees, travel expense, royalties, professional fees and an allocation of information technology and facilities costs. Cost of professional services includes salaries, benefits, bonuses and other personnel expenses of our services employees, stock-based compensation for those employees, third-party contractor expense, travel expense and an allocation of information technology and facilities costs.\nTotal Cost of Revenue. On a constant currency basis, total cost of revenue was $125.4 million and $139.0 million for fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively and as a percentage of total revenue was 41% for fiscal 2021 and 45% for fiscal 2020. The decrease in total cost of revenue as a percentage of total revenue was mainly due to improved subscription and professional services margins and the shift of our revenue mix from professional services to subscription. The non-currency related decrease in cost of revenue of $13.6 million, or 10%, in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 was primarily due to lower travel costs and lower salaries and related costs resulting from a decrease in headcount of 61 people associated with decreased professional services revenue, partially offset by higher hosting costs and salaries and related costs associated with the increase in subscription revenue.\nOn a constant currency basis, total cost of revenue was $139.9 million and $153.4 million for fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively and as a percentage of total revenue was 45% for fiscal 2020 and 47% for fiscal 2019. The decrease in total cost of revenue as a percentage of total revenue was mainly due to the shift of our revenue mix from professional services to subscription. The non-currency related decrease in cost of revenue of $13.5 million, or 9%, in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 was primarily due to lower professional services third-party contractor costs, lower travel costs and lower salaries and related costs resulting from a decrease in headcount of 116 people associated with decreased professional services revenue, partially offset by higher hosting costs and salaries and related costs associated with the increase in subscription revenue.\nCost of Subscription. On a constant currency basis, cost of subscription was $42.4 million for fiscal 2021, representing a $4.0 million, or 10%, increase from $38.4 million for fiscal 2020. The non-currency related increase in cost of subscription of $4.0 million in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 was primarily due to higher hosting costs of $2.0 million, higher salaries and related costs of $1.6 million as a result of higher headcount of 19 people, and higher bonuses of $0.3 million. Cost of subscription as a percentage of subscription revenue was 32% and 36% in fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively. We have continued to improve our subscription margins over time due to leveraging of ongoing economies of scale and implementing operational efficiencies. We have experienced, and may experience in the future, quarterly fluctuations in our subscription margins as we make investments in our data centers and cloud operations to support future growth.\nOn a constant currency basis, cost of subscription was $38.5 million for fiscal 2020, representing a $4.5 million, or 13%, increase from $34.0 million for fiscal 2019. The non-currency related increase in cost of subscription of $4.5 million in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 was primarily due to higher hosting costs of $2.3 million, higher salaries and related costs of $1.0 million as a result of higher headcount of 19 people, higher cross-charges from professional services to support conversion and upgrade projects of $0.4 million and higher information technology and facilities allocated costs of $0.4 million. Cost of subscription as a percentage of subscription revenue was 36% and 37% in fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nCost of License. On a constant currency basis, cost of license was $2.3 million for both fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020. Cost of license consisted primarily of amortization of capitalized software costs and royalty expense. License royalty expense as a percent of license revenue remained relatively consistent year over year. Amortization of capitalized software costs was $1.3 million in fiscal 2021 compared to $0.9 million in fiscal 2020.\nOn a constant currency basis, cost of license was $2.3 million for fiscal 2020, representing a $0.4 million, or 15%, decrease from $2.7 million for fiscal 2019. Cost of license consisted primarily of amortization of capitalized software costs and royalty expense, which as a percent of license revenue, remained relatively consistent year over year.\nCost of Maintenance. On a constant currency basis, cost of maintenance was $26.0 million for fiscal 2021, representing a $3.4 million, or 11%, decrease from $29.4 million for fiscal 2020. The non-currency related decrease in cost of maintenance of $3.4 million in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 was primarily due to lower salaries and related costs of $1.7 million as a result of lower headcount of 19 people, lower royalties of $0.7 million and lower information technology and facilities allocated costs of $0.7 million. Cost of maintenance as a percentage of maintenance revenue was 24% and 25% in fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nOn a constant currency basis, cost of maintenance was $29.7 million for fiscal 2020, representing a $1.2 million, or 4%, decrease from $30.9 million for fiscal 2019. The non-currency related increase in cost of maintenance of $1.2 million in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 was primarily due to lower royalties of $0.4 million and lower salaries and related costs of $0.4 million. Cost of maintenance as a percentage of maintenance revenue was 25% in both fiscal 2020 and 2019.\nCost of Professional Services. On a constant currency basis, cost of professional services was $54.7 million for fiscal 2021, representing a $14.3 million, or 21%, decrease from $69.0 million for fiscal 2020. The non-currency related decrease in cost of professional services of $14.3 million was primarily due to lower salaries and related costs of $6.9 million as a result of a decrease in headcount of approximately 61 people, lower travel of $4.3 million, lower information technology and facilities allocated costs of $1.6 million, lower bonuses of $1.3 million, and lower severance of $0.4 million. These lower costs were partially offset by lower cross-charges to other departments of $0.4 million. Cost of professional services as a percentage of professional services revenue was 93% for fiscal 2021 and 100% for fiscal 2020. During the pandemic we completed our consulting projects remotely and we expect to continue performing consulting engagements remotely subsequent to the pandemic.\nOn a constant currency basis, cost of professional services was $69.4 million for fiscal 2020, representing a $16.4 million, or 19%, decrease from $85.8 million for fiscal 2019. The non-currency related decrease in cost of professional services of $16.4 million was primarily due to lower third-party contractor costs of $7.6 million, lower travel of $3.8 million, lower salaries and related costs of $2.5 million as a result of a decrease in headcount of approximately 116 people, lower cross-charges from other departments to support conversion and upgrade projects of $1.7 million, lower bonuses of $1.2 million and lower information technology and facilities allocated costs of $0.3 million. These lower costs were partially offset by higher severance of $0.7 million and higher stock compensation of $0.2 million. Cost of professional services as a percentage of professional services revenue was 100% for fiscal 2020 and 95% for fiscal 2019.\nSales and Marketing\nYear Ended\nJanuary 31,\nYear Ended\nJanuary 31,\nChange in\nConstant\nChange due\nto Currency\nTotal Change\nas Reported\n(in thousands)\nCurrency\nFluctuations\n$\n%\nSales and marketing\n$ 71,779\n$ 82,115\n$ 10,540\n$ (204 )\n$ 10,336\n%\nPercentage of revenue\n%\n%\nYear Ended\nJanuary 31,\nYear Ended\nJanuary 31,\nChange in\nConstant\nChange due\nto Currency\nTotal Change\nas Reported\n(in thousands)\nCurrency\nFluctuations\n$\n%\nSales and marketing\n$ 82,115\n$ 78,207\n$ (5,041 )\n$ 1,133\n$ (3,908 )\n%\nPercentage of revenue\n%\n%\nSales and marketing expense includes salaries, benefits, commissions, bonuses, stock-based compensation, travel expense and other personnel costs of our sales and marketing employees in addition to costs of programs aimed at increasing revenue, such as trade shows, user group events, lead generation, advertising and various sales and promotional programs. Sales and marketing expense also includes sales agent fees and an allocation of information technology and facilities costs.\nOn a constant currency basis, sales and marketing expense was $71.8 million for fiscal 2021, representing a $10.5 million, or 13%, decrease from $82.3 million for fiscal 2020. The non-currency related decrease in sales and marketing expense of $10.5 million in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 was primarily due to lower travel costs of $5.4 million, lower severance of $2.2 million, lower bonuses of $1.7 million, lower customer conference costs of $0.7 million, lower professional fees of $0.6 million, lower recruiting costs of $0.5 million, lower marketing costs of $0.4 million and lower cross charges from other departments of $0.3 million. These lower costs were partially offset by higher stock-based compensation of $0.8 million and higher salaries and related costs of $0.4 million as a result of higher headcount of approximately seven people. The global pandemic resulted in savings from a significant reduction in travel and the cancellation of QAD\u2019s Explore annual customer conference in the second quarter of fiscal year 2021.\nOn a constant currency basis, sales and marketing expense was $82.1 million for fiscal 2020, representing a $5.0 million, or 6%, increase from $77.1 million for fiscal 2019. The non-currency related increase in sales and marketing expense of $5.0 million in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 was primarily due to higher salaries and related costs of $1.9 million as a result of higher headcount of approximately 16 people, higher severance of $1.5 million, higher sales agent fees of $1.0 million, higher information technology and facilities allocated costs of $0.7 million, higher costs of personnel from other departments performing demonstrations of $0.6 million, higher recruiting fees of $0.6 million and higher bonuses of $0.3 million. These higher expenses were offset by lower commission expense of $2.0 million. Sales and marketing expenses benefitted $2.9 million from moving 30 order processing employees to general and administrative expense.\nResearch and Development\nYear Ended\nJanuary 31,\nYear Ended\nJanuary 31,\nChange in\nConstant\nChange due\nto Currency\nTotal Change\nas Reported\n(in thousands)\nCurrency\nFluctuations\n$\n%\nResearch and development\n$ 56,084\n$ 54,726\n$ (1,186 )\n$ (172 )\n$ (1,358 )\n%\nPercentage of revenue\n%\n%\nYear Ended\nJanuary 31,\nYear Ended\nJanuary 31,\nChange in\nConstant\nChange due\nto Currency\nTotal Change\nas Reported\n(in thousands)\nCurrency\nFluctuations\n$\n%\nResearch and development\n$ 54,726\n$ 53,993\n$ (1,665 )\n$\n$ (733 )\n%\nPercentage of revenue\n%\n%\nResearch and development is expensed as incurred and consists primarily of salaries, benefits, bonuses, stock-based compensation, travel expense and other personnel costs for research and development employees in addition to professional services, such as fees paid to software development firms and independent contractors. Research and development expense includes an allocation of information technology and facilities costs, and is reduced by capitalized localization and translation costs.\nOn a constant currency basis, research and development expense was $56.1 million for fiscal 2021, representing a $1.2 million, or 2%, increase from $54.9 million for fiscal 2020. The non-currency related increase in research and development expense of $1.2 million in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 was primarily due to higher salaries and related costs of $1.5 million as a result of higher headcount of approximately 11 people, higher bonuses of $0.4 million and higher stock-based compensation of $0.3 million partially offset by lower travel costs of $0.6 million and a payroll tax credit of $0.6 million.\nOn a constant currency basis, research and development expense was $54.7 million for fiscal 2020, representing a $1.6 million, or 3%, increase from $53.1 million for fiscal 2019. The non-currency related increase in research and development expense of $1.6 million in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 was primarily due to higher salaries and related costs of $0.9 million as a result of higher headcount of approximately 16 people, higher cross-charges from other departments of $0.6 million and higher information technology and facilities allocated costs of $0.4 million. These higher costs support the development of advanced technologies in the areas of robotic process automation, machine learning and the industrial Internet of Things.\nGeneral and Administrative\nYear Ended\nJanuary 31,\nYear Ended\nJanuary 31,\nChange in\nConstant\nChange due\nto Currency\nTotal Change\nas Reported\n(in thousands)\nCurrency\nFluctuations\n$\n%\nGeneral and Administrative\n$ 41,643\n$ 39,442\n$ (2,407 )\n$\n$ (2,201 )\n%\nPercentage of revenue\n%\n%\nYear Ended\nJanuary 31,\nYear Ended\nJanuary 31,\nChange in\nConstant\nChange due\nto Currency\nTotal Change\nas Reported\n(in thousands)\nCurrency\nFluctuations\n$\n%\nGeneral and Administrative\n$ 39,442\n$ 35,248\n$ (4,541 )\n$\n$ (4,194 )\n%\nPercentage of revenue\n%\n%\nGeneral and administrative expense includes salaries, benefits, bonuses, stock-based compensation, travel expense and other personnel costs related to our finance, human resources, legal and executive personnel.

The non-currency related increase in general and administrative expense of $2.4 million in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 was primarily due to higher stock-based compensation of $1.3 million, higher salaries and related costs of $0.7 million, as a result of higher headcount of seven people, higher legal fees of $0.4 million and higher bad debt expense of $0.4 million. These higher costs were partially offset by lower travel costs of $0.6 million. The Company increased its bad debt reserve to provide for the global economic downturn associated with COVID-19.\nOn a constant currency basis, general and administrative expense was $39.4 million for fiscal 2020, representing a $4.5 million, or 13%, increase from $34.9 million for fiscal 2019. The non-currency related increase in general and administrative expense of $4.5 million in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 was primarily due to higher personnel and other costs of $2.9 million, as a result of moving our order processing employees from sales and marketing expense to general and administrative expense, higher salaries and related costs of $0.9 million, higher stock compensation of $0.8 million and higher information technology and facilities allocated costs of $0.4 million. These higher costs were partially offset by lower accounting fees of $0.4 million.\nAmortization of Intangible Assets from Acquisitions\nAmortization of intangible assets from acquisitions totaled $0.3 million, $0.3 million and $0.1 million for fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nTotal Other Expense (Income)\nYear Ended\nJanuary 31,\nIncrease\n(Decrease)\nCompared\nto Prior Period\nYear Ended\nJanuary 31,\nIncrease\n(Decrease)\nCompared\nto Prior Period\nYear Ended\nJanuary 31,\n(in thousands)\n$\n%\n$\n%\nOther expense (income)\nInterest income\n$ (923 )\n$ (1,859 )\n%\n$ (2,782 )\n$\n%\n$ (2,600 )\nInterest expense\n%\n%\nOther expense (income), net\n2,209\n(2,141 )\n3,149 %\n(455 )\n%\n(387 )\nTotal other expense (income), net\n$ 1,877\n$ (3,961 )\n%\n$ (2,084 )\n$ (260 )\n%\n$ (2,344 )\nPercentage of revenue\n%\n%\n%\nTotal other expense (income), net was $1.9 million, $(2.1) million and $(2.3) million for fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. When comparing fiscal 2021 to fiscal 2020, the unfavorable change is primarily related to higher foreign exchange losses of $2.1 million and lower interest income of $1.9 million. The U.S. dollar versus foreign currencies exchange rates in the countries where we conduct business have fluctuated significantly since the onset of the global pandemic COVID-19, most notably versus the euro, Australian dollar, Mexican peso and British pound. When comparing fiscal 2020 to fiscal 2019, the unfavorable change is primarily related to a decrease in the fair value of our interest rate swap of $0.3 million and lower foreign exchange gains of $0.2 million partially offset by higher interest income of $0.2 million.\nInterest rate swap valuations and foreign exchange gains and losses are subject to changes which are inherently unpredictable. Our interest rate swap is accounted for using mark-to-market accounting. Accordingly, changes in the fair value of the swap each reporting period are adjusted through earnings, subjecting us to non-cash volatility in our results of operations. The swap fixes the interest rate on our mortgage to 4.31% over the entire term of the mortgage. Although the agreement allows us to prepay the loan and exit the agreement early, we have no intention of doing so. As a result, we will have non-cash adjustments through earnings each reporting period. Over the term of the mortgage, however, the net impact of these mark-to-market adjustments on earnings will be zero.\nIncome Tax (Benefit) Expense\nYear Ended\nJanuary 31,\nIncrease\n(Decrease)\nCompared\nto Prior Period\nYear Ended\nJanuary 31,\nIncrease\n(Decrease)\nCompared\nto Prior Period\nYear Ended\nJanuary 31,\n(in thousands)\n$\n%\n$\n%\nIncome tax (benefit) expense\n$ (244 )\n$ (12,589 )\n%\n$ 12,345\n$ 10,856\n%\n$ 1,489\nPercentage of revenue\n%\n%\n%\nEffective tax rate\n%\n%\n%\nWe recorded income tax (benefit) expense of $(0.2) million, $12.3 million and $1.5 million for fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019 respectively. QAD\u2019s effective tax rate was -2%, -343%, and 12% for fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. We incurred pre-tax income of $10.8 million in fiscal 2021 versus a pre-tax loss of $(3.6) million in fiscal 2020. The change in effective tax rate in fiscal 2021 was primarily due to the release of $3.5 million in valuation allowances, including $2.9 million and $0.6 million valuation allowance releases on the net deferred tax assets of the Company\u2019s Germany and Hong Kong entities, respectively.\nWe incurred a pre-tax loss of ($3.6) million in fiscal 2020 versus a pre-tax income of $11.9 million in fiscal 2019. The change in effective tax rate in fiscal 2020 was primarily due to increases in valuation allowances of $16.2 million, which was mainly comprised of a $10.3 million valuation allowance placed on the net deferred tax assets of the Company\u2019s wholly-owned Irish subsidiary (the Irish principal) and additional valuation allowances of $5.2 million related to our U.S. entity which is fully valued.\nOur effective tax rate is affected by the relative amount of our foreign earnings. In fiscal 2021, our foreign earnings were primarily generated from India and Mexico. These countries have higher statutory and effective tax rates than the U.S. Additionally, we were not able to realize related benefits from operating in Ireland due to a valuation allowance placed against our Irish principal.\nOn March 27, 2020, the U.S. government enacted the \u201cCoronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act\u201d (CARES Act). The CARES Act includes provisions relating to refundable payroll tax credits, deferment of employer side social security payments, net operating loss carryback periods, alternative minimum tax (AMT) credit refunds, modifications to the net interest deduction limitations and technical corrections to tax depreciation methods for qualified improvement property. During fiscal year 2021, the Company applied the provisions related to the AMT refunds and the tax technical corrections to qualified improvement property.\nFor further information regarding income taxes, see Note 4 \u201cIncome Taxes\u201d within the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nRegulation S-K Item 10(e), \u201cUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures in Commission Filings,\u201d defines and prescribes the conditions for use of non-GAAP financial information. Our measures of non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA margins, non-GAAP pre-tax income and estimated cash taxes on GAAP earnings each meet the definition of a non-GAAP financial measure. We define the non-GAAP measures as follows:\n\u25cf\nNon-GAAP adjusted EBITDA - EBITDA is GAAP net income before net interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization. Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA is EBITDA less stock-based compensation expense and the change in the fair value of our interest rate swap.\n\u25cf\nNon-GAAP adjusted EBITDA margins - Calculated by dividing non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA by total revenue.\n\u25cf\nNon-GAAP pre-tax income - GAAP income before income taxes not including the effects of stock-based compensation expense, amortization of purchased intangible assets and the change in fair value of our interest rate swap.\nQAD\u2019s management uses non-GAAP measures internally to evaluate the business and believes that presenting non-GAAP measures provides useful information to investors regarding the underlying business trends and performance of our ongoing operations as well as useful metrics for monitoring our performance and evaluating it against industry peers. The non-GAAP financial measures presented should be used in addition to, and in conjunction with, results presented in accordance with GAAP, and should not be relied upon to the exclusion of GAAP financial measures. Management strongly encourages investors to review our consolidated financial statements in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure in evaluating the company.\nQAD non-GAAP measures reflect adjustments based on the following items:\nStock-based compensation expense: We have excluded the effect of stock-based compensation expense from our non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP pre-tax income calculations. Although stock-based compensation expense is calculated in accordance with current GAAP and constitutes an ongoing and recurring expense, such expense is excluded from non-GAAP results because it is not an expense which generally requires cash settlement by QAD, and therefore is not used by us to assess the profitability of our operations. We also believe the exclusion of stock-based compensation expense provides a more useful comparison of our operating results to the operating results of our peers.\nAmortization of purchased intangible assets: We amortize purchased intangible assets in connection with our acquisitions. We have excluded the effect of amortization of purchased intangible assets, which include purchased technology, customer relationships, trade names and other intangible assets, from our non-GAAP pre-tax income calculation, because doing so makes internal comparisons to our historical operating results more consistent. In addition, we believe excluding amortization of purchased intangible assets provides a more useful comparison of our operating results to the operating results of our peers.\nChange in fair value of the interest rate swap: We entered into an interest rate swap to mitigate our exposure to the variability of one-month LIBOR for our floating rate debt related to the mortgage of our headquarters. We have excluded the gain/loss adjustments to record the interest rate swap at fair value from our non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP pre-tax income calculations. We believe that these fluctuations are not indicative of our operational costs or meaningful in evaluating comparative period results because we currently have no intention of exiting the debt agreement early; and therefore over the life of the debt the sum of the fair value adjustments will be zero.\nThe following table sets forth the reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures of adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margins and non-GAAP pre-tax income to the most comparable GAAP measures for fiscal years 2020, 2020 and 2019 (in thousands):\nYears Ended January 31,\nTotal revenue\n$ 307,865\n$ 310,772\n$ 333,016\nNet income(loss)\n11,065\n(15,949 )\n10,428\nAdd back:\nNet interest (income) expense\n(332 )\n(2,152 )\n(1,957 )\nDepreciation\n5,334\n5,198\n4,734\nAmortization\n1,485\n1,316\nIncome tax (benefit) expense\n(244 )\n12,345\n1,489\nEBITDA\n$ 17,308\n$\n$ 15,466\nAdd back:\nStock based compensation expense\n14,192\n11,354\n10,122\nChange in fair value of interest rate swap\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$ 31,593\n$ 12,480\n$ 25,639\nAdjusted EBITDA margin\n%\n%\n%\nNon-GAAP pre-tax income reconciliation\nIncome (loss) before income tax expense\n$ 10,821\n$ (3,604 )\n$ 11,917\nAdd back\nStock-based compensation expense\n14,192\n11,354\n10,122\nAmortization of purchased intangible assets\nChange in fair value of interest rate swap\nNon-GAAP income before income taxes\n$ 25,524\n$ 8,413\n$ 22,215\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nOur primary source of cash is from the sale of subscriptions, licenses, maintenance and professional services to our customers. Our primary use of cash is payment of our operating expenses which mainly consist of employee-related expenses, such as compensation and benefits, as well as general operating expenses for facilities, third-party hosting providers, third party contractors and other overhead costs. In addition to operating expenses, we may also use cash for capital expenditures; payment of dividends; payment of our mortgage; withholding taxes on the settlement of stock-based compensation and stock repurchases; and to invest in our growth initiatives, which may include acquisitions of products, technologies and businesses.\nAt January 31, 2021, our principal sources of liquidity were cash and equivalents totaling $142.5 million and net accounts receivable of $82.6 million. Our cash and equivalents consisted of current bank accounts, registered money market funds and time delineated deposits. Approximately 84% of our cash and equivalents were held in U.S. dollar denominated accounts as of January 31, 2021.\nOur primary commercial banking relationship is with Bank of America and its global affiliates. Our largest cash concentrations are in the United States and Ireland. The percentage of cash and equivalents held outside of the United States was 58% and 69% as of January 31, 2021 and January 31, 2020, respectively. The majority of our cash and equivalents are held in investment accounts which are predominantly placed in money market mutual funds, U.S. Treasury and government securities funds. The remaining cash and equivalents are held in deposit accounts and certificates of deposit.\nWe are a U.S.-based multinational company subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. In addition to providing for U.S. income taxes on earnings from the United States, we provide for U.S. income taxes on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries unless the subsidiaries\u2019 earnings are considered permanently reinvested outside the United States. We consider the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as permanently reinvested. We do not anticipate changing our intention regarding permanently reinvested earnings as of the balance sheet date.\nIn December 2017, the United States signed into law the Tax Cuts and Job Act, (the Tax Act). The Tax Act includes a mandatory one-time tax on accumulated earnings of our foreign subsidiaries which resulted in $0.7 million of additional U.S. tax and is being paid in equal installments over eight years beginning in fiscal 2019. In spite of the U.S. taxation on these earnings, we intend to permanently reinvest the earnings in our foreign subsidiaries. Should we decide to repatriate these earnings in the future, we would not expect to incur significant additional taxes; however, foreign withholding taxes, currency translation, state taxes and currency control laws must always be considered.\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nYears Ended January 31,\n(in thousands)\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$ 32,872\n$ 16,997\n$ 19,007\nNet cash used in investing activities\n(15,906 )\n(5,712 )\n(9,258 )\nNet cash used in financing activities\n(12,637 )\n(12,275 )\n(14,691 )\nEffect of foreign exchange rates on cash and equivalents\n1,455\n(1,706 )\n(2,668 )\nNet increase (decrease) in cash and equivalents\n$ 5,784\n$ (2,696 )\n$ (7,610 )\nTypical factors affecting our cash provided by operating activities include our level of revenue and earnings for the period; the timing and amount of employee-related compensation payments, vendor payments and tax payments; and the timing and amount of billings and cash collections from our customers, which is our largest source of operating cash flow. Net cash flows provided by operating activities were $32.9 million and $17.0 million for fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively. The increase in cash flows from operating activities was due primarily to net income of $11.1 million for fiscal 2021 compared to a net loss of $(15.9) million for fiscal 2020 partially offset by the lower positive cash flow effect of changes in non-cash items (including net change in valuation allowance, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, change in fair value of interest rate swap and provision of doubtful/sales adjustments) of $9.0 million and higher negative cash flow effect of changes in assets and liabilities of $2.1 million. While our revenue has declined due to the global pandemic, we have implemented cost control initiatives such as reduced travel and discretionary spending. In addition, most of our customer events were cancelled. This has lowered expenses and preserved cash.\nNet cash flows provided by operating activities were $17.0 million and $19.0 million for fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively. The decrease in cash flows from operating activities was due primarily to lower net income of $26.4 million partially offset by the positive cash flow effect of changes in non-cash items (including net change in valuation allowance, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, change in fair value of interest rate swap and provision of doubtful/sales adjustments) of $18.7 million.\nNet cash used in investing activities consisted primarily of acquisitions and capital expenditures. Capital expenditures were $1.9 million, $5.7 million and $4.3 million for fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We continue to monitor our capital spending and do not believe we are delaying critical capital expenditures required to run our business. During the second quarter of fiscal 2020, the Company vacated its building located in Dublin, Ireland, and moved its operations into leased office space. The sale of the building was completed in the third quarter of fiscal 2021 for $1.5 million in proceeds. During fiscal 2021, we acquired Allocation Network GmbH in order to enhance our product offering in the Supply Chain area. The total purchase price, excluding future earn-out payments, was $14.2 million, net of cash acquired of $0.9 million, and funded entirely with cash on hand. During fiscal 2019, we made two acquisitions. We acquired the assets of one of our Indonesian software distributors and made another acquisition to add functionality to our product suite. The total purchase price of the two fiscal 2019 acquisitions was $2.7 million and funded entirely with cash on hand.\nNet cash used in financing activities consisted primarily of payments of withholding taxes on settlement of stock-based compensation and payment of dividends. We paid withholding taxes of $6.2 million, $6.1 million and $8.7 million in fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, on vested restricted stock units and exercised stock appreciation rights. We made dividend payments of $5.8 million, $5.6 million and $5.5 million in fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. On a regular basis the Board of Directors evaluates our ability to continue to pay dividends as well as the structure of any potential dividend payments.\nWe have historically calculated accounts receivable days\u2019 sales outstanding (DSO), using the countback, or last-in first-out, method. This method calculates the number of days of billed revenue represented by the accounts receivable balance as of period end. When reviewing the performance of our entities, DSO under the countback method is used by management. It is management\u2019s belief that the countback method best reflects the relative health of our accounts receivable as of a given quarter-end or year-end because of the cyclical nature of our billings. Our billing cycle includes high annual maintenance renewal billings at year-end that will not be recognized as earned revenue until future periods.\nDSO under the countback method was relatively consistent at 47 days and 45 days as of January 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. DSO using the average method, which is calculated utilizing the accounts receivable balance and earned revenue for the most recent quarter, was 90 days and 93 days as of January 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The aging of our accounts receivable as of January 31, 2021 remained consistent in comparison with the aging as of January 31, 2020. We believe our reserve methodology is adequate, our reserves are properly stated as of January 31, 2021 and the quality of our receivables remains good.\nSome of our customers who have been negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic have requested and may continue to request changes to payment terms. Some may also be unable to pay their receivables as they become due. We adopted ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments on February 1, 2020, which requires the measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for financial assets held at amortized cost, which includes our accounts receivables and contract assets. Our expected loss allowance methodology for accounts receivable is developed using historical collection experience, consideration of current and anticipated future economic conditions and other relevant data. For fiscal 2021, our expected loss allowance included consideration of the current and expected future economic and market conditions surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic. We recorded an increase of $0.7 million in estimated credit losses related to the impact of COVID-19 on our customers. We have not experienced any significant impact to accounts receivable quality or credit terms and the aging of our accounts receivable remained similar to the same period last year.\nContractual Obligations\nIn the normal course of business, QAD enters into various contractual obligations for the purchase of goods or services. Our most significant purchase obligations relate primarily to information technology infrastructure costs, multi-year hosting services agreements and costs associated with our sales and marketing events. They are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding for QAD which specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. As of January 31, 2021, our contractual purchase obligations have payments of $11.9 million due in the next 12 months and $11.5 million due thereafter. These amounts exclude certain short-term contracts relating to normal recurring purchasing activity. With respect to purchase obligations that are cancelable by QAD, these amounts generally include the amounts that would have been payable if we had canceled the obligations as of January 31, 2021. We expect to fund these obligations with cash flows from operations and cash on our balance sheet.\nWe have certain royalty commitments associated with the licensing of certain products. Royalty expense is generally based on the number of licenses delivered or being used in the cloud environment; or a percentage of the underlying revenue. Royalty expense, included in cost of subscription, license and maintenance revenue, was $18.3 million, $18.3 million and $18.6 million in fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nObligations Associated With Acquisitions\nWe estimate the fair value of the contingent consideration issued in business combinations using a Monte Carlo valuation approach, as well as unobservable inputs, such as forecasted financial information, reflecting our assessment of the assumptions market participants would use to value these liabilities. The fair value of our liability-classified contingent consideration is remeasured at each reporting period with any changes in the fair value recorded as income or expense. In connection with our acquisition of Allocation Network GmbH, we entered into an agreement that included future payments that are contingent upon achievement of certain development and earnings-based milestones. The potential undiscounted amount of all future cash payments under the contingent consideration agreements is between zero and $10.2 million as of January 31, 2021.\nNote Payable\nEffective May 30, 2012, QAD Ortega Hill, LLC, a consolidated entity of QAD Inc., entered into a variable rate credit agreement (the 2012 Mortgage) with Mechanics Bank (formerly Rabobank, N.A.), to refinance a pre-existing mortgage. The 2012 Mortgage has an original principal balance of $16.1 million and bears interest at the one-month LIBOR rate plus 2.25%. One-month LIBOR was 0.13% at January 31, 2021. The 2012 Mortgage matures in June 2022 and is secured by the Company\u2019s headquarters located in Santa Barbara, California. In conjunction with the 2012 Mortgage, QAD Ortega Hill, LLC entered into an interest rate swap with Mechanics Bank. The swap agreement has an initial notional amount of $16.1 million and a schedule matching that of the underlying loan that synthetically fixes the interest rate on the debt at 4.31% for the entire term of the 2012 Mortgage. The terms of the 2012 Mortgage provide for QAD Ortega Hill, LLC to make net monthly payments of $88,100 consisting of principal and interest and one final payment of $11.7 million. The unpaid balance as of January 31, 2021 was $12.4 million.\nLease Obligations\nWe lease certain office facilities, office equipment and automobiles under lease agreements. Although our office lease agreements end on various dates through fiscal year 2032, they typically include termination options at earlier dates. For further discussion of our leased office facilities, see Item 2 entitled \u201cProperties\u201d included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For further information regarding leases, see Note 11 \u201cLeases\u201d within the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThere have been no material changes in our contractual obligations or commercial commitments outside the ordinary course of business. Cash requirements for items other than normal operating expenses are anticipated for capital expenditures, dividend payments and other equity transactions. We may require cash for acquisitions of new businesses, software products and technologies complementary to our business.\nWe are continuing to monitor the impact of COVID-19 on our operating results and liquidity and believe the global pandemic will negatively impact operating results and liquidity in fiscal 2022 until vaccines are distributed and the global economy recovers. We will continue with cost savings measures in the areas of travel and discretionary spending. Subsequent to the pandemic, we do not anticipate a return to prior spending levels in travel and are reviewing opportunities to reduce our office footprint over time. Because we have $142.5 million of cash and our only debt is the mortgage of our corporate headquarters of $12.4 million, we believe we are in a solid position to withstand the negative impacts to our revenue, operating income and liquidity. We believe that our cash on hand and net cash provided by operating activities will provide us with sufficient resources to meet our current and long-term working capital requirements, debt service, dividend payments and other cash needs for at least the next twelve months.\nOur revenue, earnings, cash flows, receivables, and payables are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. See Part II, Item 7A, \u201cQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\u201d for further discussion.\nSeasonal Nature of Deferred Revenue, Accounts Receivable and Operating Cash Flow. Deferred revenue primarily consists of billings to customers for maintenance and subscription. When renewing maintenance we generally invoice our customers in annual cycles and when renewing subscription we generally invoice our customers quarterly or annually. We typically issue renewal invoices in advance of the renewal period. The invoice for initial maintenance and subsequent invoices for maintenance renewal may occur in different quarters of the relevant year. This may result in quarterly fluctuations in deferred revenue and accounts receivable. There is a disproportionate weighting towards annual billings in the fourth quarter, primarily as a result of a significant number of annual maintenance contacts renewed during the fourth quarter. Our fourth quarters have also historically been our strongest quarter for new business and renewals, although in recent years we have seen less of a fourth quarter effect. The year on year compounding effect of this seasonality in both billing patterns and overall new and renewal business causes the value of invoices that we generate in the fourth quarter for both new business and renewals to increase as a proportion of our total annual billings.\nThe sequential quarterly changes in accounts receivable, related deferred revenue and operating cash flow during the first three quarters of our fiscal year are not necessarily indicative of the billing activity that occurs in the fourth quarter as displayed below (in thousands):\nJanuary 31,\nOctober 31,\nJuly 31,\nApril 30,\nFiscal 2021\nAccounts receivable, net\n$ 82,609\n$ 39,187\n$ 42,270\n$ 46,572\nDeferred revenue, current\n125,724\n85,842\n95,049\n102,302\nOperating cash flow (1)\n13,646\n3,202\n5,112\n10,912\nJanuary 31,\nOctober 31,\nJuly 31,\nApril 30,\nFiscal 2020\nAccounts receivable, net\n$ 80,968\n$ 39,748\n$ 41,495\n$ 49,019\nDeferred revenue, current\n118,413\n81,893\n94,399\n104,471\nOperating cash flow (1)\n9,144\n(6,477 )\n14,195\nJanuary 31,\nOctober 31,\nJuly 31,\nApril 30,\nFiscal 2019\nAccounts receivable, net\n$ 81,577\n$ 46,420\n$ 54,258\n$ 56,909\nDeferred revenue, current\n115,253\n80,537\n91,195\n103,369\nOperating cash flow (1)\n3,890\n5,971\n5,361\n3,785\n(1)\nOperating cash flow represents net cash provided by (used in) operating activities for the three months ended in the periods stated above.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nAs of January 31, 2021, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(b)(8) of SEC Regulation S-K.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThe SEC defines \u201ccritical accounting policies\u201d as those that require application of management\u2019s most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments. These policies often require us to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain and are subject to change in subsequent periods.\nWe consider the following policies to be critical because of the significance of these items to our operating results and the estimation processes and management judgment involved in each:\n\u25cf\nRevenue\n\u25cf\nIncome taxes\nOur senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures. Historically, estimates described in our critical accounting policies that have required significant judgment and estimation on the part of management have been reasonably accurate.\nRevenue. We offer our software using the same underlying technology via two models: a cloud-based subscription model and a traditional on-premises licensing model. Under the cloud-based subscription delivery model, we provide access to our software on a hosted basis as a service and customers generally do not have the contractual right to take possession of the software. The on-premises model involves the sale or license of software on a perpetual basis to customers who take possession of the software and install and maintain the software on their own hardware.\nWe generate revenue through subscriptions of our cloud-based software and through sales of licenses and maintenance provided to our on-premises customers. We offer professional services to both our cloud and on-premises customers to assist them with the design, testing and implementation of our software.\nWe determine revenue recognition through the following steps:\n\u25cf\nIdentification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer;\n\u25cf\nIdentification of the performance obligations in the contract;\n\u25cf\nDetermination of the transaction price;\n\u25cf\nAllocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and\n\u25cf\nRecognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation.\nRevenue is presented net of sales, value-added and other taxes collected from customers and remitted to government authorities.\nPerformance Obligations\nA performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer and is the unit of account under ASC Topic 606. The transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied by transferring the promised good or service to the customer. We identify and track the performance obligations at contract inception so that we can monitor and account for the performance obligations over the life of the contract.\nOur contracts which contain multiple performance obligations generally consist of the initial purchase of subscription or licenses and a professional services engagement. License purchases generally have multiple performance obligations as customers purchase maintenance in addition to the licenses. Our single performance obligation arrangements are typically maintenance renewals, subscription renewals and services engagements.\nFor contracts with multiple performance obligations where the contracted price differs from the standalone selling price (SSP) for any distinct good or service, we may be required to allocate the contract\u2019s transaction price to each performance obligation using our best estimate for the SSP. SSP is assessed annually using a historical analysis of contracts with customers executed in the most recently completed fiscal year to determine the range of selling prices applicable to a distinct good or service.\nJudgment is required to determine the SSP for each distinct performance obligation. In instances where SSP is not directly observable because we do not sell the license, product or service separately, we determine the SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. In making these judgments, we analyze various factors, including our pricing methodology and consistency, size of the arrangement, length of term, customer demographics and overall market and economic conditions. Based on these results, the estimated SSP is set for each distinct product or service delivered to customers. We rarely sell licenses on a stand-alone basis, as the majority of our license sales to customers include first year maintenance with the license purchase. We frequently sell subscription, maintenance and services on a stand-alone basis.\nSubscription\nSubscription revenue is recognized ratably over the initial subscription period committed to by the customer commencing when the cloud environment is made available to the customer. The initial subscription period is typically 24 to 60 months. We generally invoice our customers in advance in quarterly or annual installments and typical payment terms provide that customers make payment within 30 days of invoice. In addition, a majority of customers renew their subscription contracts annually and typical payment terms provide that customers make payment within 30 days of invoice.\nSoftware Licenses\nTransfer of control for software is considered to have occurred upon electronic delivery of the license key that provides immediate availability of the product to the customer. License revenue is recognized upon delivery of the license key. Our typical payment terms tend to vary by region but our standard payment terms are within 30-90 days of invoice.\nMaintenance\nRevenue from support services and product updates provided to the Company\u2019s on-premises customers, referred to as maintenance revenue, is recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance period, which in most instances is one year. Software license updates provide customers with rights to unspecified software product updates, maintenance releases and patches released during the term of the support period on a when-and-if available basis. Product support includes Internet access to technical content, as well as Internet and telephone access to technical support personnel. Our customers purchase both product support and license updates via our maintenance offering when they acquire new software licenses. In addition, a majority of customers renew their maintenance contracts annually and typical payment terms provide that customers make payment within 30 days of invoice.\nProfessional Services\nRevenue from professional services is typically comprised of implementation, development, training or other consulting services. Consulting services are generally sold on a time-and-materials or fixed fee basis and can include services ranging from software installation to data conversion and building non-complex interfaces to allow the software to operate in integrated environments. We recognize revenue for time-and-materials arrangements as the services are performed. In fixed fee arrangements, revenue is recognized as services are performed as measured by costs incurred to date, compared to total estimated costs to complete the services project. Management applies judgment when estimating project status and the costs necessary to complete the services projects. A number of internal and external factors can affect these estimates, including labor rates; utilization and efficiency variances and specification and testing requirement changes. Services are generally invoiced upon milestones in the contract or upon consumption of the hourly resources and payments are typically due 30 days after invoice.\nIndirect Sales Channels\nWe execute arrangements through indirect sales channels via sales agents and distributors who are authorized to market our software products to end users. In arrangements with sales agents, QAD contracts directly with the customer and the sales agents are compensated on a commission basis. Distributor arrangements are those in which the resellers are authorized to market and distribute our software products to end users in specified territories and the distributor bears the risk of collection from the end user customer. We recognize revenue from transactions with distributors when the distributor submits a signed agreement and transfer of control has occurred to the distributor, in accordance with the five revenue recognition steps noted above. Revenue from distributor transactions is recorded on a net basis (the amount actually received by us from the distributor). We do not offer rights of return, product rotation or price protection to any of our distributors. During the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021, our revenue from sales agents and distributors was less than 15% of total subscription, license and maintenance revenue.\nManagement Judgments\nDue to the complexity of certain contracts, the actual revenue recognition treatment required under ASC Topic 606 for our arrangements may be dependent on contract-specific terms and may vary in some instances.\nRevenue is recognized over time for our subscription, maintenance and fixed fee professional services that are separate performance obligations. For professional services, revenue is recognized over time, generally using costs incurred or hours expended to measure progress. Judgment is required in estimating project status and the costs necessary to complete projects. A number of internal and external factors can affect these estimates, including labor rates, utilization, specification variances and testing requirement changes.\nIf a group of agreements are entered at or near the same time and so closely related that they are, in effect, part of a single arrangement, such agreements are deemed to be combined as one arrangement for revenue recognition purposes. We exercise judgment to evaluate the relevant facts and circumstances in determining whether agreements should be accounted for separately or as a single arrangement. Our judgments about whether a group of contracts comprise a single arrangement can affect the allocation of consideration to the distinct performance obligations, which could have an effect on results of operations for the periods involved.\nPractical Expedients and Exemptions\nThere are several practical expedients and exemptions allowed under ASC Topic 606 that impact timing of revenue recognition and our disclosures. Below is a list of practical expedients applied by us:\n\u25cf\nWe do not evaluate a contract for a significant financing component if payment is expected within one year or less from the transfer of the promised items to the customer.\n\u25cf\nWe generally expense sales commissions and sales agent fees when incurred when the amortization period would have been one year or less. These costs are recorded within sales and marketing expense in the Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss).\n\u25cf\nWe do not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for contracts for which we recognize revenue at the amount to which we have the right to invoice for services performed (applies to time-and-material engagements).\nCosts to Obtain and Fulfill a Contract\nOur incremental direct costs of obtaining a contract consist of sales commissions and sales agent fees which are deferred and amortized ratably over the term of economic benefit which we have determined to be five years. Incremental costs related to renewals are expensed as incurred because the term of economic benefit is one year or less. These deferred costs are classified as current or non-current based on the timing of when we expect to recognize the expense. The current and non-current portions of deferred commissions and sales agent fees are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets, net and other assets, net respectively, in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nCosts to fulfill a contract are incurred upon initiation of certain services contracts and are related to initial customer setup. These costs are deferred and amortized ratably over the term of economic benefit which we have determined to be five years. These deferred costs are classified as current or non-current based on the timing of when we expect to recognize the expense and are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets, net and other assets, net in the Company\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nRecoverability of these costs is subject to various business risks. Quarterly, we compare the carrying value of these assets with the undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by them to determine if there is impairment. If impaired, these assets are reduced to an estimated fair value on a discounted cash flow basis. No impairment losses were recognized during the twelve months ended January 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.\nIncome Taxes. We are a U.S. based multinational company subject to tax in the U.S. (federal and state) and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Tax laws, regulations, and administrative practices in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change, with or without notice, due to economic, political, and other conditions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision and accruals for these taxes. There are many transactions that occur during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Our effective tax rate could be affected by numerous factors, such as intercompany transactions; the relative amount of foreign earnings, including earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory tax rates; losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize the related tax benefit; changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation; and changes in the relevant tax law, accounting rules, and other laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles and interpretations.\nIn December 2017, the Tax Act was signed into law. The Tax Act significantly changes how the U.S. taxes corporations. The Tax Act requires complex computations to be performed that were not previously required; significant judgments to be made in interpretation of the provisions and significant estimates in calculations. The U.S. Treasury Department, the Internal Revenue Service, and other standard-setting bodies could interpret or issue guidance on how provisions of the Tax Act will be applied or otherwise administered that is different from our interpretation.\nOn March 27, 2020, the U.S. government enacted the \u201cCoronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act\u201d (CARES Act). The CARES Act, among other things, includes provisions relating to refundable payroll tax credits, deferment of employer social security payments, net operating loss carryback periods, alternative minimum tax (AMT) credit refunds, modifications to the net interest deduction limitations and technical corrections to tax depreciation methods for qualified improvement property. During fiscal year 2021, the Company applied the provisions related to the AMT refunds and the tax technical corrections to qualified improvement property.\nThe provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis and operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax laws is recognized in the consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) in the period that includes the enactment date.\nWe report a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a return. The amount of income tax we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, which sometimes result in proposed assessments. Our estimate of the potential outcome for any uncertain tax position requires judgment. For tax related contingencies, we account for uncertain tax positions based on a two-step approach: recognition and measurement. We recognize a tax position when we determine that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. For those positions that do not meet the recognition threshold, no tax benefit is recognized in the financial statements. For those tax positions that meet the recognition threshold, we measure the tax position as the largest amount of benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We record interest and penalties related to income tax liabilities as income tax expense. We have reserves to address tax positions that could be challenged by taxing authorities, even though we believe that the positions taken are appropriate. Our tax reserves are reviewed at each balance sheet date and adjusted as events occur that could affect our liability.\nValuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not expected to be realized based on the weight of positive and negative evidence. Future realization of deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income within the carryback or carryforward periods available under the applicable tax law. We regularly review deferred tax assets for recoverability based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies. Our judgments regarding future profitability may change due to many factors, including future market conditions and the ability to successfully execute our business plans. Should there be a change in the ability to recover deferred tax assets, the tax provision would increase or decrease in the period in which the assessment is changed.\nThe carrying value of our deferred tax assets reflects an amount that is more likely than not to be realized with taxable income generated by results of future operations. At January 31, 2021, we had $19.9 million of deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances and uncertain tax positions, consisting of $69.4 million of gross deferred tax assets offset by valuation allowances of $48.6 million and uncertain tax positions of $1.0 million.",
    "item_7A": "ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nForeign Exchange Rates. We have operations in foreign locations around the world and we are exposed to risk resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We have experienced significant foreign currency fluctuations in fiscal 2021 due primarily to the volatility of the euro, Australian dollar, Mexican peso and British pound in relation to the U.S. dollar. However, while strengthening of the U.S. dollar compared to foreign currency exchange rates generally has the effect of reducing revenues it also has the effect of reducing expenses denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. These foreign currency exchange rate movements could create a foreign currency gain or loss that could be realized or unrealized. Unfavorable movements in foreign currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other foreign currencies may have an adverse impact on our operations. We did not have any foreign currency forward or option contracts, other foreign currency denominated derivatives or other financial instruments open as of January 31, 2021.\nWe face two risks related to foreign currency exchange rates-translation risk and transaction risk. Amounts invested in our foreign operations are translated into U.S. dollars using period-end exchange rates. The resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Revenues and expenses in foreign currencies translate into higher or lower revenues and expenses in U.S. dollars as the U.S. dollar weakens or strengthens against other currencies. Our international subsidiaries also hold U.S. dollar and euro-based net monetary accounts subject to revaluation that results in realized or unrealized foreign currency gains or losses. Furthermore, we have exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations arising from the remeasurement of non-functional currency assets, liabilities and intercompany balances into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes.\nFor fiscal 2021 approximately 49% of our revenue was denominated in foreign currencies, compared with 50% and 51% for fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively. We also incurred a significant portion of our expenses in currencies other than the U.S. dollar; approximately 36% for fiscal 2021, 40% for fiscal 2020 and 41% for fiscal 2019. Based on a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in all foreign currency exchange rates, our revenue would be adversely affected by approximately 4% partially offset by a positive effect on our expenses of approximately 3%, and our operating income would be adversely affected by approximately 32%.\nFor fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, foreign currency transaction and remeasurement losses (gains) totaled $2.0 million, $(0.1) million and $(0.2) million, respectively, and are included in \u201cOther expense (income), net\u201d in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss). We performed a sensitivity analysis on the net U.S. dollar and euro-based monetary accounts subject to revaluation that are held by our international subsidiaries and on the non-functional currency assets, liabilities and intercompany balances that are remeasured into U.S. dollars. A hypothetical 10% adverse movement in all foreign currency exchange rates would result in foreign currency transaction and remeasurement losses of approximately $3.3 million.\nThese estimates assume an adverse shift in all foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar, which do not always move in the same direction or in the same degrees, and actual results may differ materially from the hypothetical analysis.\nInterest Rates. We invest our surplus cash in a variety of financial instruments, consisting principally of short-term marketable securities with maturities of less than 90 days at the date of purchase. Our investment securities are held for purposes other than trading. Cash balances held by subsidiaries are invested primarily in registered money market funds with local operating banks. Based on an interest rate sensitivity analysis of our cash and equivalents, we estimate a 10% adverse change in interest rates from the 2021 fiscal year-end rates would not have a material adverse effect on our cash flows or financial condition for the next fiscal year.\nOur debt is comprised of a loan agreement, secured by real property, which bears interest at the one-month LIBOR rate plus 2.25%. In conjunction with the loan agreement we entered into an interest rate swap. The swap agreement has an initial notional amount and schedule matching that of the underlying loan that synthetically fixes the interest rate on the debt at 4.31%.\nOur interest rate swap is accounted for using mark-to-market accounting. Accordingly, changes in the fair value of the swap each reporting period are adjusted through earnings, subjecting us to non-cash volatility in our results of operations. We prepared a sensitivity analysis using a modeling technique that measures the change in the fair values arising from a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in levels of interest rates across the entire yield curve, with all other variables held constant. Based upon the results of this analysis a 10% adverse change in interest rates from the January 31, 2021 rates would cause less than a $0.1 million reduction in our results of operations. We believe it is prudent to hedge the expected volatility of the variable rate mortgage on our corporate headquarters. The swap fixes the interest rate on our mortgage to 4.31% over the entire term of the mortgage. Although the agreement allows us to prepay the loan and exit the agreement early, we have no intention of doing so. As a result, we will have non-cash adjustments through earnings each reporting period. However, over the term of the mortgage, the net impact of these mark-to-market adjustments on earnings will be zero.",

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\n(a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nQAD maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. QAD\u2019s management, under the supervision and with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of QAD\u2019s disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based on this evaluation, QAD\u2019s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that QAD\u2019s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) were effective at a reasonable assurance level.\n(b) Management\u2019s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nQAD\u2019s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. QAD\u2019s system of internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. QAD\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of QAD\u2019s assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that QAD\u2019s receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of QAD\u2019s management and directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of QAD\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nManagement has assessed the effectiveness of QAD\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2021 based on the criteria described in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on management\u2019s assessment, management has concluded that QAD\u2019s internal control over financial reporting was effective at the reasonable assurance level as of January 31, 2021. We reviewed the results of management\u2019s assessment with our Audit Committee.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm, KPMG LLP, has audited our internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2021, as stated in their report included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n(c) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15 that occurred during our last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, internal control over financial reporting.\n(d) Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls\nQAD\u2019s management does not expect that its disclosure controls and procedures or its internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within QAD have been detected. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate.",

FORM 10-K SUMMARY\nNone.\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Stockholders and Board of Directors\nQAD Inc.:\nOpinions on the Consolidated Financial Statements and Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of QAD Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of January 31, 2021 and 2020, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss), stockholders\u2019 equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended January 31, 2021, and the related notes and financial statement schedule II (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). We also have audited the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of January 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended January 31, 2021, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2021 based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\nChange in Accounting Principle\nAs discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its method of accounting for leases as of February 1, 2019, due to the adoption of Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 842, Leases.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company\u2019s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management\u2019s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nEvaluation of the Company\u2019s revenue recognition assessment related to contracts with customers\nAs discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company determines revenue recognition through the five-step framework prescribed by ASC Topic 606 and revenue recognition treatment may be dependent on contract-specific terms. As disclosed in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income (loss), the Company recorded $307.9 million of total revenues for the year ended January 31, 2021, of which $131.1 million was subscription, $11.2 million was license, $107.1 million was maintenance, and $58.5 million was professional services.\nWe identified the evaluation of the Company\u2019s revenue recognition assessment related to contracts with customers as a critical audit matter. Challenging auditor judgment was required to evaluate the extent of audit evidence obtained for certain new contracts or amendments of existing contracts with customers, due to the level of complexity for such contracts or amendments.\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the Company\u2019s revenue recognition process. This included controls related to the Company\u2019s identification and assessment of contract terms and conditions and the related performance obligations that impact revenue recognition for certain new or amended revenue contracts with customers. For selected revenue transactions, we read the underlying contracts and evaluated the Company\u2019s assessment of the contract terms as well as compared the amounts recognized for consistency with revenue recognition requirements.\n/s/ KPMG LLP\nWe have served as the Company\u2019s auditor since 1990.\nLos Angeles, California\nApril 12, 2021\nQAD INC.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(in thousands, except share and per share data)\nJanuary 31,\nJanuary 31,\nAssets\nCurrent assets:\nCash and cash equivalents\n$ 142,501 $ 136,717\nAccounts receivable, net of allowances of $3,340 and $2,940 at January 31, 2021 and January 31, 2020, respectively\n82,609 80,968\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets, net\n22,923 24,952\nTotal current assets\n248,033 242,637\nProperty and equipment, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization of $42,596 and $38,861 at January 31, 2021 and January 31, 2020, respectively\n25,598 28,687\nLease right-of-use assets\n21,016 18,329\nCapitalized software costs, net\n7,980 1,922\nGoodwill\n25,336 12,388\nDeferred tax assets, net\n8,526 5,834\nOther assets, net\n14,298 13,007\nTotal assets\n$ 350,787 $ 322,804\nLiabilities and Stockholders\u2019 Equity\nCurrent liabilities:\nCurrent portion of long-term debt\n$ 527 $ 503\nLease liabilities\n4,904 4,371\nAccounts payable\n10,898 9,840\nDeferred revenue\n125,724 118,413\nOther current liabilities\n37,431 39,900\nTotal current liabilities\n179,484 173,027\nLong-term debt\n11,825 12,341\nLong-term lease liabilities\n17,510 14,612\nOther liabilities\n12,502 6,759\nTotal liabilities\n221,321 206,739\nCommitments and contingencies (Note 14)\nStockholders\u2019 equity:\nPreferred stock, $0.001 par value.

The Company\u2019s solutions, called QAD Adaptive Applications, are designed specifically for automotive suppliers, life sciences, consumer products, food and beverage, high technology and industrial products manufacturers. QAD software offers a full set of core manufacturing enterprise resource planning (ERP) and supply chain management capabilities. The Company\u2019s architecture, called the QAD Enterprise Platform, allows customers to upgrade existing functionality by module; and extend or create new applications, providing manufacturers with the flexibility they need to innovate and rapidly adapt to change. QAD was founded in 1979, incorporated in California in 1986 and reincorporated in Delaware in 1997.\nPRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of QAD Inc. and all of its subsidiaries. All subsidiaries are wholly-owned and all significant balances and transactions among the entities have been eliminated from the consolidated financial statements.\nUSE OF ESTIMATES\nThe financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and, accordingly, include amounts based on informed estimates and judgments of management that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the Company\u2019s financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Changes in estimates resulting from continuing changes in the economic environment will be reflected in the financial statements in future periods.\nSignificant items subject to such estimates and assumptions made by management include, but are not limited to, the determination of:\n\u25cf\nrevenue recognition;\n\u25cf\nthe fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed for business combinations;\n\u25cf\nthe average period of benefit associated with deferred contract acquisition and fulfillment costs;\n\u25cf\nthe fair value of certain stock awards issued;\n\u25cf\nthe useful life and recoverability of long-lived and intangible assets; and\n\u25cf\nthe recognition, measurement and valuation of deferred income taxes.\nThe World Health Organization declared in March 2020 that the outbreak of the coronavirus disease named COVID-19 constituted a pandemic, which lasted through the rest of fiscal 2021 and beyond. The Company has undertaken measures to protect its employees, partners and customers. There can be no assurance that these measures will be effective, however, or that the Company can adopt them without adversely affecting its business operations. In addition, the coronavirus outbreak has created and may continue to create significant uncertainty in global financial markets, which may decrease technology spending, depress demand for the Company\u2019s solutions and harm its business and results of operations. As of the date of issuance of the financial statements, the Company is not aware of any specific event or circumstance that would require updates to the Company\u2019s estimates and judgments or revisions to the carrying value of its assets or liabilities. These estimates may change, as new events occur and additional information is obtained, and are recognized in the consolidated financial statements as soon as they become known. Actual results could differ from those estimates and any such differences may be material to the financial statements.\nRECLASSIFICATION\nCertain prior year amounts included in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements have been reclassified for consistency with the current year presentation.\nFOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATIONS AND TRANSACTIONS\nThe financial position and results of operations of the Company\u2019s foreign subsidiaries are generally determined using the country\u2019s local currency as the functional currency. Assets and liabilities recorded in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rates on the balance sheet date. Revenue and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year. Translation adjustments resulting from this process are charged or credited to other comprehensive income (loss), which is included in \u201cAccumulated other comprehensive loss\u201d within the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nGains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions and remeasurement adjustments of monetary assets and liabilities not held in an entity\u2019s functional currency are included in earnings. Foreign currency transaction and remeasurement losses (gains) for fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019 totaled $2.0 million, $(0.1) million, and $(0.2) million, respectively, and are included in \u201cOther expense (income), net\u201d in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss).\nCASH AND EQUIVALENTS\nCash and equivalents consist of cash and short-term marketable securities with maturities of less than 90 days at the date of purchase. The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of 90 days or less to be cash equivalents. At January 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company\u2019s cash and equivalents consisted of money market mutual funds invested in U.S. Treasury and government securities, deposit accounts and certificates of deposit.\nACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, NET\nAccounts receivable, net, consisted of the following as of January 31:\n(in thousands)\nAccounts receivable\n$ 85,949 $ 83,908\nLess allowance for:\nDoubtful accounts\n(1,101 )\n(543 )\nSales adjustments\n(2,239 )\n(2,397 )\nAccounts receivable, net\n$ 82,609 $ 80,968\nTrade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. The collectability of accounts receivable is reviewed each period by analyzing balances based on age. Specific allowances for doubtful accounts are recorded for any balances that the Company determines may not be fully collectible due to a customer\u2019s inability to pay. Our expected loss allowance methodology is developed using historical collection experience, consideration of current and anticipated future economic conditions and other relevant data. Provisions to the allowance for bad debts are included as bad debt expense in \u201cGeneral and Administrative\u201d expense. The determination to write-off specific accounts receivable balances is based on the likelihood of collection and past due status. Past due status is based on invoice date and terms specific to each customer.\nThe Company does not generally provide a contractual right of return; however, in the course of business sales adjustments related to customer dispute resolution may occur. A provision is recorded against revenue for estimated sales adjustments in the same period the related revenues are recorded or when current information indicates additional amounts are required. These estimates are based on historical experience, specifically identified customers and other known factors.\nSALE OF BUILDING\nDuring the second quarter of fiscal 2020, the Company vacated its building located in Dublin, Ireland, and moved its operations into leased office space. The sale of the building was completed in the third quarter of fiscal 2021 for $1.5 million in proceeds.\nFINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK\nThe carrying amounts of cash and equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate fair value due to the short-term maturities of these instruments. The Company\u2019s note payable bears a variable market interest rate, subject to certain minimum interest rates. Therefore, the carrying amount outstanding under the note payable reasonably approximates fair value.\nConcentration of credit risk with respect to trade receivables is limited due to a large number of customers comprising the Company\u2019s customer base, and their dispersion across many different industries and locations throughout the world. No single customer accounted for 10% or more of the Company\u2019s total revenue during the fiscal years ended January 31, 2021 and 2020. In the fiscal year ended January 31, 2019 one customer accounted for 10% of total revenue. During fiscal 2019 the Company performed a large implementation project with a customer which included consulting services the customer needed to help perform activities their employees were responsible for. Without these services, the revenue from this customer would have been less than 10%.In addition, no single customer accounted for 10% or more of accounts receivable at January 31, 2021 or 2020.\nPROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost. Additions and significant improvements to property and equipment are capitalized, while maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. For financial reporting purposes, depreciation is generally expensed via the straight-line method over the useful life of three years for computer equipment and software, five years for furniture and office equipment, 10 years for building improvements, and 39 years for buildings. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term or the useful life of five years.\nCertain costs associated with software developed for internal use, including payroll costs for employees, are capitalized once the project has reached the application development stage and are included in property and equipment classified as software. These costs are amortized using the straight-line method over the expected useful life of the software, beginning when the asset is substantially ready for use. Costs incurred related to the preliminary project stage, training and research and development are expensed as incurred.\nProperty and equipment, net consisted of the following as of January 31:\n(in thousands)\nBuildings and building improvements\n$ 29,562 $ 29,902\nComputer equipment and software\n18,858 18,345\nFurniture and office equipment\n8,174 8,004\nLeasehold improvements\n7,685 7,382\nLand\n3,850 3,850\nAutomobiles\n65 65\n68,194 67,548\nLess accumulated depreciation and amortization\n(42,596 ) (38,861 )\n$ 25,598 $ 28,687\nThe changes in property and equipment, net, for the fiscal years ended January 31 were as follows:\n(in thousands)\nCost\nBalance at February 1\n$\n67,548\n$\n68,794\nAdditions\n1,933\n5,671\nAdjustments (1)\n(2,234\n)\nDisposals\n(2,062\n)\n(4,286\n)\nImpact of foreign currency translation\n(397\n)\nBalance at January 31\n68,194\n67,548\nAccumulated depreciation\nBalance at February 1\n(38,861\n) (39,173\n)\nDepreciation\n(5,011\n)\n(5,034\n)\nAdjustments (1)\n(71\n)\nDisposals\n1,744\n4,207\nImpact of foreign currency translation\n(397\n)\nBalance at January 31\n(42,596)\n(38,861\n)\nProperty and equipment, net at January 31\n$\n25,598\n$\n28,687\n(1)\nFiscal 2020 adjustments relate primarily to a building re-classified to assets held for sale in the second quarter of fiscal 2020.\nDepreciation and amortization expense of property and equipment for fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019 was $5.2 million, $5.1 million, and $4.7 million, respectively.\nCAPITALIZED SOFTWARE COSTS\nThe Company capitalizes software purchased from third parties or through business combinations as acquired software technology, if the related software under development has reached technological feasibility. In addition, the Company capitalizes software development costs incurred in connection with the localization and translation of its products once technological feasibility has been achieved based on a working model. A working model is defined as an operative version of the computer software product that is completed in the same software language as the product to be ultimately marketed, performs all the major functions planned for the product and is ready for initial customer testing (usually identified as beta testing).\nThe amortization of capitalized software costs is the greater of the straight-line basis over three years, the expected useful life, or a computation using a ratio of current revenue for a product compared to the estimated total of current and future revenues for that product.\nCapitalized software costs and accumulated amortization at January 31 were as follows:\n(in thousands)\nCapitalized software costs:\nCapitalized software development costs\n$ 3,655 $ 3,356\nAcquired software technology\n6,191 135\n9,846 3,491\nLess accumulated amortization\n(1,866 ) (1,569 )\nCapitalized software costs, net\n$ 7,980 $ 1,922\nThe Company\u2018s capitalized software development costs relate to translations and localizations of QAD Adaptive Applications. Acquired software technology costs primarily relate to intellectual property purchased during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021.\nIt is the Company\u2019s policy to write off capitalized software development costs once fully amortized. Accordingly, during fiscal 2021, $1.0 million of costs and accumulated amortization was removed from the Consolidated Balance Sheet and was related to capitalized software development costs which was fully amortized during fiscal 2021.\nAmortization of capitalized software costs for fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019 was $1.3 million, $0.9 million and $0.6 million, respectively and was included in \u201cCost of license\u201d in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss).\nThe following table summarizes the estimated amortization expense relating to the Company\u2019s capitalized software costs as of January 31, 2021:\nFiscal Years\n(in thousands)\n$ 2,276\n1,913\n1,469\n1,212\nThereafter\n1,110\n$ 7,980\nBUSINESS COMBINATION\nThe Company allocates the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, based upon their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. The purchase price allocation process requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date with respect to intangible assets.\nThese assumptions and estimates are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain. The estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets can include, but are not limited to, discount rates, future expected cash flows from software license sales, subscriptions, support agreements, consulting contracts, margins, and customer retention rates, as well as assumptions about the period of time the assets will continue to be used in the Company\u2019s combined product portfolio.\nThe Company estimates the fair value of the contingent consideration issued in business combinations using a Monte Carlo valuation approach, as well as unobservable inputs, such as forecasted financial information, reflecting its assessment of the assumptions market participants would use to value these liabilities. The fair values of liability-classified contingent consideration are remeasured at each reporting period with any changes in the fair value recorded as income or expense. The potential undiscounted amount of all future cash payments under the contingent consideration agreements is between zero and $10.2 million as of January 31, 2021.\nIMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS AND INTANGIBLES OTHER THAN GOODWILL\nThe Company evaluates long-lived assets, capitalized software and other intangible assets for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. This includes but is not limited to significant adverse changes in business climate, market conditions, or other events that indicate an asset's carrying amount may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of each asset to the future undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate. If the undiscounted cash flows used in the test for recoverability are less than the carrying amount of these assets, the carrying amount of such assets is reduced to fair value.\nThe Company reviews the impairment of right-of-use (ROU) assets consistent with the approach applied for the Company\u2019s other long-lived assets. The Company reviews the recoverability of long-lived assets when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. The assessment of possible impairment is based on the Company\u2019s ability to recover the carrying value of the asset from the expected undiscounted future pre-tax cash flows of the related operations.\nThere were no impairments of long-lived assets, capitalized software, or other intangible assets during fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.\nLEASES\nThe Company treats a contract as a lease when the contract conveys the right to use a physically distinct asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration, the Company directs the use of the asset and the Company obtains substantially all the economic benefits of the asset. These leases are recorded as ROU assets and lease obligation liabilities for leases with terms greater than 12 months. ROU assets represent the Company\u2019s right to use an underlying asset for the entirety of the lease term. Lease liabilities represent the Company's obligation to make payments over the life of the lease. An ROU asset and a lease liability are recognized at commencement of the lease based on the present value of the lease payments over the life of the lease. Initial direct costs are included as part of the ROU asset upon commencement of the lease. Since the interest rate implicit in a lease is generally not readily determinable, the Company uses an incremental borrowing rate to determine the present value of the lease payments. The incremental borrowing rate represents the rate of interest the Company would have to pay to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar lease term to obtain an asset of similar value. The Company used the incremental borrowing rate on February 1, 2019 for all leases that commenced prior to that date.\nThe Company has applied the practical expedient available for lessees in which lease and non-lease components are accounted for as a single lease component for all asset classes. The Company also elected the practical expedient to exclude short-term leases (leases with original terms of 12 months or less) from ROU asset and lease liability accounts.\nThe Company\u2019s operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Amortization expense of the ROU asset for finance leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and interest expense for finance leases is recognized based on the incremental borrowing rate. Variable lease payments are expensed as incurred for both operating and finance leases. Variable payments change due to facts or circumstances occurring after the commencement date, other than the passage of time, and do not result in a remeasurement of lease liabilities. The Company\u2019s variable lease payments include payments to lessors for taxes, maintenance, insurance and other operating costs as well as payments that are adjusted based on a CPI index or rate and payments in excess of fixed amounts, such as excess mileage charges on leased autos. The Company's lease agreements do not contain any significant residual value guarantees or restrictive covenants.\nSTOCK-BASED COMPENSATION\nThe Company accounts for share-based payments (equity awards) to employees in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation (ASC 718), which requires that share-based payments (to the extent they are compensatory) be recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) based on the fair values of the equity awards as measured at the grant date. The Company recognizes the impact of forfeitures on stock-based compensation expense as they occur. The fair value of an equity award is recognized as stock-based compensation expense ratably over the vesting period of the equity award. Determining the fair value of equity awards at the grant date requires judgment.\nFair Value of RSUs\nThe fair value of restricted stock units (RSUs) is determined on the grant date of the award as the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock on the date of grant, reduced by the present value of estimated dividends foregone during the vesting period. Judgment is required in determining the present value of estimated dividends foregone during the vesting period. The Company estimates the dividends for purposes of this calculation based on the Company\u2019s historical dividend payments per share, which has remained consistent over the last four years.\nFair Value of PSUs\nThe fair value of performance stock units (PSUs) is determined on the grant date of the award as the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock on the date of grant, reduced by the present value of estimated dividends foregone during the vesting period. Judgment is required in determining the present value of estimated dividends foregone during the vesting period. The Company estimates the dividends for purposes of this calculation based on the Company\u2019s historical dividend payments per share, which has remained consistent over the last three years. The number of PSUs earned and eligible to vest are determined based on attainment of specified performance criteria. To determine the anticipated achievement of the performance objectives, management must make assumptions regarding the likelihood of the Company meeting those targets. The number of PSUs that vest will be predicated on the Company achieving performance objectives during the measurement period subsequent to the date of grant. Depending on the financial performance levels achieved, a percentage of the PSUs (0% to 200% of the target award) will vest to the grantees of those stock units.\nFair Value of SARs\nThe fair value of stock-settled stock appreciation rights (SARs) is determined on the grant date of the award using the Black-Scholes-Merton valuation model. One of the inputs to the Black-Scholes-Merton valuation model is the fair market value of the Company\u2019s stock on the date of grant. Judgment is required in determining the remaining inputs to the Black-Scholes-Merton valuation model. These inputs include the expected life, volatility, the risk-free interest rate and the dividend rate. The following describes the Company\u2019s policies with respect to determining these valuation inputs:\nExpected Life - The expected life valuation input includes a computation that is based on historical vested SAR exercises and post-vest expiration patterns and an estimate of the expected life for SARs that were fully vested and outstanding. Furthermore, based on the Company\u2019s historical pattern of SAR exercises and post-vest expiration patterns the Company determined that there are two discernible populations which include the Company\u2019s directors and officers (D&O) and all other QAD employees. The estimate of the expected life for SARs that were fully vested and outstanding is determined as the midpoint of a range as follows: the low end of the range assumes the fully vested and outstanding SARs are exercised or expire unexercised on the vest date and the high end of the range assumes that these SARs are exercised or expire unexercised upon the contractual termination date.\nVolatility - The volatility valuation input is based on the historical volatility of the Company\u2019s common stock, which the Company believes is representative of the expected volatility over the expected life of SARs.\nRisk-Free Interest Rate - The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury constant maturities in effect at the time of grant for the expected term of the SARs.\nDividend Rate - The dividend rate is based on the Company\u2019s historical dividend payments per share.\nThe Company records deferred tax assets for equity awards that result in deductions on its income tax returns, based on the amount of stock-based compensation recognized and the fair values attributable to the vested portion of those equity awards. Because the deferred tax assets the Company records are based upon the stock-based compensation expenses in a particular jurisdiction, the aforementioned inputs that affect the fair values of equity awards may also indirectly affect income tax expense. If the tax deduction is less than the deferred tax asset, the calculated shortfall would increase income tax expense. If the tax deduction is more than the deferred tax asset, the calculated windfall would decrease income tax expense.\nCOMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS)\nComprehensive income (loss) includes changes in the balances of items that are reported directly as a separate component of stockholders\u2019 equity on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The components of comprehensive income (loss) are net income (loss) and foreign currency translation adjustments. The Company does not provide for income taxes on foreign currency translation adjustments since it does not provide for taxes on the unremitted earnings of its foreign subsidiaries. The changes in accumulated other comprehensive loss are included in the Company\u2019s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss).\nADVERTISING EXPENSES\nAdvertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expenses were $0.9 million, $0.6 million and $0.7 million for fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019.\nRESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT\nAll costs incurred to establish the technological feasibility of the Company\u2019s software products are expensed to research and development (R&D) as incurred. R&D expenses totaled $56.1 million, $54.7 million and $54.0 million in fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nOTHER EXPENSE (INCOME), NET\nThe components of other expense (income), were as follows:\nYears Ended January 31,\n(in thousands)\nInterest income\n$ (923 )\n$ (2,782 )\n$ (2,600 )\nInterest expense\n591 630 643\nForeign exchange losses (gains)\n2,018 (50 )\n(229 )\nChange in fair value of interest rate swap\n93 368 51\nOther expense (income), net\n98 (250 )\n(209 )\nTotal other expense (income), net\n$ 1,877 $ (2,084 )\n$ (2,344 )\nCOMPUTATION OF NET INCOME (LOSS) PER SHARE\nNet income (loss) per share of Class A common stock and Class B common stock is computed using the two-class method. Holders of Class A common stock are entitled to cash or stock dividends equal to 120% of the amount of such dividend payable with respect to a share of Class B common stock.\nThe following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net income (loss) per share:\nYears Ended January 31,\n(in thousands, except per share data)\nNet income (loss)\n$ 11,065 $ (15,949 )\n$ 10,428\nLess: dividends declared\n(5,780 )\n(5,617 )\n(5,479 )\nUndistributed net income (loss)\n$ 5,285 $ (21,566 ) $ 4,949\nNet income (loss) per share - Class A Common Stock\nDividends declared\n$ 4,982 $ 4,827 $ 4,696\nAllocation of undistributed net income (loss)\n4,559 (18,519 )\n4,243\nNet income (loss) attributable to Class A common stock\n$ 9,541 $ (13,692 )\n$ 8,939\nWeighted average shares of Class A common stock outstanding-basic\n17,274 16,709 16,267\nWeighted average potential shares of Class A common stock\n748 - 1,585\nWeighted average shares of Class A common stock and potential common shares outstanding-diluted\n18,022 16,709 17,852\nBasic net income (loss) per Class A common share\n$ 0.55 $ (0.82 )\n$ 0.55\nDiluted net income (loss) per Class A common share\n$ 0.53 $ (0.82 )\n$ 0.50\nNet income (loss) per share - Class B Common Stock\nDividends declared\n$ 798 $ 790 $ 783\nAllocation of undistributed net income (loss)\n726 (3,047 )\nNet income (loss) attributable to Class B common stock\n$ 1,524 $ (2,257 )\n$ 1,489\nWeighted average shares of Class B common stock outstanding-basic\n3,326 3,289 3,256\nWeighted average potential shares of Class B common stock\n67 - 166\nWeighted average shares of Class B common stock and potential common shares outstanding-diluted\n3,393 3,289 3,422\nBasic net income (loss) per Class B common share\n$ 0.46 $ (0.69 )\n$ 0.46\nDiluted net income (loss) per Class B common share\n$ 0.45 $ (0.69 )\n$ 0.44\nPotential common shares consist of the shares issuable upon the release of RSUs and PSUs, and the exercise of SARs. The Company\u2019s unvested RSUs and PSUs, and unexercised SARs are not considered participating securities as they do not have rights to dividends or dividend equivalents prior to release or exercise.\nThe following table sets forth the number of potential common shares not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share because their effects were anti-dilutive:\nYears Ended January 31,\n(in thousands)\nClass A\n190 2,473 325\nClass B\n- 221 -\nRECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nWith the exception of those discussed below, there have been no recent changes in accounting pronouncements issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) or adopted by the Company during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021, that are of significance, or potential significance, to the Company.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements Adopted\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment, which eliminates \u201cStep 2\u201d from the goodwill impairment test. QAD adopted the new standard on February 1, 2020, the first day of fiscal 2021. The adoption of this new standard did not have an impact on QAD\u2019s consolidated financial statements.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which requires the measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for financial assets held at amortized cost, which includes the Company's accounts receivables and contract assets. QAD adopted the new standard on February 1, 2020, the first day of fiscal 2021, using the modified retrospective approach. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on QAD\u2019s consolidated financial statements. The Company\u2019s expected loss allowance methodology for accounts receivable is developed using historical collection experience, consideration of current and anticipated future economic conditions and other relevant data.\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-15, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other-Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer\u2019s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That Is a Service Contract, which aligns the accounting for implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the accounting for implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software under ASC 350-40, in order to determine which costs to capitalize and recognize as an asset and which costs to expense. The Company adopted the new standard on February 1, 2020, the first day of fiscal 2021. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on QAD\u2019s consolidated financial statements.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued new guidance which is intended to simplify various aspects to accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions to the general principles in Topic 740 for recognizing deferred taxes for investments, performing an intraperiod allocation and calculating income taxes in interim periods. The amendment also clarifies and amends certain areas of existing guidance to reduce complexity and improve consistency in application of Topic 740. Generally, the topics must be applied prospectively upon adoption, with the exception of certain topics which are required to be applied on a retrospective or modified retrospective basis. The new standard is effective for the Company\u2019s first quarter of fiscal year 2022. The Company will continue to evaluate the new guidance and expects that the simplification will not have a material impact on its overall financial statements.\n2.\nREVENUE\nQAD offers its software using the same underlying technology via two models: a cloud-based subscription model and a traditional on-premises licensing model. Under the cloud-based subscription delivery model, QAD provides access to its software on a hosted basis as a service and customers generally do not have the contractual right to take possession of the software. Under the on-premises model, QAD sells or licenses software on a perpetual basis to customers who take possession of the software and install and maintain the software on their own hardware.\nThe Company generates revenue through subscriptions of its cloud-based software and sales of licenses and maintenance provided to its on-premises customers and through offering professional services to both its cloud and on-premises customers to assist them with the design, testing and implementation of its software.\nThe Company determines revenue recognition through the following steps:\n-\nIdentification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer;\n-\nIdentification of the performance obligations in the contract;\n-\nDetermination of the transaction price;\n-\nAllocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and\n-\nRecognition of revenue when, or as, the Company satisfies a performance obligation.\nRevenue is presented net of sales, value-added and other taxes collected from customers and remitted to government authorities.\nPerformance Obligations\nA performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer and is the unit of account under ASC Topic 606. The transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied by transferring the promised good or service to the customer. The Company identifies and tracks the performance obligations at contract inception so that the Company can monitor and account for the performance obligations over the life of the contract.\nThe Company\u2019s contracts which contain multiple performance obligations generally consist of the initial purchase of subscription or licenses and a professional services engagement. License purchases generally have multiple performance obligations as customers purchase maintenance in addition to the licenses. The Company\u2019s single performance obligation arrangements are typically maintenance renewals, subscription renewals and services engagements.\nFor contracts with multiple performance obligations where the contracted price differs from the stand-alone selling price (SSP) for any distinct good or service, the Company may be required to allocate the contract\u2019s transaction price to each performance obligation using its best estimate for the SSP. SSP is assessed annually using a historical analysis of contracts with customers executed in the most recently completed fiscal year to determine the range of selling prices applicable to a distinct good or service.\nJudgment is required to determine the SSP for each distinct performance obligation. In instances where SSP is not directly observable because the Company does not sell the license, product or service separately, the Company determines the SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. In making these judgments, the Company analyzes various factors, including its pricing methodology and consistency, size of the arrangement, length of term, customer demographics and overall market and economic conditions. Based on these results, the estimated SSP is set for each distinct product or service delivered to customers. The Company rarely sells licenses on a stand-alone basis, as the majority of its license sales to customers include first year maintenance with the license purchase. The Company frequently sells subscription, maintenance and services on a stand-alone basis.\nSubscription\nSubscription revenue is recognized ratably over the initial subscription period committed to by the customer commencing when the cloud environment is made available to the customer. The initial subscription period is typically 24 to 60 months. The Company generally invoices its customers in advance in quarterly or annual installments and typical payment terms provide that customers make payment within 30 days of invoice. In addition, a majority of customers renew their subscription contracts annually and typical payment terms provide that customers make payment within 30 days of invoice.\nSoftware Licenses\nTransfer of control for software is considered to have occurred upon electronic delivery of the license key that provides immediate availability of the product to the customer. License revenue is recognized upon the delivery of the license key. The Company\u2019s typical payment terms tend to vary by region but its standard payment terms are within 30-90 days of invoice.\nMaintenance\nRevenue from support services and product updates provided to the Company\u2019s on-premises customers, referred to as maintenance revenue, is recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance period, which in most instances is one year. Software license updates provide customers with rights to unspecified software product updates, maintenance releases and patches released during the term of the support period on a when-and-if available basis. Product support includes Internet access to technical content, as well as Internet and telephone access to technical support personnel. The Company\u2019s customers purchase both product support and license updates via the Company\u2019s maintenance offering when they acquire new software licenses. In addition, a majority of customers renew their maintenance contracts annually and typical payment terms provide that customers make payment within 30 days of invoice.\nProfessional Services\nRevenue from professional services is typically comprised of implementation, development, training or other consulting services. Consulting services are generally sold on a time-and-materials or fixed fee basis and can include services ranging from software installation to data conversion and building non-complex interfaces to allow the software to operate in integrated environments. The Company recognizes revenue for time-and-materials arrangements as the services are performed. In fixed fee arrangements, revenue is recognized as services are performed as measured by costs incurred to date, compared to total estimated costs to complete the services project. Management applies judgment when estimating project status and the costs necessary to complete the services projects. A number of internal and external factors can affect these estimates, including labor rates, utilization and efficiency variances and specification and testing requirement changes. Services are generally invoiced upon milestones in the contract or upon consumption of the hourly resources and payments are typically due 30 days after invoice.\nIndirect Sales Channels\nThe Company executes arrangements through indirect sales channels via sales agents and distributors who are authorized to market its software products to end users. In arrangements with sales agents, QAD contracts directly with the customer and sales agents are compensated on a commission basis. Distributor arrangements are those in which the resellers are authorized to market and distribute the Company\u2019s software products to end users in specified territories and the distributor bears the risk of collection from the end user customer. The Company recognizes revenue from transactions with distributors when the distributor submits a signed agreement and transfer of control has occurred to the distributor in accordance with the five revenue recognition steps noted above. Revenue from distributor transactions is recorded on a net basis (the amount actually received by the Company from the distributor). QAD does not offer rights of return, product rotation or price protection to any of its distributors. During the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021, the Company\u2019s revenue from sales agents and distributors was less than 15% of total subscription, license and maintenance revenue.\nDisaggregated Revenue\nThe Company disaggregates revenue from contracts with customers by geography and by the customers\u2019 industry within manufacturing, as it believes it best depicts how the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors.\nThe Company\u2019s revenue by geography is as follows:\nYears Ended January 31,\n(in thousands)\nNorth America\n$\n155,244\n$\n151,097\n$\n162,307\nEMEA\n93,351\n90,885\n96,989\nAsia Pacific\n39,327\n46,363\n51,628\nLatin America\n19,943\n22,427\n22,092\nTotal revenue\n$\n307,865\n$\n310,772\n$\n333,016\nThe Company\u2019s revenue by industry is as follows:\nYears Ended January 31,\n(in thousands)\nAutomotive\n$\n95,009\n$\n110,900\n$\n128,249\nConsumer products and food and beverage\n51,682\n46,915\n53,637\nHigh technology and industrial products\n111,056\n106,807\n106,658\nLife sciences and other\n50,118\n46,150\n44,472\nTotal revenue\n$\n307,865\n$\n310,772\n$\n333,016\nManagement Judgments\nDue to the complexity of certain contracts, the actual revenue recognition treatment required under ASC Topic 606 for the Company\u2019s arrangements may be dependent on contract-specific terms and may vary in some instances.\nRevenue is recognized over time for the Company\u2019s subscription, maintenance and fixed fee professional services that are separate performance obligations. For the Company\u2019s professional services, revenue is recognized over time, generally using costs incurred or hours expended to measure progress. Judgment is required in estimating project status and the costs necessary to complete projects. A number of internal and external factors can affect these estimates, including labor rates, utilization, specification variances and testing requirement changes.\nIf a group of agreements are entered at or near the same time and so closely related that they are, in effect, part of a single arrangement, such agreements are deemed to be combined as one arrangement for revenue recognition purposes. The Company exercises judgment to evaluate the relevant facts and circumstances in determining whether agreements should be accounted for separately or as a single arrangement. The Company\u2019s judgments about whether a group of contracts comprise a single arrangement can affect the allocation of consideration to the distinct performance obligations, which could have an effect on results of operations for the periods involved.\nContract Balances\nThe timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to customers and these timing differences result in receivables, contract assets, or contract liabilities (deferred revenue) on the Company\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheets. QAD records a contract asset when the Company has transferred goods or services but does not yet have the right to consideration. QAD records deferred revenue when the Company has received or has the right to receive consideration but has not yet transferred goods or services to the customer. The Company presents the contract asset and liability balance on a net basis at the contract level.\nThe contract assets indicated below are presented as other current and non-current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. These assets primarily relate to professional services and subscription and consist of the Company\u2019s rights to consideration for goods or services transferred but not billed as of January 31, 2021 and 2020. The contract assets are transferred to receivables when the rights to consideration become unconditional, usually upon completion of a milestone.\nThe Company\u2019s contract balances are as follows:\nAs of\nJanuary 31,\nJanuary 31,\n(In thousands)\nContract assets, short-term (in Prepaid expenses and other current assets, net)\n$ 2,014 $ 1,595\nContract assets, long-term (in Other assets, net)\n103 214\nTotal contract assets\n$ 2,117 $ 1,809\nDeferred revenue, short-term\n$ 125,724 $ 118,413\nDeferred revenue, long-term (in Other liabilities)\n2,705 2,811\nTotal deferred revenue\n$ 128,429 $ 121,224\nDuring the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021, the Company recognized $123.2 million of revenue that was included in the gross deferred revenue balance at the beginning of the year. All other activity in deferred revenue is due to the timing of invoicing in relation to the timing of revenue recognition.\nRevenue allocated to remaining performance obligations represents the transaction price allocated to the performance obligations that are unsatisfied, or partially unsatisfied, which includes unearned revenue and amounts that will be invoiced and recognized as revenue in future periods. Contracted but unsatisfied performance obligations were approximately $309.9 million as of January 31, 2021, of which the Company expects to recognize approximately $185.1 million as revenue over the next 12 months and the remainder thereafter. In instances where the timing of revenue recognition differs from the timing of invoicing, QAD has determined that its contracts generally do not include a significant financing component. The primary purpose of invoicing terms is to provide customers with simplified and predictable ways of purchasing the Company\u2019s products and services, and not to facilitate financing arrangements.\nDeferred Revenue\nThe Company typically invoices its customers for subscription and support fees in advance on a quarterly or annual basis, with payment due at the start of the subscription or support term. Unpaid invoice amounts for non-cancelable services starting in future periods are included in accounts receivable and deferred revenue. The portion of deferred revenue that QAD anticipates will be recognized after the succeeding twelve-month period is recorded as non-current deferred revenue, and the remaining portion is recorded as current deferred revenue.\nDeferred revenues consisted of the following:\nAs of\nJanuary 31,\nJanuary 31,\n(in thousands)\nDeferred maintenance\n$ 66,833 $ 69,650\nDeferred subscription\n55,873 45,702\nDeferred professional services\n2,649 2,705\nDeferred license and other revenue\n369 356\nDeferred revenues, current\n125,724 118,413\nDeferred revenues, non-current (in Other liabilities)\n2,705 2,811\nTotal deferred revenues\n$ 128,429 $ 121,224\nPractical Expedients and Exemptions\nThere are several practical expedients and exemptions allowed under ASC Topic 606 that impact timing of revenue recognition and the Company\u2019s disclosures. Below is a list of the practical expedients applied by the Company:\n\u25cf\nThe Company does not evaluate a contract for a significant financing component if payment is expected within one year or less from the transfer of the promised items to the customer.\n\u25cf\nThe Company generally expenses sales commissions and sales agent fees when incurred when the amortization period would have been one year or less. These costs are recorded within sales and marketing expense in the Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss).\n\u25cf\nThe Company does not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for contracts for which the Company recognizes revenue at the amount to which it has the right to invoice for services performed (applies to time-and-material engagements).\nCosts to Obtain and Fulfill a Contract\nThe Company\u2019s incremental direct costs of obtaining a contract consist of sales commissions and sales agent fees which are deferred and amortized ratably over the term of economic benefit which the Company has determined to be five years. These deferred costs are classified as current or non-current based on the timing of when the Company expects to recognize the expense. Incremental costs related to renewals are expenses as incurred because the term of economic benefit is one year or less. The current and non-current portions of deferred commissions and sales agent fees are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets, net and other assets, net, respectively, in the Company\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheets. At January 31, 2021 and January 31, 2020, the Company had $13.1 million and $12.3 million, respectively, of deferred commissions and sales agent fees. For the fiscal years ended January 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, $4.3 million, $3.9 million, and $3.6 million, respectively, of amortization expense related to deferred commissions and sales agent fees was recorded in sales and marketing expense in the Company\u2019s Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss).\nCosts to fulfill a contract, which are incurred upon initiation of certain services contracts and are related to initial customer setup, are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets, net and other assets, net in the Company\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheets. At January 31, 2021 and January 31, 2020 the Company had deferred setup costs of $1.3 million and $1.4 million, respectively. These costs are amortized over the term of economic benefit which the Company has determined to be five years. During the fiscal years ended January 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, $0.6 million, $0.6 million, and $0.5 million, respectively, of amortization expense related to deferred setup costs was recorded in cost of subscription in the Company\u2019s Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss).\nRecoverability of these costs is subject to various business risks. Quarterly, the Company compares the carrying value of these assets with the undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by them to determine if there is impairment. If impaired, these assets are reduced to an estimated fair value on a discounted cash flow basis. No impairment losses were recognized during the twelve months ended January 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.\n3. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\nWhen determining fair value, the Company uses a three-tier value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. Whenever possible, the Company uses observable market data. The Company relies on unobservable inputs only when observable market data is not available. Classification within the hierarchy is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The assessment of the significance of a particular item to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, including the consideration of inputs specific to the asset or liability.\n\u2022 Level 1 - The assets are recorded at fair value based upon quoted market prices.\n\u2022 Level 2 - The asset or liability related to the interest rate swap is recorded at fair value based upon a valuation model that uses relevant observable market inputs at quoted intervals, such as forward yield curves.\n\u2022 Level 3 - The contingent liability associated with acquisitions is recorded at fair value using a Monte Carlo valuation approach, as well as inputs that are not observable in the market. This measurement includes an assessment of the probability of achieving certain cloud bookings growth milestones and discounting the amount of each potential payment accordingly.\nThe following table sets forth the financial assets and liabilities, measured at fair value, as of January 31, 2021 and January 31, 2020:\nFair value measurement at reporting date using\nQuoted Prices\nin Active\nMarkets for\nIdentical Assets\n(Level 1)\nSignificant\nOther\nObservable\nInputs\n(Level 2)\nSignificant\nUnobservable\nInputs\n(Level 3)\n(in thousands)\nAs of January 31, 2021\nMoney market mutual funds\n$ 80,611\nCertificates of deposit\n$ 9,262\nLiability related to the interest rate swap\n$ (325 )\nContingent liability associated with acquisitions\n$ (4,751 )\nAs of January 31, 2020\nMoney market mutual funds\n$ 107,319\nCertificates of deposit\n$ 14,917\nLiability related to the interest rate swap\n$ (232 )\nMoney market mutual funds and certificates of deposit are classified as part of \u201cCash and equivalents\u201d in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. The amount of cash and equivalents deposited with commercial banks was $52.6 million and $14.5 million at January 31, 2021 and January 31, 2020, respectively.\nThe Company\u2019s note payable bears a variable market interest rate commensurate with the Company\u2019s credit standing. Therefore, the carrying amount outstanding under the note payable reasonably approximates fair value based on Level 2 inputs.\nThe contingent liability associated with acquisitions is classified as part of \u201cOther current liabilities\u201d and \u201cOther liabilities\u201d in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nThere have been no transfers between fair value measurements levels during the twelve months ended January 31, 2021.\nDerivative Instruments\nThe Company entered into an interest rate swap in May 2012 to mitigate the exposure to the variability of one month LIBOR for its floating rate debt described in Note 10 \u201cDebt\u201d within these Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The fair value of the interest rate swap is reflected as a liability in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and the change in fair value is reported in \u201cOther expense (income), net\u201d in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss). The fair value of the interest rate swap is estimated as the net present value of projected cash flows based upon forward interest rates at the balance sheet date.\nThe fair values of the derivative instrument at January 31, 2021 and January 31, 2020 were as follows (in thousands):\nLiability\nFair Value\nBalance Sheet\nLocation\nJanuary 31,\nJanuary 31,\nDerivative instrument:\nInterest rate swap\nOther liabilities\n$ (325 )\n$ (232 )\nTotal\n$ (325 )\n(232 )\nThe change in fair value of the interest rate swap recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) for the twelve months ended January 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 was $(93,000), $(368,000) and $(51,000), respectively.\n4. INCOME TAXES\nThe provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis and operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax laws is recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) in the period that includes the enactment date.\nThe Company utilizes a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain income tax positions (tax contingencies). The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The Company considers many factors when evaluating its tax positions and estimating its tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments. The Company includes interest and penalties related to its tax contingencies in income tax expense.\nValuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not expected to be realized based on the weight of positive and negative evidence. Future realization of deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income within the carryback or carryforward periods available under the applicable tax law. The Company regularly reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies. The Company\u2019s judgments regarding future profitability may change due to many factors, including future market conditions and the ability to successfully execute its business plans. Should there be a change in the ability to recover deferred tax assets, the tax provision would increase or decrease in the period in which the assessment is changed.\nThe domestic and foreign components of income (loss) before (benefit from) provision for income taxes consisted of the following:\nYears Ended January 31,\n(in thousands)\nDomestic net income before income taxes\n$ 7,725 $ 2,963 $ 6,562\nForeign net income (loss) before income taxes\n3,096 (6,567 )\n5,355\nIncome (loss) before income taxes\n$ 10,821 $ (3,604 )\n$ 11,917\nIncome tax (benefit) expense is summarized as follows:\nYears Ended January 31,\n(in thousands)\nCurrent:\nU.S. federal\n$ 997 $ 471 $ (829 )\nState\n37 130 (13 )\nForeign\n2,376 2,149 3,784\nSubtotal\n3,410 2,750 2,942\nDeferred:\nU.S. federal\n3 25 79\nState\n6 (107 )\n(30 )\nForeign\n(3,663 ) 9,677 (1,502 )\nSubtotal\n(3,654 ) 9,595 (1,453 )\nTotal\n$ (244 ) $ 12,345 $ 1,489\nActual income tax (benefit) expense differs from that obtained by applying the statutory federal income tax rate to income before income taxes as follows:\nYears Ended January 31,\n(in thousands)\nComputed expected tax expense (benefit)\n$ 2,272 $ (757 )\n$ 2,503\nState income taxes, net of federal income tax expense\n272 (581 )\nIncremental tax expense from foreign operations\n1,708 1,256 715\nEquity compensation\n(958 ) (4,198 )\n(2,916 )\nForeign withholding taxes\n1,619 1,103 1,089\nNet change in valuation allowance\n(3,438 ) 16,179 3,224\nNet change in uncertain tax positions\n125 3 (71 )\nNon-deductible expenses\n(41 ) 218 1,149\nBenefit of tax credits\n(2,569 ) (1,719 )\n(3,483 )\nSubpart F income\n611 27 101\nU.S. Tax Reform (the Tax Act)\n- - (1,312 )\nRate change impact\n123 867 124\nOther\n32 (53 )\nTotal income tax (benefit) expense\n$ (244 ) $ 12,345 $ 1,489\nWhen calculating QAD\u2019s income tax expense for fiscal 2021, the Company considered the Tax Cuts and Job Act (The Tax Act). The Company calculated an estimate for global intangible low-tax income (GILTI) in the Company\u2019s tax expense based on the final GILTI regulations released on July 20, 2020 by the U.S. Department of Treasury. The final regulations allow taxpayers to exclude certain high-taxed income of a controlled foreign corporation from their GILTI computation on an elective basis. These regulations provide computational, definitional, and anti-avoidance rule guidance relating to the determination of a U.S. shareholder\u2019s GILTI inclusion. In fiscal year 2021, cash taxes were not impacted by GILTI since the Company has enough net operating loss carryforward to offset this liability. In fiscal years 2020 and 2019, tax expense was not impacted by GILTI since the Company experienced losses overseas.\nThe Company has elected to treat the deferred taxes related to GILTI provisions as a current-period expense when incurred (the period cost method).\nAs of January 31, 2021, the Company continues to maintain its permanent reinvestment assertion under APB 23 for all of its foreign subsidiaries as it relates to withholding taxes, state taxes and currency translation. These permanently reinvested earnings are approximately $90 million at January 31, 2021. It is not practicable for the Company to determine the amount of the related unrecognized deferred income tax liability.\nDeferred Income Taxes\nDeferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes.\nSignificant components of the Company\u2019s deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows:\nJanuary 31,\n(in thousands)\nDeferred tax assets:\nAllowance for doubtful accounts and sales adjustments\n$ 700 $ 600\nAccrued vacation\n1,305 1,499\nTax credits\n24,312 22,077\nDeferred revenue\n2,670 3,136\nLease liabilities\n5,046 4,142\nNet operating loss carryforwards\n13,794 15,475\nAccrued expenses - other\n2,543 2,038\nOther comprehensive income\n3,624 1,603\nSection 263(a) interest capitalization\n182 190\nIntellectual property\n4,583 6,250\nEquity compensation\n4,219 3,579\nCarryforward of Irish amortization\n5,728 3,614\nOther\n718 1,767\nTotal deferred tax assets\n69,424 65,970\nLess valuation allowance\n(48,571 ) (50,972 )\nLess netting of unrecognized tax benefits against deferred tax assets\n(968 ) (973 )\nDeferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance\n$ 19,885 $ 14,025\nDeferred tax liabilities:\nDepreciation and amortization\n(612 ) (851 )\nAcquisition accounting basis differences\n(2,514 ) -\nCosts to obtain and fulfill contracts\n(3,081 ) (3,054 )\nASC 842 lease right of use assets\n(4,756 ) (3,931 )\nOther liabilities\n(396 ) (355 )\nTotal deferred tax liabilities\n(11,359 ) (8,191 )\nTotal net deferred tax assets\n$ 8,526 $ 5,834\nValuation Allowance\nThe Company reviews its net deferred tax assets by entity at each balance sheet date to determine whether a valuation allowance is necessary based on the more-likely-than-not standard. During fiscal year 2021, management considered all available evidence, both positive and negative, to determine whether, based on the weight of that evidence, a valuation allowance was needed. Management assessed the transfer pricing methodology, the historical profits, the economics of the country in which the entity operates, the current and future customer base, the type and character of the deferred tax asset and any other current and relevant information by entity to draw its conclusion.\nIn fiscal year 2021, the Company continued to apply a valuation allowance against its U.S. federal and state net deferred tax assets due to a U.S. three-year cumulative loss and future earmarked investment in research and development. When the Company\u2019s operating performance improves on a sustained basis, the conclusion regarding the need for a valuation allowance may change, resulting in the reversal of some or all of the valuation allowance in the future.\nBased on the weight of evidence both positive and negative, the Company continued to maintain a full valuation allowance on the Irish principal\u2019s net deferred tax assets in fiscal year 2021 as the negative evidence, which consisted of a three-year cumulative loss, and future earmarked investment outweighed the positive evidence.\nThe valuation allowance on the Company\u2019s German and Hong Kong entities was released during fiscal 2021 after management concluded that these entities will \u201cmore-likely-than-not\u201d be able to utilize the remaining net operating losses within the foreseeable future.\nA valuation allowance has been established for select foreign jurisdictions along with U.S. federal and state net deferred tax assets. The following table discloses the Company\u2019s valuation allowance by entity (in millions):\nJurisdiction\nJanuary 31,\nJanuary 31,\nU.S. federal and state\n$ 30.3 $ 30.3\nIrish principal\n12.0 11.6\nBrazil\n6.1 5.7\nGermany\n- 2.6\nHong Kong\n- 0.6\nSouth Africa\n0.2 0.2\nTotal valuation allowance\n$ 48.6 $ 51.0\nNet Operating Losses and Tax Credits\nThe Company has deferred tax asset net operating loss carryforwards of $13.8 million and tax credit carryforwards of $24.3 million as of January 31, 2021. The majority of the Company\u2019s net operating loss carryforwards do not expire. The following table shows the Company\u2019s credit carryforwards (in thousands):\nCredit Carryforwards\nJanuary 31,\nForeign tax credit\n$ 6,338\nFederal R&D credit\n8,336\nState R&D credit\n9,380\nAMT credit and New hire retention\nTotal credit\n$ 24,312\nThe Company\u2019s U.S. R&D credits, California R&D credits and U.S. foreign tax credits have been valued. The Company had $14,000 of U.S. R&D tax credits that expired in October 2020 and the remaining U.S. R&D credits will begin to expire in fiscal year 2027. The majority of the Company\u2019s state and foreign R&D tax credits do not expire. The Company\u2019s foreign tax credits will begin to expire in fiscal year 2028.\nUnrecognized Tax Benefits\nDuring the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021, the Company increased its reserves for uncertain tax positions by $0.1 million. Interest and penalties on accrued but unpaid taxes are classified in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) as income tax expense. The liability for unrecognized tax benefits that may be recognized in the next twelve months is classified as short-term in the Company\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheets while the remainder is classified as long-term.\nThe following table reconciles the gross amounts of unrecognized tax benefits at the beginning and end of the period:\nYears Ended January 31,\n(in thousands)\nUnrecognized tax benefits at beginning of the year\n$ 1,171 $ 1,168\nDecreases as a result of tax positions taken in a prior period\n- -\nIncreases as a result of tax positions taken in the prior period\n130 143\nReduction as a result of a lapse of the statute of limitations\n(5 ) (37 )\nDecreases as a result of settlements with taxing authorities\n- (103 )\nUnrecognized tax benefit at end of year\n$ 1,296 $ 1,171\nAll of the unrecognized tax benefits included in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at January 31, 2021 would impact the effective tax rate on income (loss) from continuing operations, if recognized.\nThe total amount of interest recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) for unpaid taxes was $22,000 for the year ended January 31, 2021. The total amount of interest and penalties accrued in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at January 31, 2021 was $0.1 million.\nAudit Status and Open Statutes\nThe Company files U.S. federal, state, and foreign tax returns that are subject to audit by various tax authorities. The Company is currently under audit in:\n\u25cf\nIndia for fiscal years ended March 31, 2010, 2013, and 2018*\n\u25cf\nFrance for fiscal years ended January 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020\nDuring fiscal 2021, the Company closed the following audits with no adjustments:\n\u25cf\nGermany for fiscal years ended January 31, 2015, 2016 and 2017\n\u25cf\nThailand for fiscal year ended January 31, 2018\n\u25cf\nMexico for fiscal years ended December 31, 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018\n\u25cf\nIndia for fiscal year ended March 31, 2018*\n*QAD has had multiple audits of different subsidiaries in India.

STOCKHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY\nCommon Stock\nThe Company has two classes of common stock. Each share of Class B Common Stock entitles the holder to one vote and each share of Class A Common Stock entitles the holder to 1/20th of one vote. On all matters, the Class A Common Stock and the Class B Common Stock will vote as a single class, except as otherwise required by applicable law or the articles of incorporation. Neither the Class A Common Stock nor the Class B Common Stock are convertible into the other, unless either or both classes becomes subject to exclusion from the principal national securities exchange on which such securities are traded, in which case all outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock may be converted into shares of Class B Common Stock on a share-for-share basis by resolution of the Board of Directors. There are no restrictions on the transferability of either class.\nThe amount of any dividend payable in cash or non-cash property of the Company (other than a dividend payable solely in the Company\u2019s capital stock) with respect to each share of Class A Common Stock is equal to 120% of the value of any such dividend payable with respect to a share of Class B Common Stock, except for dividends declared for the purpose of distributing all or some of the proceeds received by the Company from any transaction determined by the Board to be a material transaction not in the ordinary course of business or for the purpose of effecting a spin-off of a subsidiary of the Company (in either case, such dividend will be paid ratably, on a per share basis, to all holders of Common Stock).\nDividends\nThe following table sets forth the dividends declared and paid by the Company during fiscal 2021:\nDeclaration\nDate\nRecord Date\nPayable\nDividend\nClass A\nDividend\nClass B\n(in thousands)\n12/14/2020\n12/29/2020\n1/7/2021\n$ 0.072 $ 0.06 $ 1,450\n9/9/2020\n9/23/2020\n9/30/2020\n$ 0.072 $ 0.06 $ 1,451\n6/11/2020\n6/25/2020\n7/7/2020\n$ 0.072 $ 0.06 $ 1,448\n4/7/2020\n4/22/2020\n4/29/2020\n$ 0.072 $ 0.06 $ 1,431\n6. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION\nStock Plans\nOn June 14, 2016, the stockholders approved the QAD Inc. 2016 Stock Incentive Program (2016 Program). The 2016 Program allows for equity awards in the form of incentive stock options, non-statutory stock options, restricted shares, rights to purchase stock, stock appreciation rights (SARs) and other stock rights. The stockholders authorized a maximum of 4,000,000 shares to be issued under the 2016 Program. Prior to July 1, 2016, stock awards were issued under the QAD Inc. 2006 Stock Incentive Program. As of January 31, 2021, 2,418,000 Class A Common Shares were available for issuance.\nThe Company issues restricted stock units (RSUs) to employees under the 2016 Program, which are released 25% after each year of service for four years and are contingent upon employment with the Company on the release date.\nIn fiscal 2020, the Company began issuing performance stock units (PSUs) to certain executive employees under the 2016 Program. PSUs issued in the fiscal year ending 2021 are released 1/2 after each year of service for two years and are contingent upon employment with the Company and achievement of pre-determined performance objectives. PSUs issued in the fiscal year ending 2020 are released 1/3 after each year of service for three years and are contingent upon employment with the Company and achievement of pre-determined performance objectives. To determine the anticipated achievement of the performance objectives, management must make assumptions regarding the likelihood of the Company meeting those targets. The number of PSUs that vest will be predicated on the Company achieving performance objectives during the measurement period subsequent to the date of grant. Depending on the financial performance levels achieved, a percentage of the PSUs (0% to 200% of the target award) will vest to the grantees of those stock units. There is no guarantee that the Company\u2019s outstanding PSUs will vest in whole or in part.\nIn prior years, the Company has issued equity awards in the form of stock-settled SARs to the President of the Company. A SAR is a contractual right to receive value tied to the post-grant appreciation of the underlying stock. Although the Company has the ability to grant stock-settled or cash-settled SARs, the Company has only granted stock-settled SARs. Upon vesting, a holder of a stock-settled SAR receives shares in the Company\u2019s common stock equal to the intrinsic value of the SAR at time of exercise. Under the 2016 Program and 2006 Program, SARs have been granted for a term of eight years. They vest 25% after each year of service for four years and are contingent upon employment with the Company on the vesting date. Economically, a stock-settled SAR provides the same compensation value as a stock option, but the employee is not required to pay an exercise price upon exercise of the SAR. Stock compensation expense, as required under ASC 718, is the same for stock-settled SARs and stock options.\nEquity awards are also issued to non-employee Board members that are newly-appointed or reelected at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders. They are granted Class A shares as stock payments that are fully vested on the date of grant. Equity awards to non-employee Board members are limited to $250,000 per year, as determined for the Company\u2019s financial accounting purposes as of the date of grant.\nUnder the 2016 Program, officers, directors, employees, consultants and other independent contractors or agents of the Company or subsidiaries of the Company who are responsible for or contribute to the management, growth or profitability of its business are eligible for selection by the program administrators to participate. However, incentive stock options granted under the 2016 Program may only be granted to a person who is an employee of the Company or one of its subsidiaries.\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe following table sets forth reported stock-based compensation expense included in the Company\u2019s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019:\nYears Ended January 31,\n(in thousands)\nStock-based compensation expense:\nCost of subscription\n$ 544 $ 315 $ 252\nCost of maintenance\n479 540 497\nCost of professional services\n1,652 1,456 1,219\nSales and marketing\n2,913 2,057 2,111\nResearch and development\n2,241 1,863 1,620\nGeneral and administrative\n6,363 5,123 4,423\nTotal stock-based compensation expense\n$ 14,192 $ 11,354 $ 10,122\nRSU Information\nThe following table summarizes the activity for RSUs for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019:\nRSUs\n(in thousands)\nWeighted\nAverage\nGrant Date\nFair Value\nRestricted stock at January 31, 2018\n653 $ 25.10\nGranted\n300 51.70\nReleased (1)\n(263 )\n25.80\nForfeited\n(27 )\n30.63\nRestricted stock at January 31, 2019\n663 $ 36.64\nGranted\n281 40.43\nReleased (1)\n(267 )\n32.71\nForfeited\n(50 )\n38.51\nRestricted stock at January 31, 2020\n627 $ 39.86\nGranted\n350 40.50\nReleased (1)\n(258 )\n35.99\nForfeited\n(21 )\n41.67\nRestricted stock at January 31, 2021\n698 $ 41.56\n(1)\nThe number of RSUs released includes shares withheld on behalf of employees to satisfy minimum statutory tax withholding requirements. During the fiscal years ended January 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Company withheld 80,000 shares, 82,000 shares and 81,000 shares, respectively, for payment of these taxes. The value of the withheld shares for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 were $3.4 million, $3.5 million and $4.3 million, respectively.\nTotal unrecognized compensation cost related to RSUs was approximately $22.4 million as of January 31, 2021. This cost is expected to be recognized over a period of approximately 2.5 years.\nPSU Information\nThe estimated fair value of PSUs was calculated based on the closing price of the Company\u2019s common stock on the date of grant, reduced by the present value of dividends foregone during the vesting period. The vesting is subject to attainment of specified performance criteria. Each fiscal quarter, QAD estimates the probability of the achievement of the performance goal and recognizes any related stock-based compensation expense using the graded-vesting method. The amount of stock-based compensation expense recognized in any one period can vary based on the attainment or expected attainment of the performance goal. If the performance goal is not met, no compensation expense is recognized and any previously recognized compensation expense is reversed.\nStock-based compensation expense related to performance-based restricted stock grants for fiscal year 2021 was $2.2 million.\nThe following table summarizes the activity for PSUs for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2021 and 2020:\nPSUs\n(in thousands)\nWeighted\nAverage\nGrant Date\nFair Value\nPerformance stock units at January 31, 2019\n- $ -\nGranted\n93 39.82\nReleased\n- -\nForfeited\n(3 )\n39.82\nPerformance stock units at January 31, 2020\n90 $ 39.82\nGranted\n93 40.54\nReleased (1)\n(21 )\n39.82\nForfeited\n(9 )\n39.82\nPerformance stock units at January 31, 2021\n153 $ 40.26\n(1)\nThe number of PSUs released includes shares withheld on behalf of employees to satisfy minimum statutory tax withholding requirements.

This cost is expected to be recognized over a period of approximately 0.9 years.\nSAR Information\nThe weighted average assumptions used to value SARs are shown in the following table.\nYear Ended January 31, 2019\nExpected life in years\n5.50\nRisk free interest rate\n2.80 %\nVolatility\n31 %\nDividend rate\n0.54 %\nThe following table summarizes the activity for outstanding SARs for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019:\nSARs\n(in thousands)\nWeighted\nAverage\nExercise\nPrice per\nShare\nWeighted\nAverage\nRemaining\nContractual\nTerm\n(years)\nAggregate\nIntrinsic\nValue\n(in thousands)\nOutstanding at January 31, 2018\n3,024 $ 17.78\nGranted\n380 53.50\nExercised\n(390 )\n9.43\nExpired\n(5 )\n9.17\nForfeited\n(476 )\n37.14\nOutstanding at January 31, 2019\n2,533 $ 20.81\nGranted\n- -\nExercised\n(1,184 )\n16.19\nExpired\n- -\nForfeited\n- -\nOutstanding at January 31, 2020\n1,349 $ 24.86\nGranted\n- -\nExercised\n(205 )\n12.91\nExpired\n- -\nForfeited\n- -\nOutstanding at January 31, 2021\n1,144 $ 27.01 2.9 $ 40,971\nVested and exercisable at January 31, 2021\n1,002 $ 24.28 2.5 $ 38,324\nThe aggregate intrinsic value in the table above represents the total pretax intrinsic value (the aggregate difference between the closing stock price of the Company\u2019s common stock based on the last trading day as of January 31, 2021 and the exercise price for in-the-money SARs) that would have been received by the holders if all SARs had been exercised on January 31, 2021. The total intrinsic value of SARs exercised in the years ended January 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 was $6.1 million, $26.5 million and $12.4 million, respectively. The weighted average grant date fair value per share of SARs granted in the year ended January 31, 2019 was $16.99. No SARs were granted in fiscal 2021 and 2020.\nThe number of SARs exercised includes shares withheld on behalf of employees to satisfy minimum statutory tax withholding requirements. During the fiscal years ended January 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Company withheld 57,000, 56,000 and 104,000 shares for payment of these taxes. The value of the withheld shares for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2021, 2019 and 2018 were $2.5 million, $2.7 million and $4.4 million, respectively.\nAt January 31, 2021, there was approximately $1.3 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested SARs. This cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 1.0 years.\n7. BUSINESS COMBINATION\nAllocation Network\nOn December 31, 2020, the Company acquired all of the outstanding stock of Allocation Network GmbH (Allocation Network), a best-in class provider of strategic sourcing and supplier management solutions founded in 1998 and is headquartered in Munich, Germany. The total consideration of approximately $19.0 million is comprised of $14.2 million in cash, net of cash acquired, and $4.8 million in estimated fair value of contingent earnout consideration. The earnout consideration is between zero and $10.2 million based on Allocation Network\u2019s cloud bookings growth over the next three years. The Company completed the acquisition for the purpose of expanding its product offerings and driving revenue growth.\nThe following table summarizes the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date (in thousands):\nTangible assets, including cash acquired of $0.9 million\n$ 3,420\nGoodwill\n12,785\nOther intangible assets\n7,751\nTotal assets acquired\n23,956\nLiabilities assumed\n(1,576 )\nDeferred tax liability\n(2,549 )\nNet assets acquired\n$ 19,831\nThe Company believes the amount of goodwill resulting from the purchase price allocation is attributable to the expected synergistic benefits of being able to leverage Allocation Network\u2019s software with the Company\u2019s existing software to provide an integrated suite to the customer bases of both the Company and Allocation Network. The acquired goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes.\nIdentified intangible assets will be amortized to cost of subscription and operating expense based upon the nature of the asset ratably over the estimated useful life, as detailed in the table below (in thousands, except year amounts):\nEstimated\nuseful life\n(years)\nFair\nvalue\nEstimated\nannual\namortization\nStatement of operations\nclassification\nSoftware technology\n$ 6,056\n$ 1,211\nCost of subscription\nCustomer relationships\n1,695\nAmortization of intangible assets from acquisitions\n$ 7,751\nThe Company has evaluated and continues to evaluate pre-acquisition contingencies relating to Allocation Network that existed as of the acquisition date. The Company has preliminarily determined that certain of these pre-acquisition contingencies are probable in nature and estimable as of the acquisition date and, accordingly, has recorded its best estimates for these contingencies as a part of the purchase price allocation. The Company continues to gather information and evaluate pre-acquisition contingencies that it has assumed. If the Company makes changes to the amounts recorded or identifies additional pre-acquisition contingencies during the remainder of the measurement period, such amounts recorded will be recorded as adjustments to the purchase price allocation.\nThe financial results of Allocation Network are included in the Consolidated Financial Statements from the date of acquisition. Pro forma information has not been presented for operations of Allocation Network as the impact was not material to the Company\u2019s Consolidated Financial Statements.\n8.

As the market capitalization substantially exceeded the Company\u2019s net assets, there was no indication of goodwill impairment for fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019. The Company did not identify any events or changes in circumstances since the performance of its annual goodwill impairment test that would require the performance another goodwill impairment test during the fiscal year.\nIntangible Assets\nIntangible assets and accumulated amortization at January 31 were as follows:\n(in thousands)\nAmortizable intangible assets:\nCustomer relationships\n$ 3,039 $ 1,379\nLess accumulated amortization\n(681 ) (394 )\nNet amortizable intangible assets\n$ 2,358 $ 985\nThe Company\u2019s intangible assets are related to acquisitions completed in the second and third quarters of fiscal 2019 and in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021.

The 2012 Mortgage matures in June 2022 and is secured by the Company\u2019s headquarters located in Santa Barbara, California. In conjunction with the 2012 Mortgage, QAD Ortega Hill, LLC entered into an interest rate swap with Mechanics Bank. The swap agreement has an initial notional amount of $16.1 million and a schedule matching that of the underlying loan that synthetically fixes the interest rate on the debt at 4.31% for the entire term of the 2012 Mortgage. The terms of the 2012 Mortgage provide for QAD Ortega Hill, LLC to make net monthly payments of $88,100 consisting of principal and interest and one final payment of $11.7 million. The unpaid balance as of January 31, 2021 was $12.4 million.\n11. LEASES\nThe Company leases certain office space, office equipment and autos with remaining lease terms from two months to ten years under leases classified as operating or finance. The Company has options to terminate some of its leases early. The lease term represents the period up to the early termination date unless it is reasonably certain that QAD will not exercise the early termination option.

EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS\nThe Company has a defined contribution 401(k) plan which is available to U.S. employees after 30 days of employment. Employees may contribute up to the maximum allowable by the Internal Revenue Code. The Company voluntarily matches 75% of the employees\u2019 contributions up to the first four percent of the employee\u2019s eligible compensation. In addition, the Company can make additional contributions at the discretion of the board of directors. Participants are immediately vested in their employee contributions. Employer contributions vest 25% per year of service over four years of service. The Company\u2019s contributions for fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019 were $2.2 million, $2.1 million and $2.2 million, respectively.\nVarious QAD foreign subsidiaries also contribute to defined contribution pension plans. Employer contributions in these plans are generally based on employee salary and range from 2% to 20%. These plans are funded at various times throughout the year according to plan provisions, with aggregate employer contributions of $4.1 million for fiscal 2021, $4.7 million for fiscal 2020 and $5.3 million for fiscal 2019.\n14. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nPurchase Obligations\nAt January 31, 2021, the Company had $23.4 million of other non-cancelable contractual obligations, related to the purchase of goods and services for periods through fiscal 2025.\nIndemnifications\nThe Company sells software licenses and services to its customers under written agreements. Each agreement contains the relevant terms of the contractual arrangement with the customer and generally includes certain provisions for indemnifying the customer against losses, expenses and liabilities from damages that may be awarded against the customer in the event the Company\u2019s software is found to infringe upon certain intellectual property rights of a third party. The agreements generally limit the scope of and remedies for such indemnification obligations in a variety of industry-standard respects.\nThe Company believes its internal development processes and other policies and practices limit its exposure related to the indemnification provisions of the agreements. For several reasons, including the lack of prior indemnification claims and the lack of a monetary liability limit for certain infringement cases under the agreements, the Company cannot determine the maximum amount of potential future payments, if any, related to such indemnification provisions.\nLegal Actions\nThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims, either asserted or unasserted, which arise in the ordinary course of business. While the outcome of these claims cannot be predicted with certainty, management does not believe that the outcome of any of these legal matters will have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s consolidated results of operations, financial position or liquidity.\n15. BUSINESS SEGMENT INFORMATION\nThe Company markets its products and services worldwide, primarily to companies in the manufacturing industry, including automotive, consumer products, food and beverage, high technology, industrial products and life sciences industries. The Company sells and licenses its products through its direct sales force in four geographic regions: North America; Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA); Asia Pacific; and Latin America and through distributors where third parties can extend sales reach more effectively or efficiently. The North America region includes the United States and Canada. The EMEA region includes Europe, the Middle East and Africa. The Asia Pacific region includes Asia and Australia. The Latin America region includes South America, Central America and Mexico. In accordance with ASC Topic 606, the Company reports disaggregated revenue by geography and by industry as the Company believes it best depicts how the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors. The Company does not consider reporting by industry an operating segment in accordance with ASC 280, Segment Reporting, because discrete financial information by industry is not available. The Company\u2019s Chief Operating Decision Maker, the Chief Executive Officer, reviews the consolidated results within one operating segment.\nSubscription, license and maintenance revenues are generally assigned to the region where a majority of end users are located. Professional services revenue is assigned based on the region where the services are delivered.\nYears Ended January 31,\n(in thousands)\nRevenue:\nNorth America (1)\n$ 155,244 $ 151,097 $ 162,307\nEMEA\n93,351 90,885 96,989\nAsia Pacific\n39,327 46,363 51,628\nLatin America\n19,943 22,427 22,092\n$ 307,865 $ 310,772 $ 333,016\n(1)\nSales into Canada accounted for 2% of North America total revenue for each of the fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019.\nProperty and equipment, net are assigned by geographic region based on the location of each legal entity.\nJanuary 31,\n(in thousands)\nProperty and equipment, net:\nNorth America\n$ 21,358 $ 23,439\nEMEA\n2,792 3,262\nAsia Pacific\n1,307 1,674\nLatin America\n141 312\n$ 25,598 $ 28,687\n16.
