    "item_1": "Item 1. Business\nAs used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the terms \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cus,\u201d \u201cour,\u201d the \u201cCompany,\u201d \u201cCleanSpark, Inc.\u201d and \u201cCleanSpark\u201d mean CleanSpark, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, unless otherwise indicated.\nOverview\nCleanSpark, Inc. is a leading bitcoin mining and diversified energy company incorporated in Nevada, whose common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market. We sustainably mine bitcoin; we also provide advanced energy technology solutions to commercial and residential customers to solve modern energy challenges. The Company, through itself and its wholly owned subsidiaries, has operated in the digital currency mining sector since December 2020, and in the alternative energy sector since March 2014.\nWe are currently working with industry leaders and other advisors in developing a long-term sustainability and clean energy plan. We are also using all available clean and renewable energy resources that we currently have reasonable access to in all of our bitcoin mining locations in order to further support our sustainability efforts.\nLines of Business\nDigital Currency Mining Segment\nThrough our wholly owned subsidiaries, ATL Data Centers LLC (\u201cATL\u201d) and CleanBlok, Inc. (\u201cCleanBlok\u201d), we mine bitcoin. We entered the bitcoin mining industry through our acquisition of ATL in December 2020. We acquired a second data center in August 2021 and have had a co-location agreement with New York-based Coinmint in place since July 2021. Bitcoin mining has now become our principal revenue generating business activity. We currently intend to continue to acquire additional facilities, equipment and infrastructure capacity to continue to expand our bitcoin mining operations.\nBitcoin was introduced in 2008 with the goal of serving as a digital means of exchanging and storing value. Bitcoin is a form of digital currency that depends upon a consensus-based network and a public ledger called a \u201cblockchain,\u201d which contains a record of every bitcoin transaction ever processed. The bitcoin network is the first decentralized peer-to-peer payment network, powered by users participating in the consensus protocol, with no central authority or middlemen, that has wide network participation. The authenticity of each bitcoin transaction is protected through digital signatures that correspond with addresses of users that send and receive bitcoin. Users have full control over remitting bitcoin from their own sending addresses. All transactions on the bitcoin blockchain are transparent, allowing those running the appropriate software to confirm the validity of each transaction. To be recorded on the blockchain, each bitcoin transaction is validated through a proof-of-work consensus method, which entails solving complex mathematical problems to validate transactions and post them on the blockchain. This process is called mining. Miners are rewarded with bitcoins, both in the form of newly-created bitcoins and fees in bitcoin, for successfully solving the mathematical problems and providing computing power to the network.\nFactors such as access to computer processing capacity, interconnectivity, electricity cost, environmental factors (such as cooling capacity) and location play important roles in mining. As of the date of this filing, our mining units are currently capable of producing over 1.3 exahash/s (\u201cEH\u201d) in hash rate capacity. In cryptocurrency mining, \u201chash rate\u201d is a measure of the processing capacity and speed by which a mining computer mines and processes transactions on the bitcoin network. Our activities in this area are complemented by our energy background and planning is underway to deploy our portfolio of energy technologies to advance our bitcoin mining business, with the goal of maximizing energy savings, increasing total power capacity, providing resilient electricity, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. We are expanding our bitcoin mining business with the goal of reaching 2.0 EH/s in hashrate capacity at or near the end of December 31, 2021. We expect to exceed 3 EH/s in capacity by mid-to-late 2022. Hash rate capacity is one of the most important metrics for evaluating bitcoin mining companies.\nWe obtain bitcoin as a result of our mining operations; while we retain a significant portion of the bitcoin, we have sold, and intend to sell bitcoin from time to time, to support our operations and strategic growth. We do not currently plan to engage in regular trading of bitcoin (other than as necessary to convert our bitcoin to U.S. dollars) or to engage in hedging activities related to our holding of bitcoin; however, our decisions to hold or sell bitcoin at any given time may be impacted by the bitcoin market, which has been historically characterized by significant volatility. Currently, we do not use a formula or specific methodology to determine whether or when we will sell bitcoin that we hold, or the number of bitcoins we will sell. Rather, decisions to hold or sell bitcoins are currently determined by analyzing forecasts and monitoring the market in real time.\nThrough our recently formed wholly owned subsidiaries, CSRE Properties, LLC, CSRE Property Management Company LLC, and CSRE Properties Norcross, LLC, we maintain real property holdings for ATL and CleanBlok.\nEnergy Segment\nWe provide energy solutions through our wholly-owned subsidiaries CleanSpark, LLC, CleanSpark Critical Power Systems, Inc., GridFabric, LLC, and Solar Watt Solutions, Inc. These solutions consist of engineering, design and software solutions, custom hardware solutions, Open Automated Demand response (\u201cOpenADR\u201d), solar, energy storage for microgrid and distributed energy systems to military, commercial and residential customers in Southern California and through the world.\nOur solutions are supported by our proprietary suite of software platforms (collectively, the \u201cPlatforms\u201d) that include microgrid energy modeling, energy market communications and energy management solutions as summarized below:\n\u00b7 mPulse and mVoult: Patented, proprietary controls platforms that enable integration and optimization of multiple energy sources.\n\u00b7 Canvas: Middleware used by grid operators and aggregators to administrate load shifting programs.\n\u00b7 Plaid: Middleware used by controls and IoT (internet-of-things) product companies to participate in load shifting programs.\n\u00b7 mVSO: Energy modeling software for internal microgrid design .\nThe Platforms were developed to enable the designing, building, and operating of distributed energy systems and microgrids which efficiently manage energy assets. These strategies are generally targeted to achieve resiliency and economic optimization.\nWe also own patented gasification energy technologies. Our technology converts organic material into synthesis gas, which can be used as fuel for a variety of applications and as feedstock for the generation of DME (Di-Methyl Ether). As previously disclosed, we currently plan to continue to focus on our other offerings.\nOther business activities\nThrough p2kLabs, Inc., we provide design, software development, and other technology-based consulting services. The services provided are generally hourly or fixed-fee project-based arrangements.\nThrough ATL, we also provide traditional data center services, such as providing customers with rack space, power and equipment, and offer several cloud services including virtual services, virtual storage, and data backup services.\nMarkets, Geography and Major Customers\nDigital Currency Mining Segment\nBitcoin is a global store and exchange of value used by people across the world as an asset and to conduct daily transactions. Mining bitcoin supports the global bitcoin blockchain and the millions of people that depend on it for economic security and other benefits. Strictly speaking, there is no customer market for mining bitcoin but we consider our mining pool operators as customers because they compensate us for providing processing power to the mining pool (see",

duties or could require us to pay any amounts incurred by our directors or officers in any such actions.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOur business has been, and in the future may be, subject to risks arising from pandemic, epidemic, or an outbreak of diseases, such as the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOn March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak to be a pandemic. Since then, COVID-19 has spread across the globe and is impacting worldwide economic activity, including through quarantines, travel bans and restrictions, shelter-in-place orders, shutdowns of businesses, reductions in business activity, supply chain interruptions and overall economic and financial market instability. These measures have impacted, and may further impact, our workforce and operations, as well as the operations of our customers, our partners and our vendors and suppliers. Our critical business operations, including our headquarters, and many of our key suppliers, are located in regions which have been and continue to be impacted by COVID-19. Our customers and suppliers worldwide have also been affected by COVID-19 and may continue to experience material impacts well beyond the end of the pandemic.\nSpecifically, the manufacture of components of our products, the final assembly of our products, and other critical operations are concentrated in certain geographic locations that have been impacted by COVID-19 and in which local governments continue to take measures to try to contain the pandemic. There is considerable uncertainty regarding the impact of such measures and potential future measures, including restrictions on manufacturing facilities, on our support operations or workforce, or on our customers, partners, vendors and suppliers. Such measures, as well as restrictions on or disruptions of transportation, such as reduced availability or increased cost of air transport, port closures, and increased border controls or closures, could limit our capacity to meet customer demand and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and other factors have adversely affected our supply chain, consistent with its effect across many industries, including creating shipping and logistics challenges and placing significant limits on component supplies. These effects on our supply chain have resulted in delayed product availability in our energy business, especially when combined with the demand for our products, and have adversely impacted, and may continue to adversely impact, our ability to meet our energy product demand, result in additional costs, or may otherwise adversely impact our business and results of operations. They have also significantly increased the costs of shipping miners, related components and infrastructure. We expect these impacts, including delayed product availability, to continue for as long as the global supply chain is experiencing these challenges.\nThe spread of COVID-19 has also caused us to modify our business practices as we comply with state-mandated requirements for safety in the workplace to ensure the health, safety, and welling-being of our employees. While the company has implemented a Vaccination and Testing Policy, we still maintain other measures including personal protective equipment, social distancing, cleanliness of our facilities, and daily monitoring of the health of employees in our facilities, as well as modifying our policies on employee travel and the cancellation of physical participation in meetings,\nevents, and conferences. We may take further actions in response to the pandemic as may be required by government authorities or that we may determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, partners, and suppliers. However, we have not developed a specific and comprehensive contingency plan designed to address the challenges and risks presented by the COVID-19 pandemic and, even if and when we do develop such a plan, there can be no assurance that such plan will be effective in mitigating the potential adverse effects on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIn addition, while the extent and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy and our business in particular are difficult to assess or predict, the pandemic has resulted in, and may continue to result in, significant disruption of global financial markets, which may reduce our ability to access capital or our customers\u2019 ability to pay us for past or future purchases, which could negatively affect our working capital and liquidity. A recession or financial market correction resulting from the lack of containment and spread of COVID-19 could impact overall spending, adversely affecting demand for our products and services, our business, and the value of our common stock.\nThe ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic or a similar health epidemic is highly uncertain and subject to change. The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operational and financial performance, including our ability to execute our business strategies and initiatives in the expected time frame, will depend on future developments, including, but not limited to, the duration and continued spread of the pandemic, its severity, further related restrictions on travel, any reopening plans, the effectiveness of actions taken in the United States and other countries to contain and treat the disease, including, without limitation, the effectiveness and timing of vaccination initiatives in the United States and worldwide and the duration, timing, and severity of the impact on customer spending, including any recession resulting from the pandemic, all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted. An extended period of global supply chain and economic disruption as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, even after the pandemic subsides, could have a materially adverse impact on our business, results of operations, access to sources of capital and financial condition, though the full extent and duration of any such impact is also uncertain.\nSupply chain and shipping disruptions have resulted in shipping delays, a significant increase in shipping costs, and could increase product costs and result in lost sales, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nSupply chain disruptions, resulting from factors such as the COVID-19 pandemic, labor supply and shipping container shortages, have impacted, and may continue to impact, us and our third-party manufacturers and suppliers. These disruptions have resulted in longer lead times and increased product costs and shipping expenses, including with respect to the delivery of miners that we have purchased. While we have taken steps to minimize the impact of these increased costs by working closely with our suppliers and customers, there can be no assurances that unforeseen events impacting the supply chain will not have a material adverse effect on us in the future. Additionally, the impacts supply chain disruptions have on our third-party manufacturers and suppliers are not within our control. It is not currently possible to predict how long it will take for these supply chain disruptions to cease. Prolonged supply chain disruptions impacting us and our third-party manufacturers and suppliers could interrupt product manufacturing, increased lead times, increased product costs and result in lost sales and bitcoin production, result in a delay in the delivery of miners that we have purchased, and continue to increase shipping costs associated with the delivery of our purchased miners, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe have a limited operating history and a history of operating losses and negative cash flow, and we may never achieve consistent profitability.\nOur limited operating history, including our recent entry into the digital currency mining business, makes it difficult to evaluate our business and predict our future results of operations. Although we have achieved profitable quarters in the past, to date, we have not maintained consistent profitability from period to period, and no assurances can be made that we will achieve consistent profitability in the near future, if ever. From the Company\u2019s inception through September 30, 2021, we sustained $138,392,118 in cumulative net losses, and we had a net loss for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021 of $21,812,010. We have generated these losses as we attempt to implement our business plan, including expanding our existing products and customer base. We will not achieve consistent profitability unless and until we can develop a substantial and stable revenue base.\nOur future success is difficult to predict because we operate in emerging and evolving industries that are subject to volatile and unpredictable cycles.\nThe renewable energy, bitcoin mining, microgrid and related industries are emerging and evolving, which may lead to period-to-period variability in our operating results and may make it difficult to evaluate our future prospects. Our energy products and services are based on unique technology that we believe offers significant advantages to our customers, but the markets we serve are in a relatively early stage of development and it is uncertain how rapidly they will develop. It is also uncertain whether our energy products will achieve high levels of demand and acceptance as these markets grow. If companies and customers in the industries we serve do not perceive or value the benefits of our technologies and products, or if they are unwilling to adopt our products as alternatives to traditional power solutions, the market for our products and services may not develop or may develop more slowly than we expect, which could significantly and adversely impact our operating results.\nAs a supplier to the renewable energy, microgrid and related industries, we may be subject to business cycles, the timing, length, and volatility of which may be difficult to predict. The cyclical nature of our business may be driven by sudden changes in customers\u2019 manufacturing capacity requirements and spending, which depend in part on capacity utilization, demand for customers\u2019 products, inventory levels relative to demand and access to affordable capital. These changes may affect the timing and amounts of customers\u2019 purchases and investments in technology, and affect our orders, net sales, operating expenses, and net income. In addition, we may not be able to respond adequately or quickly to any declines in demand by reducing our costs. To meet rapidly changing demand in each of the industries we serve, we must effectively manage our resources and production capacity. During periods of decreasing demand for our products, we must be able to appropriately align our cost structure with prevailing market conditions, effectively manage our supply chain, and motivate and retain key employees. During periods of increasing demand for our products, we must have sufficient inventory to fulfill customer orders, effectively manage our supply chain, and attract, retain, and motivate a sufficient number of qualified individuals. If we are not able to timely and appropriately adapt to changes in our business environment or to accurately assess where we are positioned within a business cycle, our business, financial condition, or results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nThe markets in which we participate are highly competitive, and we may be unable to successfully compete.\nWe compete in the highly competitive market for renewable energy products and microgrid technology and associated services, as well as in certain operational aspects of our digital currency mining business, including, but not limited to, the acquisition of new miners, obtaining the lowest cost of electricity, obtaining clean energy sources, obtaining access to energy sites with reliable sources of power, and evaluating new technology developments in the industry. Evolving industry standards, rapid price changes and product obsolescence impact the market and its various participants, including us. Our competitors include many domestic and foreign companies, many of which have substantially greater financial, marketing, personnel and other resources than we do, which may cause us to be at a competitive disadvantage. Our current competitors or new market entrants could introduce new or enhanced technologies, products or services with features that render our technologies, products or services obsolete, less competitive or less marketable. The success of our energy business will be dependent upon our ability to develop products that are superior to existing products and products introduced in the future, and which are cost effective. In addition, we may be required to continually enhance any products that are developed as well as introduce new products that keep pace with technological change and address the increasingly sophisticated needs of the marketplace. Even if our current technologies prove to be commercially feasible, there is extensive research and development being conducted on alternative energy sources that may render our technologies and protocols obsolete or otherwise non-competitive. The success of our digital currency mining business will be further dependent upon our ability to purchase additional miners, adapt to changes in technology in the industry, and to obtain sufficient energy at reasonable prices, amongst other things.\nWe may also be unable to keep pace with the technological demands of the marketplace or successfully develop products that will succeed in the marketplace. Since many of our competitors are larger, well-established companies that have substantially greater financial, technical, manufacturing, marketing, distribution and other resources than us, we are at an inherent competitive disadvantage. We may not have the capital resources available to undertake the research that may be necessary to upgrade our equipment or develop new devices to meet the efficiencies of changing technologies. Our inability to adapt to technological change could have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe rely on a variety of intellectual property rights to protect our technology, and enforcing those rights could disrupt our business operation and divert resources that could ultimately harm our future prospects.\nWe rely on a combination of trade secrets, confidentiality agreements and procedures and patents to protect our proprietary technologies.\nOur business primarily relies upon trade secret laws and contractual restrictions, such as confidentiality agreements and work-for-hire provisions, to protect our technology, know-how and other proprietary information. It may be cost prohibitive for us to seek to enforce such rights through the legal-enforcement mechanisms available to us, and, in any case, such laws and contractual restrictions may not provide meaningful protection to us against the possible unauthorized use, misappropriation or disclosure of such trade secrets.\nIn relation to our microgrid business, we also own patents that protect our ability to receive data from a plurality of sources within a microgrid, which is then analyzed to forecast power needs across the microgrid, or a combination of multiple \u2018fractal\u2019 microgrids, and then determine whether or when to share power with the requesting module. The claims contained in those and any other patents we own may not provide adequate protection for our products and technology. In the absence of patent protection, our competitors may attempt to copy our products or gain access to our trade secrets and know-how. In addition, the laws of foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to our technology to the same extent as the laws of the U.S.\nIn addition, our ongoing expansion of our business, including, in particular, through the development of products, may result in claims of intellectual property infringement, regardless of merit. If an infringement claim or other dispute arises concerning our technology, we could become involved in litigation that might involve substantial cost. Litigation could divert substantial management attention away from our operations and into efforts to enforce our patents, protect our trade secrets or know-how or determine the scope of the proprietary rights of others. If a proceeding resulted in adverse findings, we could be subject to significant liabilities to third parties, and we might also be required to seek licenses from third parties to manufacture or sell our products. Our ability to manufacture and sell our products may also be adversely affected by other unforeseen factors relating to any such proceeding or its outcome.\nA significant part of our success will depend on our ability to manage our suppliers and contract manufacturers, and any failure to do so could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and relations with our customers.\nWe rely upon a limited number of suppliers to provide the components necessary to build our energy products and contract manufacturers to procure components and assemble our products. In addition, we rely on a limited number of suppliers for the purchase and delivery of our miners to support our digital currency mining operations. There can be no assurance that such key suppliers and contract manufacturers will provide components, products or miners in a timely and cost-efficient manner or otherwise meet our needs and expectations. Any disruption in such key suppliers\u2019 or contract manufacturers could delay our ability to provide our products to our customers or to expand our digital currency mining operations. Our ability to manage such relationships and timely replace suppliers and contract manufacturers, if necessary, is critical to our success. Our failure to timely replace our contract manufacturers and suppliers, should that become necessary, could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and relations with our customers. For example, we depend on Bitmain for the majority of our mining rigs and Pioneer Custom Electrical Products Corp. as a sole source contract manufacturer of our switchgear product lines, and any change in their ability to manufacture and deliver these products could have a significant impact on our results of operations.\nOur success is dependent upon our relationships with certain key customers.\nIn the past, we have derived a significant portion of our revenues from a relatively limited number of customers. Our dependence on a limited number of customers may continue in the future. The loss of any one of our major customers or decrease in demand by those customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, our results of operations and our cash flows.\nWe have limited experience selling our distributed energy focused products and solutions for use in residential markets, and our increased efforts in this regard may not be as successful as we expect or at all.\nAs a result of our recent acquisition of Solar Watt, we now are providing solar and alternative energy solutions for homeowners, as well as commercial businesses, and have developed a proprietary platform to enable integration and optimization of solar, energy storage and back-up solutions for residential applications. Historically, however, our products and solutions have been primarily sold into commercial and governmental markets. We have limited experience pursuing the residential markets, and there are unique challenges associated with sales to homeowners and others in the residential market. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in growing profitably (or at all) sales of our residential market focused products and solutions or otherwise achieving success in our efforts in this regard. Further, the success of these efforts will depend on part on expansion of homeowner use of solar energy. To date, solar energy has only achieved limited market acceptance (particularly in regions outside of Southern California, in which regions we intend to expand our services and capabilities), and its continued market acceptance and growth may depend on continued support in the form of performance-based incentives, rebates, tax credits and other incentives from federal, state, local and foreign governments. Additionally, there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully develop our planned proprietary platform to enable integration and optimization of solar, energy storage and back-up generators for residential applications.\nOur solar energy business is concentrated in Southern California, putting us at risk of region-specific disruptions.\nOur solar energy customer base is currently concentrated in Southern California, and we expect many of our future solar energy installations to be in California, which could further concentrate our solar energy customer base and operational infrastructure. Accordingly, our business and results of operations are particularly susceptible to adverse economic, regulatory, political, weather and other conditions in California, including the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and any legislative changes related to grid operations.\nIf we are the subject of future product defect or liability suits, or our products are subject to a recall, our business and our reputation could be adversely affected.\nIn the course of our planned operations, we may become subject to legal actions based on a claim that our energy products are defective in workmanship or have caused personal or other injuries. We may also be subject to lawsuits and other claims in the future if our products malfunction, including, for example, if any of our solar service offerings (such as our racking systems, photovoltaic modules, batteries, inverters, or other products) causes injuries. Because solar energy systems and many of our other current and anticipated products are electricity-producing devices, it is possible that customers or their property could be injured or damaged by our products, whether due to product malfunctions, defects, improper installation or other causes. Further, since our products are used in systems that are made up of components sourced from third party manufacturers, we may be subject to product liability claims even if our products do not malfunction. Additionally, any of our products could be subject to recalls due to product malfunctions or defects.\nThe successful assertion of product liability claims against us could result in potentially significant monetary damages that could require us to make significant payments, as well as subject us to adverse publicity, damage our reputation and competitive position and adversely affect sales of our systems and other products. We rely on third-party manufacturing warranties, warranties provided by our manufacturing partners and our general liability insurance to cover product liability claims and have not obtained separate product liability insurance. Such warranties and insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all potential claims. Moreover, even if such warranties and insurance coverage are sufficient, any successful claim could significantly harm our business, reputation, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, product liability claims, injuries, defects or other problems experienced by other companies in the industries in which we operate could lead to unfavorable market conditions for the industry as a whole, and may have an adverse effect on our ability to attract customers and thereby have an adverse effect our growth and financial performance.\nWe rely heavily on our management team, whose continued service and performance is critical to our future success. Any failure by management to properly manage growth, including hiring and retaining competent and skilled management and other personnel, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nWe currently have four executive officers\u2009-\u2009our Chief Executive Officer and President, Zachary Bradford, our Chief Financial Officer, Lori Love, our Chief Revenue Officer, Amer Tadayon, and S. Matthew Schulz, our Executive Chairman\u2009-\u2009who are responsible for our management functions and are responsible for strategic development, financing and other critical functions. Some of the members of our management team and our board of directors may not have prior experience in the energy or cryptocurrency mining industries. This lack of experience may impair our management teams\u2019 and directors\u2019 ability to evaluate and make well-informed decisions involving our current operations and any future projects we may undertake in the industries in which we operate. Such impairment and lack of experience could adversely affect our business, financial condition and future operations.\nOur future success depends significantly on the continued service and performance of our existing management team. The departure, death, disability or other extended loss of services of any member of our management team, particularly with little or no notice, could cause delays on projects, frustrate our growth prospects and could have an adverse impact on our client and industry relationships, our project exploration and development programs, other aspects of our business and our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and prospects.\nOur success, growth prospects, and ability to capitalize on market opportunities also depend to a significant extent on our ability to identify, hire, motivate and retain qualified managerial personnel, including additional senior members of management. Our growth may be constrained by resource limitations as competitors and customers compete for increasingly scarce human capital resources. The demand for trained software engineers, electrical engineers, professionals familiar with cryptocurrency mining and other skilled workers is currently high. Our competitors may be able to offer a work environment with higher compensation or more opportunities than we can. Any new personnel we hire may not be or become as productive as we expect, as we may face challenges in adequately or appropriately integrating them into our workforce and culture. If we are unable to attract and retain a sufficient number of skilled personnel, our ability to successfully implement our business plan, grow our company and maintain or expand our product offerings may be adversely affected, and the costs of doing so may increase, which may adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur expansion could also place significant demands on our management, operations, systems, accounting, internal controls and financial resources. If we experience difficulties in any of these areas, we may not be able to expand our business successfully or effectively manage our growth. Any failure by management to manage growth and to respond to changes in our business could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have engaged in, and in the future may engage in, strategic acquisitions and other arrangements that could disrupt our business, cause dilution to our stockholders, reduce our financial resources and harm our operating results.\nWe have previously engaged in strategic transactions, including acquisitions of companies, product lines, technologies and personnel, such as our recent acquisitions of ATL in December 2020 and Solar Watt in February 2021, and, as part of our growth strategy, in the future, we may seek additional opportunities to expand our product offerings or the markets we serve by pursuing strategic transactions. Our ability to grow through future acquisitions will depend on the availability of, and our ability to identify, suitable acquisition and investment opportunities at an acceptable cost, our ability to compete effectively to attract those opportunities and the availability of financing to complete acquisitions. Future acquisitions may require us to issue common stock that would dilute our current stockholders\u2019 percentage ownership, assume or otherwise be subject to liabilities of an acquired company, record goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets that will be subject to impairment testing on a regular basis and potential periodic impairment charges,\nincur amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets, incur large acquisition and integration costs, immediate write-offs, and restructuring and other related expenses, and become subject to litigation. The benefits of an acquisition may also take considerable time to develop, and we cannot be certain that any particular acquisition will produce the intended benefits in a timely manner or to the extent anticipated or at all. We may experience difficulties integrating the operations, technologies, products, and personnel of an acquired company or be subjected to liability for the target\u2019s pre-acquisition activities or operations as a successor in interest. Such integration may divert management\u2019s attention from normal daily operations of our business. Future acquisitions may also expose us to potential risks, including risks associated with entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience (such as our acquisition of our ATL subsidiary, in light of its cryptocurrency mining operations), especially when competitors in such markets have stronger market positions, the possibility of insufficient revenues to offset the expenses we incur in connection with an acquisition and potential loss of, or harm to, our relationships with employees, customers, consumers and suppliers as a result of integration of new businesses.\nOur energy business is substantially dependent on utility rate structures and government incentive programs that encourage the use of alternative energy sources. The reduction or elimination of government subsidies and economic incentives for energy-related technologies would harm our business.\nWe believe that near-term growth of energy-related technologies, including power conversion and solar energy technology, relies partly on the availability and size of government and economic incentives and grants (including, but not limited to, the U.S. Investment Tax Credit and various state and local incentive programs). These incentive programs could be challenged by utility companies, or for other reasons found to be unconstitutional, or could be reduced or discontinued for other reasons, all of which are outside of our control. The reduction, elimination, or expiration of government subsidies and economic incentives could harm our business.\nA combination of utility rate structures and government subsidies that encourage the use of alternative energy sources is a primary driver of demand for our energy products. For example, public utilities are often allowed to collect demand charges on commercial and industrial customers in addition to traditional usage charges. In addition, the federal government and many states encourage the use of alternative energy sources through a combination of direct subsidies and tariff incentives such as net metering for users that use alternative energy sources such as solar power. California also encourages alternative energy technology through its Self-Generation Incentive Program, or SGIP, which offers rebates for businesses and consumers who adopt certain new technologies. Other states have similar incentives and mandates which encourage the adoption of alternative energy sources. Notwithstanding the adoption of other incentive programs, we expect that California will be the most significant market for the sale of our energy products in the near term. Should California or another state in which we derive a substantial portion of our product revenues in the future change its utility rate structure or eliminate or significantly reduce its incentive programs, demand for our products could be substantially affected, which would adversely affect our business prospects, financial condition and operating results.\nIn the future, we may require additional financing to sustain and expand our operations, and we may not be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms, or at all, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and prospects.\nOur ability to operate profitably and to grow our business is dependent upon, among other things, generating sufficient revenue from our operations and, when and if needed, obtaining financing. If we are unable to generate sufficient revenues to operate and/or expand our business, we will be required to raise additional capital to fund operating deficits (if applicable) and growth of our business, pursue our business plans and to finance our operating activities, including through equity or debt financings, which may not be available to us on favorable terms, or at all.\nTo the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, stockholder ownership interest in the Company may be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect rights as a stockholder. Debt and equity financings, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as redeeming our shares of common stock, making investments, incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends.\nWe maintain our cash at financial institutions, which at times, exceed federally insured limits.\nThe majority of our cash is held in accounts at U.S. banking institutions that we believe are of high quality. Cash held in non-interest-bearing and interest-bearing operating accounts may exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance limits. If such banking institutions were to fail, we could lose all or a portion of those amounts held in excess of such insurance limitations.\nIf we fail to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the market may have reduced confidence in our\nreported financial information.\nWe must continue to document, test, monitor and enhance our internal control over financial reporting in order to satisfy the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. We will continue to perform the documentation and evaluations needed to comply with Section 404. If during this process our management identifies one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we will be unable to assert that our internal controls are effective, which may cause market participants to have reduced confidence in our reported financial condition.\nRisks Related to Our Cryptocurrency Mining Operations\nThrough our acquisition of ATL in December 2020, we expanded our business to include bitcoin mining, and we are actively trying to grow our bitcoin mining infrastructure, equipment and capacity. Bitcoin mining is a significant portion of our business and revenues and is expected to continue to be the source of a majority of our revenues in the future. Our bitcoin mining activities, both now and in the future, may subject us to inherent risks, including the risks described below and elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nIf regulatory changes or interpretations of our activities require our registration as a money services business (an \u201cMSB\u201d) under the regulations promulgated by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (\u201cFinCEN\u201d) under the authority of the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act (the \u201cBSA\u201d), or otherwise under state laws, we may incur significant compliance costs, which could be substantial or cost-prohibitive. If we become subject to these regulations, our costs in complying with them may have a material adverse effect on our business and the results of our operations.\nTo the extent our bitcoin mining activities cause us to be deemed an MSB under the regulations promulgated by FinCEN under the authority of the BSA, we may be required to comply with FinCEN regulations, including those that would mandate us to implement anti-money laundering programs, make certain reports to FinCEN and maintain certain records.\nTo the extent that our cryptocurrency activities cause us to be deemed a \u201cmoney transmitter\u201d (an \u201cMT\u201d) or be given an equivalent designation, under state law in any state in which we operate, we may be required to seek a license or otherwise register with a state regulator and comply with state regulations that may include the implementation of anti-money laundering programs, maintenance of certain records and other operational requirements. Currently, the New York State Department of Financial Services maintains a comprehensive \u201cBitLicense\u201d framework for businesses that conduct \u201cvirtual currency business activity.\u201d In July 2020, Louisiana enacted the Virtual Currency Businesses Act, becoming the second state after New York to enact a stand-alone virtual currency law. We will continue to monitor for developments in state-level legislation, guidance or regulations applicable to us.\nSuch additional federal or state regulatory obligations in the United States or obligations that could arise under the regulatory frameworks of other countries may cause us to incur significant expenses, possibly affecting its business and financial condition in a material and adverse manner. Furthermore, we and our service providers may not be capable of complying with certain federal or state regulatory obligations applicable to MSBs and MTs or similar obligations in other countries. If we are deemed to be subject to such additional regulatory and registration or licensing requirements, we may be required to substantially alter our bitcoin mining activities and possibly cease engaging in such activities. Any such action may adversely affect our business operations and financial condition and an investment in our company.\nCurrent regulation regarding the exchange of bitcoins under the CEA by the CFTC is unclear; to the extent we become subject to regulation by the CFTC in connection with our exchange of bitcoin, we may incur additional compliance costs, which may be significant.\nThe Commodity Exchange Act, as amended (the \u201cCEA\u201d), does not currently impose any direct obligations on us related to the mining or exchange of bitcoins. Generally, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (\u201cCFTC\u201d), the federal agency that administers the CEA, regards bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as commodities. This position has been supported by decisions of federal courts.\nHowever, the CEA imposes requirements relative to certain transactions involving bitcoin and other digital assets that constitute a contract of sale of a commodity for future delivery (or an option on such a contract), a swap, or a transaction involving margin, financing or leverage that does not result in actual delivery of the commodity within 28 days to persons not defined as \u201celigible contract participants\u201d or \u201celigible commercial entities\u201d under the CEA (e.g., retail persons). Changes in the CEA or the regulations promulgated by the CFTC thereunder, as well as interpretations thereof and official promulgations by the CFTC, may impact the classification of bitcoins and, therefore, may subject them to additional regulatory oversight by the agency. Although to date the CFTC has not enacted regulations governing non-derivative or non-financed, margined or leveraged transactions in bitcoin, it has authority to commence enforcement actions against persons who violate certain prohibitions under the CEA related to transactions in any contract of sale of any commodity, including bitcoin, in interstate commerce (e.g., manipulation and engaging in certain deceptive practices).\nWe cannot be certain as to how future regulatory developments will impact the treatment of bitcoins under the law. Any requirements imposed by the CFTC related to our mining activities or our transactions in bitcoin could cause us to incur additional extraordinary, non-recurring expenses, thereby materially and adversely impacting an investment in the Company. In addition, changes in the classification of bitcoins could subject us, as a result of our bitcoin mining operations, to additional regulatory oversight by the agency. Although to date the CFTC has not enacted regulations governing non-derivative or non-financed, margined or leveraged transactions in bitcoin, it has authority to commence enforcement actions against persons who violate certain prohibitions under the CEA related to transactions in any contract of sale of any commodity, including bitcoin, in interstate commerce (e.g., manipulation and engaging in certain deceptive practices).\nMoreover, if our mining activities or transactions in bitcoin were deemed by the CFTC to constitute a collective investment in derivatives for our shareholders, we may be required to register as a commodity pool operator with the CFTC through the National Futures Association. Such additional registrations may result in extraordinary, non-recurring expenses, thereby materially and adversely impacting an investment in the Company. If we determine not to comply with such additional regulatory and registration requirements, we may seek to cease certain of our operations. Any such action may adversely affect an investment in the Company.\nWhile no provision of the CEA, or CFTC rules, orders or rulings (except as noted herein) appears to be currently applicable to our business, this is subject to change.\nIf the SEC or another regulatory body considers bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency that we may mine in the future to be a security under U.S. securities laws, we may be required to comply with significant SEC registration and/or other requirements.\nIn general, novel or unique assets such as bitcoin and other digital assets may be classified as securities if they meet the definition of investment contracts under U.S. law. In recent years, the offer and sale of digital assets other than bitcoin, most notably Kik Interactive Inc.\u2019s Kin tokens and Telegram Group Inc.\u2019s TON tokens, have been deemed to be investment contracts by the SEC. While we believe that bitcoin is unlikely to be considered an investment contract, and thus a security under the investment contract definition, we cannot provide any assurances that digital assets that we mine or otherwise acquire or hold for our own account, including bitcoin, will never be classified as securities under U.S. law.\nTo the extent that any digital asset we have already mined or will mine is deemed a security, we may be obligated to comply with registration and/or other requirements by the SEC. This would cause us to incur significant, non-recurring expenses, thereby materially and adversely impacting an investment in the Company.\nIf regulations or interpretations change and regulation of bitcoin under the U.S. securities laws or otherwise is promulgated, we may be classified as an investment company.\nCurrent and future legislation and the SEC\u2019s rulemaking and other regulatory developments, including interpretations released by a regulatory authority, may impact the manner in which bitcoin is treated for classification and clearing purposes. The SEC\u2019s July 25, 2017 Report expressed its view that digital assets may be securities depending on the facts and circumstances. As of the date of this Annual Report, we are not aware of any rules that have been proposed to regulate bitcoin as a security, and SEC staff have publicly suggested that bitcoin is not a security for purposes of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the \u201c1940 Act\u201d), because current purchasers of bitcoin are not relying on the essential managerial and entrepreneurial efforts of others to produce a profit. We cannot be certain, however, as to how future regulatory developments will impact the treatment of bitcoin under the law.\nFor example, in the event that the bitcoin (or, in the future, any digital assets) held by us, whether as a result of our cryptocurrency mining business or otherwise (including by acquisition), are determined to constitute securities under the U.S. securities laws and such assets exceed 40% of our total assets, exclusive of cash, we would inadvertently become an investment company under the 1940 Act. Classification as an investment company under the 1940 Act requires registration with the SEC. If an investment company fails to register, it would have to stop doing almost all business, and its contracts would become voidable. Registration is time-consuming and restrictive and may require a restructuring of our operations, and we would be very constrained in the kind of business we could engage in as a registered investment company. Further, we would become subject to substantial regulation concerning management, operations, transactions with affiliated persons and portfolio composition, and would need to file reports under the 1940 Act. The cost of compliance with the 1940 Act and any other regulations applicable to our crypto mining business would result in our incurring substantial additional expenses, and the failure to properly register with the SEC or otherwise if required would have a materially adverse impact to conduct our operations.\nIt may be illegal now, or in the future, to mine, acquire, own, hold, sell or use bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies, participate in blockchains or utilize similar cryptocurrency assets in one or more countries, the ruling of which could adversely affect us.\nAlthough currently cryptocurrencies generally are not regulated or are lightly regulated in most countries, several countries, such as China, India and Russia, may continue taking regulatory actions in the future that could severely restrict the right to mine, acquire, own, hold, sell or use these cryptocurrency assets or to exchange for local currency. For example, in China and Russia (India is currently proposing new legislation), it is illegal to accept payment in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies for consumer transactions and banking institutions are barred from accepting deposits of cryptocurrencies. In addition, in March 2021, the governmental authorities for the Chinese province of Inner Mongolia banned bitcoin mining in the province due to the industry\u2019s intense electrical power demands and its negative environmental impacts. If other countries, including the U.S., implement similar restrictions, such restrictions may adversely affect us. Such circumstances could have a material adverse effect on us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations and potentially the value of any bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies we mine or otherwise acquire or hold for our own account, and thus harm investors.\nThere are several new and existing competitors in our industry that are purchasing mining equipment at scale, which may cause delays or difficulty in us obtaining new miners.\nMany of the competitors in our industry have also been purchasing mining equipment at scale, which has caused a world-wide shortage of mining equipment and extended the corresponding delivery schedules for new miner purchases. There are no assurances that Bitmain, or any other manufacturers, will be able to keep pace with the surge in demand for mining equipment. It is uncertain how manufacturers will respond to this increased global demand and whether they can deliver on the schedules promised to all of their customers. In the event Bitmain or other manufacturers, are not able to keep pace with demand, we may not be able to purchase additional miners in sufficient quantities, on the delivery schedules that meet our business needs, or at favorable prices.\nThe impact of geopolitical and economic events on the demand for bitcoin is uncertain.\nGeopolitical crises may trigger large-scale purchases of bitcoin, which could rapidly increase their prices. This may, however, also increase the likelihood of a subsequent price swing in the opposite direction as crisis-driven purchasing behavior dissipates, ultimately decreasing the value of bitcoins or any other digital asset in our possession. Such risks are similar to the risks of purchasing commodities in generally uncertain times, such as the risk of purchasing, holding or selling gold.\nAlternatively, global crises and economic downturns may discourage investment in bitcoin and digital assets in general as investors shift their investments towards less volatile asset classes. Such events could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations and potentially the value of bitcoin we mine or otherwise acquire or hold for our own account.\nThe value of bitcoin may be subject to pricing risk and has historically been subject to wide swings. Because we do not currently hedge our investment in bitcoin and do not intend to for the foreseeable future, we may be directly exposed to bitcoin\u2019s price volatility and surrounding risks.\nWhile bitcoin prices are determined primarily using data from various exchanges, over-the-counter markets and derivative platforms, they have historically been volatile and are impacted by a variety of factors. Such factors include, but are not limited to, the worldwide growth in the adoption and use of bitcoins, the maintenance and development of the software protocol of the bitcoin network, changes in consumer demographics and public tastes, fraudulent or illegitimate actors, real or perceived scarcity, and political, economic, regulatory or other conditions. Furthermore, pricing may be the result of, and may continue to result in, speculation regarding future appreciation in the value of bitcoin, or our share price, making prices more volatile or creating \u201cbubble\u201d type risks.\nCurrently, we do not use a formula or specific methodology to determine whether or when we will sell bitcoin that we hold, or the number of bitcoins we will sell. Rather, decisions to hold or sell bitcoins are currently determined by analyzing forecasts and monitoring the market in real time. Such decisions, however well-informed, may result in untimely sales and even losses, adversely affecting an investment in us. At this time, we do not anticipate engaging in any hedging activities related to our holding of bitcoin; this could expose us to substantial decreases in the price of bitcoin.\nThe development and acceptance of competing blockchain platforms or technologies may cause consumers to use alternative distributed ledgers or other alternatives.\nThe development and acceptance of competing blockchain platforms or technologies may cause consumers to abandon bitcoin. As we exclusively mine, and expect to exclusively mine bitcoin, we could face difficulty adapting to emergent digital ledgers, blockchains, or alternatives thereto. This could prevent us from realizing the anticipated profits from our investments. Such circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations and potentially the value of any bitcoin we mine or otherwise acquire or hold for our own account and harm investors.\nBitcoin faces significant challenges with scaling which, if not overcome, may lead to high fees or slow transaction settlement times.\nBitcoin is presently limited with respect to how many transactions can occur per second. Developers and contributors in the bitcoin ecosystem debate potential solutions to increasing the average number of transactions per second that networks can handle. Some have implemented mechanisms or are researching ways to increase scale, such as increasing the allowable sizes of blocks, and therefore the number of transactions per block, which would increase the number of transactions that could occur per second. However, it is uncertain how long those mechanisms being explored to increase the scale of settlement of bitcoin transactions will take to become effective, if at all. Any failure to improve bitcoin settlement times could materially affect the price of bitcoin and, as a result, adversely affect an investment in us.\nBitcoin is subject to halving; the reward for successfully solving a block will halve several times in the future and its value may not adjust to compensate us for the reduction in the rewards we receive from our mining efforts.\nHalving is a process designed to control the overall supply and reduce the risk of inflation in cryptocurrencies using a Proof-of-Work consensus algorithm. In an event referred to as bitcoin \u201chalving,\u201d the bitcoin reward for mining any block is cut in half. For example, the mining reward for bitcoin declined from 12.5 to 6.25 bitcoin on May 11, 2020. This process is scheduled to occur once every 210,000 blocks, or roughly four years, until the total amount of bitcoin rewards issued reaches 21 million, which is expected to occur around 2140. Once 21 million bitcoin are generated, the network will stop producing more. Currently, there are more than 18 million bitcoin in circulation. While bitcoin prices have had a history of price fluctuations around halving events, there is no guarantee that the price change will be favorable or would compensate for the reduction in mining reward. If a corresponding and proportionate increase in the price of bitcoin does not follow these anticipated halving events, the revenue from our mining operations would decrease, and we may not have an adequate incentive to continue mining and may cease mining operations altogether, which may adversely affect an investment in us.\nFurthermore, such reductions in bitcoin rewards for uncovering blocks may result in a reduction in the aggregate hash rate of the bitcoin network as the incentive for miners decreases. Miners ceasing operations would reduce the collective processing power on the network, which would adversely affect the confirmation process for transactions and make the bitcoin network more vulnerable to malicious actors or botnets obtaining control in excess of 50 % of the processing power active on the blockchain. Such events may adversely affect our activities and an investment in us.\nIf a malicious actor or botnet obtains control of more than 50% of the processing power on the bitcoin network, such actor or botnet could manipulate the network to adversely affect us, which would adversely affect an investment in us.\nIf a malicious actor or botnet, a collection of computers controlled by networked software coordinating the actions of the computers, obtains over 50% of the processing power dedicated to mining bitcoin, such actor may be able to construct fraudulent blocks or prevent certain transactions from completing in a timely manner, or at all. The malicious actor or botnet could control, exclude or modify the order of transactions, though it could not generate new units or transactions using such control. The malicious actor could also \u201cdouble-spend,\u201d or spend the same bitcoin in more than one transaction, or it could prevent transactions from being validated. In certain instances, reversing any fraudulent or malicious changes made to the bitcoin blockchain may not be possible.\nAlthough there are no known reports of malicious activity or control of blockchains achieved through controlling over 50% of the processing power on the bitcoin network, it is believed that certain mining pools may have exceeded, and could exceed, the 50% threshold on the bitcoin network. This possibility creates a greater risk that a single mining pool could exert authority over the validation of bitcoin transactions. To the extent that the bitcoin ecosystem, and the administrators of mining pools, do not have adequate controls and responses in place, the risk of a malicious actor obtaining control of the processing power may increase. If such an event were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations and potentially the value of any bitcoin we mine or otherwise acquire or hold for our own account and harm investors.\nOur reliance on a third-party mining pool service provider for our mining revenue payouts may adversely affect an investment in us.\nWe currently rely on Foundry Digital and Antpool (\u201cpools\u201d or \u201cCryptocurrency Customers\u201d), open access mining pools that support cryptocurrencies including bitcoin, to receive our mining rewards and fees from the network. Our pools have the sole discretion to modify the terms of our agreement at any time, and, therefore, our future rights and relationship with our pools may change. In general, mining pools allow miners to combine their computing and processing power, increasing their chances of solving a block and getting paid by the bitcoin network. The rewards, distributed proportionally to our contribution to the pool\u2019s overall mining power, are distributed by the pool operator. Should our pools\u2019 operator systems suffer downtime due to a cyber-attack, software malfunction or other similar issues, it will negatively impact our ability to mine and receive revenue. Furthermore, while we receive daily reports from our pools detailing the total processing power provided to the pools and the proportion of that total processing power, we provided to determine the distribution of\nrewards to us, we are dependent on the accuracy of our pool\u2019s record keeping. Therefore, we have little means of recourse against our pools\u2019 operators if we determine the proportion of the reward paid out to us by the mining pool operator is incorrect, other than leaving the pools. If we are unable to consistently obtain accurate proportionate rewards from our pools, we may experience reduced rewards for our efforts, which would have an adverse effect on our business and operations.\nBitcoins and other digital assets we mine or hold for our own account may be subject to loss, theft or restriction on access.\nThere is a risk that some or all of our bitcoins could be lost or stolen. Bitcoins are stored in and accessed by cryptocurrency sites commonly referred to as \u201cwallets.\u201d A hot wallet refers to any cryptocurrency wallet that is connected to the Internet. Generally, hot wallets are easier to set up and access than wallets in cold storage, but they are also more susceptible to hackers and other technical vulnerabilities. Cold storage refers to any cryptocurrency wallet that is not connected to the Internet. Cold storage is generally more secure than hot storage, but is not ideal for quick or regular transactions. When we keep our bitcoin in cold storage, we may experience lag time in our ability to respond to market fluctuations in the price of our cryptocurrency assets.\nWe currently mine bitcoin by contributing to and benefiting from our pools\u2019 processing power. Our share of bitcoins mined from our pools are initially received by us in wallets we control, which are maintained by Coinbase Inc., a U.S. based digital assets exchange. We maintain the majority of our bitcoin in cold storage with a minority allocation kept in hot wallets for working capital purposes. Bitcoins we mine or hold for our own account may be subject to loss, theft or restriction on access. Hackers or malicious actors may launch attacks to steal, compromise or secure bitcoins, such as by attacking the bitcoin network source code, exchange miners, third-party platforms (including Coinbase), cold and hot storage locations or software, or by other means. We may be in control and possession of substantial holdings of bitcoin, and as we increase in size, we may become a more appealing target of hackers, malware, cyber-attacks or other security threats. Any of these events may adversely affect our operations and, consequently, our investments and profitability.\nThe loss or destruction of private keys required to access our bitcoins may be irreversible. Our loss of access to our private keys or our experience of a data loss relating to our bitcoins could adversely affect an investment in us.\nBitcoins may only be controlled by the possessor of both the unique public and private keys relating to the local or online digital wallet in which they are held. We publish the public key relating to digital wallets in use when we verify the receipt or transfers of bitcoins to and from our wallets and disseminate such information into the network on an anonymous basis, but we safeguard the private keys relating to such digital wallets. Digital asset exchanges, such as Coinbase, where we hold our bitcoin, engage in similar practices. To the extent such private keys are lost, destroyed or otherwise compromised, we will be unable to access our bitcoins and such private keys may not be capable of being restored by any network. Any loss of private keys relating to digital wallets used to store our bitcoins whether by us or digital asset exchanges where we hold our bitcoin, could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations and potentially the value of any bitcoin we mine or otherwise acquire or hold for our own account.\nIncorrect or fraudulent bitcoin transactions may be irreversible.\nBitcoin transactions are irreversible and stolen or incorrectly transferred bitcoins may thus be irretrievable. While we exchange our bitcoins directly for U.S. dollars on Coinbase and do not presently use, or expect to use, our bitcoins for any other transactions, any incorrectly executed or fraudulent cryptocurrency transactions may still adversely affect our investments and assets.\nForks in the bitcoin network may occur in the future, which may affect the value of bitcoins held by us.\nA small group of contributors can propose refinements or improvements to the bitcoin network\u2019s source code that alter the protocols and software that govern the bitcoin network and the properties of bitcoin, including the irreversibility of transactions and limitations on the mining of new bitcoin. This is known as a \u201cfork.\u201d In the event a developer or group of developers proposes modifications to the bitcoin network that are not accepted by a majority of miners and users, but that is nonetheless accepted by a substantial plurality of miners and users, two or more competing and incompatible blockchain implementations could result. This is known as a \u201chard fork.\u201d\nThe value of bitcoin after the creation of a fork is subject to many factors, including, but not limited to, the value of the fork product, market reaction to the creation of the fork product, and the occurrence of forks in the future. As such, existing forks, such as Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Gold, and future forks may have a negative effect on bitcoin\u2019s value and may adversely affect an investment in us.\nThe open-source structure of the bitcoin network protocol means that the contributors to the protocol are generally not directly compensated for their contributions in maintaining and developing the protocol. A failure to properly monitor and upgrade the protocol could damage the bitcoin network and an investment in us.\nAs an open-source project, bitcoin does not generate revenues for its contributors, and contributors are generally not compensated for maintaining and updating the bitcoin network protocol. The lack of guaranteed financial incentives for contributors to maintain or develop the bitcoin network and the lack of guaranteed resources to adequately address emerging issues with the bitcoin network may reduce incentives to address the issues adequately or in a timely manner. To the extent that contributors may fail to adequately update and maintain the bitcoin network protocol, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, or operations and potentially the value of any bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies we mine or otherwise acquire or hold for our own account.\nBanks and financial institutions may not provide banking services, or may cut off services, to businesses that engage in cryptocurrency-related activities.\nA number of companies that engage in bitcoin and/or other cryptocurrency-related activities have been unable to find banks or financial institutions that are willing to provide them with bank accounts and other services. Similarly, a number of companies and individuals or businesses associated with cryptocurrencies may have had and may continue to have their existing bank accounts closed or services discontinued with financial institutions. To the extent that such events may happen to us, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations and potentially the value of any bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies we mine or otherwise acquire or hold for our own account.\nOur interactions with the bitcoin network may expose us to SDN or blocked persons or cause us to violate provisions of law that did not contemplate distributed ledger technology.\nThe Office of Financial Assets Control (\u201cOFAC\u201d) of the US Department of Treasury requires us to comply with its sanction program and not conduct business with persons named on its specially designated nationals (\u201cSDN\u201d) list. However, because of the pseudonymous nature of blockchain transactions, we may inadvertently and without our knowledge engage in transactions with persons named on OFAC\u2019s SDN list. We also may not be adequately capable of determining the ultimate identity of the persons with whom we transact.\nThe digital asset exchanges on which cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin, trade are relatively new and largely unregulated, and thus may be exposed to fraud and failure. Such failures may result in a reduction in the price of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies and can adversely affect an investment in us.\nDigital asset exchanges on which cryptocurrencies trade are relatively new and, in most cases, largely unregulated. Many digital exchanges do not provide the public with significant information regarding their ownership structure, management teams, corporate practices or regulatory compliance. As a result, the marketplace may lose confidence in, or may experience problems relating to, cryptocurrency exchanges, including prominent exchanges handling a significant portion of the volume of digital asset trading.\nA lack of stability in the digital asset exchange market and the closure or temporary shutdown of digital asset exchanges due to fraud, business failure, hackers or malware, or government-mandated regulation may reduce confidence in digital asset networks and result in greater volatility in cryptocurrency values. These potential consequences of a digital asset exchange\u2019s failure could adversely affect an investment in us.\nWe may not have adequate sources of recovery if our digital assets are lost, stolen or destroyed.\nWe rely on Coinbase to facilitate the custody of our bitcoins. If our bitcoins are lost, stolen or destroyed under circumstances rendering a party, including Coinbase, liable to us, the responsible party may not have the financial resources sufficient to satisfy our claim. For example, as to a particular event of loss, the only source of recovery for us might be limited, to the extent identifiable, to other responsible third parties (e.g., a thief or terrorist), any of which may not have the financial resources (including liability insurance coverage) to satisfy a valid claim of ours.\nBitcoins held by us are not subject to FDIC or SIPC protections.\nWe do not hold our bitcoins with a banking institution or a member of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (\u201cFDIC\u201d) or the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (\u201cSIPC\u201d), and, therefore, our bitcoins are not subject to the protections enjoyed by depositors with FDIC or SIPC member institutions. As a result, we may suffer a loss with respect to our bitcoins that is not covered by insurance, and we may not be able to recover any of our carried value in these bitcoins if they are lost or stolen or suffer significant and sustained reduction in conversion spot price. If we are not otherwise able to recover damages from a malicious actor in connection with these losses, our business and results of operations may suffer, which may have a material negative impact on our stock price.\nThe limited rights of legal recourse available to us expose us and our investors to the risk of loss of our bitcoins for which no person is liable.\nAt this time, there is no specifically enumerated U.S. or foreign governmental, regulatory, investigative or prosecutorial authority or mechanism through which to bring an action or complaint regarding missing or stolen cryptocurrency. To the extent that we are unable to recover our losses from such action, error or theft, such events could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations of and potentially the value of any bitcoin we mine or otherwise acquire or hold for our own account.\nThe sale of our bitcoins to pay for expenses at a time of low bitcoin prices could adversely affect an investment in us.\nWe may sell our bitcoins to pay for expenses on an as-needed basis, irrespective of then-current prices. Consequently, we may sell our bitcoins at a time when bitcoin prices are low, which could adversely affect an investment in us. At this time, we do not mitigate against the potential for decreasing price by engaging in hedging activities related to our bitcoin holdings. See the above risk factor entitled, \u201cThe value of bitcoin may be subject to pricing risk and has historically been subject to wide swings. Because we do not currently hedge our investment in bitcoin and do not intend to for the foreseeable future, we may be directly exposed to bitcoin\u2019s price volatility and surrounding risks\u201d.\nDemand for bitcoin is driven, in part, by its status as a prominent and secure cryptocurrency. It is possible that a cryptocurrency other than bitcoin could have features that make it more desirable to a material portion of the digital asset user base, resulting in a reduction in demand for bitcoins.\nBitcoin holds a \u201cfirst-to-market\u201d advantage over other cryptocurrencies. This first-to-market advantage is driven in large part by having the largest user base and, more importantly, the largest combined mining power in use. Nonetheless, another form of cryptocurrency could become materially popular due to either a perceived or exposed shortcoming of the bitcoin network or a perceived advantage of another form of digital currency. If another form of digital currency obtains significant market share, this could reduce the interest in, and value of, bitcoin and the profitability of our bitcoin operations.\nOur mining costs may be in excess of our mining revenues, which could seriously harm our business and adversely impact an investment in us.\nMining operations are costly and our expenses may increase in the future. Increases in mining expenses may not be offset by corresponding increases in revenue. Our expenses may become greater than we anticipate, and our investments to make our business more cost-efficient may not succeed. Increases in our costs without corresponding increases in our revenue would adversely affect our profitability and could seriously harm our business and an investment in us.\nThe properties included in our mining operation may experience damages, including damages that are not covered by insurance.\nOur current mining locations and any future sites we establish will be subject to a variety of risks relating to physical condition and operation, including but not limited to:\n\u00b7 construction or repair defects or other structural or building damage; any noncompliance with or liabilities under applicable environmental, health or safety regulations or requirements or building permit requirements;\n\u00b7 any damage resulting from natural disasters, such as hurricanes, earthquakes, fires, floods and windstorms; and\n\u00b7 claims by employees and others for injuries sustained at our properties.\nAlthough our mining sites are equipped with standard security measures normally associated with a traditional data center, our mining sites could still be rendered inoperable, temporarily or permanently, as a result of a fire or other natural disaster or by a terrorist or other events outside of our control. The measures we take to prevent and insure against these risks may not be sufficient or effective.\nWe are subject to risks associated with our need for significant electrical power.\nThe operation of a bitcoin mining facility can require massive amounts of electrical power. Any mining site we currently operate or establish in the future can only be successful if we can continue to obtain sufficient electrical power for that site on a cost-effective basis. To the extent that we establish multiple sites, there may be significant competition for suitable locations, and government regulators may potentially restrict the ability of electricity suppliers to provide electricity to mining operations in times of electricity shortage or may otherwise potentially restrict or prohibit the provision or electricity to mining operations.\nAdditionally, our facilities could be adversely affected by a power outage. Although we maintain limited backup power at certain sites, it would not be feasible to run miners on back-up power generators in the event of a government restriction on electricity or a power outage. To the extent we are unable to receive adequate power supply and are forced to reduce or cease our operations due to the availability or cost of electrical power, our business would be adversely affected.\nOur operations and profitability may be adversely affected by competition from other methods of investing in cryptocurrencies.\nWe compete with other users and/or companies that are mining cryptocurrencies and other potential financial vehicles, including securities backed by or linked to cryptocurrencies. Market and financial conditions, and other conditions beyond our control, may make it more attractive to invest in other financial vehicles, or to invest in cryptocurrencies directly, which could limit the market for our shares and reduce their liquidity. The emergence of other financial vehicles and exchange-traded funds have increased scrutiny on cryptocurrencies, and such scrutiny could be applicable to us and impact our ability to successfully establish or maintain a public market for our securities. Such circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations and potentially the value of any bitcoin we mine or otherwise acquire or hold for our own account, and harm investors.\nTo the extent that the profit margins of bitcoin mining operations are not high, operators of bitcoin mining operations are more likely to immediately sell bitcoin rewards earned by mining in the market, thereby constraining the growth of the price of bitcoin.\nBitcoin mining operations have evolved from individual users mining with computer processors, graphics processing units and first-generation ASIC servers. Currently, new processing power is predominantly added by incorporated and unincorporated professionalized mining operations. Professionalized mining operations may use proprietary hardware or sophisticated ASIC machines acquired from ASIC manufacturers. They require the investment of significant capital for the acquisition of this specialized hardware, the leasing of operating space (often in data centers or warehousing facilities), incurring of electricity costs and the employment of technicians to operate the mining farms. As a result, professionalized mining operations are of a greater scale than those prior and have more defined and regular expenses and liabilities. These regular expenses and liabilities require professionalized mining operations to maintain profit margins on the sale of bitcoin. To the extent the price of bitcoin declines and such profit margin decreases, professionalized miners will be pressured to immediately sell bitcoin earned from mining operations, whereas it is believed that smaller, individual operations in past years were more likely to hold newly mined bitcoin for lengthier periods. The immediate selling of newly mined bitcoin greatly increases the trading volume of bitcoin, creating downward pressure on the market price of bitcoin.\nThere are risks related to technological obsolescence, the vulnerability of the global supply chain for cryptocurrency hardware disruption, and difficulty in obtaining new hardware which may have a negative effect on our business.\nOur mining operations can only be successful and ultimately profitable if the costs, including hardware and electricity costs, associated with mining bitcoin are lower than the price of a single bitcoin. As our mining facility operates, our miners experience ordinary wear and tear, and may also face more significant malfunctions caused by a number of extraneous factors beyond our control. The degradation of our miners will require us to, over time, replace those miners which are no longer functional. Additionally, as the technology evolves, we may be required to acquire newer models of miners to remain competitive in the market. This upgrading process requires substantial capital investment, and we may face challenges in doing so on a timely and cost-effective basis.\nFurther, the global supply of miners is unpredictable and presently heavily dependent on manufacturers based in China, which was severely affected by the emergence of the COVID-19 coronavirus global pandemic. We currently utilize several types of ASIC miners as part of our mining operation, including Bitmain Antminers, Avalon miners and MicroBT WhatsMiners, which are all produced in China, Malaysia, and Indonesia. Geopolitical matters, including the U.S. relationship with China, may impact our ability to import ASIC miners. As a result, we may not be able to obtain adequate replacement parts for our existing miners or obtain additional miners from manufacturers on a timely basis. Such events could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations and potentially the value of any bitcoin we mine or otherwise acquire or hold for our own account, and harm investors.\nThere is a possibility of bitcoin mining algorithms transitioning to proof of stake validation and other mining related risks, which could make us less competitive and ultimately adversely affect our business and an investment in us.\nProof of stake is an alternative method in validating cryptocurrency transactions. Should the bitcoin mining algorithm shift from a proof of work validation method to a proof of stake method, mining would require less energy and may render any company that maintains advantages in the current climate (for example, from lower priced electricity, processing, real estate, or hosting) less competitive. As a result of our efforts to optimize and improve the efficiency of our bitcoin mining operations, we may be exposed to the risk in the future of losing the benefit of our capital investments and the competitive advantage we hope to gain and may be negatively impacted if a switch to proof of stake validation were to occur. Such events could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations and potentially the value of any bitcoin we mine or otherwise acquire or hold for our own account.\nWe may face risks of Internet disruptions, which could have an adverse effect on not only the price of bitcoin but our ability to mine bitcoin.\nA disruption of the Internet may adversely affect the mining and use of cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin. Generally, cryptocurrencies and our business of mining bitcoin is dependent upon the Internet. A significant disruption in Internet connectivity could disrupt bitcoin\u2019s network operations until the disruption is resolved and have an adverse effect on the price of bitcoin and our ability to mine bitcoin.\nSince there has been limited precedent set for financial accounting of digital assets, including bitcoin, it is unclear how we will be required to account for transactions involving digital assets.\nBecause there has been limited precedent set for the financial accounting of cryptocurrencies and related revenue recognition and no official guidance has yet been provided by the Financial Accounting Standards Board or the SEC, it is unclear how companies may in the future be required to account for cryptocurrency transactions and assets and related revenue recognition. A change in regulatory or financial accounting standards or interpretation by the SEC could result in changes in our accounting treatment and the necessity to restate our financial statements. Such a restatement could adversely impact the accounting for the bitcoins we hold and bitcoin transactions and, more generally, negatively impact our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nFuture developments regarding the treatment of digital assets for U.S. federal income and applicable state, local and non-U.S. tax purposes could adversely impact our business.\nDue to the new and evolving nature of digital assets and the absence of comprehensive legal guidance with respect to digital assets and related transactions, many significant aspects of the U.S. federal income and applicable state, local and non-U.S. tax treatment of transactions involving digital assets, such as the purchase and sale of bitcoin and the receipt of staking rewards and other digital asset incentives and rewards products, are uncertain, and it is unclear what guidance may be issued in the future with respect to the tax treatment of digital assets and related transactions.\nCurrent IRS guidance indicates that for U.S. federal income tax purposes digital assets such as bitcoins should be treated and taxed as property, and that transactions involving the payment of bitcoins for goods and services should be treated in effect as barter transactions. The IRS has also released guidance to the effect that, under certain circumstances, hard forks of digital currencies are taxable events giving rise to taxable income and guidance with respect to the determination of the tax basis of digital currency. However, current IRS guidance does not address other significant aspects of the U.S. federal income tax treatment of digital assets and related transactions. Moreover, although current IRS guidance addresses the treatment of certain forks, there continues to be uncertainty with respect to the timing and amount of income inclusions for various crypto asset transactions, including, but not limited to, staking rewards and other crypto asset incentives and rewards products. While current IRS guidance creates a potential tax reporting requirement for any circumstance where the ownership of a bitcoin passes from one person to another, it preserves the right to apply capital gains treatment to those transactions, which is generally favorable for investors in bitcoin.\nThere can be no assurance that the IRS will not alter its existing position with respect to digital assets in the future or that other state, local and non-U.S. taxing authorities or courts will follow the approach of the IRS with respect to the treatment of digital assets such as bitcoins for income tax and sales tax purposes. Any such alteration of existing guidance or issuance of new or different guidance may have negative consequences including the imposition of a greater tax burden on investors in bitcoin or imposing a greater cost on the acquisition and disposition of bitcoin, generally; in either case potentially having a negative effect on the trading price of bitcoin or otherwise negatively impacting our business. In addition, future technological and operational developments that may arise with respect to digital currencies may increase the uncertainty with respect to the treatment of digital currencies for U.S. federal income and applicable state, local and non-U.S. tax purposes.\nRisks Related to Our Securities\nThe price of our common stock may be volatile and could fluctuate widely, which could result in substantial losses for investors.\nThe market price of our common stock is likely to be highly volatile and could fluctuate widely in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control, including, without limitation:\n\u00b7 technological innovations or new products and services by us or our competitors;\n\u00b7 government regulation of our products and services;\n\u00b7 the establishment of partnerships with other technology companies;\n\u00b7 intellectual property disputes;\n\u00b7 additions or departures of key personnel;\n\u00b7 sales of our common stock;\n\u00b7 our ability to integrate operations, technology, products and services;\n\u00b7 our ability to execute our business plan;\n\u00b7 operating results below expectations;\n\u00b7 loss of any strategic relationship;\n\u00b7 industry developments;\n\u00b7 economic and other external factors; and\n\u00b7 period-to-period fluctuations in our financial results.\nIn addition, the securities markets have from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These market fluctuations may also materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe have the right to designate and issue additional shares of preferred stock. If we were to designate and/or issue additional preferred stock, it is likely to have rights, preferences and privileges that may adversely affect the common stock.\nWe are authorized to issue 10,000,000 shares of blank-check Preferred Stock, with such rights, preferences and privileges as may be determined from time to time by our Board of Directors. Our Board of Directors is empowered, without stockholder approval, to issue Preferred Stock in one or more series, and to fix for any series the dividend rights, dissolution or liquidation preferences, redemption prices, conversion rights, voting rights, and other rights, preferences and privileges for the Preferred Stock. Currently, 2,000,000 shares are designated as Series A Preferred Stock, of which 1,750,000 shares are outstanding, the features of which are discussed elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nThe issuance of shares of Preferred Stock, depending on the rights, preferences and privileges attributable to the Preferred Stock, could reduce the voting rights and powers of the common stock and the portion of our assets allocated for distribution to common stockholders in a liquidation event, and could also result in dilution in the book value per share of the common stock. The preferred stock could also be utilized, under certain circumstances, as a method for raising additional capital or discouraging, delaying or preventing a change in control of the Company, to the detriment of the investors in the common stock offered hereby. We cannot assure that we will not, under certain circumstances, issue shares of our Preferred Stock.\nWe have not paid dividends on shares of our common stock in the past and have no immediate plans to pay do so in the future.\nWe have not paid, and do not plan to pay, any cash dividends with respect to our common stock in the immediate future. We plan to reinvest all of our earnings, to the extent we have earnings, in order to market our products and to cover operating costs and to otherwise become and remain competitive. We cannot assure stockholders that we would, at any time, generate sufficient surplus cash that would be available for distribution to the holders of our common stock as a dividend. Therefore, stockholders should not expect to receive cash dividends on our common stock.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish or do not continue to publish research or reports about our business, or if they issue an adverse or misleading opinion regarding our stock, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock is influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. If any of the analysts who cover us now or in the future issue an adverse opinion regarding our stock, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nProvisions in the Nevada Revised Statutes and our Bylaws could make it very difficult for an investor to bring any legal actions against our directors or officers for violations of their fiduciary duties or could require us to pay any amounts incurred by our directors or officers in any such actions.\nMembers of our Board of Directors and our officers will have no liability for breaches of their fiduciary duty of care as a director or officer, except in limited circumstances, pursuant to provisions in the Nevada Revised Statutes and our Bylaws as authorized by the Nevada Revised Statutes. Specifically, Section 78.138 of the Nevada Revised Statutes provides that a director or officer is not individually liable to the company or its shareholders or creditors for any damages as a result of any act or failure to act in his or her capacity as a director or officer unless it is proven that (1) the directors or officers act or failure to act constituted a breach of his or her fiduciary duties as a director or officer and (2) his or her breach of those duties involved intentional misconduct, fraud or a knowing violation of law. This provision is intended to afford directors and officers protection against and to limit their potential liability for monetary damages resulting from suits alleging a breach of the duty of care by a director or officer.\nAccordingly, stockholders may be unable to prevail in a legal action against our directors or officers even if they have breached their fiduciary duty of care. In addition, our Bylaws allow us to indemnify our directors and officers from and against any and all costs, charges and expenses resulting from their acting in such capacities with us. This means that if one were able to enforce an action against our directors or officers, in all likelihood, we would be required to pay any expenses they incurred in defending the lawsuit and any judgment or settlement they otherwise would be required to pay. Accordingly, our indemnification obligations could divert needed financial resources and may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, and adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock.",

Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nForward-Looking Statements\nThe following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations for the years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020 should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements that are included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our discussion includes forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties, such as our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions. Actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors. We use words such as anticipate, estimate, plan, project, continuing, ongoing, expect, believe, intend, may, will, should, could, and similar expressions to identify forward-looking statements.\nResults of Operations for the Year Ended September 30, 2021 and 2020\nRevenues\nWe earned $49,438,115 in revenues during the year ended September 30, 2021, as compared with $10,028,701 in revenues for the year ended September 30, 2020.\nFor the year ended September 30, 2021, our revenue was derived from cryptocurrency mining revenues, the sale of equipment, solar panels, batteries, design, engineering, and services revenue. Income from our mining segment is a result of bitcoin mining activities in the United States. Income from our Energy segment is the result of contracts to sell switchgear equipment, perform engineering design, and provide software for distributed energy and microgrid systems. For the year ended September 30, 2021, we also generated services revenue from p2kLabs. We hope to generate more significant revenue from customers through the sale and licensing of our Software platforms and services in the future. However, we are unable to estimate with any degree of certainty the amount of future revenues, from existing or future software contracts. Also, we do not anticipate earning significant revenues from our Gasifier business until such time that we have fully developed our technology and are able to market our products.\nCosts and Expenses\nWe had costs and expenses of $78,015,168 for the year ended September 30, 2021, as compared with $25,171,817 for the year ended September 30, 2020.\nOur cost of revenues were $13,964,711 for the year ended September 30, 2021, as compared with cost of revenues of $7,907,849 for the year ended September 30, 2020.\nOur cost of revenues in 2021 was mainly the result of mining energy costs, hosting fees, contract manufacturing expenses, and hardware materials.

Because of varying available valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and the variety of equity instruments that can impact a company's non-cash operating expenses, CleanSpark management believes that providing a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes non-cash and non-recurring expenses allows for meaningful comparisons between the Company's core business operating results and those of other companies, as well as providing the Company with an important tool for financial and operational decision making and for evaluating its own core business operating results over different periods of time.\nThe Company's adjusted EBITDA measure may not provide information that is directly comparable to that provided by other companies in its industry, as other companies in its industry may calculate non-GAAP financial results differently, particularly related to non-recurring, unusual items. The Company's adjusted EBITDA is not a measurement of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to operating income or as an indication of operating performance or any other measure of performance derived in accordance with GAAP. Our management does not consider adjusted EBITDA to be a substitute for, or superior to, the information provided by GAAP financial results.\nWe are providing supplemental financial measures for (i) non-GAAP adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or (\u201cadjusted EBITDA\u201d) that excludes the impact of interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, our share-based compensation expense, and impairment of assets, unrealized gains/losses on securities, certain financing costs, other non-cash items, certain non-recurring expenses, and impacts related to discontinued operations; and (ii) non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP earnings per share that excludes the impact of interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, our share-based compensation expense, and impairment of assets, unrealized gains/losses on securities, certain financing costs, other non-cash items, and impacts related to discontinued operations. These supplemental financial measures are not measurements of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (\u201cGAAP\u201d) and, as a result, these supplemental financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures internally to help understand, manage, and evaluate our business performance and to help make operating decisions.\nWe believe that these non-GAAP financial measures are also useful to investors and analysts in comparing our performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis. The first supplemental financial measure excludes (i) impacts of interest, taxes, and depreciation; (ii) significant non-cash expenses such as our share-based compensation expense, unrealized gains/losses on securities, certain financing costs, other non-cash items that we believe are not reflective of our general business performance, and for which the accounting requires management judgment, and the resulting expenses could vary significantly in comparison to other companies; (iii) significant impairment losses related to long-lived and digital assets, which include our bitcoin for which the accounting requires significant estimates and judgment, and the resulting expenses could vary significantly in comparison to other companies; and (iv) and impacts related to discontinued operations that would not be applicable to our future business activities.\nNon-GAAP financial measures are subject to material limitations as they are not in accordance with, or a substitute for, measurements prepared in accordance with GAAP. For example, we expect that share-based compensation expense, which is excluded from the first two non-GAAP financial measures, will continue to be a significant recurring expense over the coming years and is an important part of the compensation provided to certain employees, officers, and directors.\nWe have also excluded impairment losses on assets, including impairments of our digital currency our non-GAAP financial measures, which may continue to occur in future periods as a result of our continued holdings of significant amounts of bitcoin. Our non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation and should be read only in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. We rely primarily on such Consolidated Financial Statements to understand, manage, and evaluate our business performance and use the non-GAAP financial measures only supplementally.\nThe following is a reconciliation of our non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable financial measure stated in accordance with GAAP, which excludes the impact of (i) interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization; (ii) our share-based compensation expense; (iii) impairment expense; (iv) unrealized gains/losses on securities; (v) and (vi) impacts related to discontinued operations, to its most directly comparable GAAP measures for the periods indicated:\nYears Ended September 30,\nReconciliation of non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA\nNet Loss: $ (21,812,010 ) $ (23,346,143)\nInterest and taxes (67,409 ) 10,449,946\nDepreciation and amortization 12,244,368 2,836,249\nShare-based compensation expense 8,546,712 2,053,232\nDigital asset impairment losses 6,608,076 -\nEnergy & other goodwill impairment losses 6,277,710 -\nUnrealized (gains)/losses of securities and derivatives (2,785,234 ) (2,232,137)\nDiscontinued operations - -\nnon-GAAP adjusted EBITDA 9,012,213 (10,238,853)\nThe following is a reconciliation of our non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA earnings per share, in each case excluding the impact of (i) interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization; (ii) our share-based compensation expense; (iii) impairment expense; (iv) unrealized gains/losses on securities; (v) certain financing costs and other non-cash items; (vi) certain non-recurring expenses; and (vii) impacts related to discontinued operations:\nReconciliation of non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA per share:\nNon-GAAP adjusted EBITDA $ 9,012,213 $ (10,238,853)\nInterest and taxes (per diluted share) - 1.09\nDepreciation and amortization (per share) 0.42 0.30\nShare-based compensation expense 0.29 0.21\nDigital asset impairment losses (per share) 0.22 -\nEnergy & other goodwill impairment losses 0.21 -\nUnrealized (gains)/losses of securities and derivatives (per share) (0.09 ) (0.23)\nDiscontinued operations - -\nNon-GAAP EBITDA per share $ 0.31 $ (1.07)\nThe following is a reconciliation of fair market value of our digital currency holdings to the current carrying value at September 30, 2021.

On March 18, 2021, the Company consummated a fully underwritten public offering of shares of its common stock, which resulted in net proceeds to the Company of approximately $187,200,000. On June 3, 2021, the Company entered into an At the Market Offering Agreement (the \u201cATM\u201d) with H.C. Wainwright & Co., LLC (\u201cHCW\u201d), pursuant to which it may, from time to time, offer and sell up to an aggregate of $500,000,000 of shares of its common stock to or through HCW. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, the Company issued an aggregate of 3,443,379 shares of the Company\u2019s common stock under the ATM for net proceeds of $46.4 million. The shares were sold pursuant to a prospectus dated March 15, 2021 and a prospectus supplement dated June 3, 2021 filed with the SEC. Based on our current plans and business conditions, we believe that existing cash, cash generated from operations and our ATM will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated cash requirements until we reach profitability, and we are not aware of any trends or demands, commitments, events or uncertainties that are reasonably likely to result in a decrease in liquidity of our assets. However, our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including our growth rate, the timing and extent of spending to support development efforts, the expansion of our sales and marketing, the timing of new product introductions and the continuing market acceptance of our products and services. If cash generated from operations is insufficient to satisfy our capital requirements, we may open a revolving line of credit with a bank, or we may have to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain credit facilities. In the event such financing is needed in the future, there can be no assurance that such financing will be available to us, or, if available, that it will be in amounts and on terms acceptable to us. If cash flows from operations became insufficient to continue operations at the current level, and if no additional financing was obtained, our business, operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected.\nAs of September 30, 2021, we had total current assets of $57,726,321, consisting of cash, accounts receivable, inventory, digital currency, investments, prepaid expenses and other current assets, and total assets in the amount of $317,473,121. Our total current liabilities as of September 30, 2021 were $10,063,022. We had a working capital surplus of $47,663,299 as of September 30, 2021.\nOperating activities used $35,429,342 in cash for the year ended September 30, 2021, as compared with $6,642,734 for the same period ended September 30, 2020. Our net loss of $21,812,010 was the main component of our negative operating cash flow for the year ended September 30, 2021, offset mainly by stock-based compensation of $8,546,712, impairment expense of $12,885,786 and depreciation and amortization of $12,244,368. Our net loss of $23,346,143 was the main component of our negative operating cash flow for the year ended September 30, 2020, offset mainly by amortization of debt discount of $9,010,547, depreciation and amortization of $2,672,331, shares issued as interest of $2,050,000, amortization of capitalized software of $163,918 and stock-based compensation of $2,053,232.\nCash flows used by investing activities during the year ended September 30, 2021 was $217,714,926, as compared with $2,383,623 for the year ended September 30, 2020. Our acquisitions of Solar watt Solutions for $1,000,136, purchase of fixed assets of $139,234,948, and deposits on mining equipment of $87,959,910 were the main components of our negative investing cash flow for the year ended September 30, 2021. The negative cash flow from investing activities is offset by sale of digital currencies of $11,443,132, acquisition of ATL Data Center, net of cash received of $45,783 and sale of equity securities of $373,121.\nFor the year ended September 30, 2020, our investment in the capitalized software of $84,924, acquisition of P2K Labs of $1,141,990, acquisition of Grid Fabric of $371,812, purchase of fixed assets of $34,897, and investment in equity and debt security of $750,000 were the main components of our negative investing cash flow.\nCash flows provided by financing activities during the year ended September 30, 2021 amounted to $268,058,393, as compared with $4,313,702 for the year ended September 30, 2020. Our positive cash flows from financing activities for the year ended September 30, 2021 consisted of $270,656,118 in proceeds from offerings, $3,750,932 in proceeds from the exercise of warrants and options offset by repayments of $5,882,553 on promissory notes and $288,602 in finance leases. Our positive cash flows from financing activities for the year ended September 30, 2020 consisted of $4,000,000 in proceeds from the sale of common stock, $531,169 in proceeds from promissory notes offset by repayments of $217,467 on promissory notes.\nContractual Obligations\nThe Company has purchase commitments for approximately $203.6 million related to purchase of miners as of September 30, 2021, and the Company has paid $144.7 million towards these commitments as of the end of this period.\nThe Company has purchase commitments for infrastructure assets and other mining equipment of approximately $6,512,000 as of September 30, 2021 and the Company has paid $4,576,000 towards these commitments during this period.\nThe following table sets forth certain information concerning our obligations to make contractual future payments towards our agreements as of September 30, 2021:\n2025 Thereafter Total\nRecorded contractual obligations:\nOperating lease obligations $316,908 $324,948 $333,234 $341,767 $299,039 $50,659 $1,666,555\nFinance Lease obligations 449,431 321,887 142,428 12,320 1,853 - 927,919\nMiner equipment 58,930,880\n58,930,880\nInfrastructure assets 1,936,000\n1,936,000\nTotal $61,633,219 $646,835 $475,662 $354,087 $300,892 $50,659 $63,461,354\nContingent consideration\nGridFabric: On August 31, 2020, the Company acquired GridFabric, LLC. Pursuant to the terms of the purchase agreement, additional shares of the Company\u2019s common stock valued at up to $750,000 were issuable if GridFabric achieves certain revenue and product release milestones. On September 30, 2021, the contingent consideration was re-measured to $500,000.\nSubsequent to September 30, 2021, the Company settled all contingent consideration due to GridFabric resulting in the issuance of 8,404 shares of Company common stock valued at $150,000.\nSolar Watt Solutions: On February 24, 2021, the Company acquired Solar Watt Solutions, Inc. Pursuant to the terms of the purchase agreement, additional cash consideration of up to $2,500,000 and up to 310,018 shares of the Company\u2019s common stock may be payable if Solar Watt Solutions achieves certain revenue milestones. As of September 30 2021, none of the contingent consideration had been earned.\nKnown Trends or Uncertainties\nAlthough we have not seen any significant reduction in revenues to date, we have seen some consolidation in our industry during economic downturns. These consolidations have not had a negative effect on our total sales; however, should consolidations and downsizing in the industry continue to occur, those events could adversely impact our revenues and earnings going forward.\nAs discussed in the Risk Factors section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the world has been affected due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Until the pandemic has passed, there remains uncertainty as to the effect of COVID-19 on our business in both the short and long-term.\nWe believe that the need for improved productivity in the research and development activities directed toward developing new products and/or software will continue to result in increasing adoption of energy solution tools such as those we produce. New product and/or software developments in the energy business segment could result in increased revenues and earnings if they are accepted by our markets; however, there can be no assurances that new products and/or software will result in significant improvements to revenues or earnings. For competitive reasons, we do not disclose all of our new product development activities.\nOur continued quest for acquisitions could result in a significant change to revenues and earnings if one or more such acquisitions are completed.\nThe potential for growth in new markets is uncertain. We will continue to explore these opportunities until such time as we either generate sales or determine that resources would be more efficiently used elsewhere.\nInflation\nWe have not been affected materially by inflation during the periods presented, and no material effect is expected in the near future.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nIn October 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers, which requires contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination to be recognized and measured by the acquirer on the acquisition date in accordance with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, as if it had originated the contracts. Under the current business combinations guidance, such assets and liabilities are recognized by the acquirer at fair value on the acquisition date. This new guidance is effective for the Company for its fiscal year beginning February 1, 2023 and interim periods within that fiscal year, and early adoption is permitted. The Company is evaluating its potential impact but does not expect the new standard to have a material impact on the Company's results of operations or cash flows.\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting and issued subsequent amendments to the initial guidance (collectively, \u201cTopic 848\u201d). Topic 848 became effective immediately and expires on December 21, 2022. Topic 848 allows eligible contracts that are modified to be accounted for as a continuation of those contracts, permits companies to preserve their hedging accounting during the transition period and enables companies to make a one-time election to transfer or sell held-to-maturity debt securities that are affected by rate reform. Topic 848 provides optional expedients and exceptions for contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions that reference the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) or another reference rate expected to be discontinued because of reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. The adoption of ASU 2020-04 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company\u2019s financial statements or disclosures.\nThe Company adopted ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments on October 1, 2020 (\u201cASU 2016-13\u201d). ASU 2016-13 requires entities to use a new forward-looking \u201cexpected loss\u201d model that reflects expected credit losses, including credit losses related to trade receivables, and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates, which generally will result in the earlier recognition of allowances for losses. As the Company was a Smaller Reporting Company at the time of issuance of the ASU, the Company expects to adopt the ASU effective October 1, 2023, including the interim periods within the fiscal year. In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU2020-06, \u201cDebt - Debt with Conversion and Other Options (subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entity\u2019s Own Equity (subtopic 815-40),\u201d which reduces the number of accounting models in ASC 470-20 that require separate accounting for embedded conversion features. As a result, a convertible debt instrument will be accounted for as a single liability measured at its amortized cost as long as no other features require bifurcation and recognition as derivatives. By removing those separation models, the effective interest rate of convertible debt instruments will be closer to the coupon interest rate. Further, the diluted net income per share calculation for convertible instruments will require the Company to use the if-converted method. The treasury stock method should no longer be used to calculate diluted net income per share for convertible instruments. The amendment will be effective for the Company with annual periods beginning January 1, 2022 and early adoption is permitted. The adoption of ASU 2020-06 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company\u2019s financial statements or disclosures.\nIn August 2020, the FASB issued Account Standard Update (\u201cASU\u201d) 2020-06, \u201cDebt - Debt with Conversion and Other Options (subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entity\u2019s Own Equity (subtopic 815-40),\u201d which reduces the number of accounting models in ASC 470-20 that require separate accounting for embedded conversion features. As a result, a convertible debt instrument will be accounted for as a single liability measured at its amortized cost as long as no other features require bifurcation and recognition as derivatives. By removing those separation models, the effective interest rate of convertible debt instruments will be closer to the coupon interest rate. Further, the diluted net income per share calculation for convertible instruments will require the Company to use the if-converted method. The treasury stock method should no longer be used to calculate diluted net income per share for convertible instruments. The amendment will be effective for the Company with annual periods beginning January 1, 2022 and early adoption is permitted. The adoption of ASU 2020-06 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company\u2019s financial statements or disclosures.\nThe Company has evaluated all other recent accounting pronouncements and believes that none of them will have a material effect on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nIn December 2001, the SEC requested that all registrants list their most critical accounting policies in the Management Discussion and Analysis. The SEC indicated that a critical accounting policy is one which is both important to the portrayal of a Company\u2019s financial condition and results, and requires managements most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain.\nOur accounting policies are discussed in detail in the footnotes to our financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2021 however we consider our critical accounting policies to be those related to revenue recognition, long-lived assets, accounts receivable, fair value of financial instruments, cash and cash equivalents, digital currency and stock-based compensation.\nOur significant estimates include estimates used to review the Company\u2019s goodwill and digital currency impairment, intangible assets acquired, impairments and estimations of long-lived assets, revenue recognition on percentage of completion type contracts, revenue recognition from digital currency mining, valuation of derivative assets and liabilities, available-for-sale investments, allowances for uncollectible accounts, valuation of digital currencies, valuation of contingent consideration, warranty, and the valuations of share based awards. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable in the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions including, but not limited to, the ultimate impact that COVID-19 may have on the Company\u2019s operations.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of September 30, 2021, there were no off-balance sheet arrangements.",

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2021 and 2020, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended September 30, 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nWe also have audited the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (\u201cCOSO\u201d) and our report dated December 14, 2021 expressed an adverse opinion.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company\u2019s management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management\u2019s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s financial statements and an opinion on the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (\u201cPCAOB\u201d) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that responds to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nEvaluation of the Accounting for and Disclosure of Digital Currency Held\nAs disclosed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company\u2019s digital currency held as of September 30, 2021, which mainly consist of Bitcoin, are accounted for as indefinite-lived intangible assets, and have been included in current assets on the consolidated balance sheet. The Company\u2019s digital currency as of September 30, 2021 amounted to approximately $23,603,000. We identified the accounting for and disclosure of the digital currency held as a critical audit matter because, currently, no specific definitive guidance exists for the accounting for and disclosure of digital currencies held in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\u201cGAAP\u201d). The Company\u2019s management has exercised significant judgment in their determination of how existing GAAP should be applied to the accounting for its digital currency held, the associated financial statement presentation and accompanying footnote disclosures.\nThe primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included the following:\n\u00b7 Evaluated management\u2019s rationale for the application of Accounting Standards Codification (\u201cASC\u201d) 350 to account for its digital currency held and examined management\u2019s processes for determining the amount of impairment expense recognized;\n\u00b7 Evaluated management\u2019s rationale for the inclusion of digital currency as a current asset on the balance sheet;\n\u00b7 Independently and directly confirmed the balance and ownership of digital currency that is in the custody of a third party;\n\u00b7 Evaluated management\u2019s disclosures of its digital currency activities in the financial statement footnotes; and\n\u00b7 Examined supporting sale and cash receipt evidence for digital currency sales, including management\u2019s processes for calculating any gains or losses on sales of its digital currency.\nEvaluation of the Accounting for and Disclosure of Digital Currency Mining Revenue Recognized\nAs disclosed in Note 2, the Company recognizes revenue in accordance with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The Company provides computing power to the mining pools and in exchange for providing such computing power, the Company is entitled to a fractional share of the fixed cryptocurrency award the pool operator receives for successfully adding a block to the blockchain, plus a fractional share of the transaction fees attached to that block. The Company\u2019s fractional share is based on the proportion of computing power the Company contributed to the mining pool operator to the total computing power contributed by all mining pool participants in solving the current algorithm. During the year ended September 30, 2021, the Company recognized net digital currency mining revenue of approximately $38,846,000. We identified the accounting for and disclosure of digital currency mining revenue recognized as a critical audit matter because, currently, no specific definitive guidance exists for the accounting for and disclosure of digital currency mining revenue recognized in accordance with GAAP. The Company\u2019s management has exercised significant judgment in their determination of how existing GAAP should be applied to the accounting for and disclosure of digital currency mining revenue recognized.\nThe primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included the following:\n\u00b7 Performed a site visitation of the facility where the Company\u2019s mining hardware is located. The visitation included an observation of the physical and environmental controls and mining equipment inventory observation procedures;\n\u00b7 Evaluated management\u2019s rationale for the application of ASC 606 to account for digital currency awards earned;\n\u00b7 Evaluated management\u2019s disclosures of its digital currency activities in the financial statement footnotes;\n\u00b7 Evaluated and tested management\u2019s rationale and supporting documentation associated with the valuation of digital currency awards earned;\n\u00b7 Independently confirmed certain financial data and wallet records directly with the mining pools;\n\u00b7 Compared the Company\u2019s wallet records of digital currency mining compensation received to publicly available blockchain records; and\n\u00b7 Undertook an analytical review of total digital currency mining revenue expected to be recognized by the Company by assessing the total hash power contributed onto the network by the Company against total block rewards and transaction fees issued over the year.\n/s/ MaloneBailey, LLP\nwww.malonebailey.com\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2018.\nHouston, Texas\nDecember 14, 2021\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Shareholders and Board of Directors of\nCleanSpark, Inc.\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the internal control over financial reporting of CleanSpark, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, the \u201cCompany\u201d) as of September 30, 2021 based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (\u201cCOSO\u201d). In our opinion, because of the effect of the material weaknesses described below on the achievement of the objectives of the control criteria, the Company did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.\nWe do not express an opinion or any other form of assurance on management\u2019s statements referring to any corrective actions taken by the Company after the date of management\u2019s assessment.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (\u201cPCAOB\u201d), the consolidated financial statements of the Company as of September 30, 2021 and 2020 and for the years then ended and our report dated December 14, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.\nThe Company acquired ATL Data Centers LLC and Solar Watt Solutions, Inc. (collectively, the \u201cAcquired Businesses\u201d) during the year ended September 30, 2021, and management excluded from its assessment of the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2021, the Acquired Businesses\u2019 internal control over financial reporting associated with total assets of $267.3 million (of which $27.3 million represents goodwill and intangibles included within the scope of the assessment), and total revenues of $43.2 million included in the consolidated financial statements of the Company as of and for the year ended September 30, 2021. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of the Company also excluded an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of the Acquired Businesses.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company\u2019s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the Management\u2019s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting (\u201cManagement\u2019s Report\u201d). Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company\u2019s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The following material weaknesses have been identified and included in management\u2019s assessment: (1) the Company did not adequately implement or properly maintain controls over its financial close and reporting process, its process over the recording of energy and other services revenue and its process over the accounting and valuation of certain aspects of business combinations involving significant estimates and (2) the Company did not adequately design and maintain effective general information technology controls over third-party information systems and applications that are relevant to the preparation of the Company\u2019s financial statements. These material weaknesses were considered in determining the nature, timing, and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the 2021 consolidated financial statements, and this report does not affect our report on those financial statements.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ MaloneBailey, LLP\nwww.malonebailey.com\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2018.\nHouston, Texas\nDecember 14, 2021\nCLEANSPARK, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\nSeptember 30, 2021 September 30, 2020\nASSETS\nCurrent assets\nCash and cash equivalents, including restricted cash $ 18,040,327 $ 3,126,202\nAccounts receivable, net 2,619,957 859,791\nContract assets -

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nBasis of Presentation and Liquidity\nThe accompanying audited financial statements of the Company have been prepared by the Management in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission and have been filed with the SEC on December 14, 2021 (\u201cForm 10-K\u201d).\nAs shown in the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements, the Company incurred a net loss of $21,812,010 and $23,346,143 during the years ended September 30, 2021 and September 30, 2020, respectively. While the Company has experienced negative cash flows from operations, the Company has sufficient capital to support its ongoing operations from cash flows provided from operational activities, including potential sale of digital currency, and has access to additional capital through the registered sale of equity securities pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-3. In addition, the Company is continuing to grow its business segments through which it expects to grow its working capital base. As of September 30, 2021 and September 30, 2020, the Company had working capital of $47,663,299 and $2,869,329, respectively.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe accompanying audited consolidated financial statements include the accounts of CleanSpark, Inc., and its wholly owned operating subsidiaries, CleanSpark, LLC, CleanSpark II, LLC, CleanSpark Critical Power Systems Inc., p2kLabs, Inc, GridFabric, LLC, ATL Data Centers LLC, CleanBlok, Inc., CSRE Properties, LLC, Solar Watt Solutions, Inc, CSRE Properties Norcross, LLC and CSRE Property Management Company, LLC. All intercompany transactions have been eliminated upon consolidation of these entities.\nGoing Concern\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. The going concern basis of presentation assumes that the Company will continue in operation one year after the date these financial statements are issued and will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. The evaluation of going concern under the accounting guidance requires significant judgment which involves the Company to consider that it has historically incurred losses in recent years as it has prepared to grow its business through acquisition opportunities. The Company must also consider its current liquidity as well as future market and economic conditions that may be deemed outside the control of the Company as it relates to obtaining financing and generating future profits. As of September 30, 2021, the Company had approximately $18 million of available cash on-hand and Bitcoin with a fair market value of $27.5 million. In determining whether there is substantial doubt about the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern, the Company may consider the effects of any mitigating plans for additional sources of financing. The Company identified additional financing sources it believes are currently available to fund its operations and drive future growth that include (i) the ability to access capital using the at-the-market (\u201cATM\u201d) equity offering program available to the Company whereby the Company may sell additional shares of its common stock (discussed in Note 11 - Stockholders\u2019 Equity), and (ii) the ability to raise additional financing from other sources. (Refer to Note 11 for further details)\nUse of estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates include estimates used to review the Company\u2019s goodwill and digital currency impairment, intangible assets acquired, impairments and estimations of long-lived assets, revenue recognition on percentage of completion type contracts, revenue recognition from digital currency mining, valuation of derivative assets and liabilities, available-for-sale investments, allowances for uncollectible accounts, valuation of digital currencies, valuation of contingent consideration, warranty, and the valuations of share based awards. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable in the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions including, but not limited to, the ultimate impact that COVID-19 may have on the Company\u2019s operations.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles as outlined in the Financial Accounting Standard Board's (\u201cFASB\u201d) Accounting Standards Codification (\u201cASC\u201d) 606, Revenue From Contracts with Customers, which requires that five steps be followed in evaluating revenue recognition: (i) identify the contract with the customer; (ii) identity the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price; and (v) recognize revenue when or as the entity satisfied a performance obligation.\nOur accounting policy on revenue recognition by type of revenue is provided below.\nRevenues from digital currency mining\nThe Company has entered in digital asset mining pools to provide computing power to the mining pools. The contracts are terminable at any time by either party and the Company\u2019s enforceable right to compensation only begins when the Company starts providing computing power to the mining pool operator. In exchange for providing computing power, the Company is entitled to a fractional share of the fixed cryptocurrency award the mining pool operator receives (less net digital asset transaction fees to the mining pool operator), for successfully adding a block to the blockchain, , plus a fractional share of the transaction fees attached to that block.. The Company\u2019s fractional share is based on the proportion of computing power the Company contributed to the mining pool operator to the total computing power contributed by all mining pool participants in solving the current algorithm. The transaction consideration the Company receives is noncash consideration, in the form of digital currency, which the Company measures at fair value on the date received which is not materially different than the fair value at contract inception or time the Company has earned the award from the mining pools. The consideration is dependent on the number of digital assets mined on any given day. Fair value of the digital currency award received is determined using the spot price of the related digital currency on the date earned.\nThere is currently no definitive guidance under GAAP or alternative accounting framework for the accounting for digital currencies recognized as revenue or held, and management has exercised significant judgment in determining the appropriate accounting treatment. In the event authoritative guidance is enacted by the FASB, the Company may be required to change its policies, which could have an effect on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial position and results from operations. The total revenue recognized from digital currency mining for the years ended September 30, 2021 and September 30, 2020 is $38,846,633 and $0, respectively.\nEngineering & Construction Contracts and Service Contracts\nThe Company recognizes engineering and construction contract revenue over time, as performance obligations are satisfied, due to the continuous transfer of control to the customer. Engineering and construction contracts are generally accounted for as a single unit of account (a single performance obligation) and are not segmented between types of services. The Company recognizes revenue based primarily on contract cost incurred to date compared to total estimated contract cost (an input method). The input method is the most faithful depiction of the Company\u2019s performance because it directly measures the value of the services transferred to the customer. Customer-furnished materials, labor and equipment and, in certain cases, subcontractor materials, labor and equipment, are included in revenue and cost of revenue when management believes that the company is acting as a principal rather than as an agent (i.e., the company integrates the materials, labor and equipment into the deliverables promised to the customer). Customer-furnished materials are only included in revenue and cost when the contract includes construction activity and the Company has visibility into the amount the customer is paying for the materials or there is a reasonable basis for estimating the amount. The Company recognizes revenue, but not profit, on certain uninstalled materials that are not specifically produced, fabricated, or constructed for a project. Revenue on these uninstalled materials is recognized when the cost is incurred (when control is transferred). Changes to total estimated contract cost or losses, if any, are recognized in the period in which they are determined as assessed at the contract level. Pre-contract costs are expensed as incurred unless they are expected to be recovered from the client. Project mobilization costs are generally charged to project costs as incurred when they are an integrated part of the performance obligation being transferred to the client. Customer payments on engineering and construction contracts are typically due within 30 to 45 days of billing, depending on the contract.\nThe Company recognizes energy (solar panel and battery) installation contract revenue for residential customers at a point in time upon completion of the installation. The revenues associated with energy installations for commercial customers are recognized over a period of time as noted in the engineering and construction contract revenue disclosure above.\nFor service contracts (including maintenance contracts) in which the Company has the right to consideration from the customer in an amount that corresponds directly with the value to the customer of the Company\u2019s performance completed to date, revenue is recognized when services are performed and contractually billable. Service contracts that include multiple performance obligations are segmented between types of services.\nFor contracts with multiple performance obligations, the Company allocates the transaction price to each performance obligation using an estimate of the stand-alone selling price of each distinct service in the contract. Revenue recognized on service contracts that have not been billed to clients is classified as a current asset under contract assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Amounts billed to clients in excess of revenue recognized on service contracts to date are classified as a current liability under contract liabilities. Customer payments on service contracts are typically due within 30 days of billing, depending on the contract.\nThe total revenue recognized from sale of residential battery, residential solar and commercial solar for the years ended September 30, 2021 and September 30, 2020 is $3,727,335 and $0, respectively.\nRevenues from Sale of Equipment\nPerformance Obligations Satisfied at a point in time.\nWe recognize revenue on agreements for equipment we sell on a standardized basis to the market at a point in time. We recognize revenue at the point in time that the customer obtains control of the good, which is generally upon shipment or when the customer has physical possession of the product depending on contract terms. We use proof of delivery for certain large equipment with more complex logistics, whereas the delivery of other equipment is estimated based on historical averages of in-transit periods (i.e., time between shipment and delivery). Generally, shipping costs are included in the price of equipment unless the customer requests a non-standard shipment. In situations where an alternative shipment arrangement has been made, the Company recognizes the shipping revenue upon customer receipt of the shipment.\nIn situations where arrangements include customer acceptance provisions based on seller or customer-specified objective criteria, we recognize revenue when we have concluded that the customer has control of the goods and that acceptance is likely to occur. We generally do not provide for anticipated losses on point in time transactions prior to transferring control of the equipment to the customer.\nOur billing terms for these point in time equipment contracts vary and generally coincide with shipment to the customer; however, within certain businesses, we receive progress payments from customers for large equipment purchases, which is generally to reserve production slots with our manufacturing partners, which are recorded as contract liabilities.\nDue to the customized nature of the equipment, the Company does not allow for customer returns.\nService Performance obligations satisfied over time.\nWe enter into long-term product service agreements with our customers primarily within our microgrid segment. These agreements require us to provide preventative maintenance, and standby support services that include certain levels of assurance regarding system performance throughout the contract periods, these contracts will generally range from 1 to 10 years. We account for items that are integral to the maintenance of the equipment as part of our service-related performance obligation, unless the customer has a substantive right to make a separate purchasing decision (e.g., equipment upgrade). Contract modifications that extend or revise contract terms are not uncommon and generally result in our recognizing the impact of the revised terms prospectively over the remaining life of the modified contract (i.e., effectively like a new contract). Revenues are recognized for these arrangements on a straight-line basis consistent with the nature, timing and extent of our services, which primarily relate to routine maintenance and as needed product repairs. Our billing terms for these contracts vary, but we generally invoice periodically as services are provided.\nContract assets represent revenue recognized in excess of amounts billed and include unbilled receivables (typically for cost reimbursable contracts) of $0 and contract work in progress (typically for fixed-price contracts) of $0 and $4,103 as of September 30, 2021 and September 30, 2020, respectively. Unbilled receivables, which represent an unconditional right to payment subject only to the passage of time, are reclassified to accounts receivable when they are billed under the terms of the contract. There are no advances that are payments on account of contract assets that have been deducted from contract assets as of September 30, 2021 and September 30, 2020. Contract liabilities mostly represent customer deposits. The Company recorded $296,964 and $64,198 in contract liabilities as of September 30, 2021 and September 30, 2020, respectively.\nThe total revenue recognized from sale of switchgear for the years ended September 30, 2021 and September 30, 2020 is $4,448,726 and $7,505,761 respectively.\nRevenues from software\nThe Company derives its software revenue from both subscription fees from customers for access to its energy software offerings and software license sales and support services. Revenues from software licenses are generally recognized upfront when the software is made available to the customer and revenues from the related support is generally recognized ratably over the contract term. The Company\u2019s policy is to exclude sales and other indirect taxes when measuring the transaction price of its subscription agreements.\nThe Company\u2019s subscription agreements generally have monthly or annual contractual terms. Revenue is recognized ratably over the related contractual term beginning on the date that the platform is made available to a customer. Access to the platform represents a series of distinct services as the Company continually provides access to, and fulfills its obligation to the end customer over the subscription term. The series of distinct services represents a single performance obligation that is satisfied over time.\nThe total revenue recognized from design, software development and other technology-based consulting services for the years ended September 30, 2021 and September 30, 2020 is $1,676,505 and $2,431,419, respectively.\nRevenues from design, software development and other technology-based consulting services\nFor service contracts performed under Master Services Agreements (\u201cMSA\u201d) and accompanying Statement(s) of Work (\u201cSOW\u201d), revenue is recognized based on the performance obligation(s) outlined in the SOW which is typically hours worked or specific deliverable milestones. In the case of a milestone-based SOW, the Company recognizes revenues as each deliverable is signed off by the customer.\nThe total revenue recognized from design, software development and other technology-based consulting services for the years ended September 30, 2021 and September 30, 2020 is $1,676,505 and $2,431,419, respectively.\nRevenues from data center services\nThe Company provides data services such as providing its customers with rack space, power and equipment, and cloud services such as virtual services, virtual storage, and data backup services, generally based on monthly services provided at a defined price included in the contracts. The performance obligations are the services provided to a customer for the month based on the contract. The transaction price is the price agreed with the customer for the monthly services provided and the revenues are recognized monthly based on the services rendered for the month.\nThe total revenue recognized from data center services for the years ended September 30, 2021 and September 30, 2020 is $554,345 and $0, respectively.\nVariable Consideration\nThe nature of the Company\u2019s contracts gives rise to several types of variable consideration, including claims and unpriced change orders; awards and incentive fees; and liquidated damages and penalties. The Company recognizes revenue for\nvariable consideration when it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur. The Company estimates the amount of revenue to be recognized on variable consideration using the expected value (i.e., the sum of a probability-weighted amount) or the most likely amount method, whichever is expected to better predict the amount. Factors considered in determining whether revenue associated with claims (including change orders in dispute and unapproved change orders in regard to both scope and price) should be recognized include the following: (a) the contract or other evidence provides a legal basis for the claim, (b) additional costs were caused by circumstances that were unforeseen at the contract date and not the result of deficiencies in the company\u2019s performance, (c) claim-related costs are identifiable and considered reasonable in view of the work performed, and (d) evidence supporting the claim is objective and verifiable. If the requirements for recognizing revenue for claims or unapproved change orders are met, revenue is recorded only when the costs associated with the claims or unapproved change orders have been incurred. Back charges to suppliers or subcontractors are recognized as a reduction of cost when it is determined that recovery of such cost is probable and the amounts can be reliably estimated. Disputed back charges are recognized when the same requirements described above for claims accounting have been satisfied.\nThe Company generally provides limited warranties for work performed under its engineering and construction contracts. The warranty periods typically extend for a limited duration following substantial completion of the Company\u2019s work on a project. Historically, warranty claims have not resulted in material costs incurred.\nPractical Expedients\nIf the Company has a right to consideration from a customer in an amount that corresponds directly with the value of the Company\u2019s performance completed to date (a service contract in which the company bills a fixed amount for each hour of service provided), the Company recognizes revenue in the amount to which it has a right to invoice for services performed.\nThe Company does not adjust the contract price for the effects of a significant financing component if the Company expects, at contract inception, that the period between when the company transfers a service to a customer and when the customer pays for that service will be one year or less.\nThe Company has made an accounting policy election to exclude from the measurement of the transaction price all taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are collected by the Company from its customers (use taxes, value added taxes, some excise taxes).\nFor the year ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, the Company reported revenues of $49,438,115 and $10,028,701, respectively.\nCost of Revenues\nThe Company includes the following in cost of revenues: energy costs, materials costs, manufacturing and logistics costs, freight costs, inventory write-downs, hosting services costs. The recognition of cost of revenue for our energy segment is dependent upon the revenue stream that it pertains to, refer below:\n1. Products Delivered at a Point in Time. Cost of revenue from these products is recognized when the Company transfers control of the product to the customer, which is generally upon shipment.\n2. Products Delivered Over Time. Cost of revenue from these products is recognized over the related service period.\nCash and cash equivalents including restricted cash\nCash and cash equivalents include cash and amounts due from banks and restricted cash. The Company\u2019s restricted cash represents amounts held in trust for certain construction projects. The following table sets forth a reconciliation of cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash reported in the consolidated balance sheets that agrees to the total of those amounts as presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows.\nSeptember 30, 2021 September 30, 2020\nCash and cash equivalents, excluding restricted cash $ 14,571,198 $ 3,126,202\nRestricted cash - construction escrow account 3,469,129 -\nCash and cash equivalents per consolidated Balance Sheet $ 18,040,327 $ 3,126,202\nAccounts receivable\nAccounts receivable is comprised of uncollateralized customer obligations due under normal trade terms. They are initially recorded at the invoiced amount upon the sale of goods or services to customers, and do not bear interest. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluation of its customers and management closely monitors outstanding receivables based on factors surrounding the credit risk of specific customers, historical trends, and other information. The carrying amount of accounts receivable is reviewed periodically for collectability. If management determines that collection is unlikely, an allowance that reflects management\u2019s best estimate of the amounts that will not be collected is recorded.\nAccounts receivable, net consists of the following:\nSeptember 30, 2021 September 30, 2020\nAccounts Receivable, gross $ 2,891,784 $ 902,146\nOther receivables 421,681 -\nRetainage receivable -\nProvision for doubtful allowances (693,508 ) (42,970)\nTotal Accounts Receivable, net $ 2,619,957 $ 859,791\nInventory\nInventory is stated at the lower cost or net realizable value with cost being measured on a first-in, first-out basis. For solar panel and battery installations, the Company transfers component parts from inventories to cost of goods sold once installation is complete. The Company periodically reviews inventories for unusable and obsolete items based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions. Based on this evaluation, provisions are made to write inventories down to their net realizable value. There were no write-downs of inventory as of September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The composition of inventory for the years ended as of September 30, 2021 and 2020 are as follows:\nSeptember 30, 2021 September 30, 2020\nBatteries and solar panels $ 1,819,398 $ -\nSupplies and other 853,346 247,500\nTotal inventory $ 2,672,744 $ 247,500\nThe Company has presented inventory amounting to $247,500 separate from Prepaid and other current assets to Inventory as of September 30, 2020.\nPrepaid expense and other current assets\nThe Company records a prepaid expense for costs paid but not yet incurred. Those expected to be incurred within one year are recognized and shown as a short-term pre-paid expense. Any costs expected to be incurred outside of one year would be considered other long term assets.\nOther current assets are assets that consist of deposits and interest receivable. Deposits and interest we expect to receive within one year are shown as short-term. Those we expect to receive outside of one year are shown as other long term assets.\nInvestment securities\nInvestment securities include debt securities and equity securities. Debt securities are classified as available for sale (\u201cAFS\u201d) and are reported as an asset in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at their estimated fair value. As the fair values of AFS debt securities change, the changes are reported net of income tax as an element of OCI, except for other-than-temporarily-impaired securities. When AFS debt securities are sold, the unrealized gains or losses are reclassified from OCI to non-interest income. Securities classified as AFS are securities that the Company intends to hold for an indefinite period of time, but not necessarily to maturity. Any decision to sell a security classified as AFS would be based on various factors, including significant movements in interest rates, changes in the maturity mix of the Company\u2019s assets and liabilities, liquidity needs, decline in credit quality, and regulatory capital considerations.\nInterest income is recognized based on the coupon rate and increased by accretion of discounts earned or decreased by the amortization of premiums paid over the contractual life of the security.\nFor individual debt securities where the Company either intends to sell the security or more likely than not will not recover all of its amortized cost, OTTI (other than temporary impairment) is recognized in earnings equal to the entire difference between the security's cost basis and its fair value at the balance sheet date. For individual debt securities for which a credit loss has been recognized in earnings, interest accruals and amortization and accretion of premiums and discounts are suspended when the credit loss is recognized. Interest received after accruals have been suspended is recognized in income on a cash basis.\nThe Company holds investments in both publicly held and privately held equity securities. However, as described in Note 1, the Company is primarily doing business of in the digital currency mining sector and alternative energy sector, and not in the business of investing in securities.\nPrivately held equity securities are recorded at cost and adjusted for observable transactions for same or similar investments of the issuer (referred to as the measurement alternative) or impairment. All gains and losses on privately held equity securities, realized or unrealized, are recorded through gains or losses on equity securities on the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss.\nPublicly held equity securities are based on fair value accounting with unrealized gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value reflected as unrealized gains or losses on equity securities in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\nConcentration Risk\nAt times throughout the year, the Company may maintain cash balances in certain bank accounts in excess of FDIC limits. The cash balance, in excess of the FDIC limits was $17,790,327 and $2,876,202 for periods ended September 30, 2021 and September 30, 2020, respectively. The accounts offered by custodians of the Company\u2019s bitcoin are not insured by the FDIC. The fair market value of bitcoin held in accounts covered by FDIC limits was $27,554,031 and $0 for the periods ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts and believes it is not exposed to any significant credit risk in these accounts.\nThe Company has certain customers and vendors who individually represented 10% or more of the Company\u2019s revenue or capital expenditures. (see Note 16 for details)\nLeases\nIn accordance with ASC 842, the Company assesses whether an arrangement contains a lease at contract inception. When an arrangement contains a lease, the Company categorize leases with contractual terms longer than twelve months as either operating or finance. Finance leases are generally those leases that allow us to substantially utilize or pay for the entire asset over its estimated life. Assets acquired under finance leases are recorded in \u201cFixed Assets, net.\u201d All other leases are categorized as operating leases.\nThe Company records right-of use (\"ROU\") assets and lease obligations for its finance and operating leases, which are initially recognized based on the discounted future lease payments over the term of the lease. As the rate implicit in the Company's leases is not easily determinable, the Company\u2019s applicable incremental borrowing rate is used in calculating the present value of the sum of the lease payments.\nLease term is defined as the non-cancelable period of the lease plus any options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise the option. The Company has elected not to recognize ROU asset and lease obligations for its short-term leases, which are defined as leases with an initial term of 12 months or less.\nSome leases include multiple year renewal options. The Company\u2019s decision to exercise these renewal options is based on an assessment of its current business needs and market factors at the time of the renewal. Currently, the Company has no leases for which the option to renew is reasonably certain and therefore, options to renew were not factored into the calculation of its right of use asset and lease liability as of September 30, 2021.\nFor all classes of underlying assets, the Company has elected to not separate lease from non-lease components.\nWarranty Liability\nThe Company establishes warranty liability reserves to provide for estimated future expenses as a result of installation and product defects, product recalls and litigation incidental to the Company\u2019s business. Liability estimates are determined based on management\u2019s judgment, considering such factors as historical experience, the likely current cost of corrective action, manufacturers and subcontractors participation in sharing the cost of corrective action, consultations with third party experts such as engineers, and discussions with the Company\u2019s general counsel and outside counsel retained to handle specific product liability cases. The Company\u2019s manufacturers and service providers currently provide substantial warranties between ten to twenty-five years with full reimbursement to replace and install replacement parts. While it is probable that the Company will incur costs associated with future warranty claims, the Company cannot reasonably estimate the loss of future warranty claims. Thus, the loss on warranty claims will be charged to the income of the period in which the loss can be reasonably estimated and shall not be charged retroactively to an earlier period, in accordance with the provisions of ASC 450. There were no warranty costs and associated liabilities as of September 30, 2021 and September 30, 2020.\nStock -based compensation\nThe Company follows the guidelines in FASB Codification Topic ASC 718-10 Compensation-Stock Compensation, which requires companies to measure the cost of employee and non-employee services received in exchange for an award of an equity instrument based on the grant-date fair value of the award. Stock-based compensation expense for stock options is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. The Company may issue compensatory shares for services including, but not limited to, executive, management, accounting, operations, corporate communication, financial and administrative consulting services. The Company determines the grant date fair value of the options using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. For discussion of accounting for RSUs, please refer Note 13 - Stock-Based Compensation.\nEarnings (loss) per share\nThe Company reports earnings (loss) per share in accordance with FASB ASC 260-10 \u201cEarnings Per Share,\u201d which provides for calculation of \u201cbasic\u201d and \u201cdiluted\u201d earnings per share. Basic earnings per share includes no dilution and is computed by dividing net income or loss available to common stockholders by the weighted average common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share reflect the potential dilution of securities that could share in the earnings of an entity. The calculation of diluted net loss per share gives effect to common stock equivalents; however, potential common shares are excluded if their effect is anti-dilutive. As of September 30, 2021 and 2020, there were 2,173,578 shares and 1,577,013 shares, respectively, issuable upon exercise of outstanding options warrants and restricted stock units, as well as 5,250,000 shares issuable upon preferred stock conversions, that were excluded from the current and prior period calculations of diluted net loss per share as their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive to the Company\u2019s net loss.\nProperty and equipment\nIn accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board ASC 360-10, \"Property, Plant and Equipment\u201d the carrying value of property and equipment, and other long-lived assets is reviewed on a regular basis for the existence of facts or circumstances that may suggest impairment. The Company recognizes impairment when the sum of the expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset. Impairment losses, if any, are measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over its estimated fair value. During the year ended September 30, 2021 and September 30, 2020 the Company did not record an impairment expense. Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Construction in progress is the construction or development of assets that has not yet been placed in service for its intended use. Depreciation for machinery and equipment, mining equipment, buildings, furniture and fixtures and leasehold improvements commences once they are ready for its intended use. Land is not depreciated.\nDepreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset as follows:\nUseful life (years)\nBuilding\nMachinery and equipment - 10\nMining equipment - 15\nLeasehold improvements Shorter of estimated lease term or 5 years\nFurniture and fixtures - 5\nBusiness combinations, Intangible Assets and Goodwill\nThe Company accounts for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations, where the total purchase price is allocated to the identified assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. The purchase price is allocated using the information currently available, and may be adjusted, up to one year from acquisition date, after obtaining more information regarding, among other things, asset valuations, liabilities assumed and revisions to preliminary estimates. The difference between the purchase price, including any contingent consideration, and the fair value of net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Contingent consideration transferred is initially recognized at fair value. Contingent consideration classified as a liability or an asset is remeasured to fair value each period until settlement, with changes recognized in profit or loss. Contingent consideration classified as equity is not remeasured. Acquisition-related costs are recognized separately from the acquisition and are expensed as incurred.\nThe Company reviews its indefinite lived intangibles and goodwill for impairment annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value and may not be recoverable. In accordance with its policies, the Company performed an assessment of indefinite lived intangibles and goodwill as of the year end September 30, 2021. (See Note 6 for impairment related to indefinite lived intangibles and goodwill).\n2021 Goodwill Impairment analysis\nIn completing the 2021 annual goodwill impairment analysis, the Company elected to perform both qualitative and quantitative assessments for our goodwill. The assessments involve comparing the carrying value of the entity, including goodwill, to its estimated fair value. In accordance with ASU 2017-04, a goodwill impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit. In determining the fair value for which the quantitative assessment was performed, the Company obtained an independent evaluation of goodwill. The independent evaluation agency has utilized the income approach to test for goodwill impairment. The income approach is a valuation technique under which we estimate future cash flows using the financial forecast from the perspective of an unrelated market participant. Using historical trending and internal forecasting techniques, revenue is projected and applied to fixed and variable cost experience rates to arrive at the future cash flows. A terminal value was then applied to the projected cash flow stream. Future estimated cash flows were discounted to their present value to calculate the estimated fair value. The discount rate used was the value-weighted average of our estimated cost of capital derived using both known and estimated customary market metrics. In determining the estimated fair value, several factors were estimated, including projected operating results, growth rates, economic conditions, anticipated future cash flows and the discount rate.\nThe assessment indicated that impairment of goodwill was necessary. Based on the assessment for impairment, the Company reported an impairment expense of goodwill of $5,723,388 for the year ended September 30, 2021. There was no impairment expense for the year ended September 30, 2020.\nThe following table reflects segment wise goodwill activity for the years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively: 2.

Digital currencies are classified as indefinite-lived intangible assets in accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other, and are accounted for in connection with the Company\u2019s revenue recognition policy detailed above and in Footnote 2 - Significant Accounting Policies. An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is not amortized but assessed for impairment annually, or more frequently, when events or changes in circumstances occur indicating that it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived asset is impaired. Quantitative impairment exists when the carrying amount exceeds its fair value, which is measured using the quoted price of the digital currency at the time its fair value is being measured in accordance with ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement. Quoted prices are obtained from the principal market. To the extent an impairment loss is recognized, the loss establishes the new cost basis of the asset. Subsequent reversal of impairment losses is not permitted as per ASC 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other.\nDigital currencies earned by the Company through its mining activities are included within operating activities on the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows. The sales of digital currencies are included within investing activities in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows and any realized gains or losses from such sales are included in other income (expense) in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. The Company accounts for its gains or losses in accordance with the first in first out (\u201cFIFO\u201d) method of accounting.\nThe following table presents the activities of the digital currencies for the year ended September 30, 2021:\nAmount ($)\nBalance as on September 30, 2019 -\nAdditions to digital currencies -\nSale of digital currencies -\nBalance as on September 30, 2020 -\nAdditions of digital currencies 38,846,633\nSale of digital currencies (11,443,132)\nRealized gain on sale of digital currencies 3,104,378\nDigital currencies issued for services (296,593)\nImpairment loss (6,608,076)\nBalance as on September 30, 2021 23,603,210\nSoftware Development Costs\nThe Company capitalizes software development costs under guidance of ASC 985-20 Costs of Software to be Sold, Leased or Marketed for our mPulse, Canvas & Plaid platforms and under ASC 350-40 Internal Use Software. Software development costs include payments made to independent software developers under development agreements, as well as direct costs incurred for internally developed products. Software development costs are capitalized once the technological feasibility of a product is established and such costs are determined to be recoverable. Technological feasibility of a product requires both technical\ndesign documentation and infrastructure design documentation, or the completed and tested product design and a working model. Significant management judgments and estimates are utilized in the assessment of when technological feasibility is established, and the evaluation is performed on a product-by-product basis. For products where proven technology exists, this may occur early in the development cycle. Prior to a product's release, if and when we believe capitalized costs are not recoverable, we expense the amounts as part of \"Product development.\" Capitalized costs for products that are cancelled or are expected to be abandoned are charged to \"Product development\" in the period of cancellation.\nCommencing upon a product's release, capitalized software development costs are amortized to \"Cost of revenues software amortization\" based on the ratio of current revenues to total projected revenues for the specific product, generally resulting in an amortization period of seven years for our current product offerings. In recognition of the uncertainties involved in estimating future revenue, amortization will never be less than straight-line amortization of the products remaining estimated economic life.\nWe evaluate the future recoverability of capitalized software development costs on a quarterly basis. For products that have been released in prior periods, the primary evaluation criterion is the actual performance of the software platform to which the costs relate. For products that are scheduled to be released in future periods, recoverability is evaluated based on the expected performance of the specific products to which the costs relate. Criteria used to evaluate expected product performance include: historical performance of comparable products developed with comparable technology; market performance of comparable software; orders for the product prior to its release; pending contracts and general market conditions.\nSignificant management judgments and estimates are utilized in assessing the recoverability of capitalized costs. In evaluating the recoverability of capitalized costs, the assessment of expected product performance utilizes forecasted sales amounts and estimates of additional costs to be incurred. If revised forecasted or actual product sales are less than the originally forecasted amounts utilized in the initial recoverability analysis, the net realizable value may be lower than originally estimated in any given quarter, which could result in an impairment charge. Material differences may result in the amount and timing of expenses for any period if matters resolve in a manner that is inconsistent with management's expectations. If an impairment occurs the reduced amount of the capitalized software costs that have been written down to the net realizable value at the close of each annual fiscal period will be considered the cost for subsequent accounting purposes.\nFair Value Measurement of financial instruments, derivative asset and contingent consideration\nThe carrying value of cash, accounts payable and accrued expenses, and debt approximate their fair values because of the short-term nature of these instruments. Management believes the Company is not exposed to significant interest or credit risks arising from these financial instruments.\nFair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Valuation techniques used to measure fair value maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The Company utilizes a fair value hierarchy based on three levels of inputs, of which the first two are considered observable and the last unobservable.\nLevel 1 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. These are typically obtained from real-time quotes for transactions in active exchange markets involving identical assets.\nLevel 2 Quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets; quoted prices included for identical or similar assets and liabilities that are not active; and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets. These are typically obtained from readily-available pricing sources for comparable instruments.\nLevel 3 Unobservable inputs, where there is little or no market activity for the asset or liability. These inputs reflect the reporting entity\u2019s own beliefs about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, based on the best information available in the circumstances.\nThe following table presents the Company\u2019s financial instruments that are measured and recorded at fair value on the Company\u2019s balance sheets on a recurring basis, and their level within the fair value hierarchy as of September 30, 2021 and September 30, 2020:\nSeptember 30, 2021:\nAmount ($) Level Level Level\nDerivative asset 4,905,656 - - 4,905,656\nInvestment in equity security 10,772 10,772 - -\nInvestment in debt security 494,608 - - 494,608\nContingent cash consideration 820,802 - - 820,802\nTotal\n6,231,838 10,772 - 6,221,066\nSeptember 30, 2020:\nAmount ($) Level Level Level\nDerivative asset 2,115,269 - - 2,115,269\nInvestment in equity security 210,000 210,000 - -\nInvestment in debt security 500,000 - - 500,000\nContingent cash consideration 750,000 - - 750,000\nTotal\n3,575,269 210,000 - 3,365,269\nIncome taxes\nThe Company\u2019s calculation of its tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in various taxing jurisdictions. The Company recognizes tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on management\u2019s estimate of whether it is more likely than not that additional taxes will be required. The Company had no uncertain tax positions as of September 30, 2021 and 2020.\nDeferred income taxes are recognized in the consolidated financial statements for the tax consequences in future years of differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates. Temporary differences arise from net operating losses, differences in depreciation methods of archived images, and property and equipment, stock-based and other compensation, and other accrued expenses. A valuation allowance is established when it is determined that it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nThe application of tax laws and regulations is subject to legal and factual interpretation, judgment and uncertainty. Tax laws and regulations themselves are subject to change as a result of changes in fiscal policy, changes in legislation, the evolution of regulations and court rulings. Therefore, the actual liability for U.S., or the various state jurisdictions, may be materially different from managements estimates, which could result in the need to record additional tax liabilities or potentially reverse previously recorded tax liabilities. Interest and penalties are included in tax expense.\nThe Company includes interest and penalties arising from the underpayment of income taxes in the statements of operation in the provision for income taxes. As of September 30, 2021 and 2020, the Company had no accrued interest or penalties related to uncertain tax positions.\nReclassifications\nCertain prior year amounts have been reclassified for consistency with the current year presentation. These reclassifications had no effect on the reported results of operations or net assets of the Company and are as follows:\n\u2022 The Company has reclassified interest receivable on investment in debt securities from Accounts Receivable to Prepaid expense and other current assets amounting to $399,863 and $187,562 as of September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\u2022 The revenue presentation is updated to remain consistent with the business segments of the Company. In 2020, revenues were categorized into hardware and software related sales. In 2021, the Company has realigned its focus and accordingly revenue is reported based upon business segments of digital currency mining, energy and others.\t\n\u2022 Product development expense for the year ended September 30, 2020 has been reclassified to be included in depreciation and amortization expense.\nCommitments and contingencies\nThe Company is subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies and loss recoveries, such as legal proceedings and claims arising out of its business. The Company considers the likelihood of loss or impairment of an asset, or the incurrence of a liability, as well as the Company\u2019s ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss, in determining loss contingencies. An estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company regularly evaluates current information available with its external and internal counsel to determine whether an accrual is required, an accrual should be adjusted or a range of possible loss should be disclosed.\nSegment Reporting\nOperating segments are defined as components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is available and evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker, or decision-making group, in deciding the method to allocate resources and assess performance. To better align with the Company\u2019s strategic objectives, the Company optimized its reportable segments down to two, (1) Digital Currency Mining Segment and (2) Energy Segment; by eliminating the digital agency segment. Results associated with that component are now being reported under other revenue and eliminations.\nRecently issued accounting pronouncements\nIn October 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers, which requires contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination to be recognized and measured by the acquirer on the acquisition date in accordance with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, as if it had originated the contracts. Under the current business combinations guidance, such assets and liabilities are recognized by the acquirer at fair value on the acquisition date. This new guidance is effective for the Company for its fiscal year beginning February 1, 2023 and interim periods within that fiscal year, and early adoption is permitted. The Company is evaluating its potential impact but does not expect the new standard to have a material impact on the Company's results of operations or cash flows.\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting and issued subsequent amendments to the initial guidance (collectively, \u201cTopic 848\u201d). Topic 848 became effective immediately and expires on December 21, 2022. Topic 848 allows eligible contracts that are modified to be accounted for as a continuation of those contracts, permits companies to preserve their hedging accounting during the transition period and enables companies to make a one-time election to transfer or sell held-to-maturity debt securities that are affected by rate reform. Topic 848 provides optional expedients and exceptions for contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions that reference the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) or another reference rate expected to be discontinued because of reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. The adoption of ASU 2020-04 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company\u2019s financial statements or disclosures.\nThe Company adopted ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments on October 1, 2020 (\u201cASU 2016-13\u201d). ASU 2016-13 requires entities to use a new forward-looking \u201cexpected loss\u201d model that reflects expected credit losses, including credit losses related to trade receivables, and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates, which generally will result in the earlier recognition of allowances for losses. As the Company was a Smaller Reporting Company at the time of issuance of the ASU, the Company expects to adopt the ASU effective October 1, 2023, including the interim periods within the fiscal year. In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU2020-06, \u201cDebt - Debt with Conversion and Other Options (subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entity\u2019s Own Equity (subtopic 815-40),\u201d which reduces the number of accounting models in ASC 470-20 that require separate accounting for embedded conversion features. As a result, a convertible debt instrument will be accounted for as a single liability measured at its amortized cost as long as no other features require bifurcation and recognition as derivatives. By removing those separation models, the effective interest rate of convertible debt instruments will be closer to the coupon interest rate. Further, the diluted net income per share calculation for convertible instruments will require the Company to use the if-converted method. The treasury stock method should no longer be used to calculate diluted net income per share for convertible instruments. The amendment will be effective for the Company with annual periods beginning January 1, 2022 and early adoption is permitted. The adoption of ASU 2020-06 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company\u2019s financial statements or disclosures.\nIn August 2020, the FASB issued Account Standard Update (\u201cASU\u201d) 2020-06, \u201cDebt - Debt with Conversion and Other Options (subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entity\u2019s Own Equity (subtopic 815-40),\u201d which reduces the number of accounting models in ASC 470-20 that require separate accounting for embedded conversion features. As a result, a convertible debt instrument will be accounted for as a single liability measured at its amortized cost as long as no other features require bifurcation and recognition as derivatives.

The adoption of ASU 2020-06 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company\u2019s financial statements or disclosures.\n3. ACQUISITIONS\nSOLAR WATT SOLUTIONS, INC.\nOn February 23, 2021, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the \u201cSWS Merger Agreement\u201d) with Solar Watt Solutions, Inc. (\u201cSWS\u201d) and its owners (the \u201cSellers\u201d). The Company accounted for the acquisition of SWS as an acquisition of a business under ASC 805 - Business Combination.\nAt the closing on February 24, 2021, SWS became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. In exchange, the Company issued (i) 477,703 shares of restricted common stock with a deemed value of $15,640,000 calculated based on the five-day average price to the Sellers, of which (a) 167,685 shares with a deemed value of $5,490,000 would be fully earned on closing, and (b) an additional 310,018 shares with a deemed fair value of $10,150,000 were issued to an escrow agent and only earned by Sellers, subject to holdback pending Sellers\u2019 satisfaction of certain future milestones with all such shares subject to a lock up of no less than 180 days and a leak out of no more than 10% of average daily trading value of the prior 30 days for a period of 36 months following the closing, and (ii) up to $3,850,000 in cash to the Sellers, minus the Sellers\u2019 debt, minus the difference between the Actual Amount and Expected Amount consisting of: (A) $1,350,000 (no changes post acquisition date) in cash payable on a pro rata basis to Sellers at closing, less payment of $500,000 (no changes post acquisition date) to settle Sellers\u2019 debt at closing, which includes (I) $200,000 (no changes post acquisition date) in cash was held back by the Company to satisfy potential damages from indemnification claims and any amounts owed pursuant to post-closing adjustments, (II) an additional $100,000 (no changes post acquisition date) in cash was held back by the Company to satisfy any amounts owed pursuant to post-closing adjustments, and (B) up to $2,500,000 (fair valued at $155,000 at acquisition date) in cash held back by the Company and only payable pro rata to Sellers upon meeting certain future milestones and subject to satisfaction of any amounts owing rom SWS to the Company resulting from damages required to be indemnified under the SWS Merger Agreement.\nThe Company determined the fair value of the consideration given to the sellers of SWS in connection with the transaction in accordance with ASC 820 was as follows:\nConsideration: Fair Value\nCash $ 1,350,000\nContingent consideration 155,000\n310,018 shares of common stock as contingent equity consideration $ 533,002\n167,685 shares of common stock 4,649,905\nTotal Consideration $ 6,687,907\nPurchase Price Allocation Preliminary Allocation at Acquisition Date Adjustments to Fair Value Final Allocation at Acquisition Date\nCustomer List $ 5,122,733 $ (4,932,733 ) $ 190,000\nGoodwill 1,642,409 5,178,126 6,820,535\nOther Assets and Liabilities assumed, net (77,235 ) (245,393 ) (322,628)\nTotal $ 6,687,907 $ - $ 6,687,907\nThe goodwill recorded as result of the acquisition represents the strategic benefits of growing the Company\u2019s service portfolio and the expected revenue growth from increased market penetration. Acquired goodwill is not deductible for income tax purposes. The total purchase price was allocated to identifiable assets deemed acquired, and liabilities assumed, based on their estimated fair values.\nIn connection with the preparation of our financial statements, the Company determined that the accounting treatment of the contingent consideration as reported in the March 31, 2021 and June 30, 2021 consolidated financial statements needed to be revised. Specifically, the contingent cash consideration liability recorded at acquisition date of $2,500,000 should be adjusted to $155,000 due to probability of non-satisfaction of future milestones. As a result, the contingent cash consideration liability recorded at acquisition date of $2,500,000 was adjusted to $155,000 due to probability of non-satisfaction of future milestones. The Company also estimated that based upon the milestones, only 19,221 contingent shares will be earned out of the 310,018 total contingent shares, and as a result, the Company adjusted the contingent stock consideration to $533,002. The Company assessed the materiality of these adjustments and determined that these were not material to previously issued financial statements for the quarters ended March 31, 2021 and June 30, 2021.\nThe immaterial impacts of these adjustments for the quarters ended March 31, 2021 and June 30, 2021 are as follows:\nCondensed Consolidated Balance Sheet (unaudited)\nMarch 31, 2021 June 30, 2021\nAs Reported ($) Change ($) As Revised ($) As Reported ($) Change ($) As Revised ($)\nGoodwill 32,034,559 (10,408,798) 21,625,761 31,797,564 (10,408,798) 21,388,766\nTotal assets 292,612,596 (10,408,798) 282,203,798 297,488,821 (10,408,798) 287,080,023\nContingent consideration - Current 2,416,667 (1,319,751) 1,096,916 650,000 (855) 649,145\nTotal current liabilities 7,340,445 (1,319,751) 6,020,694 11,910,017 (855) 11,909,162\nContingent consideration - Non Current 833,333 (833,333) - 2,600,000 (2,000,000) 600,000\nTotal Liabilities 8,892,137 (2,153,084) 6,739,053 15,693,207 (2,000,855) 13,692,352\nAdditional paid-in capital 400,032,436 (8,063,798) 391,968,638 414,783,896 (8,063,798) 406,720,098\nTotal Stockholders' equity 283,720,459 (8,255,714) 275,464,745 281,795,614 (8,407,943) 273,387,671\nTotal Liabilities and Stockholders' equity 292,612,596 (10,408,798) 282,203,798 297,488,821 (10,408,798) 287,080,023\nCondensed Consolidated Statement of operations (unaudited)\nFor the Three Months Ended March 31, 2021 For the Three Months Ended June 30, 2021\nAs Reported ($) Change ($) As Revised ($) As Reported ($) Change ($) As Revised ($)\nChange in fair value of contingent consideration - (191,916) (191,916) - (152,229) (152,229)\nTotal other income (expense) 9,897,012 (191,916) 9,705,096 (2,058,948) (152,229) (2,211,177)\nNet Income/(loss) 7,400,040 (191,916) 7,208,124 (16,677,127) (152,229) (16,829,356)\nNet Income (loss) attributable to the Company\u2019s common shareholders 7,222,535 (191,916) 7,030,619 (16,677,127) (152,229) (16,829,356)\nThe amortization period for customer list is estimated to be 1.5 years. The Company estimated the fair value of the identified customer list using a discounted cash flow model. These fair value measurements were based on significant inputs not observable in the market and thus represent a Level 3 measurement. Key assumptions include the level and timing of expected incremental future cash flows over its remaining useful life, and discount rates the Company believe to be consistent with the inherent risks associated with customer list, which is 14%. The Company believes the level and timing of expected future cash flows appropriately reflects market participant assumptions.\nThe contingent cash consideration was re-measured to $320,802 at September 30, 2021. The company estimates the total contingent cash consideration to be between $320,000 and $550,000 based on the range of possible outcomes. In addition, the Company estimates the total stock consideration to be between $1,100,000 and $1,900,000 based on the range of possible outcomes.\nNet sales and net loss of this business included in the Company\u2019s consolidated results of operations in fiscal year 2021 were approximately $3,806,007 and $811,727, respectively.\nATL DATA CENTERS, LLC\nOn December 9, 2020, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the \u201cATL Merger\u201d) with ATL Data Centers LLC (\u201cATL\u201d) and its members. The Company accounted for the acquisition of ATL as an acquisition\nof a business under ASC 805 - Business Combination.\nAt the closing, ATL became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. In exchange, the Company issued 1,618,285 shares of restricted common stock to the selling members of ATL, of which: (i) 642,309 shares were fully earned on closing, and (ii) an additional 975,976 shares were issued and held in escrow, subject to holdback pending satisfaction of certain indemnification claims and future milestones, with all such shares subject to a lock up of no less than 180 days and a leak out of no more than 10% of the average daily trading value of the prior 30 days.\nThe Company determined the fair value of the consideration given to the sellers of SWS in connection with the transaction in accordance with ASC 820 was as follows:\nConsideration\nPreliminary Allocation at Acquisition Date\nAdjustments to Fair Value\nFinal Allocation at Acquisition Date\n642,309 shares of common stock\n$ 8,407,826\n-\n$ 8,407,826\n975,976 shares of common stock - held in escrow\n12,775,525\n-\n12,775,525\nTotal Consideration\n$ 21,183,351\n-\n$ 21,183,351\nOf the 975,976 shares held in escrow, 515,724 shares were released to the selling members of ATL and 68,194 shares were returned to the Company and canceled due to nonsatisfaction of certain indemnification claims during the year ended September 30, 2021. The remaining 392,058 shares held in escrow consist of 72,989 shares subject to holdback pending satisfaction of further indemnification claims and 319,069 shares subject to satisfaction of future milestones.\nIn connection with the return of the 68,194 shares held in escrow that were cancelled due to the non-satisfaction of certain indemnification claims, total consideration and the related goodwill, decreased by $892,659 during the year ended September 30, 2021.\nThe consideration remitted in connection with the ATL Merger is subject to adjustment based on post-closing adjustments to closing cash, indebtedness, and transaction expenses of ATL within 90 days of closing. The Company also assumed approximately $6.9 million in debts of ATL at closing. As part of the transaction costs, the Company issued 41,708 shares of common stock for an aggregate value of $545,916 to the broker which were expensed upon issuance of the shares.\nPurchase Price Allocation Preliminary Allocation at Acquisition Date Adjustments to Fair Value Final Allocation at Acquisition Date\nStrategic Contract $ 7,457,970 $ 2,342,000 $ 9,799,970\nGoodwill 14,205,245 (1,264,167 ) 12,941,078\nOther Assets and Liabilities assumed, net (479,864 ) (1,077,833 ) (1,557,697)\nTotal $ 21,183,351 $ - $ 21,183,351\nThe Company made measurement period adjustments, primarily to strategic contract and goodwill, to better reflect the facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date.\nThe goodwill recorded as a result of the acquisition represents the strategic benefits of growing the Company\u2019s service portfolio and the expected revenue growth from increased mcarket penetration. Acquired goodwill is not deductible for income tax purposes. The total purchase price was allocated to identifiable assets deemed acquired, and liabilities assumed, based on their estimated fair values.\nThe strategic contract relates to supply of a critical input to our digital currency mining business. The other assets and liabilities assumed include $5.67 million of digital currency mining equipment and $5.475 million of notes payable related to this equipment, which was settled by the Company during the year ended September 30, 2021. In connection with the acquisition, the Company had acquired an operating lease related to a rental building, which had a purchase option associated with the lease agreement. The Company exercised the purchase option to buy the property in May 2021 and, as a result, terminated the lease.\nThe amortization period for strategic contracts is estimated to be 5 years.

INCOME TAXES\nThe Company provides for income taxes under FASB ASC 740, Accounting for Income Taxes. FASB ASC 740 requires the use of an asset and liability approach in accounting for income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities and the tax rates in effect currently.\nFASB ASC 740 requires the reduction of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance, if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In the Company\u2019s opinion, it is uncertain whether they will generate sufficient taxable income in the future to fully utilize the net deferred tax asset. Accordingly, a valuation allowance equal to the deferred tax asset has been recorded. The total deferred tax asset is approximately $38.8 million as of September 30, 2021 which is calculated by multiplying a 21% estimated tax rate by the cumulative net operating loss (\u201cNOL\u201d) of approximately $184.6 million.\nDue to the enactment of the Tax Reform Act of 2017, we have calculated our deferred tax assets using an estimated corporate tax rate of 21%. U.S. Tax codes and laws may be subject to further reform or adjustment which may have a material impact to the Company\u2019s deferred tax assets and liabilities.\nThe significant components of the Company's deferred tax assets and liabilities as of September 30, 2021 and 2020 are as follows:\nAs of September 30,\nCumulative tax net operating losses (in millions)\n$ 184.6 $ 52.5\nDeferred tax asset (in millions)\n$ 38.8 $ 11.0\nValuation allowance (in millions)\n(38.8 )\n(11.0)\nCurrent taxes payable\n-\n-\nIncome tax expense\n$ - $ -\nAs of September 30, 2021, and 2020, the Company had gross federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $184.6 million and $52.5 million, respectively.\nThe Company plans to file its U.S. federal return for the year ended September 30, 2021 upon the issuance of this filing. Upon filing of the tax return for the year ended September 30, 2021 the actual deferred tax asset and associated valuation allowance available to the Company may differ from managements estimates. The tax years 2015-2019 remained open to examination for federal income tax purposes by the major tax jurisdictions to which the Company is subject. No tax returns are currently under examination by any tax authorities.\n15. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nThe Company has purchase commitments that are cancellable of approximately $144.04 million related to purchase of miners as of September 30, 2021, and the Company has paid $85.11 million towards these commitments as of the end of this period.

Pursuant to the terms of the purchase agreement, additional shares of the Company\u2019s common stock valued at up to $750,000 were issuable if GridFabric achieves certain revenue and product release milestones. On September 30, 2021, the contingent consideration was re-measured to $500,000.\nSubsequent to September 30, 2021, the Company settled all contingent consideration due to GridFabric resulting in a payment of 8,404 shares of common stock valued at $150,000.\nSolar Watt Solutions: On February 24, 2021, the Company acquired Solar Watt Solutions, Inc.

The contingent cash consideration was re-measured to $320,802 at September 30, 2021.\nLegal contingencies\nFrom time to time we may be subject to litigation. Risks associated with legal liability are difficult to assess and quantify, and their existence and magnitude can remain unknown for significant periods of time. We have acquired liability insurance to reduce such risk exposure to the Company. Despite the measures taken, such policies may not cover future litigation, or the damages claimed may exceed our coverage which could result in contingent liabilities.\nBishins v. CleanSpark, Inc. et al.\nOn January 20, 2021, Scott Bishins (\u201cBishins\u201d), individually, and on behalf of all others similarly situated (together, the \u201cClass\u201d), filed a class action complaint (the \u201cClass Complaint\u201d) in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against the Company, its Chief Executive Officer, Zachary Bradford (\u201cBradford\u201d), and its Chief Financial Officer, Lori Love (\u201cLove\u201d) (the \u201cClass Action\u201d). The Class Complaint alleges that, between December 31, 2020 and January 14, 2021, the Company, Bradford, and Love \u201cfailed to disclose to investors: (1) that the Company had overstated its customer and contract figures; (2) that several of the Company\u2019s recent acquisitions involved undisclosed related party transactions; and (3) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants\u2019 positive statements about the Company\u2019s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis.\u201d (the \u201cClass Allegations\u201d). The Class Complaint seeks: (a) certification of the Class, (b) an award of compensatory damages to the Class, and (c) an award of reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the Class in the litigation. To date, no class has been certified in the Class Action. Currently, there is a pending motion to appoint lead class plaintiff, at which point dispositive motions may be filed.\nAlthough the ultimate outcome of the Class Action cannot be determined with certainty, the Company stands behind all of its prior statements and disclosures and believes that the claims raised in the Class Complaint are entirely without merit. The Company intends to both defend itself vigorously against these claims and to vigorously prosecute any counterclaims.\nNotwithstanding the Class Allegations\u2019 lack of merit, however, the Class Action may distract the Company and cost the Company\u2019s management time, effort and expense to defend against the claims made in the Class Complaint. Notwithstanding the Company\u2019s belief that the Company and its management have complied with all of their obligations under applicable securities regulations, no assurance can be given as to the outcome of the Class Action, and in the event the Company does not prevail in such action, the Company, its business, financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected.\nCiceri, derivatively on behalf of CleanSpark, Inc., v. Bradford, Love, Schultz, Beynon, McNeill, and Wood (consolidated with Perna, derivatively on behalf of CleanSpark, Inc., v. Bradford, Love, Schultz, Beynon, McNeill, and Wood)\nOn May 26, 2021, Andrea Ciceri (\u201cCiceri\u201d), derivatively on behalf of CleanSpark, Inc., filed a verified shareholder derivative action (the \u201cCiceri Derivative Action\u201d) in the United States District Court in the District of Nevada against Chief Executive Officer, Zachary Bradford (\u201cBradford\u201d), Chief Financial Officer, Lori Love (\u201cLove\u201d) and Directors Matthew Schultz, Roger Beynon, Larry McNeill and Tom Wood (Bradford, Love and Directors collectively referred to as \u201cDefendants.\u201d) On June 22, 2021, Mark Perna (\u201cPerna\u201d) filed a verified shareholder derivative action (the \u201cPerna Derivative Action\u201d) in the same Court against the same Defendants making substantially similar allegations. On June 29, 2021, the court consolidated the Ciceri Derivative Action with the Perna Derivative Action in accordance with a stipulation among the parties (the consolidated case referred to as the \u201cDerivative Action\u201d). The Derivative Action alleges that Defendants: (1) made materially false and misleading public statements about the Company\u2019s business and prospects; (2) did not maintain adequate internal controls; and (3) did not disclose several related party transactions benefitting insiders, questionable uses of corporate assets, and excessive compensation. The claims asserted against all Defendants include breach of fiduciary duties, unjust enrichment, abuse of control, gross mismanagement, and waste of corporate assets. A claim for contribution under Sections 10(b) and 21D of the Securities and Exchange Act is asserted against only Bradford and Love. The Derivative Action seeks declaratory relief, monetary damages, and imposition of adequate corporate governance and internal controls. Plaintiffs were given the opportunity to submit an Amended Complaint by November 25, 2021, but elected not to. Defendants\u2019 Motion to Dismiss will be due by January 20, 2022.\nAlthough the ultimate outcome of the Derivative Action cannot be determined with certainty, the Company stands behind all of its prior statements and disclosures, and believes that the claims raised in that case are entirely without merit. The Company intends to both defend itself vigorously against these claims and to vigorously prosecute any counterclaims.\nNotwithstanding the Derivative Action\u2019s lack of merit, however, it may distract the Company and cost the Company\u2019s management time, effort and expense to defend against the claims.

The agreements have an initial term of five years, during which time the power utilized by the Company will be billed under the Georgia Power Real Time Pricing (\u201cRTP\u201d) rate, where a portion of the usage is priced hourly and another portion is billed at a conventional rate.\nIn addition, the Company agreed to pay Georgia Power a one-time fee of approximately $2.0 million to install additional power equipment on the property.\nMining Equipment Purchase Agreements\nOn October 6 and October 14, 2021, the Company entered into agreements that are cancellable with a mining equipment supplier to purchase an aggregate of 6,750 mining servers.

    "item_9A": "Item 9A. Controls and Procedures\nEVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nIn connection with the preparation of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting as of the end of the period covered by this report (under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer (\u201cCEO\u201d) and Chief Financial Officer (\u201cCFO\u201d). Based on that assessment, our CEO and CFO have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) were not effective due to material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting, as described below. Management\u2019s assessment of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures is expressed at a level of reasonable assurance because management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives.\nMANAGEMENTS REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP and includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions; (2) provide reasonable assurance that our transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with appropriate authorizations; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness for future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. No evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected.\nUnder the supervision of and with the participation of our management, we assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2021, using the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013). We excluded from our assessment the internal control over financial reporting of ATL Data Centers LLC and Solar Watt Solutions, Inc. with total assets of $267.3 million (of which $27.3 million represents goodwill and intangibles included within the scope of the assessment), and total revenues of $43.2 million included in the consolidated financial statements of the Company as of and for the year ended September 30, 2021.As part of our assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2021, management identified the following material weaknesses: (1) the Company did not adequately implement or properly maintain controls over its financial close and reporting process, its process over the recording of energy and other services revenue and its process over the accounting and valuation of certain aspects of business combinations involving significant estimates and (2) the Company did not adequately design and maintain effective general information technology controls over third-party information systems and applications that are relevant to the preparation of the Company\u2019s financial statements:\n\u00b7 Financial Close and Reporting: Controls over financial statement reviews, specific to the appropriate reconciliation of certain balance sheet accounts, were not operating effectively.\no Recording of Revenues for certain non-principal revenue generating subsidiaries: Controls over the recording and processing of revenue for certain non-principal revenue generating entities, specifically, p2kLabs, Inc, GridFabric, LLC and CleanSpark, LLC, lack the level of precision necessary to ensure the completeness and accuracy of revenue recorded.\no Business Combinations: Controls designed to properly consider and evaluate certain aspects of our business combinations and related reporting units did not operate effectively to identify all necessary adjustments made to the purchase price during the valuation process and the related goodwill balances recorded. This includes controls around business combination accounting, specifically as it relates to the valuation of contingent consideration as part of the purchase price underlying the business combinations, as well as the identification of reporting units.\n\u00b7 Information and Technology Controls: Certain individual control deficiencies related to information technology (\u201cIT\u201d) general controls and report reviews aggregate into a material weakness, as follows:\no Certain process-level and IT-dependent controls over user access to IT programs and applications, specifically utilized for hosting services and file storage, were not effective.\no Controls relating to the evaluation of service organization controls reports were not performed over certain third-party service providers to cover the entire fiscal year.\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis\nThese material weaknesses did not result in any identified material misstatements to the financial statements, and there were no changes to previously released financial results. Based on these material weaknesses, management concluded that at September 30, 2021, internal control over financial reporting was not effective.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm, MaloneBailey, LLP has issued an adverse audit report on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2021, which appears on page.\nFollowing identification of the material weaknesses and prior to filing this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we completed substantive procedures for the year ended September 30, 2021. Based on these procedures, management believes that our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our CEO and CFO has certified that, based on their knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this Form 10-K, fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of CleanSpark as of, and for, the periods presented in this Form 10-K. MaloneBailey, LLP has issued an unqualified opinion on our financial statements, which appears on page.\nREMEDIATION\nManagement has been implementing and continues to implement measures designed to ensure that control deficiencies contributing to the material weakness are remediated, such that these controls are designed, implemented, and operating effectively. The remediation actions include the following:\n\u00b7 additional qualified staff were appointed during the year-ended September 30, 2021 and subsequent to year-end to ensure appropriate reviews occur\n\u00b7 the implementation of additional monitoring of controls to improve documentation of internal control procedures\n\u00b7 expanding the management and governance over IT system controls; and\n\u00b7 implementing enhanced process controls around internal user access management including provisioning, removal, and periodic review\nWe believe that these actions will remediate the material weaknesses, once management has performed its assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting including the remedial measures described above. The weaknesses will not be considered remediated, however, until the applicable controls operate for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are operating effectively. We expect that the remediation of these material weaknesses will be completed prior to the end of fiscal year 2022.\nCHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING\nExcept for the material weaknesses identified during the quarter, as of September 30, 2021, and except for the remedial measures described above, there have been no other changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting.\nINHERENT LIMITATIONS ON INTERNAL CONTROLS\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness for future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. No evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected.",
