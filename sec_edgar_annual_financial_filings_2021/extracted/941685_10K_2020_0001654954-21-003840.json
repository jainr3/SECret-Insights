As of March 2021, the global outbreak of COVID-19 continues to rapidly evolve, and the extent to which COVID-19 may impact our business and markets we serve will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, such as the duration of the outbreak, travel restrictions and social distancing in the United States and other countries, business closures or business disruptions, and the effectiveness of actions taken both in the United States and other countries. We are continuing to vigilantly monitor the situation with our primary focus on health and safety of our employees and clients.\nThe Series D Financing\nOn November 12, 2020 and December 23, 2020, the Company consummated private placements of 12,060 shares of its Series D Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share (the \"Series D Preferred\"), resulting in gross proceeds to the Company of $12.06 million, less fees and expenses (the \u201cSeries D Financing\u201d). The gross proceeds include approximately $2.2 million in principal amount due and payable under the terms of certain term loans issued by the Company on September 29, 2020 (\u201cBridge Notes\u201d), which Bridge Notes were converted into Series D Preferred at Closing (the \u201cConversion\u201d). The issuance of the Series D Preferred was made pursuant to securities purchase agreements, dated September 28, 2020 (the \"Purchase Agreement\"), by and between the Company and certain accredited investors (the \"Purchasers\"), for the sale of the Series D Preferred at a purchase price of $1,000 per share of Series D Preferred. The holders of Series D Preferred may voluntarily convert their shares of Series D Preferred into shares of the Company\u2019s Common Stock at any time that is at least ninety days following the issuance date, at the conversion price calculated by dividing the Stated Value by the conversion price of $0.0583 per share of Common Stock, subject to adjustments as set forth in Section 5(e) of the Certificate of Designations, Preferences, and Rights of Series D Convertible Preferred Stock (the \"Series D Certificate\"). Dividends on shares of Series D Preferred will be paid prior to any junior securities, and are to be paid at the rate of 4% of the Stated Value (as defined in the Series D Certificate) per share per annum in the form of shares of Series D Preferred.\nOn the fourth anniversary of the Issuance Date (as defined in the Series D Certificate), or in the event of the consummation of a Change of Control (as defined in the Series D Certificate), if any shares of Series D Preferred are outstanding, then each holder of Series D Preferred shall have the right (the \u201cHolder Redemption Right\u201d), at such holder\u2019s option, to require the Company to redeem all or any portion of such holder\u2019s shares of Series D Preferred at the Liquidation Preference Amount per share of Series D Preferred plus an amount equal to all accrued but unpaid dividends, if any, (such price, the \u201cHolder Redemption Price\u201d), which Holder Redemption Price shall be paid in cash.\nIn connection with the sale of the Series D Preferred, we granted certain registration rights to the Investors with respect to the Conversion Shares and Dividend Shares, pursuant to a Registration Rights Agreement by and among us and the Investors. The registration statement registering the Conversion Shares and Dividend Shares was declared effective by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d) on February 12, 2021.\nSolutions and Products\nWe are a \"biometrics first\" security company who brings the highest level of security to systems, data and places, by identifying and authenticating people through biometrics. Our solutions are focused on biometrics and secure credentials providing complete, cross-functional interoperable systems and an open architecture.\nIWS Biometric Engine. This is a biometric identity and authentication database for multi-biometric enrollment, management and authentication, managing population databases of unlimited sizes without regard to hardware or algorithm.

IWS Biometric Engine is biometric agnostic, enabling the use of biometric devices and algorithms from any vendor, and with current support of the following biometric types: finger, face, iris, palm, and voice. We leverage the IWS Biometric Engine\u00ae to create products that provide government, law enforcement, public safety, border management and enterprise businesses, with a wide variety of solutions that address specific problems, mandates and technology standards.\nImageWare Authenticate. The Company introduced GoVerify ID\u00ae, now known as ImageWare Authenticate, a multi-factor biometric authentication, MFA product, for the enterprise markets on November 14, 2016. ImageWare Authenticate supports multimodal biometric Cloud-based matching and authentication including, but not limited to, face, voice, fingerprint, iris, palm, and more. All the biometrics can be combined with authentication and access control tools, including tokens, digital certificates, passwords, and PINS, to provide the ultimate level of assurance, accountability, and ease of use for corporate networks, web applications, mobile devices, and PC desktop environments. ImageWare Authenticate provides multimodal biometric identity authentication that can be used in place of passwords or as a strong second factor authentication method. ImageWare Authenticate is provided as a Cloud-based SaaS solution, thereby, eliminating complex IT deployment of biometric software and eliminating startup costs. ImageWare Authenticate works with existing mobile devices, eliminating the need for specialized biometric scanning devices typically used with most biometric solutions. We enhanced the product and completed this work on December 31, 2020. We relaunched ImageWare Authenticate on February 1, 2021.\nIWS EPI Suite. This is an ID software solution for producing, issuing, and managing secure credentials and personal identification cards, also called biometric smart badges. It is used by many human resource departments, along with other corporate groups, to enroll employees and print physical badges which may be used later for physical access.\u202fUsers can efficiently manage large amounts of data, images and card designs, as well as track and issue multiple cards per person, automatically populate multiple cards and eliminate redundant data entry. IWS EPI Suite was designed to integrate with our customers\u2019 existing security and computing infrastructure. We believe that this compatibility may be an appealing feature to corporations, government agencies, transportation departments, schools, and other public institutions.\nIWS EPI Builder. This is an SDK and a leading secure credential component of identity management and security solutions, providing all aspects of ID functionality from image and biometric capture to the enrollment, issuance and management of secure documents. It contains components which developers or systems integrators can use to support and produce secure credentials, including national IDs, passports, International Civil Aviation Office -compliant travel documents, smartcards and driver licenses. IWS EPI Builder enables organizations to develop custom identification solutions or incorporate sophisticated identification capabilities into existing applications including the ability to capture images, biometric and demographic data; enable biometric identification and verification (1:1 and 1:X); as well as support numerous biometric hardware and software vendors. It also enables users to add electronic identification functionality for other applications, including access control, tracking of time and attendance, point of sale transactions, human resource systems, school photography systems, asset management, inventory control, warehouse management, facilities management and card production systems. We intend to update the EPI Suite and Builder platforms in late 2021 and offer these products in the Cloud.\nIWS Law Enforcement. IWS Law Enforcement is a digital booking, identification and investigative platform that enables users to digitally capture, store, search and retrieve images and demographic data, including mugshots and line ups, fingerprints and scars, marks and tattoos (SMT\u2019s). Law enforcement may choose between submitting fingerprint data directly to the State Automated Fingerprint Identification System (\u201cAFIS\u201d), FBI criminal repository, or other agencies as required. Additional features and functionality include real-time access to images and data, creation of photo lineups or electric mug books, and production of identification cards and credentials.\u202fIWS Law Enforcement also uses off-the-shelf, biometric hardware and is designed to comply with open industry standards so that it can operate on an array of systems ranging from a stand-alone personal computer or handheld to larger, integrated systems. To avoid duplication of entries, the system can be integrated easily with several other information storage and retrieval systems, such as a records/jail management system (\u201cRMS/JMS\u201d) or an automated fingerprint identification system. We intend to update the Law Enforcement platform in first half of 2021 and offer the full suite in the Cloud as a SaaS offering.\nThe IWS Law Enforcement platform contains the following components:\nCapture. This software module allows users to capture and store a variety of images (facial, SMT and others such as evidence photos) as well as biographical text information. Each record includes images and text information in an easy-to-view format made up of fields designed and defined by the individual agency. Current customers of this module range from agencies that capture a few thousand mug shots per year to those that capture hundreds of thousands of mug shots each year.\nLiveScan. This software module is FBI certified\u202fand complies with the FBI Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System (\u201cIAFIS\u201d) Image Quality Specifications (\u201cIQS\u201d) while utilizing FBI certified LiveScan devices from most major vendors. LiveScan allows users to capture single to ten prints and palm data, providing an integrated biometric management solution for both civil and law enforcement use. By adding LiveScan capabilities, law enforcement organizations further enhance the investigative process by providing additional identifiers to identify suspects involved in a crime.\u202fIn addition, officers no longer need to travel to multiple booking stations to capture fingerprints and mugshots.\u202fAll booking information, including images, may be located at a central designation and from there routed to the State AFIS or FBI criminal history record repository.\nInvestigative. This software module allows users to search the database created with IWS Law Enforcement. Officers can conduct text searches in many fields, including file number, name, alias, distinctive features, and other information, such as gang membership and criminal history. The Investigative module creates a catalogue of possible matches, allowing officers or witnesses to save time by looking only at mug shots that closely resemble the description of the suspect. This module can also be used to create a line-up of similar facial images from which a witness may identify the suspect.\nEPI Designer for Law Enforcement. The EPI Designer for LE software is a design solution created for the IWS Law Enforcement databases based on the IWS EPI Suite program.\u202fThis program allows integration with various IWS databases for the production of unique booking/inmate reports, wristbands, photo ID cards, Wanted or BOLO fliers, etc., created from the information stored in booking records. Designs can be created in minutes and quickly added to the IWS Law Enforcement system, allowing all users with appropriate permissions immediate access to the newly added form.\nQuick Capture. Quick Capture is a multiple biometric capture application that dynamically adapts to a client\u2019s required use case, including different city, state, and federal charge codes. With it, you can collect a variety of biometrics (face, finger, palm, iris, voice, etc.) using a variety of biometric hardware in the order desired as well as any needed biographic information associated with the subjects.\nBioIntellic. BioIntellic is a facial matching and anti-spoofing product integrated into ImageWare Authenticate. It is designed to prevent presentation attacks, by ensuring the captured biometric image is that of a live individual, not a picture of 3D mask. BioIntellic is also available as a standalone product, enabling companies to quickly integrate facial matching and liveness detection into their offerings.\nMaintenance and Customer Support\nMaintenance and support enrollment entitles software license customers to technical support services, including telephone and email support, problem resolution services, and the right to receive unspecified product upgrades, maintenance releases and patches released during the term of the support period. Maintenance and support service fees are an important source of recurring revenue, and we invest continuing resources into providing maintenance and support services.\nCustomers\nWe have a wide variety of domestic and international customers. Most of our IWS Law Enforcement customers are government agencies at the federal, state and local levels in the United States and Canada, but we also have clients outside of North America. For the year ended December 31, 2020, two customers accounted for approximately 61% or $2,921,000 of total revenue and had trade receivables of approximately $250,000 as of the end of the year. For the year ended December 31, 2019, two customers accounted for approximately 37% or $1,301,000 of total revenue and had trade receivables of approximately $161,000 as of the end of the year.\nOur Strategy\nOur strategy is to be a \u201cbiometric first\u201d cybersecurity company bringing the highest level of security to systems, data and places by identifying and authenticating people through biometrics. We sell to governments, law enforcement and public safety, as well as enterprises, through key partners and large systems integrators and with our own direct sales team.\nWith recent COVID-19 events, remote work and social distancing have quickly been brought to the forefront of society. And while the impact of these events will be seen in the coming years, many problems have been immediately realized by corporations and government agencies, who are diligently looking for solutions to operate in a new business environment.\nWithin a matter of weeks, corporations and government agencies have had to heavily rely upon remote access technologies to enable work continuity through the pandemic. This increase in employees remotely accessing sensitive corporate systems has increased the risk of both cybercrime and unintentional information leaks. This risk is also increased by the fact that many employees now use a mixture of personal and corporate owned devices on the job, a trend known as, Bring Your Own Device (BYOD).\nVerification of an individual through biometrics is an effective way to authenticate users accessing sensitive information and systems. ImageWare Authenticate provides this functionality and is already integrated in many of the authentication systems leveraged by large companies and agencies to manage the identities of their employees and users. We will market and sell ImageWare Authenticate as a solution for protecting corporate data to the most relevant business verticals during this time of increased susceptibility to broad cyberattacks, such as malware, viruses, trojans, ransomware infections and phishing attacks.\nAdditionally, social distancing and the need to limit personal contact throughout everyday life is driving governments and corporations to deploy new ways to continue work and commerce while minimizing contact points between individuals. We believe this trend will increase the acceptance and use of biometrics as a means of contactless and touchless authentication for health, retail, finance/banking, government services, higher education and transportation.\nScaling out biometrics across these verticals is going to require new methods and solutions to support the increased number of users and transactions. With our decades of experience innovating and scaling government grade biometric solutions and our years executed strategy of creating multimodal, vendor agnostic solutions, ImageWare has had a rich portfolio of products and solutions to address these new challenges brought on by the pandemic.\u202f\nAdditionally, the law enforcement community continues to be an important market and customer base. Over the past few years, innovation within our law enforcement product line has been static, which has resulted in revenue being primarily driven from support and maintenance. Recently ImageWare released a new product offering to the law enforcement sector called, QuickCapture Mobile. Quick Capture Mobile streamlines the process of capturing biometrics from perpetrators on a mobile, PC-based device, in the field. The law enforcement market will immediately benefit from this product. We believe we can develop the Quick Capture product to service other verticals such as; corporate, telecommunications, academia, hospitality and entertainment.\nWe believe the increasing demand for biometric technology will drive demand for our solutions.\u202fIn the coming year, we will work to develop an Identity Platform, which combines all of our products onto one end-to-end, Cloud-based platform, allowing large clients to do enrollments (Enroll, Verify, Credential and Authenticate). The building blocks of the Identity Platform consist of upgrades to our current standalone products (IWS LE, EPI Builder, and ImageWare Authenticate) as well as a new identity proofing product, to be developed to verify the authenticity of government issued IDs. The Enroll, Verify, Credential and Authenticate workflow, is foundational to the majority of governments and corporate opportunities we compete for, and therefore, a key to the Identity Platform. This single platform which allows a customer to create a digital identity fully vetted against a government issued ID, use it thereafter for a reliable biometric authentication and manage that identity through its life cycle is compelling. We are scheduling the Identity Platform to be completed in late 2021.\nSales and Marketing\nWe market and sell our products in most major world markets directly through our salesforce and indirectly through channel partners, including resellers, distributors and systems integrators. Our sales force includes both field, and inside sales, which provides us a lower-cost channel for additional sales into existing customers and for expanding our customer base.\nInternational Operations\nWe are a global company. We are headquartered in San Diego, California with a remote office in Ottawa, Canada. Our main business operations are based in San Diego, California. We regularly seek out opportunities to efficiently expand our operations in international locations that offer highly talented resources as a way to maximize our global competitiveness.\nSoftware Licenses\nThe bulk of our revenue presently is generated from new subscription and historical maintenance payments for our software solutions for Law Enforcement, Badging, Identity Management, and Multi-factor Access, MFA. \u202fWe currently have four primary revenue sources:\n- Annual Maintenance of our Law Enforcement Solution;\n- Perpetual license revenue of our Badging Solution;\n- Term Subscriptions of our ImageWare Authenticate solution; and \u202f\n- Professional Services fees associated with implementation and training for our customers.\nWe are actively engaged in simplifying our revenue sources, migrating our existing customers Annual Maintenance, and perpetual license agreements to more consistent and sustainable subscription models.\nSoftware as a Service Business Model\nWe also provide an on-demand SaaS offering for ImageWare Authenticate.\u202fSaaS offerings will be offered on a subscription term-limited basis.\u202fWe are exploring offering additional products as SaaS offerings on a subscription term-limited basis.\nCompetition\nBiometric Market\nThe market to provide biometric systems to the identity management market is evolving and we face competition from a number of sources. We believe that the strength of our competitive position is based on:\n\u25cf\nOur ability to provide a system which enables the enrollment, management and authentication of multiple biometrics managing population databases of unlimited sizes;\n\u25cf\nSearches can be 1:1 (verification), 1:N (identification), and N:N (database integrity); and\n\u25cf\nThe system is technology and biometric agnostic, enabling the use of biometric devices and algorithms from any vendor, and the support of the following biometric types: finger, face, iris, palm and voice\nOur multifactor-biometric product faces competition from Duo, HYPR, Daon and Aware Inc., none of which have offerings with the scope and flexibility of our IWS Biometric Engine and its companion suite of products or relevant patent protection.\nCredential Market\nDue to the breadth of our software offering in the secure credential market space, we face differing degrees of competition in certain market segments.

We believe the principal bases on which we compete with respect to all of our products are:\n\u25cf\nthe unique ability to integrate our modular products into a complete biometric, LiveScan, imaging and investigative system;\n\u25cf\nour reputation as a reliable systems supplier;\n\u25cf\nthe usability and functionality of our products;\n\u25cf\nthe responsiveness, availability and reliability of our customer support; and\n\u25cf\nhardware agnostic across many biometric vendors.\nOur law enforcement product line faces competition from other companies such as DataWorks Plus, Idemia, Gemalto and NEC.\u202fInternationally, there are often a number of local companies offering solutions in most countries.\nIntellectual Property\nWe rely on trademark, patent, trade secret and copyright laws and confidentiality and license agreements to protect our intellectual property. We have several federally registered trademarks, including the trademark ImageWare and IWS Biometric Engine, as well as trademarks for which there are pending trademark registrations with the United States, Canadian and other International Patent & Trademark Offices.\nWe hold several issued patents and have several other patent applications pending for elements of our products. We believe we have the foundational patents regarding the use of multiple biometrics and continue to be an IP leader in the biometric arena. It is our belief that this intellectual property leadership will create a sustainable competitive advantage.\nWe are an early pioneer of patents related to multi-modal biometrics and currently are a worldwide leader in multi-modal biometric patents, with 27 issued patents worldwide and 14 pending or allowed patent applications worldwide as well. The Company\u2019s patents are as follows:\nUS Issued Patents - 17\nUS Allowed Patents - 1\nUS Patent Applications - 3\nInternational Issued Patents - 10\nInternational Patent Applications - 10\nTotal Worldwide Issued Patents - 27\nTotal Worldwide Allowed Patents - 1\nTotal Worldwide Patent Applications - 14\nEmployees\nWe had a total of 44 full-time employees as of December 31, 2020. In 2020, we had 40 employees based in the United States, three employees based in Canada and one employee based in Mexico. Our employees are not covered by any collective bargaining agreement, and we have never experienced a work stoppage. We believe that our relations with our employees are good.\nEnvironmental Regulation\nOur business does not require us to comply with any particular environmental regulations.\nAdditional Available Information\nWe make available, free of charge, at our corporate website www.iwsinc.com copies of our annual reports filed with the SEC on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, proxy statements, and all amendments to these reports, as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act.

    "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.\nRISK FACTORS\nOur business is subject to significant risks. You should carefully consider the risks described below and the other information in this Annual Report, including our financial statements and related notes, before you decide to invest in our Common Stock. If any of the following risks or uncertainties actually occur, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be materially harmed, the trading price of our Common Stock could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment. The risks and uncertainties described below are those that we currently believe may materially affect us; however, they may not be the only ones that we face. Additional risks and uncertainties of which we are unaware or currently deem immaterial may also become important factors that may harm our business. Except as required by law, we undertake no obligations to update any risk factors.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY\nAvailable cash resources will be insufficient to provide for our working capital needs for the next twelve months. As a result, we will need to raise additional capital to continue as a going concern.\nAt December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had negative working capital of $19,349,000 and $1,653,000, respectively. Our principal source of liquidity at December 31, 2020 and 2019 consisted of cash and cash equivalents of $8,345,000 and $1,030,000, respectively. Considering the financings consummated in 2020, as well as our projected cash requirements, and assuming we are unable to generate incremental revenue, our available cash will be insufficient to satisfy our cash requirements for the next twelve months from the date of this filing. These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. To address our working capital requirements, management intends to seek additional equity and/or debt financing through the issuance of additional debt and/or equity securities and may seek strategic or other transactions intended to increase shareholder value. There are currently no formal committed financing arrangements to support our projected cash shortfall, including commitments to purchase additional debt and/or equity securities, or other agreements, and no assurances can be given that we will be successful in raising additional capital through the issuance of debt and/or equity securities, or entering into any other transaction that addresses our ability to continue as a going concern.\nWe have a history of significant recurring losses totaling approximately $213.2 million at December 31, 2020 and $203.2 million and December 31, 2019, and these losses may continue in the future.\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $213.2 million and $203.2 million, respectively, and these losses may continue in the future. We expect to continue to incur significant sales and marketing, research and development, and general and administrative expense. As a result, we will need to generate significant revenue to achieve profitability, and we may never achieve profitability.\nOur loan under the Paycheck Protection Program may not be forgiven or may subject us to challenges and investigations regarding qualification for the loan.\nWe have received loan proceeds in the amount of approximately $1.57 million under the Payroll Protection Program (\u201cPPP Loan\u201d), which was established under the CARES Act and is administered by the SBA (\u201cPPP\u201d). Under the terms of the CARES Act, PPP Loan recipients can apply for loan forgiveness. The potential loan forgiveness for all or a portion of PPP Loan is determined, subject to limitations, based on the use of loan proceeds over the 24 weeks after the loan proceeds are disbursed for payment of payroll costs and any payments of mortgage interest, rent, and utilities. The amount of loan forgiveness will be reduced if PPP Loan recipients terminate employees or reduce salaries during the covered period. The unforgiven portion of our PPP Loan, if any, is payable over two years at an interest rate of 1%, with a deferral of payments for the first six months. We have utilized all the proceeds from the PPP Loan for purposes consistent with the PPP. While we currently believe that our use of the loan proceeds will meet the conditions for forgiveness of the PPP Loan, the Series D Financing may affect the Company's ability to have the PPP Loan forgiven under the PPP and there can be no assurance that forgiveness for any portion of the PPP Loan will be obtained.\nAdditionally, the Company is evaluating whether the Series D Financing will prevent the Company from qualifying for loan forgiveness. In the event the SBA determines that the Series D Financing disqualifies the Company for loan forgiveness under the PPP, the Company will be required to repay all $1.57 million of the PPP Loan by May 4, 2022, with interest accruing at 1%.\nOur operating results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to fluctuate in the future.\nOur operating results have fluctuated in the past. These fluctuations in operating results are the consequence of the following, amongst other things:\n\u25cf\nvarying demand for and market acceptance of our technology and products;\n\u25cf\nchanges in our product or customer mix;\n\u25cf\nthe gain or loss of one or more key customers or their key customers, or significant changes in the financial condition of one or more of our key customers or their key customers;\n\u25cf\nour ability to introduce, certify and deliver new products and technologies on a timely basis;\n\u25cf\nthe announcement or introduction of products and technologies by our competitors;\n\u25cf\ncompetitive pressures on selling prices;\n\u25cf\ncosts associated with acquisitions and the integration of acquired companies, products and technologies;\n\u25cf\nour ability to successfully integrate acquired companies, products and technologies;\n\u25cf\nour accounting and legal expense; and\n\u25cf\ngeneral economic conditions.\nThese factors, some of which are not within our control, will likely continue in the future. To respond to these and other factors, we may need to make business decisions that could result in failure to meet financial expectations. If our quarterly operating results fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts or investors, our stock price could drop suddenly and significantly. Most of our expense, such as employee compensation and inventory, is relatively fixed in the short term. Moreover, our expense levels are based, in part, on our expectations regarding future revenue levels. As a result, if our revenue for a particular period was below our expectations, we may not be able to proportionately reduce our operating expense for that period. Any revenue shortfall would have a disproportionately negative effect on our operating results for the period.\nWe depend upon a small number of large system sales ranging from $100,000 to in excess of several million dollars and we may fail to achieve one or more large system sales in the future.\nHistorically, we have derived a substantial portion of our revenue from a small number of sales of large, relatively expensive systems, typically ranging in price from $100,000 to $2,000,000. If we fail to receive orders for these large systems in a given sales cycle on a consistent basis, our business could be significantly harmed. Further, our quarterly results are difficult to predict because we cannot predict in which quarter, if any, large system sales will occur in a given year. As a result, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our results of operations are not a good indication of our future performance. In some future quarters, our operating results may be below the expectations of securities analysts and investors, in which case the market price of our Common Stock may decrease significantly.\nOur lengthy sales cycle may cause us to expend significant resources for one year or more in anticipation of a sale to certain customers, yet we still may fail to complete the sale.\nWhen considering the purchase of a large identity management product, potential customers may take as long as eighteen months to evaluate different solutions and obtain approval for the purchase. Under these circumstances, if we fail to complete a sale, we will have expended significant resources and received no revenue in return. Generally, customers consider a wide range of issues before committing to purchase our products, including product benefits, ability to operate with their current systems, product reliability and their own budgetary constraints. While potential customers are evaluating our products, we may incur substantial selling costs and expend significant management resources in an effort to accomplish potential sales that may never occur. In times of economic recession, our potential customers may be unwilling or unable to commit resources to the purchase of new and costly systems.\nA number of our customers and potential customers are local, state, and federal government agencies that are subject to unique political and budgetary constraints and have special contracting requirements, which may affect our ability to obtain new and retain current government customers.\nA significant number of our customers are government agencies. These agencies often do not set their own budgets and therefore have little control over the amount of money they can spend from quarter-to-quarter or year-to-year. In addition, these agencies experience political pressure that may dictate the manner in which they spend money. Due to political and budgetary processes and other scheduling delays that may frequently occur relating to the contract or bidding process, some government agency orders may be canceled or substantially delayed, and the receipt of revenue or payments from these agencies may be substantially delayed. In addition, future sales to government agencies will depend on our ability to meet government contracting requirements, certain of which may be onerous or impossible to meet, resulting in our inability to obtain a particular contract. Common requirements in government contracts include bonding requirements, provisions permitting the purchasing agency to modify or terminate at will the contract without penalty, and provisions permitting the agency to perform investigations or audits of our business practices, any of which may limit our ability to enter into new contracts or maintain our current contracts.\nTwo customers accounted for approximately 61% of our total revenue during the year ended December 31, 2020, and two customers accounted for approximately 37% of our total revenue during the year ended December 31, 2019. In the event of any material decrease in revenue from these customers, or if we are unable to replace the revenue through the sale of our products to additional customers, our financial condition and results from operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, two customers accounted for approximately 61% or $2,921,000 of our total revenue. During the year ended December 31, 2019, two customers accounted for approximately 37% or $1,301,000 of our total revenue. If these customers were to significantly reduce their relationship with the Company, or in the event that we are unable to replace the revenue through the sale of our products to additional customers, our financial condition and results from operations could be negatively impacted, and such impact would be material.\nWe face competition from companies with greater financial, technical, sales, marketing and other resources, and, if we are unable to compete effectively with these competitors, our market share may decline and our business could be harmed.\nWe face competition from other established companies. A number of our competitors have longer operating histories, larger customer bases, significantly greater financial, technological, sales, marketing and other resources than we do. As a result, our competitors may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards or client requirements, more quickly develop new products or devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products and services than we can. Likewise, their greater capabilities in these areas may enable them to better withstand periodic downturns in the identity management solutions industry and compete more effectively on the basis of price and production. In addition, new companies may enter the markets in which we compete, further increasing competition in the identity management solutions industry.\nWe believe that our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors, including the type and quality of our products and the strength of our brand names, as well as many factors beyond our control. We may not be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors, and increased competition may result in price reductions, reduced profit margins, loss of market share and an inability to generate cash flows that are sufficient to maintain or expand the development and marketing of new products, any of which would adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR TECHNOLOGY\nWe occasionally rely on systems integrators to manage our large projects, and if these companies do not perform adequately, we may lose business.\nWe occasionally act as a subcontractor to systems integrators who manage large projects that incorporate our systems. We cannot control these companies, and they may decide not to promote our products or may price their services in such a way as to make it unprofitable for us to continue our relationship with them. Further, they may fail to perform under agreements with their customers, in which case we might lose sales to these customers. If we lose our relationships with these companies, our business, financial condition and results of operations may suffer.\nSome third parties integrate our software into their platforms or solutions. Any delay in the integration of our software or the launch of third-party products may materially affect our results from operations and financial condition.\nWe sell some of our software through larger product partners and/or resellers that will either resell our product alongside theirs, OEM a white label version of our products, or sell our products fully integrated into their offerings. In these cases, we are dependent upon the successful rollout of our products by our distribution partners. Any delays negatively affect our results from operations and financial condition.\nIf our security measures or those of our third-party data center hosting facilities, Cloud computing platform providers, or third-party service partners, are breached, and unauthorized access is obtained to a customer\u2019s data, our data or our IT systems, or authorized access is blocked or disabled, our services may be perceived as not being secure, customers may curtail or stop using our services, and we may incur significant legal and financial exposure and liabilities.\nOur services involve the storage and transmission of our customers\u2019 and our customers\u2019 customers\u2019 proprietary and other sensitive data, including financial information and other personally identifiable information. While we have security measures in place, they may be breached as a result of efforts by individuals or groups of hackers and sophisticated organizations, including state-sponsored organizations or nation-states. Our security measures could also be compromised by employee error or malfeasance, which could result in someone obtaining unauthorized access to, or denying authorized access to our IT systems, our customers\u2019 data or our data, including our intellectual property and other confidential business information. Additionally, third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing sensitive information such as usernames, passwords or other information to gain access to our customers\u2019 data, our data or our IT systems.\nWe take extraordinary measures to ensure identity authentication of users who access critical IT infrastructure, including but not limited to, two-factor, multi-factor and biometric identity verification. This substantially reduces the threat of unauthorized access by bad actors using compromised user credentials.\nBecause the techniques used to breach, obtain unauthorized access to, or sabotage IT systems change frequently, grow more complex over time, and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate or implement adequate measures to prevent against such techniques.\nOur services operate in conjunction with and are dependent on products and components across a broad ecosystem and, if there are security vulnerabilities in one of these components, a security breach could occur. In addition, our internal IT systems continue to evolve, and we are often early adapters of new technologies and new ways of sharing data and communicating internally and with partners and customers, which increases the complexity of our IT systems. These risks are mitigated by our ability to maintain and improve business and data governance policies and processes and internal security controls, including our ability to escalate and respond to known and potential risks.\nIn addition, our customers may authorize third-party technology providers to access their customer data, and some of our customers may not have adequate security measures in place to protect their data that is stored on our servers. Because we do not control our customers or third-party technology providers, or the processing of such data by third-party technology providers, we cannot ensure the integrity or security of such transmissions or processing. Malicious third parties may also conduct attacks designed to temporarily deny customers access to our services.\nA security breach could expose us to a risk of loss or inappropriate use of proprietary and sensitive data, or the denial of access to this data. A security breach could also result in a loss of confidence in the security of our services, damage our reputation, negatively impact our future sales, disrupt our business and lead to legal liability. Finally, the detection, prevention and remediation of known or potential security vulnerabilities, including those arising from third-party hardware or software may result in additional direct and indirect costs, for example additional infrastructure capacity to mitigate any system degradation that could result from remediation efforts.\nRISKS RELATED TO INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY\nIf the patents we own or license, or our other intellectual property rights, do not adequately protect our products and technologies, we may lose market share to our competitors and our business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nOur success depends significantly on our ability to protect our rights to the technologies used in our products. We rely on patent protection, trade secrets, as well as a combination of copyright and trademark laws and nondisclosure, confidentiality and other contractual arrangements to protect our technology. However, these legal means afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep any competitive advantage. In addition, we cannot be assured that any of our current and future pending patent applications will result in the issuance of a patent to us. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (\u201cPTO\u201d) may deny or require significant narrowing of claims in our pending patent applications, and patents issued as a result of the pending patent applications, if any, may not provide us with significant commercial protection or may not be issued in a form that is advantageous to us. We could also incur substantial costs in proceedings before the PTO. These proceedings could result in adverse decisions as to the claims included in our patents.\nOur issued and licensed patents and those that may be issued or licensed in the future may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, which could limit our ability to stop competitors from marketing related products. Additionally, upon expiration of our issued or licensed patents, we may lose some of our rights to exclude others from making, using, selling or importing products using the technology based on the expired patents. We also must rely on contractual rights with the third parties that license technology to us to protect our rights in the technology licensed to us. Although we have taken steps to protect our intellectual property and technology, there is no assurance that competitors will not be able to design around our patents. We also rely on unpatented proprietary technology. We cannot assure you that we can meaningfully protect all our rights in our unpatented proprietary technology or that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary products or processes or otherwise gain access to our unpatented proprietary technology. We seek to protect our know-how and other unpatented proprietary technology with confidentiality agreements and intellectual property assignment agreements with our employees. However, such agreements may not provide meaningful protection for our proprietary information in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure or other breaches of the agreements or in the event that our competitors discover or independently develop similar or identical designs or other proprietary information. In addition, we rely on the use of registered and common law trademarks with respect to the brand names of some of our products. Our common law trademarks provide less protection than our registered trademarks. Loss of rights in our trademarks could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFurthermore, the laws of foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. If we fail to apply for intellectual property protection or if we cannot adequately protect our intellectual property rights in these foreign countries, our competitors may be able to compete more effectively against us, which could adversely affect our competitive position, as well as our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf third parties claim that we infringe their intellectual property rights, we may incur liabilities and costs and may have to redesign or discontinue selling certain products.\nWhether a product infringes a patent involves complex legal and factual issues, the determination of which is often uncertain. We face the risk of claims that we have infringed on third parties\u2019 intellectual property rights. Searching for existing intellectual property rights may not reveal important intellectual property and our competitors may also have filed for patent protection, which is not yet a matter of public knowledge, or claimed trademark rights that have not been revealed through our availability searches. Our efforts to identify and avoid infringing on third parties\u2019 intellectual property rights may not always be successful. Any claims of patent or other intellectual property infringement, even those without merit, could:\n\u25cf\nincrease the cost of our products;\n\u25cf\nbe expensive and time consuming to defend;\n\u25cf\nresult in us being required to pay significant damages to third parties;\n\u25cf\nforce us to cease making or selling products that incorporate the challenged intellectual property;\n\u25cf\nrequire us to redesign, reengineer or rebrand our products;\n\u25cf\nrequire us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements in order to obtain the right to use a third party\u2019s intellectual property, the terms of which may not be acceptable to us;\n\u25cf\nrequire us to indemnify third parties pursuant to contracts in which we have agreed to provide indemnification to such parties for intellectual property infringement claims;\n\u25cf\ndivert the attention of our management; and\n\u25cf\nresult in our customers or potential customers deferring or limiting their purchase or use of the affected products until the litigation is resolved.\nIn addition, new patents obtained by our competitors could threaten a product\u2019s continued life in the market even after it has already been introduced.\nREGULATORY AND LEGAL RISK FACTORS\nFailure to comply with federal, state and international laws and regulations and our contractual obligations relating to privacy, data protection and consumer protection, or the expansion of current or the enactment of new laws or regulations relating to privacy, data protection and consumer protection, could adversely affect our business and our financial condition.\nWe collect and maintain significant amounts of personal data and other data relating to our customers and employees. A variety of federal, state and international laws and regulations, and certain industry standards, govern or apply to our collection, use, retention, sharing and security of consumer data. We are subject to certain laws, regulations, contractual obligations and industry standards (including, for example, the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, or PCI-DSS) relating to privacy, data protection, information security and consumer protection, which are evolving and subject to potentially differing interpretations. These requirements may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another or may conflict with other rules or our practices. As a result, our practices may not comply or may not comply in the future with all such laws, regulations, requirements and obligations. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with our privacy policies or with any federal, state or international laws, regulations, industry self-regulatory principles, industry standards or codes of conduct, regulatory guidance, orders to which we may be subject or other legal or contractual obligations relating to privacy, data protection, information security or consumer protection could adversely affect our reputation, brand and business, and may result in claims, proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others or other liabilities or require us to change our operations and/or cease or modify our use of certain data sets. Any such claim, proceeding or action could hurt our reputation, brand and business, force us to incur significant expenses in defense of such proceedings, distract our management, increase our costs of doing business, result in a loss of customers and suppliers or an inability to process credit card payments and may result in the imposition of monetary penalties. We may also be contractually required to indemnify and hold harmless third parties from the costs or consequences of non-compliance with any laws, regulations or other legal obligations relating to privacy or consumer protection or any inadvertent or unauthorized use or disclosure of data that we store or handle as part of operating our business.\nForeign laws and regulations relating to privacy, data protection, information security and consumer protection often are more restrictive than those in the United States. The European Union, for example, traditionally has imposed stricter obligations under its laws and regulations relating to privacy, data protection and consumer protection than the United States. In May 2018 the European Union's new regulation governing data practices and privacy called the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, became effective and substantially replaced the data protection laws of the individual European Union member states. The law requires companies to meet more stringent requirements regarding the handling of personal data of individuals in the EU than were required under predecessor EU requirements. In the United Kingdom, a Data Protection Bill that substantially implements the GDPR also became law in May 2018. The law also increases the penalties for non-compliance, which may result in monetary penalties of up to \u20ac20.0 million or 4% of a company's worldwide turnover, whichever is higher. The GDPR and other similar regulations require companies to give specific types of notice and in some cases seek consent from consumers and other data subjects before collecting or using their data for certain purposes, including some marketing activities. Outside of the European Union, many countries have laws, regulations, or other requirements relating to privacy, data protection, information security, and consumer protection, and new countries are adopting such legislation or other obligations with increasing frequency. Many of these laws may require consent from consumers for the use of data for various purposes, including marketing, which may reduce our ability to market our products. There is no harmonized approach to these laws and regulations globally. Consequently, we increase our risk of non-compliance with applicable foreign data protection laws by operating internationally. We may need to change and limit the way we use personal information in operating our business and may have difficulty maintaining a single operating model that is compliant. In addition, various federal, state and foreign legislative and regulatory bodies, or self-regulatory organizations, may expand current laws or regulations, enact new laws or regulations or issue revised rules or guidance regarding privacy, data protection, information security and consumer protection. For example, California recently adopted the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (\u201cCCPA\u201d), which provides new data privacy rights for consumers and new operational requirements for businesses. The CCPA includes a statutory damages framework and private rights of action against businesses that fail to comply with certain CCPA terms or implement reasonable security procedures and practices to prevent data breaches. The CCPA went into effect in January 2020. The effects of the CCPA potentially are significant, however, and may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and to incur substantial costs and expenses in an effort to comply. As a general matter, compliance with laws, regulations, and any applicable rules or guidance from self-regulatory organizations relating to privacy, data protection, information security and consumer protection, may result in substantial costs and may necessitate changes to our business practices, which may compromise our growth strategy, adversely affect our ability to acquire customers, and otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe may have additional tax assessments.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States. Significant judgments are required in determining our provisions for income taxes. In the course of preparing our tax provisions and returns, we must make calculations where the ultimate tax determination may be uncertain. Our tax returns are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) and state tax authorities. There can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations. If the ultimate determination of taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, our operating results, cash flows, and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nWe operate in foreign countries and are exposed to risks associated with foreign political, economic and legal environments and with foreign currency exchange rates.\nWe have significant foreign operations. As a result, we are exposed to risks, including among others, risks associated with foreign political, economic and legal environments and with foreign currency exchange rates. Our results may be adversely affected by, among other things, changes in government policies with respect to laws and regulations, anti-inflation measures, currency conversions, collection of receivables abroad and rates and methods of taxation.\nGOVERNANCE RISKS AND RISKS RELATED TO OUR SECURITIES\nOur Common Stock is subject to \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules.\nOur Common Stock is currently defined as a \u201cpenny stock\u201d under Rule 3a51-1 promulgated under the Exchange Act which are subject to Rules 15g-2 through 15g-7 and Rule 15g-9, which impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers that sell penny stocks to persons other than established customers and institutional accredited investors. Among other things, for transactions covered by these rules, a broker-dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchaser and have received the purchaser\u2019s written consent to the transaction prior to sale. Consequently, these rules may affect the ability of broker-dealers to sell our Common Stock and affect the ability of holders to sell their shares of our Common Stock in the secondary market. To the extent our Common Stock is subject to the penny stock regulations, the market liquidity for our shares will be adversely affected.\nOur stock price has been volatile, and your investment in our Common Stock could suffer a decline in value.\nThere has been significant volatility in the market price and trading volume of equity securities, which is unrelated to the financial performance of the companies issuing the securities. These broad market fluctuations may negatively affect the market price of our Common Stock. You may not be able to resell your shares at or above the price you pay for those shares due to fluctuations in the market price of our Common Stock caused by changes in our operating performance or prospects and other factors.\nSome specific factors that may have a significant effect on our Common Stock market price include:\n\u25cf\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results or future prospects;\n\u25cf\nour announcements or our competitors\u2019 announcements of new products;\n\u25cf\nthe public\u2019s reaction to our press releases, our other public announcements and our filings with the SEC;\n\u25cf\nstrategic actions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions or restructurings;\n\u25cf\nnew laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business;\n\u25cf\nchanges in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles;\n\u25cf\nchanges in our growth rates or our competitors\u2019 growth rates;\n\u25cf\ndevelopments regarding our patents or proprietary rights or those of our competitors;\n\u25cf\nour inability to raise additional capital as needed;\n\u25cf\nsubstantial sales of Common Stock underlying warrants and preferred stock;\n\u25cf\nconcern as to the efficacy of our products;\n\u25cf\nchanges in financial markets or general economic conditions;\n\u25cf\nsales of Common Stock by us or members of our management team; and\n\u25cf\nchanges in stock market analyst recommendations or earnings estimates regarding our Common Stock, other comparable companies or our industry generally.\nOur future sales of our Common Stock could adversely affect its price and our future capital-raising activities could involve the issuance of equity securities, which would dilute shareholders\u2019 investments and could result in a decline in the trading price of our Common Stock.\nWe may sell securities in the public or private equity markets if and when conditions are favorable, even if we do not have an immediate need for additional capital at that time. Sales of substantial amounts of our Common Stock, or the perception that such sales could occur, could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our Common Stock and our ability to raise capital. We may issue additional Common Stock in future financing transactions or as incentive compensation for our executive management and other key personnel, consultants and advisors. Issuing any equity securities would be dilutive to the equity interests represented by our then-outstanding shares of Common Stock. The market price for our Common Stock could decrease as the market takes into account the dilutive effect of any of these issuances. Furthermore, we may enter into financing transactions at prices that represent a substantial discount to the market price of our Common Stock. A negative reaction by investors and securities analysts to any discounted sale of our equity securities could result in a decline in the trading price of our Common Stock.\nThe holders of our Preferred Stock (as defined below) have certain rights and privileges that are senior to our Common Stock, and we may issue additional shares of Preferred Stock without stockholder approval that could have a material adverse effect on the market value of the Common Stock.\nOur Board of Directors has the authority to issue a total of up to 5.0 million shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share (\u201cPreferred Stock\u201d) and to fix the rights, preferences, privileges, and restrictions, including voting rights, of the Preferred Stock, which typically are senior to the rights of the Common Stock, without any further vote or action by the holders of our Common Stock. The rights of the holders of our Common Stock will be subject to, and may be adversely affected by, the rights of the holders of the Preferred Stock that have been issued or might be issued in the future. Preferred Stock also could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock. This could delay, defer, or prevent a change in control. Furthermore, holders of our Preferred Stock may have other rights, including economic rights, senior to the Common Stock. As a result, their existence and issuance could have a material adverse effect on the market value of the Common Stock. We have in the past issued and may from time to time in the future issue, Preferred Stock for financing or other purposes with rights, preferences, or privileges senior to the Common Stock. As of March 26, 2021, we had four series of Preferred Stock outstanding, the Series A Preferred, Series A-1 Preferred, Series B Preferred, and Series D Preferred.\nThe provisions of our Series A Preferred prohibit the payment of dividends on our Common Stock unless the dividends on our preferred shares are first paid. In addition, upon a liquidation, dissolution or sale of our business, the holders of our Series A Preferred will be entitled to receive, in preference to any distribution to the holders of Common Stock, initial distributions of $1,000 per share, plus all accrued but unpaid dividends. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, there were 14,911 and 37,467 shares of our Series A Preferred outstanding, respectively. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had no cumulative undeclared dividends on our Series A Preferred.\nThe provisions of our Series A-1 Preferred prohibit the payment of dividends on our Common Stock unless the dividends on our preferred shares are first paid. In addition, upon a liquidation, dissolution or sale of our business, the holders of our Series A-1 Preferred will be entitled to receive, in preference to any distribution to the holders of Common Stock, initial distributions of $1,000 per share, plus all accrued but unpaid dividends. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, there were 14,782 and 0 shares of our Series A-1 Preferred outstanding, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, we had no cumulative undeclared dividends on our Series A-1 Preferred.\nThe provisions of our Series B Preferred prohibit the payment of dividends on our Common Stock unless the dividends on our preferred shares are first paid. In addition, upon a liquidation, dissolution or sale of our business, the holders of our Series B Preferred will be entitled to receive, in preference to any distribution to the holders of Common Stock, initial distributions of $2.50 per share, plus all accrued but unpaid dividends. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, there were 239,400 shares of Series B Preferred outstanding. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had cumulative undeclared dividends on our Series B Preferred of approximately $8,000.\nThe provisions of our Series D Preferred prohibit the payment of dividends on our Common Stock unless the dividends on our preferred shares are first paid. In addition, upon a liquidation, dissolution or sale of our business, the holders of our Series D Preferred will be entitled to receive, in preference to any distribution to the holders of Common Stock, initial distributions of $1,000 per share, plus all accrued but unpaid dividends. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, there were 22,863.28 and 0 shares of Series D Preferred outstanding, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, we had no cumulative undeclared dividends on our Series D Preferred.\nThe conversion of our Series A Preferred Stock, Series A-1 Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock and Series D Preferred Stock and the exercise of currently outstanding warrants could result in significant dilution to the holders of our common stock.\nThe holders of our Series A Preferred Stock, Series A-1 Preferred Stock, Stock Series B Preferred Stock and Series D Preferred Stock may elect to convert their shares of Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock. As of December 31, 2020, we had outstanding: (i) 14,911 shares of Series A Preferred Stock, which are convertible into 74,555,000 shares of Common Stock; (ii) 14,782 shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock, which are convertible into 73,910,000 shares of Common Stock; (iii) 239,400 shares of Series B Preferred Stock, which are convertible into 46,029 shares of Common Stock; and (iv) 22,863.28 shares of Series D Preferred Stock, which are convertible into 392,166,023 shares of Common Stock. In addition to our outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, as of December 31, 2020, there were outstanding warrants to purchase 753,775 shares of our Common Stock.\nThe conversion of our Series A Preferred Stock, Series A-1 Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock and Series D Preferred Stock, as well as the exercise of our outstanding warrants could result in significant dilution to existing common shareholders, adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock and impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities.\nUpon the occurrence of certain events, we may be required to redeem all or a portion of our Preferred Stock.\nHolders of certain of our Preferred Stock may require us to redeem all or any portion of such Holder\u2019s shares Preferred Stock within specific date from issuance or in the event of the consummation of a Change of Control (as such term is defined in the Certificate of Designations, Preferences and Rights of each class of Preferred Stock). We cannot assure you that we will maintain sufficient cash reserves or that our business will generate cash flow from operations at levels sufficient to permit us to redeem our shares of Preferred Stock if and when required to do so. In the event we have insufficient cash available or do not have access to additional third-party financings on commercially reasonable terms or at all to complete such redemption, our business, results of operations, and financial condition may be materially adversely affected.\nCertain large shareholders may have certain personal interests that may affect the Company.\nAs a result of the securities issued to Nantahala Capital Management, LLC (\u201cNantahala Capital Management\u201d), and the related entities controlled by Nantahala Capital Management, (i) Blackwell Partners LLC - Series A, (ii) Nantahala Capital Partners Limited Partnership, (iii) Nantahala Capital Partners II Limited Partnership, (iv) Nantahala Capital Partners SI, LP, (v) NCP QR Limited Partnership, and (vi) Silver Creek CS SAV, L.L.C. (collectively, \"Nantahala\"), Nantahala beneficially owns, in the aggregate, approximately 37% of the Company\u2019s outstanding voting securities as of March 26, 2021. As a result, Nantahala has the potential ability to exert influence over the outcome of issues requiring approval by the Company\u2019s shareholders. This concentration of ownership may have effects such as delaying or preventing a change in control of the Company that may be favored by other shareholders or preventing transactions in which shareholders might otherwise recover a premium for their shares over current market prices.\nOur corporate documents and Delaware law contain provisions that could discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of the Company.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition involving us that our stockholders may consider favorable. For example, our certificate of incorporation authorizes Preferred Stock, which carries special rights, including voting and dividend rights. With these rights, holders of Preferred Stock could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us.\nOur Amended Charter designates courts within the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, and the federal district courts for the United States of America for claims brought under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees or agents.\nOur Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the \u201cAmended Charter\u201d) require that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, and unless the Company consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, a state court located within the State of Delaware (or, if no state court located within the State of Delaware has jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware), will, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the sole and exclusive forum for each of the following:\n\u25cf\nany derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Company;\n\u25cf\nany action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director or officer or other employee of the Company to the Company or the Company\u2019s stockholders;\n\u25cf\nany action asserting a claim against the Company or any director or officer or other employee of the Company arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law or the Company\u2019s Amended Charter, or the Amended and Restated Bylaws; or\n\u25cf\nany action asserting a claim against the Company or any director or officer or other employee of the Company governed by the internal affairs doctrine.\nFurthermore, the Amended Charter sets forth that the federal district courts of the United States of America are the exclusive forum for the resolution of any causes of action arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d).\nBecause the applicability of the exclusive forum provision is limited to the extent permitted by law, we believe that the exclusive forum provision would not apply to suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (\u201cExchange Act\u201d), or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. We note that there is uncertainty as to whether a court would enforce the provision and that investors cannot waive compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. Although we believe this provision benefits us by providing increased consistency in the application of Delaware law and federal law under the Securities Act in the types of lawsuits to which they apply, the provisions may have the effect of discouraging lawsuits against our directors and officers.\nWe do not expect to pay cash dividends on our Common Stock for the foreseeable future.\nWe have never paid cash dividends on our Common Stock and do not anticipate that any cash dividends will be paid on the Common Stock for the foreseeable future. The payment of any cash dividend by us will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on, among other things, our earnings, capital, regulatory requirements and financial condition. Furthermore, the terms of our Series A Preferred, Series A-1 Preferred, Series B Preferred, Series C Preferred and Series D Preferred directly limit our ability to pay cash dividends on our Common Stock.\nGENERAL RISK FACTORS\nOur business is subject to risks arising from epidemic diseases, such as the recent global outbreak of the COVID-19 coronavirus.\nThe recent outbreak of the novel coronavirus, COVID-19, which has been declared by the World Health Organization to be a pandemic, has spread across the globe and is impacting worldwide economic activity. A pandemic, including COVID-19 or other public health epidemics, pose the risk that we or our employees, contractors, suppliers, and other partners may be prevented from conducting business activities for an indefinite period of time, including shutdowns that may be requested or mandated by governmental authorities. While it is not possible at this time to estimate the impact that COVID-19 could have on our business, the COVID-19 pandemic and mitigation measures have had and may continue to have an adverse impact on global economic conditions which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition, including impairing our ability to raise capital when needed.\nCOVID-19 has prevented employees from returning to physical offices. In many cases, our potential customers in the government or commercial enterprise-side like to test our software in their labs with their systems and hardware. Potential customers have been unable to do this and that has caused purchase decisions to be delayed as these employees who would be testing are now working from their homes and can\u2019t simulate test environments. COVID-19 has further led to a distributed work environment. Decision makers are now working from their homes, from all different parts of a state or country. Some have weak or no Internet connections, making it harder to review paperwork to decide on a large financial purchase. Some decision makers want to have more conversations with more people, and mull over decisions longer, versus in the past, when an individual could walk into a decision makers office and garner more rapid approval. Some countries have limits on how many people are permitted to gather in one meeting or have been hit particularly hard with many residents suffering and dying from the COVID-19 virus. There is a new paradigm emerging in making critical decisions from a video conference calls versus in person.\nAn economic recession had set in from the pandemic in 2020. Some companies are not receiving payments and in turn are not making payments to us, causing impairments in our ability to pay others. COVID-19 has led to some of our customers and potential customers being stricken with the virus causing them to not be able to work for many weeks and therefore causing delays for us in our projects or decisions. Technology partners have slowed down and/or laid off employees, impacting us downstream because decisions makers have been furloughed or the work has been passed to new employees who need to come up to speed on a particular project. The closing/downsizing of our offices due to COVID-19 has further caused employees to work from home on unsecured personal Wifi networks, and as such, working from home may cause security breaches such as malware, ransomware, and Phishing attempts. These attempts in some cases have knocked out their ability to have a connection and be able to work until their IT department resolves their issues.\nThis outbreak could decrease spending, adversely affect demand for the Company\u2019s products, and harm the Company\u2019s business and results of operations. It is not possible for the Company to predict the duration or magnitude of the adverse results of the outbreak and its effects on the Company\u2019s business or results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity, at this time.\nWe depend on key personnel, the loss of any of whom could materially adversely affect future operations.\nOur success will depend to a significant extent upon the efforts and abilities of our executive officers and other key personnel. The loss of the services of one or more of these key employees and any negative market or industry perception arising from the loss of such services could have a material adverse effect on us and the trading price of our Common Stock. Our business will also be dependent upon our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel. Acquiring and keeping these personnel could prove more difficult or cost substantially more than estimated and we cannot be certain that we will be able to retain such personnel or attract a high caliber of personnel in the future.",

Using human characteristics that are unique to us all, the Company creates software that provides a highly reliable indication of a person\u2019s identity. The Company\u2019s products are used to manage and issue secure credentials, including national IDs, passports, driver licenses and access control credentials. The Company\u2019s products also provide law enforcement with integrated mugshot, fingerprint LiveScan and investigative capabilities. The Company also provides comprehensive authentication security software using biometrics to secure physical and logical access to facilities or computer networks or Internet sites. Biometric technology is now an integral part of all markets the Company addresses, and all the products leveraged by our patented IWS Biometric Engine\u00ae\nThe IWS Biometric Engine\u00ae is a patented biometric identity and authentication database built for multi-biometric enrollment, management and authentication. It is hardware agnostic and can utilize different types of biometric algorithms. It allows different types of biometrics to be operated at the same time on a seamlessly integrated platform. It is also offered as a Software Development Kit (\u201cSDK\u201d), enabling developers and system integrators to implement biometric solutions or integrate biometric capabilities into existing applications.\u202f\nOur secure credential solutions empower customers to design and create smart digital identification wristbands and badges for access control systems. We develop, sell and support software and design systems that utilize digital imaging and biometrics for photo identification cards, credentials and identification systems. Our products in this market consist of IWS EPI Suite and IWS EPI Builder. These products allow for production of digital identification badges and related databases and records and can be used by, among others, schools, airports, hospitals, corporations and governments. We have added the ability to incorporate multiple biometrics into the ID systems with the integration of IWS Biometric Engine\u00ae.\nThe Company is also a developer of a biometric based multi-factor authentication (MFA) Cloud-based service. ImageWare Authenticate brings together Cloud and mobile technologies to offer multi-factor authentication for the enterprise, and across industries. ImageWare Authenticate consists of mobile and desktop clients, and the backend system which is a Cloud-based Software-as-a-Service (\u201cSaaS\u201d) servicing Cloud-based biometric template matching requests. ImageWare Authenticate comes in two offerings, Workforce and Customer. ImageWare Authenticate Customer is leveraged by product developers to enable biometric authentication for their consumers.

These integrations provide multi-modal biometric authentication to replace or augment passwords for use with enterprise and consumer class systems.\nOur law enforcement solutions enable agencies to quickly capture, archive, search, retrieve, and share digital images, fingerprints and other biometrics, as well as criminal history records on a stand-alone, networked, wireless or Web-based platform. We develop, sell and support a suite of modular software products used by law enforcement and public safety agencies to create and manage criminal history records and to investigate crime. Our IWS Law Enforcement solution consists of five software modules: Capture and Investigative modules, which provide a criminal booking system with related databases as well as the ability to create and print mug photo/scars, marks, and tattoos (SMT), as well as image lineups and electronic mug-books; a Facial Recognition module, which uses biometric facial recognition to identify suspects; a Web module, which provides access to centrally stored records over the Internet in a connected or wireless fashion; and a LiveScan module, which incorporates LiveScan capabilities into IWS Law Enforcement platform providing integrated fingerprint and palm print biometric management for civil and law enforcement use. The IWS Biometric Engine\u00ae is also available to our law enforcement clients and allows them to capture and search using multiple biometrics.\nRecent Market Conditions\nDuring March 2020, a global pandemic was declared by the World Health Organization related to the rapidly growing outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d).\nThe pandemic has significantly impacted the economic conditions both in the United States and worldwide, with accelerated effects in February 2020 through the date of this Annual Report, as federal, state and local governments react to the public health crisis, creating significant uncertainties in both the worldwide and the United States economies. The situation is rapidly changing and additional impacts to our business may arise that we are not aware of currently. We cannot predict whether, when or the manner in which the conditions surrounding COVID-19 will change including the timing of lifting any restrictions or office closure requirements.\nThe full extent of COVID-19\u2019s impact on our operations and financial performance depends on future developments that are uncertain and unpredictable, including the duration and spread of the pandemic, its impact on capital and financial markets and any new information that may emerge concerning the severity of the virus, its spread to other regions as well as the actions taken to contain it, among others.\nOn March 27, 2020, President Trump signed into law the \u201cCoronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (\u201cCARES Act\u201d). The CARES Act, among other things, includes provisions relating to refundable payroll tax credits, deferment of employer side social security payments, net operating loss carryback periods, alternative minimum tax credit refunds, modifications to the net interest deduction limitations, increased limitations on qualified charitable contributions and technical corrections to tax depreciation methods for qualified improvement property.\nThe Company continues to examine the impact that the CARES Act may have on our business. Currently the Company is unable to determine the impact that the CARES Act will have on our financial condition, results of operation or liquidity.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\u201cGAAP\u201d). The preparation of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires us to utilize accounting policies and make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingencies as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during a fiscal period. The SEC considers an accounting policy to be critical if it is important to a company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations, and if it requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application.\nSignificant estimates include the evaluation of our ability to continue as a going concern, the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable, assumptions used in the Black-Scholes model to calculate the fair value of share-based payments, fair value of Series D Preferred and financial instruments issued with and affected by the Series D Preferred Financing (defined below), fair value of financial instruments with and affected by the Series C Preferred (defined below), fair value of Series A Preferred (defined below), fair value of Series A-1 Preferred (defined below), assumptions used in the application of revenue recognition policies, assumptions used in the derivation of the Company\u2019s incremental borrowing rate used in the computation of the Company\u2019s operating lease liabilities and assumptions used in the application of fair value methodologies to calculate the fair value of pension assets and obligations. Actual results could differ from estimates.\nThe following are our critical accounting policies because we believe they are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require critical management judgments and estimates about matters that are uncertain. If actual results or events differ materially from those contemplated by us in making these estimates, our reported financial condition and results of operations for future periods could be materially affected.\nRevenue Recognition. Effective January 1, 2018, we adopted Accounting Standards Codification (\u201cASC\u201d), Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (\u201cASC 606\u201d), using the modified retrospective transition method.\nIn accordance with ASC 606, revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services.\nThe core principle of the standard is that we should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. To achieve that core principle, we apply the following five step model:\n1.\nIdentify the contract with the customer;\n2.\nIdentify the performance obligation in the contract;\n3.\nDetermine the transaction price;\n4.\nAllocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and\n5.\nRecognize revenue when (or as) each performance obligation is satisfied.\nAt contract inception, we assess the goods and services promised in a contract with a customer and identify as a performance obligation each promise to transfer to the customer either: (i) a good or service (or a bundle of goods or services) that is distinct or (ii) a series of distinct goods or services that are substantially the same and that have the same pattern of transfer to the customer. We recognize revenue only when we satisfy a performance obligation by transferring a promised good or service to a customer.\nDetermining the timing of the satisfaction of performance obligations as well as the transaction price and the amounts allocated to performance obligations requires judgement.\nWe disclose disaggregation of our customer revenue by classes of similar products and services as follows:\n\u25cf\nSoftware licensing and royalties;\n\u25cf\nSales of computer hardware and identification media;\n\u25cf\nServices; and\n\u25cf\nPost-contract customer support.\nSoftware licensing and royalties\nSoftware licenses consist of revenue from the sale of software for identity management applications. Our software licenses are functional intellectual property and typically provide customers with the right to use our software in perpetuity as it exists when made available to the customer. We recognize revenue from software licensing at a point in time upon delivery, provided all other revenue recognition criteria are met.\nRoyalties consist of revenue from usage-based arrangements and guaranteed minimum-based arrangements. We recognize revenue for royalty arrangements at the later of (i) when the related sales occur, or (ii) when the performance obligation to which some or all of the royalty has been allocated has been satisfied.\nComputer hardware and identification media\nWe generate revenue from the sale of computer hardware and identification media. Revenue for these items is recognized upon delivery of these products to the customer, provided all other revenue recognition criteria are met.\nServices\nServices revenue is comprised primarily of software customization services, software integration services, system installation services and customer training. Revenue is generally recognized upon completion of services and customer acceptance provided all other revenue recognition criteria are met.\nPost-contract customer support (\u201cPCS\u201d)\nPCS consists of maintenance on software and hardware for our identity management solutions. We recognize PCS revenue from periodic maintenance agreements. Revenue is generally recognized ratably over the respective maintenance periods provided no significant obligations remain. Costs related to such contracts are expensed as incurred.\nArrangements with multiple performance obligations\nA performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer. In addition to selling software licenses, hardware and identification media, services and post-contract customer support on a standalone basis, certain contracts include multiple performance obligations. For such arrangements, we allocate revenue to each performance obligation based on our best estimate of the relative standalone selling price. The standalone selling price for a performance obligation is the price at which we would sell a promised good or service separately to a customer. The primary methods used to estimate standalone selling price are as follows: (i) the expected cost-plus margin approach, under which we forecast our expected costs of satisfying a performance obligation and then add an appropriate margin for that distinct good or service and (ii) the percent discount off of list price approach.\nContract costs\nWe recognize an asset for the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer if we expect the benefit of those costs to be longer than one year. We apply a practical expedient to expense costs as incurred for costs to obtain a contract when the amortization period is one year or less.\nOther items\nWe do not offer rights of return for our products and services in the normal course of business.\nSales tax collected from customers is excluded from revenue.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts. We provide an allowance for our accounts receivable for estimated losses that may result from our customers\u2019 inability to pay. We determine the amount of allowance by analyzing historical losses, customer concentrations, customer creditworthiness, current economic trends, and the age of the accounts receivable balances and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts.\nImpairment of Goodwill, Other Intangible and Long-Lived Assets. The Company accounts for its intangible assets under the provisions of ASC 350, \u201cIntangibles - Goodwill and Other\u201d. In accordance with ASC 350, intangible assets with a definite life are analyzed for impairment under ASC 360-10-05 \u201cProperty, Plant and Equipment\u201d and intangible assets with an indefinite life are analyzed for impairment under ASC 360 annually, or more often if circumstances dictate. The Company performs its annual simplified impairment test in the fourth quarter of each year. In December 2018, the Company adopted the provisions of ASU 2017-04, \u201cIntangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment\u201d. The provisions of ASU 2017-04 eliminate the requirement to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill to measure a goodwill impairment charge. Instead, entities will record an impairment charge based on the excess of a reporting unit's carrying amount over its fair value. Entities that have reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts will no longer be required to perform a qualitative assessment assuming they pass the simplified impairment test.\nThe Company did not record any goodwill impairment charges for the years ended December 31, 2020 or 2019.\nThe Company evaluates long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate their net book value may not be recoverable. When such factors and circumstances exist, the Company compares the projected undiscounted future cash flows associated with the related asset or group of assets over their estimated useful lives against their respective carrying amount. Impairment, if any, is based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value, based on market value when available, or discounted expected cash flows, of those assets and is recorded in the period in which the determination is made. The Company\u2019s management currently believes there is no impairment of its long-lived assets. There can be no assurance, however, that market conditions will not change or demand for the Company\u2019s products under development will continue. Either of these could result in future impairment of long-lived assets.\nThere are many management assumptions and estimates underlying the determination of an impairment loss, and estimates using different, but reasonable, assumptions could produce significantly different results. Significant assumptions include estimates of future levels of revenue and operating expense. Therefore, the timing and recognition of impairment losses by us in the future, if any, may be highly dependent upon our estimates and assumptions. There can be no assurance that goodwill impairment will not occur in the future.\nStock-Based Compensation. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company had one stock-based compensation plan for employees and nonemployee directors, which authorizes the granting of various equity-based incentives including stock options and restricted stock.\nThe Company estimates the fair value of its stock options using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model, consistent with the provisions of ASC 718, \u201cCompensation - Stock Compensation\u201d. The fair value of stock options granted is recognized to expense over the requisite service period. Stock-based compensation expense for all share-based payment awards is recognized using the straight-line single-option method. Stock-based compensation expense is reported in general and administrative, sales and marketing, engineering and customer service expense based upon the departments to which substantially all of the associated employees report and credited to additional paid-in capital.\nASC 718 requires the use of a valuation model to calculate the fair value of stock-based awards. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company has elected to use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which incorporates various assumptions including volatility, expected life, and interest rates. The Company is required to make various assumptions in the application of the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Company has determined that the best measure of expected volatility is based on the historical weekly volatility of the Company\u2019s Common Stock. Historical volatility factors utilized in the Company\u2019s Black-Scholes computations for options granted during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 ranged from 57% and 83%. The Company has elected to estimate the expected life of an award based upon the SEC approved \u201csimplified method\u201d noted under the provisions of Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 14. The expected term used by the Company to value the grants issued in 2020 and 2019 as computed by this method was 5.17 years. The effect of the difference between the actual historical expected life and the simplified method was immaterial. The interest rate used is the risk-free interest rate and is based upon U.S. Treasury rates appropriate for the expected term. Interest rates used in the Company\u2019s Black-Scholes calculations averaged 2.58% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. Dividend yield is zero, as the Company does not expect to declare any dividends on the Company\u2019s common shares in the foreseeable future.\nIn addition to the key assumptions used in the Black-Scholes model, the estimated forfeiture rate at the time of valuation is a critical assumption. The Company has estimated an annualized forfeiture rate of approximately 5.0% for corporate officers, 4.1% for members of the Board of Directors and 15.0% for all other employees. The Company reviews the expected forfeiture rate annually to determine if that percent is still reasonable based on historical experience.\nIncome Taxes. The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740, \u201cAccounting for Income Taxes\u201d. Deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences related to temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for tax purposes at each year-end, based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. A valuation allowance is established when necessary based on the weight of available evidence, if it is considered more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Income tax expense is the sum of current income tax plus the change in deferred tax assets and liabilities.\nASC 740-10 requires a company to first determine whether it is more-likely-than-not (defined as a likelihood of more than fifty percent) that a tax position will be sustained based on its technical merits as of the reporting date, assuming that taxing authorities will examine the position and have full knowledge of all relevant information. A tax position that meets this more-likely-than-not threshold is then measured and recognized at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely to be realized upon effective settlement with a taxing authority.\nWe recognize and measure uncertain tax positions in accordance with GAAP, pursuant to which we only recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. Any tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We report a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. GAAP further requires that a change in judgment related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions be recognized in earnings in the quarter of such change. We recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.\nWe file annual income tax returns in multiple taxing jurisdictions around the world. A number of years may elapse before an uncertain tax position is audited and finally resolved. While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular uncertain tax position, we believe that our analysis of income tax reserves reflects the most likely outcome. We adjust these reserves, if any, as well as the related interest, in light of changing facts and circumstances. Settlement of any particular position could require the use of cash.\nSignificant judgment is required in evaluating the Company\u2019s uncertain tax positions and determining the Company\u2019s provision for income taxes. No assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in the Company\u2019s historical income tax provisions and accruals. The Company adjusts these items in light of changing facts and circumstances. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made.\nThe Internal Revenue Code (the \u201cRevenue Code\u201d) limits the availability of certain tax credits and net operating losses that arose prior to certain cumulative changes in a corporation\u2019s ownership resulting in a change of control of the Company. The Company\u2019s use of its net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards will be significantly limited because the Company believes it underwent \u201cownership changes\u201d, as defined under Section 382 of the Revenue Code, in 1991, 1995, 2000, 2003, 2004, 2011, 2012, 2018 and 2020, though the Company has not performed a study to determine the limitation. The Company has reduced its deferred tax assets to zero relating to its federal and state research credits because of such limitations. The Company continues to disclose the tax effect of the net operating loss carryforwards at their original amount as the actual limitation has not yet been quantified. The Company has also established a full valuation allowance for substantially all deferred tax assets due to uncertainties surrounding its ability to generate future taxable income to realize these assets. Since substantially all deferred tax assets are fully reserved, future changes in tax benefits will not impact the effective tax rate. Management periodically evaluates the recoverability of the deferred tax assets. If it is determined at some time in the future that it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will be realized, the valuation allowance would be reduced accordingly at that time.\nOn March 27, 2020, President Trump signed the CARES Act into law, which, among other things, includes provisions relating to refundable payroll tax credits, deferment of employer side social security payments, net operating loss carryback periods, alternative minimum tax credit refunds, modifications to the net interest deduction limitations, increased limitations on qualified charitable contributions and technical corrections to tax depreciation methods for qualified improvement property.\nThe Company continues to examine the impact that the CARES Act may have on our business. Currently the Company is unable to determine the impact that the CARES Act will have on our financial condition, results of operation or liquidity.\nFair-Value Measurements. The Company accounts for fair value measurements in accordance with ASC 820, \u201cFair Value Measurements and Disclosures\u201d, which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.\nASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy under ASC 820 are described below:\nLevel 1- Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities.\nLevel 2- Applies to assets or liabilities for which there are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions (less active markets); or model-derived valuations in which significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data.\nLevel 3- Prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable (supported by little or no market activity).\nAssessing the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment, considering factors specific to the asset or liability. Determining whether a fair value measurement is based on Level 1, Level 2, or Level 3 inputs is important because certain disclosures are applicable only to those fair value measurements that use Level 3 inputs. The use of Level 3 inputs may include information derived through extrapolation or interpolation which involves management assumptions as well as valuation techniques employing Monte Carlo simulation methodologies.\nLease Liabilities and Operating Lease Right-of-Use Assets\nThe Company is a party to certain contractual arrangements for office space which meet the definition of leases under Accounting Standards Codification (\u201cASC\u201d) Topic 842 - Leases (\u201cASC 842\u201d). In accordance with ASC 842, the Company has determined that such arrangements are operating leases and accordingly the Company has, as of January 1, 2019, recorded operating lease right-of-use assets and related lease liability for the present value of the lease payments over the lease terms using the Company\u2019s estimated weighted-average incremental borrowing rate of approximately 14.5%. The Company has utilized the practical expedient regarding lease and nonlease components and has combined such items into a single combined component. The Company has also utilized the practical expedient regarding leases of twelve months or less and has excluded such leases from its computation of lease liability and related right-of-use assets. The Company has also elected the optional transition package of practical expedients which include:\nA package of practical expedient to not reassess:\n\u25cf\nWhether a contract is or contains a lease\n\u25cf\nLease classification\n\u25cf\nInitial direct costs\nFor a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies, see Note 2 to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended December 31, 2020.\nComparison of Results for Fiscal Years Ended December 31, 2020 and\nProduct Revenue\nTwelve Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nNet Product Revenue\n$ Change\n% Change\n(dollars in thousands)\nSoftware and royalties\n$872\n$489\n$383\n78%\nPercentage of total net product revenue\n39%\n53%\nHardware and consumables\n$84\n$96\n$(12)\n(13)%\nPercentage of total net product revenue\n4%\n10%\nServices\n$1,275\n$338\n$937\n277%\nPercentage of total net product revenue\n57%\n37%\nTotal net product revenue\n$2,231\n$923\n$1,308\n142%\nSoftware and royalty revenue increased 78% or approximately $383,000 during the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the corresponding period in 2019. This increase is attributable to higher identification project related revenue of approximately $539,000, offset by lower law enforcement project related revenue of approximately $11,000, lower royalty revenue of approximately $116,000 and lower sales of boxed identity management software sold through our distribution channel of approximately $29,000. The increase in identification project related revenue is reflective of the expansion of the Company\u2019s identity management software base combined with the sale of additional software licenses into existing identification projects caused by increased end-user utilization during the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the corresponding period in 2019. The decrease in our law enforcement project revenue resulted from a decrease in the timing of procurement by our law enforcement customers. The decrease in boxed identity management software sold through our distribution channel reflects slightly lower procurement from both domestic and international customers and the decrease in royalty revenue reflects the expiration of a minimum royalty contract.\nRevenue from the sale of hardware and consumables decreased approximately $12,000 during the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the corresponding period in 2019 due to a decrease in project related solutions containing hardware and consumable sales primarily to law enforcement customers.\nServices revenue is comprised primarily of software integration services, system installation services and customer training. Such revenue increased $937,000 during the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the corresponding period in 2019, due to an increase in the service element of project related work completed during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nWe believe that the period-to-period fluctuations of identity management software revenue in project-oriented solutions are largely due to the timing of government procurement with respect to the various programs we are pursuing. Although no assurances can be given, based on management\u2019s current visibility into the timing of potential government procurements and potential partnerships and current pilot programs, we believe that we will see an increase in government procurement and implementations with respect to identity management initiatives; however, government procurement initiatives, implementations and pilots are frequently delayed and extended and we cannot predict the timing of such initiatives.\nAs discussed more fully elsewhere in this Annual Report, the full extent of COVID-19\u2019s impact on our operations and financial performance depends on future developments that are uncertain and unpredictable, including the duration and spread of the pandemic, its impact our ability to close sales transactions and on capital and financial markets and any new information that may emerge concerning the severity of the virus, its spread to other regions as well as the actions taken to contain it, among others.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we have focused on strategically updating our products with the latest mobile and cloud technology prioritized by market opportunities. We relaunched ImageWare Authenticate (formerly GoVerify ID\u00ae) in July 2020. This relaunch includes a new container and microservices-based architecture along with refreshed mobile and desktop clients. We believe these updates will result in additional customers implementing our ImageWare Authenticate solution. Additionally, we have focused on the integration of the suite of products that comprise our Identity Platform. Throughout 2021 we plan to continue to enhance our Identity Platform products, including our EPI (our biometric smart access cards) and law enforcement offerings by leveraging cloud and mobile technologies to improve both functionality and value to the customer. Management believes that these initiatives will result in the expansion of our solutions into both law enforcement and non-governmental sectors including commercial, consumer and healthcare applications, further resulting in additional implementations of both our ImageWare Authenticate products and Identity Platform products.\nMaintenance Revenue\nTwelve Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nMaintenance Revenue\n$ Change\n% Change\n(dollars in thousands)\nTotal maintenance revenue\n$2,554\n$2,583\n$(29)\n(1)%\nMaintenance revenue was approximately $2,554,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to approximately $2,583,000 for the corresponding periods in 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2020, identity management maintenance revenue was approximately $1,264,000 as compared to $1,275,000 for the comparable period in 2019. The decrease of $11,000 in identification software maintenance revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the corresponding period of 2019 is reflective of the expiration of certain maintenance contracts combined with the timing of the commencement of maintenance services related to a certain customer. The decrease of $18,000 in law enforcement maintenance revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the corresponding period of 2019 is reflective of the expiration of certain maintenance contracts.\nWe anticipate growth of our maintenance revenue through the retention of existing customers combined with the expansion of our installed base resulting from the completion of project-oriented work; however, we cannot predict the timing of this anticipated growth.\nCost of Product Revenue\nTwelve Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nCost of Product Revenue:\n$ Change\n% Change\n(dollars in thousands)\nSoftware and royalties\n$54\n$36\n$18\n50%\nPercentage of software and royalty product revenue\n6%\n7%\nHardware and consumables\n$52\n$66\n$(14)\n(21)%\nPercentage of hardware and consumables product revenue\n62%\n69%\nServices\n$694\n$116\n$578\n498%\nPercentage of services product revenue\n54%\n34%\nTotal product cost of revenue\n$800\n$218\n$582\n267%\nPercentage of total product revenue\n36%\n24%\nThe cost of software and royalty product revenue increased approximately $18,000 from higher software and royalty revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 of approximately $383,000 due to a significant percentage of the revenue increase containing solutions with extremely minimal third-party software costs. In addition to changes in costs of software and royalty product revenue caused by revenue level fluctuations, costs of products can vary as a percentage of product revenue from period to period depending upon level of software customization and third-party software license content included in product sales during a given period.\nThe cost of product revenue for our hardware and consumable sales during the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased approximately $14,000 as compared to the corresponding period in 2019 due primarily to lower hardware and consumable product revenue of approximately $12,000 during the 2020 period.\nThe cost of services revenue increased approximately $578,000 during the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the corresponding period in 2019 due to higher service revenue of approximately $937,000. Cost of services revenue as a percentage of service revenue increased to 54% for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 34% for the corresponding 2019 period. This increase reflects the one-time impact of additional service costs incurred in the completion of the service element for a particular customer. Although changes in costs of services product revenue are sometimes caused by revenue level fluctuations, costs of services can also vary as a percentage of service revenue from period to period depending upon both the level and complexity of professional service resources utilized in the completion of the service element.\nCost of Maintenance Revenue\nMaintenance cost of revenue\nTwelve Months Ended\nDecember 31,\n(dollars in thousands)\n$ Change\n% Change\nTotal maintenance cost of revenue\n$448\n$425\n$23\n5%\nPercentage of total maintenance revenue\n18%\n16%\nCost of maintenance revenue increased approximately $23,000 during the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the corresponding period in 2019 despite lower maintenance revenue of approximately $29,000. This increase is reflective of higher maintenance labor costs incurred during the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the corresponding period in 2019 due primarily to the composition of engineering resources used in the provision of maintenance services.\nProduct Gross Profit\nTwelve Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nProduct gross profit\n$ Change\n% Change\n(dollars in thousands)\nSoftware and royalties\n$818\n$453\n$365\n81%\nPercentage of software and royalty product revenue\n94%\n93%\nHardware and consumables\n$32\n$30\n$2\n7%\nPercentage of hardware and consumables product revenue\n38%\n31%\nServices\n$581\n$222\n$359\n162%\nPercentage of services product revenue\n46%\n66%\nTotal product gross profit\n$1,431\n$705\n$726\n103%\nPercentage of total product revenue\n64%\n76%\nSoftware and royalty gross profit increased 81% or approximately $365,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the corresponding period in 2019, due primarily to higher software and royalty revenue of approximately $383,000 combined with higher software and royalty cost of revenue of $18,000 for the same period. This revenue increase with only a minimal increase in software and royalty cost of revenue reflects extremely low third-party software costs. In addition to changes in costs of software and royalty product revenue caused by revenue level fluctuations, costs of products can vary as a percentage of product revenue from period to period depending upon level of software customization and third-party software license content included in product sales during a given period.\nHardware and consumables gross profit increased approximately $2,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the 2019 period, due primarily to lower hardware and consumable revenue of approximately $12,000 combined with lower cost of hardware and consumable revenue of approximately $14,000. These decreases result from a decrease in project related solutions containing hardware and consumable components.\nServices gross profit increased approximately $359,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the corresponding period in 2019 due to higher service revenue of approximately $937,000 combined with higher service cost of revenue of $578,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the corresponding period in 2019. The decrease in services gross profit as a percentage of services revenue from 66% in the year ended December 31, 2019 to 46% in the corresponding period of 2020 reflects the one-time impact of additional service costs incurred in the completion of the service element for a particular customer. Although changes in costs of services product revenue are sometimes caused by revenue level fluctuations, costs of services can also vary as a percentage of service revenue from period to period depending upon both the level and complexity of professional service resources utilized in the completion of the service element.\nMaintenance Gross Profit\nMaintenance gross profit\nTwelve Months Ended\nDecember 31,\n(dollars in thousands)\n$ Change\n% Change\nTotal maintenance gross profit\n$2,106\n$2,158\n$(52)\n(2)%\nPercentage of total maintenance revenue\n82%\n84%\nGross profit related to maintenance revenue decreased 2% or approximately $52,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the corresponding period in 2019. This decrease reflects lower maintenance revenue of approximately $29,000 combined with higher cost of maintenance revenue of approximately $23,000. The decrease in maintenance revenue results from the timing of maintenance revenue recognition related to a certain customer combined with the expiration of certain maintenance contracts. The increase cost of maintenance revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the corresponding period in 2019 is due primarily to the composition of engineering resources used in the provision of maintenance services. The decrease in maintenance revenue results from the timing of maintenance revenue recognition related to a certain contract.

General legal, accounting and consulting services, insurance, occupancy and communication costs are also included with general and administrative expense.\nThe dollar increase of approximately $488,000 in general and administrative expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the corresponding period in 2019 is comprised of the following major components:\n\u25cf\nOverall decrease in personnel related expense of approximately $55,000 is due to reductions in employer contributions to employee benefit plans of approximately $230,000 offset by higher personnel expenses of approximately $175,000 due to the effects of various senior management changes;\n\u25cf\nIncreases in professional services of approximately $252,000 which includes higher legal fees of approximately $197,000, higher patent-related legal and other fees of approximately $155,000 resulting from the Company\u2019s efforts to monetize certain patents, higher contractor and contract service expenses of approximately $23,000 and higher general corporate expense of $16,000 offset by reductions in Board of Director fees of approximately $6,000, lower investor and public relations fees of approximately $106,000 and lower audit fees of approximately $27,000,\n\u25cf\nIncrease in insurances, licenses, dues, rent, office related costs and other of approximately $21,000;\n\u25cf\nIncrease in financing expense of approximately $66,000; and\n\u25cf\nIncrease in stock-based compensation expense related to options and restricted stock units (\"RSU\u2019s\") of approximately $204,000.\nWe continue to focus our efforts on achieving additional future operating efficiencies by reviewing and improving upon existing business processes and evaluating our cost structure. We believe these efforts will allow us to continue to gradually decrease our level of general and administrative expense expressed as a percentage of total revenue.\nSales and Marketing Expense\nSales and marketing expense consists primarily of the salaries, commissions, other incentive compensation, employee benefits and travel expense of our sales, marketing, and business development personnel.\nThe dollar decrease of approximately $1,001,000 during the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the corresponding period in 2019 is primarily comprised of the following major components:\n\u25cf\nDecrease in personnel related expense of approximately $369,000 driven primarily by headcount reductions;\n\u25cf\nDecrease in contractor and contract services of approximately $388,000 resulting from lower contract service expense of approximately $303,000 which includes lower dues and subscription expense, and reduced utilization of certain sales consultants of approximately $85,000.;\n\u25cf\nDecrease in travel, trade show expense and office related expense of approximately $257,000;\n\u25cf\nDecrease in stock-based compensation expense of approximately $45,000; and\n\u25cf\nIncrease in our Mexico sales office expense of approximately $58,000 due to certain personnel separation expenses.\nResearch and Development Expense\nResearch and development expense consists primarily of salaries, employee benefits and outside contractors for new product development, product enhancements, custom integration work and related facility costs.\nResearch and development expense decreased approximately $1,782,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the corresponding period in 2019, due primarily to the following major components:\n\u25cf\nDecrease in personnel related expense of approximately $1,092,000 due to headcount reductions;\n\u25cf\nDecrease in contractor fees and contract services of approximately $537,000;\n\u25cf\nDecrease in rent, office related expense and engineering tools and supplies of approximately $128,000; and\n\u25cf\nDecrease in stock based-compensation expense of approximately $25,000.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, depreciation and amortization expense increased approximately $1,000 as compared to the corresponding period in 2019. The relatively small amount of depreciation and amortization reflects the relatively small property and equipment carrying value.\nInterest Expense (Income), Net\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized interest income of $2,000 and interest expense of $104,000. Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 was comprised of approximately $94,000 on our related party notes payable and approximately $10,000 on notes payable under the PPP Loan program. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we recognized interest income of $90,000 and interest expense of $0.\nOther Expense\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized other income of approximately $0 and other expense of approximately $4,000. Other expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 is comprised of approximately $4,000 in late payment penalty fees.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, we recognized other income of approximately $0 and other expense of $1,000. Other expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 is comprised of approximately $1,000 in foreign transaction expense.\nChange in Fair Value of Derivative Liabilities\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized approximately $369,000 from the decrease of derivative liabilities arising from the consummation of the Series C Convertible Preferred Stock financing in September 2019 (\u201cSeries C Financing\u201d). Such decrease was determined by management using fair value methodologies and is included as non-cash income under the caption \u201cChange in fair value of derivative liabilities\u201d in our consolidated statement of operations for twelve months ended December 31, 2020. Also for the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized approximately $1,883,000 from the change in fair value of derivative liabilities arising from the Series D Financing. Such decrease was determined by management using fair value methodologies and is included as non-cash income under the caption \u201cChange in fair value of derivative liabilities\u201d in our consolidated statement of operations for twelve months ended December 31, 2020.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, we recognized approximately $696,000 from the decrease of derivative liabilities arising from the consummation of the Series C Financing in September 2019. Such decrease was determined by management using fair value methodologies and is included as non-cash income under the caption \u201cChange in fair value of derivative liabilities\u201d in our consolidated statement of operations for twelve months ended December 31, 2019.\nIncome Tax Expense\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we recorded an expense for income taxes of $7,000 and $10,000, respectively. These tax expenses relate to taxes on income generated in certain foreign jurisdictions offset by research and development tax credits generated in certain foreign jurisdictions.\nWe have incurred consolidated pre-tax losses during the years ended December 31, 2020, and 2019, and have incurred operating losses in all prior periods. Management has determined that it is more likely than not that a tax benefit from such losses will not be realized and has established a full valuation allowance for any tax benefits. Accordingly, we did not record a benefit for income taxes for these periods.\nLiquidity, Capital Resources and Going Concern\nHistorically, our principal sources of cash have included customer payments from the sale of our products, proceeds from the issuance of common and preferred stock and proceeds from the issuance of debt. Our principal uses of cash have included cash used in operations, product development, and payments relating to purchases of property and equipment. We expect that our principal uses of cash in the future will be for product development, including customization of identity management products for enterprise and consumer applications, further development of intellectual property, development of SaaS capabilities for existing products as well as general working capital. Management expects that, as our revenue grows, our sales and marketing and research and development expense will continue to grow, albeit at a slower rate and, as a result, we will need to generate significant net revenue to achieve and sustain income from operations.\nLincoln Park Capital Fund, LLC\nOn April 28, 2020, the Company entered into a purchase agreement, and as amended on June 11, 2020 (the \u201cLincoln Purchase Agreement\u201d), and a registration rights agreement (the \u201cLincoln Registration Rights Agreement\u201d) with Lincoln Park Capital fund, LLC (\u201cLincoln Park\u201d) pursuant to which Lincoln Park committed to purchase up to $10,250,000 of our Common Stock.\nUnder the terms and subject to the conditions of the Lincoln Purchase Agreement, including stockholder approval of an amendment to the Company\u2019s Certificate of Incorporation, as amended from time to time (the \"Certificate of Incorporation\"), to increase the number of shares of the Company\u2019s capital stock to 350 million shares, obtained from our shareholders effective June 9, 2020, we have the right, but not the obligation, to sell to Lincoln Park, and Lincoln Park is obligated to purchase up to $10,250,000 of shares of Common Stock. Future sales of Common Stock under the Lincoln Purchase Agreement, if any, will be subject to certain limitations, and may occur from time to time, at our sole discretion, over the 24-month period commencing on July 8, 2020, and the other conditions set forth in the Purchase Agreement are satisfied (such date on which all of such conditions are satisfied, the \u201cCommencement Date\u201d). During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company sold an aggregate of 5,700,000 shares of Common Stock to Lincoln Park under the terms of the Lincoln Purchase Agreement resulting in gross cash proceeds to the Company of approximately $918,000.\nAfter the Commencement Date, on any business day over the term of the Lincoln Purchase Agreement, the Company has the right, in its sole discretion, to direct Lincoln Park to purchase up to 125,000 shares of its Common Stock on such business day (the \u201cRegular Purchase\u201d), subject to increases under certain circumstances as provided in the Lincoln Purchase Agreement. The purchase price per share of Common Stock for each such Regular Purchase will be based on prevailing market prices of the Company\u2019s Common Stock immediately preceding the time of sale as computed under the Lincoln Purchase Agreement. In each case, Lincoln Park\u2019s maximum commitment in any single Regular Purchase may not exceed $500,000. In addition to Regular Purchases, provided that the Company presents Lincoln Park with a Lincoln Park Purchase Notice for the full amount allowed for a Regular Purchase, the Company may also direct Lincoln Park to make accelerated purchases and additional accelerated purchases as described in the Lincoln Purchase Agreement.\nPursuant to the terms of the Lincoln Purchase Agreement, in no event may the Company issue or sell to Lincoln Park shares of Common Stock under the Lincoln Purchase Agreement which, when aggregated with all other shares of Common Stock then beneficially owned by Lincoln Park and its affiliates (as calculated pursuant to Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and Rule 13d-3 promulgated thereunder), would result in the beneficial ownership by Lincoln Park and its affiliates of more than 4.99% of the then issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock (the \u201cBeneficial Ownership Limitation\u201d).\nThe Lincoln Purchase Agreement and the Lincoln Registration Rights Agreement contain customary representations, warranties, agreements and conditions and indemnification obligations of the parties. The Company has the right to terminate the Purchase Agreement at any time, at no cost or penalty. The Company issued to Lincoln Park 2,500,000 shares of Common Stock in consideration for entering into the Lincoln Purchase Agreement. Pursuant to this issuance, $400,000 was recorded by the Company as a deferred stock issuance cost. Such amount is recorded in the Company\u2019s consolidated balance sheet under the caption \u201cOther assets\u201d. Such deferred stock issuance costs will be recognized as a charge against paid in capital in proportion to securities sold under this Lincoln Purchase Agreement. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recognized approximately $36,000, respectively, as a charge against paid in capital relating to securities sold under the Lincoln Purchase Agreement.\nDue to the terms of the Lincoln Purchase Agreement as described above, management is not currently expecting the related proceeds from the Lincoln Purchase Agreement to be sufficient to sustain operations for an extended period of time.\nSeries D Preferred Stock Financings\nOn November 12, 2020 and December 23, 2020, the Company consummated private placements of 12,060 shares of its Series D Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share (the \"Series D Preferred\"), resulting in gross proceeds to the Company of $12.06 million, less fees and expenses (the \u201cSeries D Financing\u201d). The gross proceeds included approximately $2.2 million in principal amount due and payable under the terms of certain term loans issued by the Company on September 29, 2020 (\u201cBridge Notes\u201d), which Bridge Notes were converted into Series D Preferred at Closing (the \u201cConversion\u201d). The issuance of the Series D Preferred was made pursuant to securities purchase agreements, dated September 28, 2020 (the \"Series D Purchase Agreement\"), by and between the Company and certain accredited investors (the \"Purchasers\"), for the sale of the Series D Preferred at a purchase price of $1,000 per share of Series D Preferred. The holders of Series D Preferred may voluntarily convert their shares of Series D Preferred into shares of the Company\u2019s Common Stock at any time that is at least ninety days following the issuance date, at the conversion price calculated by dividing the Stated Value by the conversion price of $0.0583 per share of Common Stock, subject to adjustments as set forth in Section 5(e) of the Certificate of Designations, Preferences, and Rights of Series D Convertible Preferred Stock (the \"Series D Certificate\"). Dividends on shares of Series D Preferred will be paid prior to any junior securities, and are to be paid at the rate of 4% of the Stated Value (as defined in the Series D Certificate) per share per annum in the form of cash or shares of Series D Preferred.\nConcurrently with the execution of the Purchase Agreement, the Company and the Investors executed (i) a Registration Rights Agreement, pursuant to which the Company agreed to file a registration statement with the SEC within thirty days of closing to register the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Series D Preferred; (ii) a Series C Exchange Agreement (the \"Exchange Agreement\"), pursuant to which the Company and certain holders of the Company\u2019s Series C Preferred agreed to exchange their Series C Preferred, with a liquidation preference of approximately $10.0 million, for Series D Preferred at closing; and (iii) a Term Loan and Security Agreement (\u201cLoan Agreement\u201d), pursuant to which each investor signatory thereto agreed to make a term loan to the Company, secured by all assets of the Company, in an amount equal to 20% of such investor\u2019s purchase commitment as set forth in the Purchase Agreement (\u201cBridge Loan\u201d), which Bridge Loan, plus accrued interest, rolled into, and was used to purchase, Series D Preferred at Closing.\nBridge Loan\nConcurrently with the execution of the Series D Purchase Agreement, the Company and certain investors in the Series D Financing executed the Loan Agreement, pursuant to which each such investor signatory thereto (the \"Investors\") agreed to the Bridge Loan, secured by all assets of the Company, in an amount equal to 20% of such Investor\u2019s purchase commitment as set forth in the Series D Purchase Agreement, which Bridge Loan, plus accrued interest, rolled into, and was used to purchase, Series D Preferred at Closing. For more information regarding the Series D Purchase Agreement, the Investors, the Loan Agreement, and the Bridge Loan, see Note 1, Description of Business and Operations to the consolidated financial statements.\nPursuant to the Bridge Loan, the Company received proceeds of $2,187,000 in September 2020. The Bridge Loan bears interest at a fixed rate of 12% and is due and payable in arrears on the earlier of the Loan Conversion Date, as such term is defined in the Loan Agreement, or six months after the disbursement of the Bridge Loan. All amounts due and payable pursuant to the Bridge Loan are automatically convertible, without further action by the Investors, into shares of Series D Preferred at closing at a purchase price of $1,000 for each share of Series D Preferred. The repayment of all amounts due under the terms of the Loan Agreement are secured by all assets of the Company. On November 12, 2020, contemporaneously with the closing of the Series D Preferred Financing, all amounts due under the Bridge Loan were converted into shares of Series D Preferred Stock.\nGoing Concern and Management\u2019s Plan\nAt December 31, 2020, we had negative working capital of approximately $19,349,000 as compared to negative working capital of approximately $1,653,000 at December 31, 2019. Included in our negative working capital as of December 31, 2020 are $24,128,000 of derivative liabilities which are not required to be settled in cash except in the event of the consummation of a Change of Control or at any time after the fourth anniversary of the Series D Preferred issuance, at which time the holders of the Series D Preferred may require the Company to redeem in cash any or all of the holder\u2019s outstanding Series D Preferred at an amount equal to the Series D Liquidation Preference Amount. At December 31, 2020 the Liquidation Preference Amount totaled $22,863,000.\nOn March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic is affecting the United States and global economies and may affect the Company's operations and those of third parties on which the Company relies. Additionally, as the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic is difficult to assess or predict, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the financial markets may reduce our ability to access capital, which could negatively impact the Company's short-term and long-term liquidity. These effects could have a material impact on the Company's liquidity, capital resources, operations and business and those of the third parties on which the Company relies.\nTo address our working capital requirements, management has instituted several cost cutting measures and has utilized cash proceeds from borrowing under the PPP loan, sales of our Common Shares utilizing the Lincoln Park facility and closing of the Series D Financing to satisfy the Company\u2019s working capital requirements. However, we believe our available cash balances will be insufficient to satisfy our cash requirement for the next twelve months from the date of this filing. To address our working capital requirements, management intends to seek additional equity and/or debt financing through the issuance of additional debt and/or equity securities. Other than the Lincoln Purchase Agreement, there are currently no formal committed financing arrangements to support our projected cash shortfall, including commitments to purchase additional debt and/or equity securities, or other agreements, and no assurances can be given that we will be successful in raising additional capital through the issuance of debt and/or equity securities, or entering into any other transaction that addresses our ability to continue as a going concern.\nHowever, in view of the matters described in the preceding paragraphs, recoverability of a major portion of the recorded asset amounts shown in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet is dependent upon continued operations of the Company, which, in turn, is dependent upon the Company\u2019s ability to generate positive cash flows from operations. The Company, however, operates in markets that are emerging and highly competitive. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain additional capital, operate at a profit or generate positive cash flows in the future. Therefore, management\u2019s plans do not alleviate the substantial doubt regarding the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern.\nThe consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classifications of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.\nOperating Activities\nNet cash used in operating activities was approximately $8,009,000 during the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to $11,267,000 during the year ended December 31, 2019. During the year ended December 31, 2020, net cash used in operating activities consisted of net loss of $7,253,000 and an increase in working capital and other assets and liabilities of $438,000. Those amounts in addition to approximately $1,194,000 of non-cash income, including $2,252,000 in income from the change in fair value of derivative liabilities offset by $862,000 in stock-based compensation, $72,000 in depreciation and amortization and $124,000 from the application of rent deposits. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we generated cash of $690,000 from decreases in current assets offset by $20,000 from increases in our operating leases right-of-use assets and used cash of $410,000 through decreases in current liabilities and deferred revenue offset by increases of $178,000 in pension liability.\nNet cash used in operating activities was $11,267,000 during the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to $10,310,000 during the year ended December 31, 2018. During the year ended December 31, 2019, net cash used in operating activities consisted of net loss of $11,581,000 and an increase in working capital and other assets and liabilities of $287,000. Those amounts were offset by approximately $723,000 of non-cash costs and $696,000 in non-cash income. Non-cash costs were $652,000 in stock-based compensation and $71,000 in depreciation and amortization. Non-cash income consisted of $696,000 in the change in fair value of derivative liabilities. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we used cash of $209,000 from increases in current assets offset by $168,000 from decreases in our operating leases right-of-use assets and generated cash of $357,000 through increases in current liabilities and deferred revenue offset by $32,000 used from decreases in contract costs.\nInvesting Activities\nThere was no net cash used or generated from investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we used cash of $31,000 to fund capital expenditures.\nFinancing Activities\nCash generated from financing activities was approximately $15,475,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020, which consisted of cash of approximately $12,060,000 generated from the sale of 12,060 shares of Series D Preferred. Such amount includes $2,187,000 received by the Company in the form of a Bridge Loan which was converted into shares of Series D Preferred before recognition of approximately $726,000 in cash direct stock issuance costs. We also generated cash of approximately $900,000 from the issuance of related party notes payable and generated cash of $1,571,000 from the issuance of the PPP Loan under the CARES Act. Also in the year ended December 31, 2020, we generated cash of approximately $2,360,000 from the sales of 15,700,000 shares of Common Stock before recognition of approximately $64,000 in direct stock issuance costs. We used cash of approximately $575,000 to repay certain related party notes payable and used cash of approximately $51,000 for the payment of dividends on our Series B Preferred.\nCash generated from financing activities was approximately $6,635,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019, which consisted of cash generated of approximately $166,000 from the exercise of 351,334 stock options resulting in the issuance of 351,334 shares of Common Stock, and cash generated of $6,520,000 from the sale of 5,954,545 shares of Common Stock, offset by cash used of approximately $51,000 for the payment of dividends on our Series B Preferred Stock.\nReal Property Leases\nOur corporate headquarters is located in San Diego, California, where we now occupy approximately 500 square feet of office space at a cost of approximately $2,000 per month. We entered into this facility\u2019s lease in February 2021 and this new lease commenced on March 1, 2021 and is on a month-to-month basis. In addition to our corporate headquarters, we also occupied the following spaces at December 31, 2020:\n\u25cf\n1,508 square feet in Ottawa, Province of Ontario, Canada, at a cost of approximately $3,000 per month until the expiration of the lease on March 31, 2021. The Company extended this lease for a 30-day period and is currently evaluating alternative premises which the Company believes are readily available;\n\u25cf\n9,720 square feet in Portland, Oregon, at a cost of approximately $23,000 per month until the expiration of the lease on February 28, 2023; and\n\u25cf\n183 square feet of office space in Mexico City, Mexico, at a cost of approximately $2,000 per month until September 30, 2021.\nPrior to entering into our current lease agreement in January 2021 and moving our corporate headquarters to a new location, we occupied 8,511 square feet of office space in San Diego, at a cost of approximately $30,000 per month. In January 2021, we entered in a subleasing agreement for our previously occupied corporate headquarters located in San Diego, California. The term of the sublease commences on April 1, 2021 and expires on April 20, 2025 coterminous with the expiration of the Company's master lease. Sublease payments due the Company approximate $26,000 per month over the term of the sublease.\nStock-Based Compensation\nStock-based compensation related to equity options and restricted stock has been classified as follows in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations (in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31,\nCost of revenue\n$15\n$13\nGeneral and administrative\nSales and marketing\nResearch and development\nTotal\n$862\n$643\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAt December 31, 2020, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance, special purpose or variable interest entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. In addition, we did not engage in trading activities involving non-exchange traded contracts. As a result, we are not exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships. We do not have relationships and transactions with persons or entities that derive benefits from their non-independent relationship with us or our related parties except as disclosed elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nFrom time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the \u201cFASB\u201d), or other standard setting bodies, which are adopted by us as of the specified effective date. Unless otherwise discussed, the Company\u2019s management believes the impact of recently issued standards not yet effective will not have a material impact on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements upon adoption. See Note 2 to these consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements.\nImpact of Inflation\nThe primary inflationary factor affecting our operations is labor costs, and we do not believe that inflation has materially affected earnings during the past four years. Substantial increases in costs and expense, particularly labor and operating expense, could have a significant impact on our operating results to the extent that such increases cannot be passed along to customers and end users.",
    "item_7A": "ITEM 7A.\nQUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nOur business extends to countries outside the United States, and we intend to continue to expand our foreign operations. As a result, our revenue and results of operations are affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates, interest rates, and other uncertainties inherent in doing business in more than one currency. In addition, our operations are exposed to risks that are associated with changes in social, political, and economic conditions in the foreign countries in which we operate, including changes in the laws and policies that govern foreign investment, as well as, to a lesser extent, changes in United States laws and regulations relating to foreign trade and investment.\nWe had approximately $23,000 and $104,000 in revenue from sources outside the United States for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We made payments in foreign currencies to fund our foreign operations of approximately $1,015,000 and $983,000 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Changes in currency exchange rates affect the relative prices at which we sell our products and purchase goods and services. Given the uncertainty of exchange rate fluctuations, we cannot estimate the effect of these fluctuations on our future business, product pricing, results of operations, or financial condition. We do not use foreign currency exchange contracts or derivative financial instruments for hedging or speculative purposes. To the extent foreign sales become a more significant part of our business in the future, we may seek to implement strategies which make use of these or other instruments in order to minimize the effects of foreign currency exchange on our business.",

Based on this evaluation, the Company\u2019s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms. In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework.\n(b) Management\u2019s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives.\nOur Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020. In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of December 31, 2020 our internal control over financial reporting was effective.\n(c) Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting.\nThe Company\u2019s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have determined that there have been no changes in the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting during the period covered by this report identified in connection with the evaluation described in the above paragraph that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting.",

Prior to the appointment of Kristin Taylor as President and Chief Executive Officer on March 2, 2020, and during the year ended December 31, 2019, S. James Miller held the roles of both Chief Executive Officer and Chair of the Board since 1996, and our Board believed that at the time, his combined role was advantageous to the Company and its shareholders. Currently, Ms. Taylor serves as both Chief Executive Officer and Chair of the Board as the Board believes, at this time, her combined role is advantageous to the Company and its shareholders.\nThe Board maintains effective independent oversight through a number of governance practices, including open and direct communication with management, input on meeting agendas, and regular executive sessions.\nSection 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance\nSection 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires our directors and executive officers, and persons who beneficially own more than 10% of a registered class of our equity securities, to file with the SEC initial reports of ownership and reports of changes in ownership of our Common Stock and other equity securities. Such persons are required by SEC regulations to furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file. To our knowledge, based solely on a review of the copies of such reports furnished to us and written representations that no other reports were required, during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, all Section 16(a) filing requirements were complied with in a timely manner.\nBoard Role in Risk Assessment\nManagement, in consultation with outside professionals, as applicable, identifies risks associated with the Company\u2019s operations, strategies and financial statements. Risk assessment is also performed through periodic reports received by the Audit Committee from management, counsel and the Company\u2019s independent registered public accountants relating to risk assessment and management. Audit Committee members meet privately in executive sessions with representatives of the Company\u2019s independent registered public accountants. The Board also provides risk oversight through its periodic reviews of the financial and operational performance of the Company.\nCode of Ethics\nThe Company has adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics policy that applies to our directors and employees (including the Company\u2019s principal executive officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer or controller, or persons performing similar functions). The Company intends to promptly disclose (i) the nature of any amendment to this code of ethics that applies to our principal executive officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer or controller, or persons performing similar functions and (ii) the nature of any waiver, including an implicit waiver, from a provision of this code of ethics that is granted to one of these specified individuals, the name of such person who is granted the waiver and the date of the waiver on our website in the future. A copy of our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics can be obtained from our website at http://www.iwsinc.com.\nIndemnification of Officers and Directors\nTo the extent permitted by Delaware law, the Company will indemnify its directors and officers against expenses and liabilities they incur to defend, settle, or satisfy any civil or criminal action brought against them on account of their being or having been Company directors or officers unless, in any such action, they are adjudged to have acted with gross negligence or willful misconduct.",

Lewis was appointed as Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of the Company on January 8, 2021, after the fiscal year end date of December 31, 2020, and therefore has been excluded from the Summary Compensation Table above. On March 23, 2021, Mr. Lewis resigned from his position as Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, effective April 7, 2021.\n(2)\nAll option awards were granted under the Company\u2019s 2020 Plan or the 1999 Plan.\n(3)\nThe amounts presented in this column do not reflect the cash value or realizable value of option grants to the named executive officers during the year ended December 31, 2020 or 2019. During the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, no named executive officer exercised an option and therefore no value was realized during the reporting period. The amounts reflect the grant date fair value of the options awarded in the fiscal years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, in accordance with the provisions of FASB ASC Topic 718. We have elected to use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which incorporates various assumptions including volatility, expected life, and interest rates. We are required to make various assumptions in the application of the Black-Scholes option-pricing model and have determined that the best measure of expected volatility is based on the historical weekly volatility of our Common Stock. Historical volatility factors utilized in our Black-Scholes computations for options granted during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 ranged from 57% to 83%. We have elected to estimate the expected life of an award based upon the SEC approved \u201csimplified method\u201d noted under the provisions of Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 14. The expected term used by the Company during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was 5.17 years. The difference between the actual historical expected life and the simplified method was immaterial. The interest rate used is the risk-free interest rate and is based upon U.S. Treasury rates appropriate for the expected term. Interest rates used in the Company\u2019s Black-Scholes calculations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was 2.58%. Dividend yield is zero, as we do not expect to declare any dividends on shares of our Common Stock in the foreseeable future. In addition to the key assumptions used in the Black-Scholes model, the estimated forfeiture rate at the time of valuation is a critical assumption. We have estimated an annualized forfeiture rate of 5.0% for corporate officers, 4.1% for members of the Board and 15.0% for all other employees. We review the expected forfeiture rate annually to determine if that percent is still reasonable based on historical experience.\n(4)\nMs. Taylor was appointed as the Company\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer on March 2, 2020, and received no compensation prior to her employment. Under the terms of Kristin Taylor\u2019s Employment Agreement, dated March 2, 2020, Ms. Taylor is entitled to an option to purchase 1,750,000 shares of Common Stock, which option has not been granted as of the date of this Annual Report, pending the negotiation of a new grant since the consummation of the offering of Series D Preferred in November 2020.\n(5)\nEffective November 12, 2020, Mr. Miller, Former Chief Executive Officer of the Company, resigned from his position as a member of the Board of Directors of the Company.

In the event of termination of her employment other than by reason of death or disability, or for cause, the employment agreement is also anticipated to provide Ms. Taylor with certain severance payments, including continuation of her salary for the greater of one year or the remaining term under her employment agreement.\nJay Lewis. Mr. Lewis joined the Company as its Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer on January 7, 2021. The Company and Mr. Lewis are parties to a letter agreement, pursuant to which Mr. Lewis will be paid an annual base salary of $240,000.

The option shall vest ratably over a three-year period from the date of grant. As of the date of this Annual Report, the Company has not issued the option.\nOn March 23, 2021, Mr. Lewis resigned from his position as Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, effective April 7, 2021.\nFormer Named Executive Officers\nS. James Miller, Jr. On October 1, 2005, the Company entered into an employment agreement with Mr. Miller, pursuant to which Mr. Miller served as President and Chief Executive Officer until his resignation on March 2, 2020. On March 2, 2020, the Company entered into a Transition Services Agreement (the \u201cTransition Agreement\u201d) with Mr. Miller, whereby Mr. Miller continued to serve the Company as its Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors until May 2, 2021; however, the Transition Agreement was terminated on November 13, 2020, when the Company and Mr. Miller entered into the Consulting Agreement (the \u201cConsulting Agreement\u201d).

Following his resignation, Mr. Harding received his then current salary accrued through the effective date of his resignation, plus accrued compensation in connection with unused vacation.\nFor purposes of the above-referenced agreements, termination for \u201ccause\u201d means the executive\u2019s commission of a criminal act or an act of fraud, embezzlement, breach of trust or other act of gross misconduct; violations of policies or rules of the Company; refusal to follow the direction given by the Company from time to time or breach of any covenant or obligation under the above-referenced agreements or other agreements with the Company; neglect of duty; misappropriation, concealment, or conversion of any money or property of the Company; intentional damage or destruction of property of the Company; reckless conduct which endangers the safety of other persons or property during the course of employment or while on premises leased or owned by the Company; or a breach of any obligation or requirement set forth in the above-referenced agreements.

Under the Factoring Agreement, the Company received $350,000 in proceeds (the \"Factoring Principal\") in the form of a loan, bearing interest at a rate of 1% for every seven days until the Factoring Principal and accrued interest are paid in full, with a maturity date of March 4, 2020. Pursuant to the Factoring Agreement, repayment of the Factoring Principal and accrued interest was secured by certain of the Company\u2019s trade accounts receivable approximating $500,000 (the \"Factoring Collateral\"). During the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded approximately $45,000 in interest expense related to the Factoring Agreement. In May 2020, the Company repaid $35,000 in accrued interest to the Factoring Lender. As a condition to the consummation of the Company's offer and sale (the \"Closing\") of shares of its Series D Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 (\"Series D Preferred\") (the \"Series D Financing\"), the Factoring Lender agreed to settle the entire Factoring Principal plus accrued interest and release the Company from liabilities due under the Factoring Agreement in exchange for a one-time payment of $360,000 (the \"Factoring Settlement\") to be made upon the Closing, and out of the proceeds, of the Series D Financing.

On June 29, 2020, the Company executed a promissory note (the \"Board Note\") in the favor of the Board Lender in the principal amount of $450,000 (the \"Board Note Principal\"), pursuant to which the Board Note Principal accrued simple interest at the rate of 5% per annum and was convertible into shares of the Company's Common Stock at $0.16 per share of Common Stock at the election of the Board Lender. The Board Note was to mature on the earlier to occur of (i) October 13, 2020, or (ii) on such date that the Company consummates a debt and/or equity financing resulting in net proceeds to the Company of at least $3.0 million.\nAlso, during the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company received advances from an additional former member of the Board of Directors (the \"Second Board Lender\") in the aggregate amount of $100,000. On June 29, 2020, the Company executed a promissory note (the \"Second Board Note\", and collectively with the Board Note, the \"Board Notes\") in the principal amounts of $100,000 (the \"Second Board Note Principal\"), pursuant to which the Second Board Note Principal accrued simple interest at the rate of 5% per annum and was convertible into shares of the Company\u2019s Common Stock at $0.16 per share of Common Stock at the election of the Second Board Lender. The Second Board Note was to mature on the earlier to occur of (i) October 13, 2020, or (ii) on such date that the Company consummates a debt and/or equity financing resulting in net proceeds to the Company of at least $3.0 million.\nOn November 12, 2020, in connection with the Closing of the Series D Financing, the Board Lenders entered into (i) Debt Exchange Agreements (collectively, the \"Debt Exchange Agreements\"), and (ii) Satisfaction and Release Agreements (collectively, the \"Release Agreements\"), for the purpose of satisfying certain obligations of the Company arising under (i) the Board Note, and (ii) the Second Board Note. Pursuant to the Debt Exchange Agreements and Release Agreements: (a) one-half of the Board Note Principal plus accrued interest, totaling approximately $232,000 was converted into 231.6 shares of Series D Preferred at a rate of $1,000 per share of Series D Preferred, with the remaining one-half of the Board Note Principal plus accrued interest, totaling approximately $232,000, to be paid to the Board Lender in cash out of proceeds of the Series D Financing, in full satisfaction of the Company's obligations under the Board Note; and (b) the entire Second Board Note Principal plus accrued interest, totaling approximately $103,000, was converted into 102.8 shares of Series D Preferred at a rate of $1,000 per share of Series D Preferred, in full satisfaction of the Company's obligations under the Second Board Note.\nProfessional Services Agreement\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company entered into professional services agreement with a firm affiliated with a member of the Company\u2019s Board at the time the parties entered into the agreement. The Company made no payments pursuant to this agreement during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and has made approximately $34,000 during 2021.

(\u201cCompany\u201d) as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, shareholders\u2019 deficit and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the \u201cfinancial statements\u201d). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2020, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d).\nGoing Concern Uncertainty\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company does not generate sufficient cash flows from operations to maintain operations and, therefore, is dependent on additional financing to fund operations. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern. Management\u2019s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 1 to the financial statements. The financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company\u2019s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (\"PCAOB\") and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nConvertible Preferred Shares\nAs described further in Note 13 to the financial statements, the Company issued 22,863 shares of Series D Convertible Preferred Stock during the year ended December 31, 2020. The accounting for the transaction was complex, as it required the identification and assessment as to whether embedded features were required to be recognized separately and therefore, also were required to be recorded at fair value. The Company determined that the embedded conversion option, redemption option and participating dividend feature contained in the Series D Convertible Preferred Stock host instrument were required to be recognized separately as derivative liabilities at fair value. The determination of fair value involved using complex valuation methodologies that incorporate significant assumptions which include the expected volatility of the Company\u2019s common stock and the probability of certain conditions or events occurring.\nWe identified auditing the Company\u2019s evaluation of the accounting for the embedded features included in the Series D Convertible Preferred Stock and the methods and assumptions used to estimate the fair value of the resulting derivative liability as a critical audit matter. The principal consideration for this determination was the degree of judgment involved by management in determining if the host contract was more akin to debt or equity and the development of the assumptions necessary to estimate the fair value of the derivative liability which in turn led to significant auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence for the accounting and estimated fair value.\nThe primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included:\n\u25cf\nReading the underlying Series D Convertible Preferred Stock agreements to understand the terms and conditions, economic substance, and identify embedded features requiring evaluation.\n\u25cf\nTesting management\u2019s application of the relevant accounting guidance to assess if the embedded features require accounting as derivative financial instruments and applying our understanding of each.\n\u25cf\nObtaining an understanding of management\u2019s process for developing the estimated fair value, including understanding the reasons the method was selected by the Company, identifying the significant assumptions used to determine the fair value estimate, and the application of those assumptions in the related method, and evaluating the appropriateness of each.\n\u25cf\nTesting the data used in developing the fair value estimate, including procedures to determine whether the data was complete and accurate and sufficiently precise.\n\u25cf\nEvaluating the significant assumptions used in developing the fair value estimate, including:\no\nEvaluating whether management\u2019s estimation of the probability of whether certain conditions or events were reasonable as of each valuation date.\no\nComparing the forecasted volatility of the Company\u2019s common stock price to its historical volatility.\n\u25cf\nInvolving the use of valuation professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in the evaluation of management\u2019s process, selected method, and inputs and assumptions used in the method.\nModification of Preferred Shares\nAs described in Note 2 and Note 14 to the financial statements, during the year ended December 31, 2020 the Company amended the terms of its Series A and Series A-1 Preferred Stock. In addition, the Company converted the Series C Preferred Stock into shares of Series D Preferred Stock. The accounting for the transactions was complex due to a lack of authoritative guidance on the accounting for preferred stock modifications and extinguishments within US GAAP. Additionally, the transactions required an estimation of the fair value of Series A, Series A-1, and Series D Preferred Stock.\nWe identified auditing the Company\u2019s accounting for the modification of the Series A and A-1 preferred shares, the conversion of the Series C Preferred Stock into Series D Preferred Stock, and the corresponding fair value estimates of the Series A, Series A-1, and Series D Preferred Stock as a critical audit matter. The principal consideration for this determination was a combination of the lack of authoritative guidance on accounting for the modification or extinguishment of preferred shares and the judgment involved by management in developing the model and assumptions necessary to estimate of the fair value of the Series A, Series A-1, and Series D Preferred Stock. This in turn led to significant auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence related to management\u2019s accounting conclusions and the reasonableness of the significant assumptions used by the Company to estimate each fair value and the application of those assumptions within the valuation methods.\nThe primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included:\n\u25cf\nReading the underlying preferred share agreements to understand the terms, conditions and economic substance of the transactions.\n\u25cf\nEvaluating whether management\u2019s selection and application of the relevant accounting guidance was reasonable and supportable, applying our understanding of the agreements.\n\u25cf\nObtaining an understanding of management\u2019s process for developing the estimated fair value of the Series A, Series A-1, and Series D Preferred Stock, including understanding the reasons the methods were selected by the Company, identifying the significant assumptions used to determine the fair value estimates and the application of those assumptions in the related models, and evaluating the appropriateness of each.\n\u25cf\nTesting the data used in developing the fair value estimates, including procedures to determine whether the data was complete and accurate and sufficiently precise.\n\u25cf\nInvolving the use of valuation professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in the evaluation of management\u2019s process, selected methods, and inputs and assumptions used in the methods.\n/s/ Mayer Hoffman McCann P.C.\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2011.\nSan Diego, California\nApril 2,\nIMAGEWARE SYSTEMS, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE

2020 AND 2019\n1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS\nOverview\nAs used in this Report, \u201cwe\u201d, \u201cus\u201d, \u201cour\u201d, \u201cImageWare\u201d, \u201cImageWare Systems\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d refers to ImageWare Systems, Inc. and all of its subsidiaries. ImageWare Systems, Inc. is incorporated in the state of Delaware. The Company is a pioneer and leader in the emerging market for biometrically enabled software-based identity management solutions. Using those human characteristics that are unique to us all, the Company creates software that provides a highly reliable indication of a person\u2019s identity. The Company\u2019s \u201cflagship\u201d product is the patented IWS Biometric Engine\u00ae. The Company\u2019s products are used to manage and issue secure credentials, including national IDs, passports, driver licenses and access control credentials. The Company\u2019s products also provide law enforcement with integrated mug shot, fingerprint LiveScan and investigative capabilities. The Company also provides comprehensive authentication security software using biometrics to secure physical and logical access to facilities or computer networks or internet sites. Biometric technology is now an integral part of all markets the Company addresses, and all the products are integrated into the IWS Biometric Engine.\nLiquidity, Going Concern and Management\u2019s Plan\nHistorically, our principal sources of cash have included customer payments from the sale of our products, proceeds from the issuance of common and preferred stock and proceeds from the issuance of debt. Our principal uses of cash have included cash used in operations, product development, and payments relating to purchases of property and equipment. We expect that our principal uses of cash in the future will be for product development, including customization of identity management products for enterprise and consumer applications, further development of intellectual property, development of Software-as-a-Service (\u201cSaaS\u201d) capabilities for existing products as well as general working capital requirements. Management expects that, as our revenue grows, our sales and marketing and research and development expense will continue to grow, albeit at a slower rate and, as a result, we will need to generate significant net revenue to achieve and sustain positive cash flows from operations. Historically the Company has not been able to generate sufficient net revenue to achieve and sustain positive cash flows from operations and management has determined that there is substantial doubt about the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern.\nAt December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had negative working capital of $19,349,000 and $1,653,000, respectively. Included in our negative working capital as of December 31, 2020 are $24,128,000 of derivative liabilities which are not required to be settled in cash except in the event of the consummation of a Change of Control or at any time after the fourth anniversary of the Series D Preferred issuance, at which time the holders of the Series D Preferred may require the Company to redeem in cash any or all of the holder\u2019s outstanding Series D Preferred at an amount equal to the Series D Liquidation Preference Amount. At December 31, 2020 the Liquidation Preference Amount totaled $22,863,000.\nConsidering the financings consummated in 2020, as well as our projected cash requirements, and assuming we are unable to generate incremental revenue, our available cash will be insufficient to satisfy our cash requirements for the next twelve months from the date of this filing. At March 26, 2021, cash on hand approximated $5,178,000. Based on the Company\u2019s rate of cash consumption in the first quarter of 2021 and the last quarter of 2020, the Company estimates it will need additional capital in the third quarter of 2021 and its prospects for obtaining that capital are uncertain. As a result of the Company\u2019s historical losses and financial condition, there is substantial doubt about the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern.\nTo address our working capital requirements, management has begun instituting several cost cutting measures and may seek additional equity and/or debt financing through the issuance of additional debt and/or equity securities. Other than the Lincoln Purchase Agreement, there are currently no financing arrangements to support our projected cash shortfall, including commitments to purchase additional debt and/or equity securities, or other agreements, and no assurances can be given that we will be successful in raising additional debt and/or equity securities, or entering into any other transaction that addresses our ability to continue as a going concern.\nIn view of the matters described in the preceding paragraph, recoverability of a major portion of the recorded asset amounts shown in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet is dependent upon continued operations of the Company, which, in turn, is dependent upon the Company\u2019s ability to continue to raise capital and generate positive cash flows from operations. However, the Company operates in markets that are emerging and highly competitive. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain additional capital, operate at a profit or generate positive cash flows in the future. Therefore, management\u2019s plans do not alleviate the substantial doubt of the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern.\nThe consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classifications of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.\n2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nBasis of Presentation\nThe financial statements are prepared under the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) Accounting Standards Codification (\u201cASC\u201d) Topic 105-10, Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (\u201cGAAP\u201d).\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. The Company\u2019s wholly-owned subsidiaries are: XImage Corporation, a California Corporation; ImageWare Systems ID Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation (formerly Imaging Technology Corporation); I.W. Systems Canada Company, a Nova Scotia unlimited liability company; ImageWare Digital Photography Systems, LLC, a Nevada limited liability company (formerly Castleworks LLC); Digital Imaging International GmbH, a company formed under German laws; and Image Ware Mexico S de RL de CV, a company formed under Mexican laws. All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.\nOperating Cycle\nAssets and liabilities related to long-term contracts are included in current assets and current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, although they will be liquidated in the normal course of contract completion which may take more than one operating cycle.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting period. Significant estimates include the evaluation of our ability to continue as a going concern, the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable, assumptions used in the Black-Scholes model to calculate the fair value of share-based payments, fair value of Series D Preferred and financial instruments issued with and affected by the Series D Preferred Financing (defined below), fair value of financial instruments with and affected by the Series C Preferred (defined below), fair value of Series A Preferred (defined below), fair value of Series A-1 Preferred (defined below), assumptions used in the application of revenue recognition policies, assumptions used in the derivation of the Company\u2019s incremental borrowing rate used in the computation of the Company\u2019s operating lease liabilities and assumptions used in the application of fair value methodologies to calculate the fair value of pension assets and obligations. Actual results could differ from estimates.\nAccounts Receivable\nIn the normal course of business, the Company extends credit without collateral requirements to its customers that satisfy pre-defined credit criteria. Accounts receivable are recorded net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. Accounts receivable are considered delinquent when the due date on the invoice has passed. The Company records its allowance for doubtful accounts based upon its assessment of various factors. The Company considers historical experience, the age of the accounts receivable balances, the credit quality of its customers, current economic conditions and other factors that may affect customers\u2019 ability to pay to determine the level of allowance required. Accounts receivable are written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts when all collection efforts by the Company have been unsuccessful.\nInventories\nFinished goods inventories are stated at the lower of cost, determined using the average cost method, or net realizable value. See Note 6.\nProperty, Equipment and Leasehold Improvements\nProperty and equipment, consisting of furniture and equipment, are stated at cost and are being depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which generally range from three to five years. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Major renewals or improvements are capitalized. When assets are sold or abandoned, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and the resulting gain or loss is recognized. Expenditures for leasehold improvements are capitalized. Amortization of leasehold improvements is computed using the straight-line method over the shorter of the remaining lease term or the estimated useful lives of the improvements.\nRevenue Recognition\nIn accordance with ASC 606, revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services.\nThe core principle of the standard is that we should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. To achieve that core principle, we apply the following five step model:\n1.\nIdentify the contract with the customer;\n2.\nIdentify the performance obligation in the contract;\n3.\nDetermine the transaction price;\n4.\nAllocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and\n5.\nRecognize revenue when (or as) each performance obligation is satisfied.\nAt contract inception, we assess the goods and services promised in a contract with a customer and identify as a performance obligation each promise to transfer to the customer either: (i) a good or service (or a bundle of goods or services) that is distinct or (ii) a series of distinct goods or services that are substantially the same and that have the same pattern of transfer to the customer. We recognize revenue only when we satisfy a performance obligation by transferring a promised good or service to a customer.\nDetermining the timing of the satisfaction of performance obligations as well as the transaction price and the amounts allocated to performance obligations requires judgement.\nWe disclose disaggregation of our customer revenue by classes of similar products and services as follows:\n\u25cf\nSoftware licensing and royalties;\n\u25cf\nComputer hardware and identification media;\n\u25cf\nServices; and\n\u25cf\nPost-contract customer support.\nSoftware licensing and royalties\nSoftware licenses consist of revenue from the sale of software for identity management applications. Our software licenses are functional intellectual property and typically provide customers with the right to use our software in perpetuity as it exists when made available to the customer. We recognize revenue from software licensing at a point in time upon delivery, provided all other revenue recognition criteria are met.\nRoyalties consist of revenue from usage-based arrangements and guaranteed minimum-based arrangements. We recognize revenue for royalty arrangements at the later of (i) when the related sales occur, or (ii) when the performance obligation to which some or all of the royalty has been allocated has been satisfied.\nComputer hardware and identification media\nWe generate revenue from the sale of computer hardware and identification media. Revenue for these items is recognized upon delivery of these products to the customer, provided all other revenue recognition criteria are met.\nServices\nServices revenue is comprised primarily of software customization services, software integration services, system installation services and customer training. Revenue is generally recognized upon completion of services and customer acceptance provided all other revenue recognition criteria are met.\nPost-contract customer support (\u201cPCS\u201d)\nPost contract customer support consists of maintenance on software and hardware for our identity management solutions. We recognize PCS revenue from periodic maintenance agreements. Revenue is generally recognized ratably over the respective maintenance periods provided no significant obligations remain. Costs related to such contracts are expensed as incurred.\nArrangements with multiple performance obligations\nA performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer. In addition to selling software licenses, hardware and identification media, services and post-contract customer support on a standalone basis, certain contracts include multiple performance obligations. For such arrangements, we allocate revenue to each performance obligation based on our best estimate of the relative standalone selling price. The standalone selling price for a performance obligation is the price at which we would sell a promised good or service separately to a customer. The primary methods used to estimate standalone selling price are as follows: (i) the expected cost-plus margin approach, under which we forecast our expected costs of satisfying a performance obligation and then add an appropriate margin for that distinct good or service and (ii) the percent discount off of list price approach.\nContract costs\nWe recognize an asset for the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer if we expect the benefit of those costs to be longer than one year. We apply a practical expedient to expense costs as incurred for costs to obtain a contract when the amortization period is one year or less. At December 31, 2019, we had recorded approximately $118,000 in contract costs relating to capitalized commissions. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we recognized approximately $53,000 and $18,000, respectively, of capitalized contract costs as expense. Such expense is included as a component of operating expense and is included under the caption \u201cSales and marketing\u201d in our consolidated statement of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. We recorded no additional capitalized contract costs in the year ended December 31, 2020. We recognized approximately $1,594,000 of revenue during the year ended December 31, 2020 that was related to contract costs at the beginning of the period.\nOther items\nWe do not offer rights of return for our products and services in the normal course of business.\nSales tax collected from customers is excluded from revenue.\nThe following table sets forth our disaggregated revenue for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\nNet Revenue\n(dollars in thousands)\nSoftware and royalties\n$872\n$489\nHardware and consumables\nServices\n1,275\nMaintenance\n2,554\n2,583\nTotal net revenue\n$4,785\n$3,506\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nFor certain of the Company\u2019s financial instruments, including accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued expense, and deferred revenue, the carrying amounts approximate fair value due to their relatively short maturities.\nLease Liabilities and Operating Lease Right-of-Use Assets\nThe Company is a party to certain contractual arrangements for office space which meet the definition of leases under Accounting Standards Codification (\u201cASC\u201d) Topic 842 - Leases (\u201cASC 842\u201d). In accordance with ASC 842, the Company has determined that such arrangements are operating leases and accordingly the Company has, as of January 1, 2019, recorded operating lease right-of-use assets and related lease liability for the present value of the lease payments over the lease terms using the Company\u2019s estimated weighted-average incremental borrowing rate of approximately 14.5%. The Company has utilized the practical expedient regarding lease and nonlease components and has combined such items into a single combined component. The Company has also utilized the practical expedient regarding leases of twelve months or less and has excluded such leases from its computation of lease liability and related right-of-use assets. The Company has also elected the optional transition package of practical expedients which include:\nA package of practical expedient to not reassess:\n\u25cf\nWhether a contract is or contains a lease\n\u25cf\nLease classification\n\u25cf\nInitial direct costs\nGoodwill\nThe Company annually, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate a need, tests the carrying amount of goodwill for impairment. The Company performs its annual simplified impairment test in the fourth quarter of each year. In December 2018, the Company adopted the provisions of ASU 2017-04, \u201cIntangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment.\u201d The provisions of ASU 2017-04 eliminate the requirement to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill to measure a goodwill impairment charge. Instead, entities will record an impairment charge based on the excess of a reporting unit\u2019s carrying amount over its fair value. Entities that have reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts, will no longer be required to perform a qualitative assessment assuming they pass the simplified impairment test. The Company continues to have only one reporting unit, Identity Management, which at December 31, 2020, had a negative carrying amount of approximately $19,823,000. Based on the results of the Company\u2019s impairment testing, the Company determined that its goodwill was not impaired as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019.\nIntangible and Long-Lived Assets\nIntangible assets are carried at their cost less any accumulated amortization. Any costs incurred to renew or extend the life of an intangible or long-lived asset are reviewed for capitalization. The Company evaluates long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate their net book value may not be recoverable. When such factors and circumstances exist, the Company compares the projected undiscounted future cash flows associated with the related asset or group of assets over their estimated useful lives against their respective carrying amount. Impairment, if any, is based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value, based on market value when available, or discounted expected cash flows, of those assets and is recorded in the period in which the determination is made. As of December 31, 2020, and through the date of this Annual Report, the Company\u2019s management believes there is no impairment of its long-lived assets. There can be no assurance, however, that market conditions will not change or demand for the Company\u2019s products under development will continue. Either of these could result in future impairment of long-lived assets.\nDerivative Liabilities\nThe Company accounts for its derivative instruments under the provisions of ASC 815, \u201cDerivatives and Hedging\u201d. Under the provisions of ASC 815, the Company identified embedded features within the Series C Preferred and Series D Preferred host contracts that qualify as derivative instruments and require bifurcation.\nThe Company determined that the conversion option, redemption option and participating dividend feature contained in the Series C Preferred host instrument required bifurcation. The Company valued the bifurcatable features at fair value. Such liabilities aggregated approximately $833,000 at inception and are classified as current liabilities on the Company\u2019s consolidated balance sheets under the caption \u201cDerivative liabilities\u201d. The Company will revalue these features at each balance sheet date and record any change in fair value in the determination of period net income or loss. Due to the exchange of all outstanding shares of Series C Preferred Stock into shares of Series D Preferred Stock, the fair value of the embedded derivative liabilities contained in the Series C host instrument was $0 at the date of exchange. The change in fair value of such amounts are recorded in the caption \u201cChange in fair value of derivative liabilities\u201d in the Company\u2019s consolidated statements of operations. For the period January 1, 2020 through the November 12, 2020 date of exchange, the Company recorded a decrease to these derivative liabilities using fair value methodologies of approximately $369,000. As a result of this decrease, such liabilities aggregated approximately $0 at their November 12, 2020 date of exchange. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, the Company recorded a decrease to these derivative liabilities using fair value methodologies of approximately $696,000. As a result of this decrease, such liabilities aggregated approximately $369,000 at December 31, 2019.\nThe Company determined that the conversion option, redemption option and participating dividend feature contained in the Series D Preferred host instrument required bifurcation. The Company valued the bifurcatable features at fair value. Such liabilities aggregated approximately $26,011,000 at inception and are classified as current liabilities on the Company\u2019s consolidated balance sheets under the caption \u201cDerivative liabilities\u201d. The excess of the derivative fair value over the carrying amount of the Series D Preferred was recorded as a deemed dividend of approximately $4,201,000. The Series D Preferred financing was approved by the Company\u2019s Board of Directors to provide for an immediate need of capital, to allow the Company to continue as a going concern and to execute the Company\u2019s business plan after consultation with several of the Company\u2019s largest shareholders and a review of financing alternatives. The Company will revalue these features at each balance sheet date and record any change in fair value in the determination of period net income or loss. The change in fair value of such amounts are recorded in the caption \u201cChange in fair value of derivative liabilities\u201d in the Company\u2019s consolidated statements of operations. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded a decrease to its derivative liabilities using fair value methodologies of approximately $2,252,000 ($369,000 relating to Series C embedded derivatives and $1,883,000 related to Series D embedded derivatives) . As a result of this decrease, such liabilities aggregated approximately $24,128,000 at December 31, 2020.\nModification of Preferred Stock\nThe following Preferred Stock modifications were consummated in connection with the Series D Financing:\n\u25cf\nSeries C Preferred Stock Exchange into Series D Preferred Stock\n\u25cf\nSeries A Preferred Stock Modification\n\u25cf\nSeries A-1 Preferred Stock Modification\nThe Company is required to analyze preferred stock modifications to determine the proper method of accounting to apply to properly record and reflect the transactions. While guidance exists in ASC 470-50 to address the accounting for debt modifications, including preferred stock that is accounted for as a liability, there is no comparable guidance to address the accounting for modifications to preferred stock instruments that are accounted for as equity or temporary equity, which necessitates the subjective determination of whether a modification or exchange represents an extinguishment. Current accounting guidance permits the analysis of preferred stock modifications by using either the qualitative approach, the fair value approach or the cash flow approach. Due to the nature of the preferred stock modifications that the Company consummated in 2020, the Company determined that the fair value approach was the most appropriate methodology.\nConcentration of Credit Risk\nFinancial instruments which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and trade accounts receivable. The Company places its cash with high quality financial institutions and at times during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, exceeded the FDIC insurance limits of $250,000. Sales are typically made on credit and the Company generally does not require collateral. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers\u2019 financial condition and maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts. The Company considers historical experience, the age of the accounts receivable balances, the credit quality of its customers, current economic conditions and other factors that may affect customers\u2019 ability to pay to determine the level of allowance required. Accounts receivable are presented net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of approximately $5,000 and $7,000 at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, two customers accounted for approximately 61% or $2,921,000 of total revenue and had trade receivables of approximately $250,000 as of the end of the year. For the year ended December 31, 2019, two customers accounted for approximately 37% or $1,301,000 of total revenue and had trade receivables of approximately $161,000 as of the end of the year.\nStock-Based Compensation\nAt December 31, 2020, the Company had one stock-based compensation plan for employees and nonemployee directors, which authorizes the granting of various equity-based incentives including stock options and restricted stock.\nThe Company estimates the fair value of its stock options using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model, consistent with the provisions of ASC 718, \u201cCompensation - Stock Compensation\u201d. The fair value of stock options granted is recognized to expense over the requisite service period. Stock-based compensation expense for all share-based payment awards is recognized using the straight-line single-option method. Stock-based compensation expense is reported in operating expense based upon the departments to which substantially all of the associated employees report and credited to additional paid-in-capital.\nASC 718 requires the use of a valuation model to calculate the fair value of stock-based awards. The Company has elected to use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which incorporates various assumptions including volatility, expected life, and interest rates. The Company is required to make various assumptions in the application of the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Company has determined that the best measure of expected volatility is based on the historical weekly volatility of the Company\u2019s Common Stock. Historical volatility factors utilized in the Company\u2019s Black-Scholes computations for options granted during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 ranged from 57% to 83%. The Company has elected to estimate the expected life of an award based upon the SEC approved \u201csimplified method\u201d noted under the provisions of Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 14. The expected term used by the Company during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was 5.17 years. The difference between the actual historical expected life and the simplified method was immaterial. The interest rate used is the risk-free interest rate and is based upon U.S. Treasury rates appropriate for the expected term. Interest rates used in the Company\u2019s Black-Scholes calculations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 averaged 2.58%. Dividend yield is zero as the Company does not expect to declare any dividends on the Company\u2019s common shares in the foreseeable future.\nIn addition to the key assumptions used in the Black-Scholes model, the estimated forfeiture rate at the time of valuation is a critical assumption. The Company has adopted the provisions of ASU 2016-09 and will continue to use an estimated annualized forfeiture rate of approximately 5.0% for corporate officers, 4.1% for members of the Board of Directors and 15.0% for all other employees. The Company reviews the expected forfeiture rate annually to determine if that percent is still reasonable based on historical experience.\nRestricted stock units are recorded at the grant date fair value with corresponding compensation expense recorded ratably over the requisite service period.\nStock-based compensation expense related to equity options was approximately $862,000 and $643,000 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740, Accounting for Income Taxes, (ASC 740).Current income tax expense or benefit is the amount of income taxes expected to be payable or refundable for the current year. A deferred income tax asset or liability is computed for the expected future impact of differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and for the expected future tax benefit to be derived from tax credits and loss carryforwards. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nASC 740 requires a company to first determine whether it is more-likely-than-not (defined as a likelihood of more than fifty percent) that a tax position will be sustained based on its technical merits as of the reporting date, assuming that taxing authorities will examine the position and have full knowledge of all relevant information. A tax position that meets this more-likely-than-not threshold is then measured and recognized at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely to be realized upon effective settlement with a taxing authority. The amount accrued for uncertain tax positions was $0 at December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nThe Company\u2019s uncertain tax position relative to unrecognized tax benefits and any potential increase in these liabilities relates primarily to the allocations of revenue and costs among the Company\u2019s global operations and the impact of tax rulings made during the period affecting its tax positions. The Company\u2019s existing tax positions could result in liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits. The Company recognizes interest and/or penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. The amount of interest and penalties accrued as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $0.\nSignificant judgment is required in evaluating the Company\u2019s uncertain tax positions and determining the Company\u2019s provision for income taxes. No assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in the Company\u2019s historical income tax provisions and accruals. The Company adjusts these items in light of changing facts and circumstances. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made.\nForeign Currency Translation\nThe financial position and results of operations of the Company\u2019s foreign subsidiaries are measured using the foreign subsidiary\u2019s local currency as the functional currency. Revenue and expense of such subsidiaries have been translated into U.S. dollars at weighted-average exchange rates prevailing during the period. Assets and liabilities have been translated at the rates of exchange on the balance sheet date. The resulting translation gain and loss adjustments are recorded directly as a separate component of shareholders\u2019 equity, unless there is a sale or complete liquidation of the underlying foreign investments. The Company translates foreign currencies of its German, Canadian and Mexican subsidiaries. The cumulative translation adjustment, which is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss, decreased approximately $151,000 and $1,000 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nComprehensive Loss\nComprehensive loss consists of net gains and losses affecting shareholders\u2019 deficit that, under generally accepted accounting principles, are excluded from net loss. For the Company, the only items are the cumulative translation adjustment and the additional minimum liability related to the Company\u2019s defined benefit pension plan, recognized pursuant to ASC 715-30, \u201cCompensation - Retirement Benefits - Defined Benefit Plans - Pension\u201d.\nAdvertising Costs\nThe Company expenses advertising costs as incurred. The Company incurred approximately $5,000 in advertising expense during the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019.\nLoss Per Share\nBasic loss per common share is calculated by dividing net loss available to common shareholders for the period by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted loss per common share is calculated by dividing net loss available to common shareholders for the period by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period, adjusted to include, if dilutive, potential dilutive shares consisting of convertible preferred stock, convertible lines of credit, stock options and warrants, calculated using the treasury stock and if-converted methods. For diluted loss per share calculation purposes, the net loss available to common shareholders is adjusted to add back any preferred stock dividends in the consolidated statements of operations for the respective periods.\n(Amounts in thousands, except share and per share amounts)\nYear Ended December 31,\nNumerator for basic and diluted loss per share:\nNet loss\n$(7,253)\n$(11,581)\nPreferred dividends, deemed dividends and accretion\n(3,695)\n(5,670)\nNet loss available to common shareholders\n$(10,948)\n$(17,251)\nDenominator for basic and diluted loss per share - weighted-average shares outstanding\n133,346,309\n104,372,048\nBasic and diluted loss per share:\nNet loss available to common shareholders\n$ (0.08)\n$(0.17)\nThe following potential dilutive securities have been excluded from the computations of diluted weighted-average shares outstanding as their effect would have been antidilutive:\nPotential Dilutive Securities:\nCommon Share Equivalents at\nDecember 31, 2020\nCommon Share Equivalents at\nDecember 31, 2019\nConvertible redeemable preferred stock - Series A\n74,555,000\n32,580,000\nConvertible redeemable preferred stock - Series A-1\n73,910,000\n-\nConvertible redeemable preferred stock - Series B\n46,029\n46,029\nConvertible redeemable preferred stock - Series C\n-\n10,000,000\nConvertible redeemable preferred stock - Series D\n392,166,023\n-\nStock options\n2,585,500\n7,204,672\nRestricted stock units (RSUs)\n845,106\n-\nWarrants\n753,775\n1,733,856\nTotal Potential Dilutive Securities\n544,861,433\n51,564,557\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nFrom time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the FASB or other standard setting bodies, which are adopted by us as of the specified effective date. Unless otherwise discussed, the Company\u2019s management believes the impact of recently issued standards not yet effective will not have a material impact on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements upon adoption.\nFASB ASU No. 2019-12. In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-12, \u201cIncome Taxes (Topic 740). The amendments in this update simplify the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions to the general principles in Topic 740. The amendments also improve consistent application of and simplify GAAP for other areas of Topic 740 by clarifying and amending existing guidance. Early adoption of the amendments is permitted. For public business entities, the amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2020. The adoption of this standard will not have a material impact on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements.\nFASB ASU No. 2020-01. In January 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-01 \u201cInvestments-Equity Securities (Topic 321), Investments-Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323), and Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815)-Clarifying the Interactions between Topic 321, Topic 323, and Topic 815\u201d, to clarify the interaction of the accounting for equity securities under ASC 321 and investments accounted for under the equity method of accounting in ASC 323 and the accounting for certain forward contracts and purchased options accounted for under ASC 815. With respect to the interactions between ASC 321 and ASC 323, the amendments clarify that an entity should consider observable transactions that require it to either apply or discontinue the equity method of accounting when applying the measurement alternative in ASC 321, immediately before applying or upon discontinuing the equity method of accounting. With respect to forward contracts or purchased options to purchase securities, the amendments clarify that when applying the guidance in ASC 815-10-15-141(a), an entity should not consider whether upon the settlement of the forward contract or exercise of the purchased option, individually or with existing investments, the underlying securities would be accounted for under the equity method in ASC 323 or the fair value option in accordance with ASC 825. The ASU is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2020. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in any interim period. The\nadoption of this standard will not have a material impact on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements.\nFASB ASU No. 2020-06. In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06 \u201cDebt-Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging- Contracts in Entity\u2019s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity\u2019s Own Equity\u201d. This ASU simplifies accounting for convertible instruments by removing major separation models required under current U.S. GAAP. Consequently, more convertible debt instruments will be reported as a single liability instrument and more convertible preferred stock as a single equity instrument with no separate accounting for embedded conversion features. The ASU removes certain settlement conditions that are required for equity contracts to qualify for the derivative scope exception, which will permit more equity contracts to qualify for it. The ASU also simplifies the diluted earnings per share (EPS) calculation in certain areas. This ASU is effective for public business entities, excluding entities eligible to be smaller reporting companies, for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, including interim periods within those fiscal years. For all other entities, the standard will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption will be permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact ASU 2020-06 will have on its consolidated financial statements.\n3. FAIR VALUE ACCOUNTING\nThe Company accounts for fair value measurements in accordance with ASC 820, \u201cFair Value Measurements and Disclosures\u201d, which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.\nASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy under ASC 820 are described below:\nLevel 1\nUnadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities.\nLevel 2\nApplies to assets or liabilities for which there are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions (less active markets); or model-derived valuations in which significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data.\nLevel 3\nPrices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable (supported by little or no market activity).\nThe following table sets forth the Company\u2019s financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value by level within the fair value hierarchy. As required by ASC 820, assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.\nFair Value at December 31, 2020\n($ in thousands)\nTotal\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nAssets:\nPension assets\n$1,881\n$-\n$-\n$1,881\nTotals\n$1,881\n$-\n$-\n$1,881\nLiabilities:\nDerivative liabilities\n$24,128\n$-\n$-\n$24,128\nTotals\n$24,128\n$-\n$-\n$24,128\nFair Value at December 31, 2019\n($ in thousands)\nTotal\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nAssets:\nPension assets\n$1,713\n$-\n$-\n$1,713\nTotals\n$1,713\n$-\n$-\n$1,713\nLiabilities:\nDerivative liabilities\n$369\n$-\n$-\n$369\nTotals\n$369\n$-\n$-\n$369\nThe Company\u2019s German pension plan is funded by insurance contract policies whereby the insurance company guarantees a fixed minimum return. The Company has determined that the pension assets are appropriately classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy because they are valued using actuarial valuation methodologies which approximate cash surrender value that cannot be corroborated with observable market data. All plan assets are managed in a policyholder pool in Germany by outside investment managers. The investment manager is responsible for the investment strategy of the insurance premiums that Company submits and does not hold individual assets per participating employer. The German Federal Financial Supervisory oversees and supervises the insurance contracts.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company had embedded features contained in the Series D Preferred host instrument (issued in November 2020) that qualified for derivative liability treatment. The recorded fair market value of these features was approximately $24,128,000 at December 31, 2020, and are classified as a current liability in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020. The fair value of the Company\u2019s derivative liabilities are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy because they are valued using pricing models that incorporate management assumptions that cannot be corroborated with observable market data. The Company uses Monte-Carlo simulations and other fair value methodologies in the determination of the fair value of derivative liabilities. Considering the various path dependencies for the Series D Preferred Stock, Monte-Carlo simulations were deemed the most appropriate methodology.\nAt December 31, 2019, the Company had embedded features contained in the Series C Preferred host instrument that qualified for derivative liability treatment. The recorded fair market value of these features was $369,000 at December 31, 2019. Due to the exchange of the Series C Preferred into Series D Preferred, the value of the Series C derivative liabilities was $0 at December 31, 2020. Such liabilities are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy because they were valued using pricing models that incorporate management assumptions that cannot be corroborated with observable data.\nSome of the aforementioned fair value methodologies are affected by the Company\u2019s stock price as well as assumptions regarding the expected stock price volatility over the term of the derivative liabilities in addition to the probability of future events. Significant assumptions used in the application of fair value methodologies for the Series D Preferred are a risk-free rate of 0.26% to 0.31%, equity volatility of 96.9% to 98.0%, effective life of 4.0 years, and a preferred stock dividend rate of 4.0%. Additionally, management has made certain estimates regarding the timing of potential change of control events.\nThe Company monitors the activity within each level and any changes with the underlying valuation techniques or inputs utilized to recognize if any transfers between levels are necessary. That determination is made, in part, by working with outside valuation experts for Level 3 instruments and monitoring market related data and other valuation inputs for Level 1 and Level 2 instruments.\nThe reconciliations of Level 3 pension assets measured at fair value in 2020 and 2019 are presented below:\n($ in thousands)\nDecember 31,\nDecember 31,\nPension assets:\nFair value at beginning of year\n$1,713\n$1,734\nReturn on plan assets\nCompany contributions and benefits paid, net\n(82)\n(68)\nEffect of rate changes\n(33)\nFair value at end of year\n$1,881\n$1,713\nThe reconciliations of Level 3 derivative liabilities measured at fair value in 2020 and 2019 are presented below:\n($ in thousands)\nDecember 31,\nDecember 31,\nDerivative liabilities\nFair value at beginning of year\n$369\n$1,065\nIssuances from Preferred Stock Financing\n26,011\n-\nChange in fair value included in earnings\n(2,252)\n(696)\nFair value at end of year\n$24,128\n$369\n4. INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND GOODWILL\nThe carrying amounts of the Company\u2019s patent intangible assets were $58,000 and $70,000 as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, which includes accumulated amortization of $601,000 and $589,000 as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Amortization expense for patent intangible assets was $12,000 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. Patent intangible assets are being amortized on a straight-line basis over their remaining life of approximately 5.5 years. There was no impairment of the Company\u2019s intangible assets during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nThe Company annually, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate a need, tests the carrying amount of goodwill for impairment. The Company performs its annual simplified impairment test in the fourth quarter of each year. In December 2020, the Company adopted the provisions of ASU 2017-04, \"Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment\". The provisions of ASU 2017-04 eliminate the requirement to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill to measure a goodwill impairment charge. Instead, entities will record an impairment charge based on the excess of a reporting unit's carrying amount over its fair value. Entities that have reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts, will no longer be required to perform a qualitative assessment assuming they pass the simplified impairment test. The Company continues to have only one reporting unit, Identity Management which, at December 31, 2020, had a negative carrying amount of approximately $19,823,000. Based on the results of the Company's impairment testing, the Company determined that its goodwill was not impaired during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nThe estimated acquired intangible amortization expense for the next five fiscal years is as follows:\nFiscal Year Ended December 31,\nEstimated Amortization\nExpense\n($ in thousands)\n$12\nThereafter\n-\nTotals\n$58\n5. RELATED PARTIES\nNotes Payable\nFactoring Agreement\nOn February 12, 2020, the Company entered into a factoring agreement (the \"Factoring Agreement\") with a former member of the Company\u2019s Board of Directors (the \"Factoring Lender\"). Under the Factoring Agreement, the Company received $350,000 in proceeds (the \"Factoring Principal\") in the form of a loan, bearing interest at a rate of 1% for every seven days until the Factoring Principal and accrued interest are paid in full, with a maturity date of March 4, 2020. Pursuant to the Factoring Agreement, repayment of the Factoring Principal and accrued interest was secured by certain of the Company\u2019s trade accounts receivable approximating $500,000 (the \"Factoring Collateral\"). During the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded approximately $45,000 in interest expense related to the Factoring Agreement. In May 2020, the Company repaid $35,000 in accrued interest to the Factoring Lender. As a condition to the consummation of the Company's offer and sale (the \"Closing\") of shares of its Series D Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 (\"Series D Preferred\") (the \"Series D Financing\"), the Factoring Lender agreed to settle the entire Factoring Principal plus accrued interest and release the Company from liabilities due under the Factoring Agreement in exchange for a one-time payment of $360,000 (the \"Factoring Settlement\") to be made upon the Closing, and out of the proceeds, of the Series D Financing. On November 16, 2020, the Company fulfilled its obligation under the Factoring Settlement, thereby releasing it from its obligation under the Factoring Agreement.\nConvertible Promissory Notes\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company received advances from a second former member of the Board of Directors (the \"Board Lender\") in the aggregate amount of $450,000. On June 29, 2020, the Company executed a promissory note (the \"Board Note\") in the favor of the Board Lender in the principal amount of $450,000 (the \"Board Note Principal\"), pursuant to which the Board Note Principal accrued simple interest at the rate of 5% per annum, and was convertible into shares of the Company's Common Stock at $0.16 per share of Common Stock at the election of the Board Lender. The Board Note was to mature on the earlier to occur of (i) October 13, 2020, or (ii) on such date that the Company consummates a debt and/or equity financing resulting in net proceeds to the Company of at least $3.0 million.\nAlso during the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company received advances from a third former member of the Board of Directors (the \"Second Board Lender\") in the aggregate amount of $100,000. On June 29, 2020, the Company executed a promissory note (the \"Second Board Note\", and collectively with the Board Note, the \"Board Notes\") in the principal amounts of $100,000 (the \"Second Board Note Principal\"), pursuant to which the Second Board Note Principal accrued simple interest at the rate of 5% per annum, and was convertible into shares of the Company\u2019s Common Stock at $0.16 per share of Common Stock at the election of the Second Board Lender. The Second Board Note was to mature on the earlier to occur of (i) October 13, 2020, or (ii) on such date that the Company consummates a debt and/or equity financing resulting in net proceeds to the Company of at least $3.0 million.\nOn November 12, 2020, in connection with the Closing of the Series D Financing, the Board Lenders entered into (i) Debt Exchange Agreements (collectively, the \"Debt Exchange Agreements\"), and (ii) Satisfaction and Release Agreements (collectively, the \"Release Agreements\"), for the purpose of satisfying certain obligations of the Company arising under (i) the Board Note, and (ii) the Second Board Note. Pursuant to the Debt Exchange Agreements and Release Agreements: (a) one-half of the Board Note Principal plus accrued interest, totaling approximately $232,000 was converted into 231.6 shares of Series D Preferred at a rate of $1,000 per share of Series D Preferred, with the remaining one-half of the Board Note Principal plus accrued interest, totaling approximately $232,000, to be paid to the Board Lender in cash out of proceeds of the Series D Financing, in full satisfaction of the Company's obligations under the Board Note; and (b) the entire Second Board Note Principal plus accrued interest, totaling approximately $103,000, was converted into 102.8 shares of Series D Preferred at a rate of $1,000 per share of Series D Preferred, in full satisfaction of the Company's obligations under the Second Board Note.\nProfessional Services Agreement\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company entered into professional services agreement with a firm affiliated with a member of the Company\u2019s Board at the time the parties entered into the agreement. The Company made no payments pursuant to this agreement during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and has made approximately $34,000 during 2021. The Company has the right to terminate the agreement on thirty days written notice at any time.\n6. INVENTORY\nInventories of $40,000 as of December 31, 2020 were comprised of work in process of $26,000, representing direct labor costs on in-process projects and finished goods of $14,000 net of reserves for obsolete and slow-moving items of $3,000.\nInventories of $615,000 as of December 31, 2019 were comprised of work in process of $608,000, representing direct labor costs on in-process projects and finished goods of $7,000 net of reserves for obsolete and slow-moving items of $3,000.\nAppropriate consideration is given to obsolescence, excessive levels, deterioration and other factors in evaluating net realizable value and required reserve levels.\n7.

NOTES PAYABLE\nConcurrently with the execution of the Series D Purchase Agreement, the Company and certain Series D Preferred investors executed the Series D Bridge Loan Agreement (\u201cthe Bridge Loan\u201d), pursuant to which each Investor signatory thereto agreed to the Bridge Loan, secured by all assets of the Company, in an amount equal to 20% of such Investor\u2019s purchase commitment as set forth in the Purchase Agreement, which Bridge Loan, plus accrued interest, will roll into, and be used to purchase, Series D Preferred at Closing.\nPursuant to the Bridge Loan, the Company received proceeds of $2,187,000 in September 2020. The Bridge Loan bears interest at a fixed rate of 12% and is due and payable in arrears on the earlier of the Loan Conversion Date, as such term is defined in the Loan Agreement, or six months after the disbursement of the Bridge Loan. All amounts due and payable pursuant to the Bridge Loan are automatically convertible, without further action by the Investors, into shares of Series D Preferred at Closing at a purchase price of $1,000 for each share of Series D Preferred. The repayment of all amounts due under the terms of the Loan Agreement are secured by all assets of the Company. On November 12, 2020, contemporaneously with the closing of the Series D Preferred Financing, all amounts due under the Bridge Loan were converted into shares of Series D Preferred Stock.\nOn March 27, 2020, President Trump signed into law the \u201cCoronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (\u201cCARES Act\u201d). On May 4, 2020, the Company entered into a loan agreement (the \u201cPPP Loan\u201d) with Comerica Bank (\u201cComerica\u201d) under the Paycheck Protection Program (the \u201cPPP\u201d), which is part of the CARES Act administered by the United States Small Business Administration (\u201cSBA\u201d). As part of the application for these funds, the Company in good faith, has certified that the current economic uncertainty made the loan request necessary to support the ongoing operations of the Company. This certification further requires the Company to take into account our current business activity and our ability to access other sources of liquidity sufficient to support ongoing operations in a manner that is not significantly detrimental to the business. Under the PPP, the Company received proceeds of approximately $1,571,000. In accordance with the requirements of the PPP, the Company utilized the proceeds from the PPP Loan primarily for payroll costs, rent and utilities. The PPP Loan has a 1.00% interest rate per annum, matures on May 4, 2022 and is subject to the terms and conditions applicable to loans administered by the SBA under the PPP. Under the terms of PPP, all or certain amounts of the PPP Loan may be forgiven if they are used for qualifying expenses as described in the CARES Act, which the Company continues to evaluate. While no determination has been made at the time of the filing of this Annual Report, the Series D Financing may affect the Company's ability to have the PPP Loan forgiven under the PPP. The Company has recorded the entire amount of the PPP Loan as debt. Under the terms of the PPP Loan, monthly payments of principal and interest were due to commence November 1, 2020, however the SBA is deferring loan payments for borrowers who apply for loan forgiveness until the SBA remits the borrower\u2019s loan forgiveness amount to the lender. The Company plans to file for loan forgiveness and at the time of the filing of this Annual Report, no amounts have been repaid. At December 31, 2020, the Company has recorded the current portion of the PPP Loan of approximately $918,000 as a current liability under the caption \u201cNotes payable, current portion\u201d in its consolidated balance sheet. The remaining portion of approximately $653,000 is recorded as a long-term liability under the caption \u201cNote payable, net of current portion\u201d in its consolidated December 31, 2020 balance sheet.\n10. INCOME TAXES\nThe Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740, Accounting for Income Taxes, (ASC 740). Deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences related to temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for tax purposes at each year-end, based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. A valuation allowance is established when necessary based on the weight of available evidence, if it is considered more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Income tax expense is the sum of current income tax plus the change in deferred tax assets and liabilities. The Company has established a valuation allowance against its deferred tax asset due to the uncertainty surrounding the realization of such asset.\nThe significant components of the income tax provision are as follows:\n($ in thousands)\nYear Ended December 31,\nCurrent\nFederal\n$ -\n$-\nState\n-\n-\nForeign\nDeferred\nFederal\n-\n-\nState\n-\n-\nForeign\n-\n-\n$7\n$10\nThe following is a schedule of the deferred tax assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2020 and 2019:\n($ in thousands)\nDeferred tax assets:\nNet operating loss carryforwards\n$23,327\n$21,981\nStock based compensation\n1,626\n1,678\nReserves , loans and accrued expense\nGross deferred tax assets\n25,374\n23,777\nValuation allowance\n(25,193)\n(23,643)\nGross deferred tax assets after valuation allowance\nDeferred tax liability - Intangible and fixed assets\n(181)\n(134)\nNet deferred tax liabilities\n$-\n$-\nA reconciliation of the provision for income taxes to the amount computed by applying the statutory income tax rates to loss before income taxes is as follows:\nAmounts computed at statutory rates\n$(1,415)\n$(2,432)\nState income tax, net of federal benefit\n(551)\n(579)\nExpiration of net operating loss carryforwards\nEquity compensation\nNon-deductible interest\n(581)\n(146)\nForeign tax rate differential\nOther\n(1)\nNet change in valuation allowance on deferred tax assets\n1,550\n1,484\n$7\n$10\nThe Company has established a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty surrounding the realization of such assets.\nAt December 31, 2020, the Company had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $60,035,000 that begin to expire in 2021. The Company has federal net operating losses of approximately $29,121,000 that arose after the 2017 tax year and will carryforward indefinitely, the utilization of which is limited to 80% of taxable income in any given year. The Company has net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $70,436,000 for the state of California that will begin to expire in 2035.\nThe Internal Revenue Code (the \u201cRevenue Code\u201d) limits the availability of certain tax credits and net operating losses that arose prior to certain cumulative changes in a corporation\u2019s ownership resulting in a change of control of the Company. The Company\u2019s use of its net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards will be significantly limited because the Company believes it underwent \u201cownership changes\u201d, as defined under Section 382 of the Revenue Code, in several years, though the Company has not performed a study to determine the limitation. The Company continues to disclose the tax effect of the net operating loss carryforwards at their original amount in the table above as the actual limitation has not yet been quantified. The Company has also established a full valuation allowance for substantially all deferred tax assets due to uncertainties surrounding its ability to generate future taxable income to realize these assets. Since substantially all deferred tax assets are fully reserved, future changes in tax benefits will not impact the effective tax rate. Management periodically evaluates the recoverability of the deferred tax assets. If it is determined at some time in the future that it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will be realized, the valuation allowance would be reduced accordingly at that time.\nTax returns for the years 2016 through 2020 are subject to examination by taxing authorities. The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to U.S. federal and state income tax, and in the normal course of business, its income tax returns are subject to examination by the relevant taxing authorities. As of December 31, 2020, the 2016 - 2020 tax years remain subject to examination in the U.S. federal tax state and foreign jurisdictions. However, to the extent allowed by law, the taxing authorities may have the right to examine the period from 2000 through 2020 where net operating losses and income tax credits were generated and carried forward and make adjustments to the amount of the net operating loss and income tax credit carryforward amount. The Company is not currently under examination by federal, state, or foreign jurisdictions. The Company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain income tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019 the Company had no liability for unrecognized tax benefits. The Company\u2019s policy is to record interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions as income tax expense. As of December 31, 2020, the Company has no accrued interest or penalties related to uncertain tax positions.\nOn March 27, 2020, President Trump signed into law the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (\u201cCARES Act\u201d). The CARES Act, among other things, includes provisions relating to refundable payroll tax credits, deferment of employer side social security payments, net operating loss carryback periods, alternative minimum tax credit refunds, modifications to the net interest deduction limitations and technical corrections to tax depreciation methods for qualified improvement property. Under ASC 740, the effects of new legislation are recognized upon enactment. Accordingly, the CARES Act is effective beginning in the quarter ended March 31, 2020. The Company does not currently believe that such provisions will have a material impact on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements.\n11. LEASES\nThe Company is a party to certain contractual arrangements for office space which meet the definition of leases under ASC 842 - Leases. In accordance with ASC 842, the Company has determined that such arrangements are operating leases and accordingly the Company has, as of January 1, 2019, recorded operating lease right-of-use assets and related lease liability for the present value of the lease payments over the lease terms using the Company\u2019s estimated weighted-average incremental borrowing rate of approximately 14.5% as the discount rates implicit in the Company\u2019s leases cannot be readily determined. Such assets and liabilities aggregated approximately $2,265,000 and $2,280,000 as of January 1, 2019, respectively and $1,906,000 and $2,089,000 as of December 31, 2019, respectively. At December 31, 2020, such assets and liabilities aggregated approximately $1,557,000 and $1,718,000, respectively. The Company determined that it had no arrangements representing finance leases.\nThe Company\u2019s operating leasing arrangements are summarized below:\nOur corporate headquarters is located in San Diego, California, where we now occupy approximately 500 square feet of office space at a cost of approximately $2,000 per month. We entered into this facility\u2019s lease in February 2021 and this new lease commenced on March 1, 2021 and is on a month-to-month basis. In addition to our corporate headquarters, we also occupied the following spaces at December 31, 2020:\n\u25cf\n1,508 square feet in Ottawa, Province of Ontario, Canada, at a cost of approximately $3,000 per month until the expiration of the lease on March 31, 2021. The Company extended this lease for a 30-day period and is currently evaluating alternative premises which the Company believes is readily available;\n\u25cf\n9,720 square feet in Portland, Oregon, at a cost of approximately $23,000 per month until the expiration of the lease on February 28, 2023; and\n\u25cf\n183 square feet of office space in Mexico City, Mexico, at a cost of approximately $2,000 per month until September 30, 2021.\nPrior to entering into our current lease agreement in January 2021 and moving our corporate headquarters to a new location, we occupied 8,511 square feet of office space in San Diego, at a cost of approximately $28,000 per month. In January 2021, we entered in a subleasing agreement for our previously occupied corporate headquarters located in San Diego, California. The term of the sublease commences on April 1, 2021 and expires on April 30, 2025 coterminous with the expiration of the Company\u2019s master lease. Sublease payments due the Company approximate $26,000 per month over the term of the sublease.\nThe above leases contain no residual value guarantees provided by the Company and there are no options to either extend or terminate the leases. The Company is not a party to any subleasing arrangements.\nFor the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded approximately $657,000 in lease expense using the straight-line method. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 the Company recorded approximately $673,000 in operating lease expense. Under the provisions of ASC 842, lease expense is comprised of the total lease payments under the lease plus any initial direct costs incurred less any lease incentives received by the lessor amortized ratably using the straight-line method over the lease term. The weighted-average remaining lease term of the Company\u2019s operating leases as of December 31, 2020 is 3.64 years. Cash payments under operating leases aggregated approximately $669,000 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and are included in operating cash flows.\nThe Company\u2019s lease liability was computed using the present value of future lease payments. The Company has utilized the practical expedient regarding lease and non-lease components and combined such components into a single combined component in the determination of the lease liability. The Company has excluded the lease of its office space in Mexico City, Mexico in the determination of the lease liability as of January 1, 2019 as its term is less than 12 months.\nAt December 31, 2020, future minimum undiscounted lease payments are as follows for the years ending:\n($ in thousands)\n$664\n$653\n$424\n$387\n$129\nThereafter\n$-\nTotal\n$2,257\nShort-term leases not included in lease liability\n$(22)\nPresent Value effect on future minimum undiscounted lease payments at December 31, 2020\n$(517)\nLease liability at December 31, 2020\n$1,718\nLess current portion\n$(421)\nNon-current lease liability at December 31, 2020\n$1,297\n12. CONTINGENT LIABILITIES\nEmployment Agreements\nThe Company has an employment agreement with its Chief Executive Officer, which expires on March 2, 2022. The Company may terminate the agreement with or without cause. Subject to the conditions and other limitations set forth in the employment agreement, the executive will be entitled to the following severance benefits if the Company terminates the executive\u2019s employment without cause or in the event of an involuntary termination (as defined in the employment agreement) by the Company or by the executive:\nUnder the terms of the agreement, the Chief Executive Officer will be entitled to the following severance benefits if we terminate their employment without cause or in the event of an involuntary termination: (i) severance payments equal to the lesser of twelve months\u2019 base salary or the remaining period prior to the expiration of the Employment Period; (ii) continuation of fringe benefits and medical insurance for a period of twelve months. In the event that the Chief Executive Officer\u2019s employment is terminated within six months prior to or thirteen months following a change of control (as defined in the employment agreements), the Chief Executive Officer is entitled to the severance benefits described above, except that 100% of the Chief Executive Officer\u2019s outstanding stock options and restricted stock awards will immediately vest.\nLitigation\nThere is no action, suit, proceeding, inquiry or investigation before or by any court, public board, government agency, self-regulatory organization or body pending or, to the knowledge of the executive officers of the Company or any of our subsidiaries, threatened against or affecting the Company, our Common Stock, any of our subsidiaries or of the Company\u2019s or our subsidiaries\u2019 officers or directors in their capacities as such, in which an adverse decision could have a material adverse effect.\n13. MEZZANINE EQUITY\nSeries C Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock\nOn September 10, 2018, the Company filed the Certificate of Designations, Preferences, and Rights of Series C Preferred with the Secretary of State for the State of Delaware - Division of Corporations, as amended November 12, 2020 (the \u201cSeries C Certificate\u201d) designating 1,000 shares of the Company\u2019s preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share, as Series C Preferred. Shares of Series C Preferred accrue dividends cumulatively and are payable quarterly at a rate of 8% per annum if paid in cash, or 10% per annum if paid by the issuance of shares of Common Stock. Each share of Series C Preferred has a liquidation preference equal to the greater of (i) the Stated Value plus all accrued and unpaid dividends, and (ii) such amount per share as would have been payable had each share been converted into Common Stock immediately prior to the occurrence of a Liquidation Event or Deemed Liquidation Event. Each share of Series C Preferred is convertible into that number of shares of the Company\u2019s Common Stock equal to the Stated Value, divided by $1.00, which conversion rate is subject to adjustment in accordance with the terms of the Series C Certificate. Holders of Series C Preferred may elect to convert shares of Series C Preferred into Conversion Shares at any time. Holders of the Series C Preferred may also require the Company to redeem all or any portion of such holder\u2019s shares of Series C Preferred at any time from and after the third anniversary of the issuance date or in the event of the consummation of a Change of Control (as such term is defined in the Series C Certificate). Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Series C Certificate, in the event the volume-weighted average price of the Company\u2019s Common Stock is at least $3.00 per share (subject to adjustment in accordance with the terms of the Series C Certificate) for at least 20 consecutive trading days, the Company may convert all, but not less than all, issued and outstanding shares of Series C Preferred into Conversion Shares. In addition, in the event of a Change of Control, the Company will have the option to redeem all, but not less than all, issued and outstanding shares of Series C Preferred for 115% of the Liquidation Preference Amount per share. The Series C Certificate provides for a drag-along right whereby if at any time one or more holders of Series C Preferred then holding, in the aggregate, more than 50% of the outstanding shares of Series C Preferred, exchange all (but not less than all) of each such exchanging shareholder\u2019s shares of Series C Preferred for shares of Series D Preferred, then such initiating shareholder(s), in their sole discretion, shall have the right to require that all the holders of Series C Preferred similarly exchange their shares of Series C Preferred into shares of Series D Preferred on identical terms and conditions to the majority shareholders that elected to exchange their Series C Preferred into Series D Preferred. Holders of Series C Preferred will have the right to vote, on an as-converted basis, with the holders of the Company\u2019s Common Stock on any matter presented to the Company\u2019s stockholders for their action or consideration. Shares of Series C Preferred rank senior to the Company\u2019s Common Stock and Series A Preferred, and junior to the Company\u2019s Series B Preferred Stock and Series D Preferred.\nThe Company had 0 and 1,000 shares of Series C Preferred outstanding as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. There were no issuances of Series C Preferred during the years ended December 31, 2020 or 2019. In connection with the Series D Financing, the Company entered into an Exchange Agreement with certain holders of the Series C Preferred which hold, in the aggregate, more than 50% of the outstanding shares of Series C Preferred (the \u201cExchange Agreement\u201d). As contemplated by the parties thereto, after the filing of the Amended Series C Certificate and in connection with the closing of the Purchase Agreement and Exchange Agreement, such holders exercised their right under the Amended Series C Certificate to require all holders of Series C Preferred to similarly exchange their shares of Series C Preferred into shares of Series D Preferred on identical terms and conditions. On November 12, 2020 all 1,000 shares of Series C Preferred were converted into 10,000 shares of Series D Preferred.\nThe Company issued the holders of Series C Preferred an aggregate of 6,455,149 shares of Common Stock during the year ended December 31, 2020 as dividends.\nThe Company issued the holders of Series C Preferred an aggregate of 1,857,438 shares of Common Stock during the year ended December 31, 2019 as dividends.\nThere were no conversions of Series C Preferred into Common Stock during the year ended December 31, 2020 or 2019.\nSeries D Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock\nOn November 12, 2020, the Company filed the Series D Certificate with the Secretary of State for the State of Delaware. Pursuant to the Series D Certificate, the Series D Preferred ranks senior to all Common Stock and all other present and future classes or series of capital stock, except for Series B Preferred, and upon liquidation will be entitled to receive the Liquidation Preference Amount (as defined in the Series D Certificate) plus any accrued and unpaid dividends, before the payment or distribution of the Company\u2019s assets or the proceeds thereof is made to the holders of any junior securities. Additionally, dividends on shares of Series D Preferred will be paid prior to any junior securities, and are to be paid at the rate of 4% of the Stated Value (as defined in the Series D Certificate) per share per annum in the form of shares of Series D Preferred. Holders of Series D Preferred shall vote together with holders of Common Stock on an as-converted basis, and not as a separate class, except (i) the holders of Series D Preferred, voting as a separate class, shall be entitled to elect two directors, (ii) the holders of Series D Preferred have the right to vote as a separate class regarding the waiver of certain protective provisions set forth in the Series D Certificate, and (iii) as otherwise required by law.\nThe holders of Series D Preferred may voluntarily convert their shares of Series D Preferred into Common Stock at any time that is at least ninety days following the issuance date, at the conversion price calculated by dividing the Stated Value by the conversion price of $0.0583 per share of Common Stock, subject to adjustments as set forth in Section 5(e) of the Series D Certificate. The shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Series D Preferred shall be subject to the following registration rights: (i) one demand registration starting three months after the Closing, (ii) two demand registrations starting one year after the Closing, and (iii) unlimited piggy-back and Form S-3 registration rights with reasonable and customary terms.\nIf, on any date that is at least five (5) years following the Issuance Date, (i) the Common Stock is registered pursuant to Section 12(b) or (g) under the Exchange Act; (ii) there are sufficient authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock (which have not otherwise been reserved or committed for issuance) to permit the issuance of all Common Shares issuable upon conversion of all outstanding shares of Series D Preferred; (iii) upon issuance, the Common Shares will be either (A) covered by an effective registration statement under the Securities Act, which is then available for the immediate resale of such Common Shares by the recipients thereof, and the Board reasonably believes that such effectiveness will continue uninterrupted for the foreseeable future, or (B) freely tradable without restriction pursuant to Rule l44 promulgated under the Securities Act without volume or manner-of-sale restrictions or current public information requirements, as determined by the counsel to the Company as set forth in a written opinion letter to such effect, addressed and acceptable to the Transfer Agent and the affected holders; and (iv) the VWAP of a share of Common Stock is greater than 300% of the Conversion Price (as defined in Section 5(d) below) then in effect for a period of at least twenty (20) Trading Days in any period of thirty (30) consecutive Trading Days, then the Company shall have the right, subject to the terms and conditions, to convert (a \u201cMandatory Conversion\u201d) all, but not less than all, of the issued and outstanding shares of Series D Preferred into Common Stock.\nOn the fourth anniversary of the Issuance Date, or in the event of the consummation of a Change of Control, if any shares of Series D Preferred are outstanding, then each holder of Series D Preferred shall have the right (the \u201cHolder Redemption Right\u201d), at such holder\u2019s option, to require the Company to redeem all or any portion of such holder\u2019s shares of Series D Preferred at the Liquidation Preference Amount per share of Series D Preferred plus an amount equal to all accrued but unpaid dividends, if any, (such price, the \u201cHolder Redemption Price\u201d), which Holder Redemption Price shall be paid in cash.\nOn November 12, 2020 (\u201cClosing Date\u201d), the Company consummated the Series D Financing, resulting in the sale of 11,560 shares of its Series D Preferred, resulting in gross proceeds to the Company of $11.56 million, less fees and expenses. The gross proceeds include approximately $2.2 million in principal amount due and payable under the terms of certain term loans issued by the Company on September 29, 2020 (\u201cBridge Note\u201d), which Bridge Notes were converted into Series D Preferred at Closing (the \u201cConversion\u201d). The issuance and sale of the Series D Preferred was made pursuant to that certain Securities Purchase Agreement, dated September 28, 2020 (the \"Purchase Agreement\"), by and between the Company and the Investors, for the purchase price of $1,000 per share of Series D Preferred. The Conversion and Series D Financing was undertaken pursuant to Section 3(a)(9) and/or Rule 506 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"Securities Act\"). On December 23, 2020, the Company sold an additional 500 shares of Series D Preferred resulting in gross proceeds to the Company of $500,000 less fees and expenses.\nOn the Closing Date, the Company exchanged approximately $661,000 of liabilities of the Company for 661.3 shares of Series D Preferred, and received notice from the holders of a majority of the Series C Preferred (the \u201cSeries C Exchange Notice\u201d) of their election to convert all of their shares of Series C Preferred into Series D Preferred, and further exercising their right to require all other holders of Series C Preferred to convert their shares of Series C Preferred into Series D Preferred (the \u201cSeries C Exchange\u201d). Upon the consummation of the Series C Exchange in accordance with the terms of the Series C Exchange Notice, the Company issued an additional 10,000 shares of Series D Preferred in exchange for all 1,000 issued and outstanding shares of the Company\u2019s Series C Preferred. The Company determined that the Series C Exchange was a modification of its Series C preferred stock. Using the fair value method, the Company concluded that the modification was significant and will apply the guidance in ASC 260-10-S99 for extinguishments. Under such guidance, the difference between the consideration paid (i.e. the fair value of the new or modified preferred shares) and the carrying value of the original preferred shares was recognized as a deemed dividend. Pursuant to such guidance the company recorded approximately $10,206,000 as a deemed dividend in the computation of Earnings Per Share.\nOn December 31, 2020, the Company issued 142 shares of Series D Preferred Stock as payment of dividends due to the Series D Preferred stockholders.\nGuidance for accounting for freestanding financial instruments that contain characteristics of both liabilities and equity are contained in ASC 480, Distinguishing Liabilities From Equity and Accounting Series Release 268 (\u201cASR 268\u201d) Redeemable Preferred Stocks. The Company evaluated the provisions of the Series C Preferred and determined that the provisions of the Series C Preferred grant the holders of the Series C Preferred a redemption right whereby the holders of the Series C Preferred may, at any time after the third anniversary of the Series C Preferred issuance, require the Company to redeem in cash any or all of the holder\u2019s outstanding Series C Preferred at an amount equal to the Liquidation Preference Amount (\u201cLiquidation Preference Amount\u201d). The Liquidation Preference Amount is defined as the greater of the stated value of the Series C Preferred plus any accrued unpaid interest or such amount per share as would have been payable had each such share been converted into Common Stock. In the event of a Change of Control, the holders of Series C Preferred shall have the right to require the Company to redeem in cash all or any portion of such holder\u2019s shares at the Liquidation Preference Amount. The Company has concluded that because the redemption features of the Series C Preferred are outside of the control of the Company, the instrument is to be recorded as temporary or mezzanine equity in accordance with the provisions of ASR 268.\nLikewise, the Company evaluated the provisions of the Series D Preferred and determined that the provisions of the Series D Preferred grant the holders of the Series D Preferred a redemption right whereby the holders of the Series D Preferred may, at any time after the fourth anniversary of the Series D Preferred issuance, require the Company to redeem in cash any or all of the holder\u2019s outstanding Series D Preferred at an amount equal to the Series D Liquidation Preference Amount. In the event of a Change of Control, the holders of Series D Preferred shall have the right to require the Company to redeem in cash all or any portion of such holder\u2019s shares at the Series D Liquidation Preference Amount. The Company has concluded that because the redemption features of the Series D Preferred are outside of the control of the Company, the instrument is to be recorded as temporary or mezzanine equity in accordance with the provisions of ASR 268.\nThe Company noted that the Series C Preferred and Series D Preferred instruments were hybrid instruments that contain several embedded features. In November 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-16 to amend ASC 815, \u201cDerivatives and Hedging\u201d, (\u201cASC 815\u201d) and require the use of the whole instrument approach (described below) to determine whether the nature of the host contract in a hybrid instrument issued in the form of a share is more akin to debt or to equity.\nThe whole instrument approach requires an issuer or investor to consider the economic characteristics and risks of the entire hybrid instrument, including all of its stated and implied substantive terms and features. Under this approach, all stated and implied features, including the embedded feature being evaluated for bifurcation, must be considered. Each term and feature should be weighed based on the relevant facts and circumstances to determine the nature of the host contract. This approach results in a single, consistent determination of the nature of the host contract, which is then used to evaluate each embedded feature for bifurcation. That is, the host contract does not change as each feature is evaluated.\nThe revised guidance further clarifies that the existence or omission of any single feature, including an investor-held, fixed-price, noncontingent redemption option, does not determine the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract. Instead, an entity must base that determination on an evaluation of the entire hybrid instrument, including all substantive terms and features.\nHowever, an individual term or feature may be weighed more heavily in the evaluation based on facts and circumstances. An evaluation of all relevant terms and features, including the circumstances surrounding the issuance or acquisition of the equity share, as well as the likelihood that an issuer or investor is expected to exercise any options within the host contract, to determine the nature of the host contract, requires judgement.\nUsing the whole instrument approach, the Company concluded that the host instruments of both the Series C Preferred and Series D Preferred were more akin to debt than equity as the majority of identified features contain more characteristics of debt.\nThe Company evaluated the identified embedded features of the Series C Preferred and Series D Preferred host instruments and determined that certain features meet the definition of and contained the characteristics of derivative financial instruments requiring bifurcation at fair value from the host instrument.\nAccordingly, the Company has bifurcated from the Series C Preferred host instrument the conversion options, redemption option and participating dividend feature in accordance with the guidance in ASC 815. These bifurcated features aggregated approximately $833,000 at issuance and have been recorded as a discount to the Series C Preferred. Such amount were accreted to the point of their exchange into shares of Series D Preferred on November 12, 2020 using the effective interest rate method. The accretion of these features is recorded as a deemed dividend.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded the accretion of Series C Preferred debt issuance costs and derivative liabilities aggregating approximately $573,000 using the effective interest rate method. On November 12, 2020, pursuant to the exchange of the Series C Preferred into Series D Preferred, the Company recorded approximately $543,000 of remaining unamortized Series C discount as a deemed dividend. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recorded the accretion of debt issuance costs and derivative liabilities aggregating approximately $728,000 using the effective interest rate method as a deemed dividend.\nThe Company has bifurcated from the Series D Preferred host instrument the conversion options, redemption option and participating dividend feature in accordance with the guidance in ASC 815. These bifurcated features aggregated approximately $26,011,000 at issuance and have been recorded as a discount to the Series D. As the fair value of the derivative liabilities was in excess of the Series D Preferred Stock carrying value, the Company recognized a deemed dividend of approximately $4,201,000. The Series D Preferred financing was approved the Company\u2019s Board of Directors to provide for an immediate need of capital, to allow the Company to continue as a going concern and to execute the Company\u2019s business plan after consultation with several of the Company\u2019s largest shareholders and a review of financing alternatives. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded the accretion of debt issuance costs and derivative liabilities aggregating approximately $1,572,000 using the effective interest rate method as a deemed dividend.\nThe Company reflected the following in Mezzanine Equity for the Series C and Series D Preferred Stock as of December 31, 2019 and 2020:\nSeries C\nSeries D\nConvertible\nConvertible\nRedeemable\nRedeemable\nPreferred\nPreferred\n(Amounts in thousands, except share amounts)\nShares\nAmount\nShares\nAmount\nTotal Series C Preferred Stock - December 31, 2018\n1,000\n$8,156\n-\n$-\nAccretion of discount - deemed dividend for the twelve months ended December 31,\n-\n-\n-\nTotal Series C Preferred Stock - December 31, 2019\n1,000\n$8,884\n-\n$-\nAccretion of Series C discount - deemed dividend\n-\n-\n-\nDeemed dividend of unamortized discount at date of conversion of Series C Preferred Stock into Series D Preferred Stock\n-\n-\n-\nIssuance of Series D Preferred Stock\n-\n-\n12,060\n12,060\nExchange of Series C Preferred Stock into Series D Preferred Stock\n(1,000)\n(10,000)\n10,000\n10,000\nDiscount - transaction costs\n-\n-\n-\n(1,053)\nIssuance of Series D Preferred as payment of liabilities\n-\n-\nIssuance of Series D Preferred as payment of dividends due\n-\n-\nDiscount - bifurcated derivative\n-\n-\n-\n(21,810)\nAccretion of Series D discount - deemed dividend\n-\n-\n-\n1,572\nBalance of Preferred Stocks at December 31, 2020\n-\n$-\n22,863\n$1,572\n14. EQUITY\nThe Company\u2019s Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, authorizes the issuance of two classes of stock to be designated \u201cCommon Stock\u201d and \u201cPreferred Stock\u201d. The Preferred Stock may be divided into such number of series and with the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions as the Board of Directors may determine.\nOn June 9, 2020, the Company amended its Certificate of Incorporation to increase the number of shares of the Company\u2019s Common Stock and the number of shares of the Company\u2019s Preferred Stock authorized thereunder from an aggregate of 179 million to 350 million, consisting of 345 million shares of Common Stock and 5 million shares of Preferred Stock. On September 28, 2020, the Company received executed written consents from the requisite holders of the Company's voting securities, voting on an as-converted basis, approving the Amended Charter, which, among other things, will increase the authorized number of shares of Common Stock from 345 million shares to 1.0 billion shares, with no change to the number of authorized shares of Preferred Stock. This action did not become effective until October 13, 2020.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had 180,096,317 and 180,089,613 shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding, respectively. Our authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock are available for issuance without action by our shareholders. All shares of Common Stock now outstanding are fully paid and non-assessable.\nOn February 20, 2020, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement (the \u201cTriton Purchase Agreement\u201d) with Triton Funds LP, a Delaware limited partnership (\"Triton\"). The Triton Purchase Agreement provides the Company the right to sell to Triton, and Triton is obligated to purchase, up to $2.0 million worth of shares of Common Stock under the Triton Purchase Agreement (the \"Triton Offering\u201d). Pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth in the Triton Purchase Agreement, the purchase price of the Common Stock will be based on the number of shares of Common Stock equal to the amount in U.S. Dollars that the Company intends to sell to Triton to be set forth in each written notice sent to Triton by the Company (the \"Triton Purchase Notice\") and delivered to Triton (the \"Triton Purchase Notice Amount\"), divided by the lowest daily volume weighted average price of the Company's Common Stock listed on the OTC Markets during the five business days prior to closing (the \"Triton Shares\"). The closing of the purchase of the Triton Shares as set forth in the Triton Notice will occur no later than three business days following receipt of the Triton Shares by Triton.\nIn February and March of 2020, the Company sold, and Triton purchased, an aggregate of 10,000,000 shares of Common Stock for cash. In February, the Company sold 4,000,000 shares of Common Stock for $0.16 per share resulting in gross proceeds to the Company of $640,000. In March 2020, the Company sold 6,000,000 shares of Common Stock resulting in gross proceeds to the Company of $765,000, or a per share purchase price of $0.13 per share. Aggregate net proceeds from this financing approximated $1,387,000 after recognition of direct offering costs.\nLincoln Park Capital Fund, LLC\nOn April 28, 2020, the Company entered into a purchase agreement, and as amended on June 11, 2020 (the \u201cLincoln Purchase Agreement\u201d), and a registration rights agreement (the \u201cLincoln Registration Rights Agreement\u201d) with Lincoln Park Capital fund, LLC (\u201cLincoln Park\u201d) pursuant to which Lincoln Park committed to purchase up to $10,250,000 of our Common Stock.\nUnder the terms and subject to the conditions of the Lincoln Purchase Agreement, including stockholder approval of an amendment to the Company\u2019s Certificate of Incorporation, as amended from time to time (the \"Certificate of Incorporation\") to increase the number of shares of the Company\u2019s capital stock to 350 million shares, obtained from our shareholders effective June 9, 2020, we have the right, but not the obligation, to sell to Lincoln Park, and Lincoln Park is obligated to purchase up to $10,250,000 of shares of Common Stock. On April 28, 2020, we sold 1,000,000 shares of Common Stock to Lincoln Park under the Lincoln Purchase Agreement for an aggregate purchase price of $100,000 (the \u201cInitial Purchase Shares\u201d). On June 11, 2020, we sold an additional 1,500,000 shares of Common Stock to Lincoln Park under the Lincoln Purchase Agreement for an aggregate purchase price of $150,000 (the \u201cCommencement Purchase Shares\u201d). Future sales of Common Stock under the Lincoln Purchase Agreement, if any, will be subject to certain limitations, and may occur from time to time, at our sole discretion, over the 24-month period commencing on July 8, 2020, and the other conditions set forth in the Purchase Agreement are satisfied (such date on which all of such conditions are satisfied, the \u201cCommencement Date\u201d).\nAfter the Commencement Date, on any business day over the term of the Lincoln Purchase Agreement, the Company has the right, in its sole discretion, to direct Lincoln Park to purchase up to 125,000 shares of its Common Stock on such business day (the \u201cRegular Purchase\u201d), subject to increases under certain circumstances as provided in the Lincoln Purchase Agreement. The purchase price per share of Common Stock for each such Regular Purchase will be based on prevailing market prices of the Company\u2019s Common Stock immediately preceding the time of sale as computed under the Lincoln Purchase Agreement. In each case, Lincoln Park\u2019s maximum commitment in any single Regular Purchase may not exceed $500,000. In addition to Regular Purchases, provided that the Company presents Lincoln Park with a Lincoln Purchase Notice for the full amount allowed for a Regular Purchase, the Company may also direct Lincoln Park to make accelerated purchases and additional accelerated purchases as described in the Lincoln Purchase Agreement.\nPursuant to the terms of the Lincoln Purchase Agreement, in no event may the Company issue or sell to Lincoln Park under the shares of Common Stock under the Lincoln Purchase Agreement which, when aggregated with all other shares of Common Stock then beneficially owned by Lincoln Park and its affiliates (as calculated pursuant to Section 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d) and Rule 13d-3 promulgated thereunder), would result in the beneficial ownership by Lincoln Park and its affiliates of more than 4.99% of the then issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock (the \u201cBeneficial Ownership Limitation\u201d).\nThe Lincoln Purchase Agreement and the Lincoln Registration Rights Agreement contain customary representations, warranties, agreements and conditions and indemnification obligations of the parties. The Company has the right to terminate the Purchase Agreement at any time, at no cost or penalty. The Company issued to Lincoln Park 2,500,000 shares of Common Stock in consideration for entering into the Lincoln Purchase Agreement. Pursuant to this issuance, $400,000 was recorded by the Company as a deferred stock issuance cost. Such amount was recorded in the Company\u2019s consolidated balance sheet under the caption \u201cOther assets\u201d. Such deferred stock issuance costs will be recognized as a charge against paid in capital in proportion to securities sold under this Lincoln Purchase Agreement. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recognized approximately $36,000 as a charge against paid- in capital relating to securities sold under the Lincoln Purchase Agreement.\nIn addition to the Initial Purchase Shares and Commencement Purchase Shares disclosed above, during the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company sold an aggregate 3,200,000 shares of Common Stock to Lincoln Park under the terms of the Lincoln Purchase Agreement resulting in gross cash proceeds to the Company of approximately $918,000.\nOur Board of Directors has designated five series of Preferred Stock; (i) Series A Preferred, (ii) Series A-1 Preferred, (iii) Series B Preferred, (iv) Series C Preferred and (v) Series D Preferred. As of December 31, 2020, there were 14,911 shares of Series A Preferred outstanding, 14,782 shares of Series A-1 Preferred outstanding, 239,400 shares of series B Preferred outstanding, 0 shares of Series C Preferred outstanding, and 22,863 shares of Series D Preferred outstanding.\nSeries A Convertible Preferred Stock\nOn September 15, 2017, the Company filed the Certificate of Designations of the Series A Preferred with the Delaware Secretary of State (the \u201cSeries A Certificate\u201d), designating 38,000 shares of the Company\u2019s preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share, as Series A Preferred. The Company had 37,467 shares of Series A Preferred outstanding as of December 31, 2019.\nDuring July 2020, the Company entered into the Series A Exchange Agreement with the Series A Holders, pursuant to which such Series A Holders exchanged 18,828 shares of Series A Preferred for an equivalent number of Series A-1 Preferred in consideration for their waiver of approximately $1,849,000 in dividends payable.\nOn September 28, 2020, the Company received executed written consents from (i) the requisite holders of the Company's voting securities, voting on an as-converted basis, and (ii) the requisite holders of Series A Preferred, voting as a separate class, approving the Amended Series A Certificate, which, among other things, provides for (i) the automatic conversion of all Series A Preferred into Common Stock at a rate of 10% per month following the Closing of the Series D Financing, with the conversion price for such conversion reduced from $1.15 per share of Common Stock, to $0.20 per share of Common Stock, and (ii) a reduction of the dividend rate from 8% of the stated Series A Liquidation Preference Amount if paid in cash and 10% of the stated Series A Liquidation Preference Amount if paid in Common Stock, to 4% of the Series A Liquidation Preference Amount, with the dividends being paid only in shares of Common Stock.\nThe Company determined that the September 28, 2020 changes to the Series A Preferred Stock was a modification of its Series A preferred stock. Using the fair value method, the Company concluded that the modification was significant and applied the guidance in ASC 260-10-S99 for extinguishments. Under such guidance, the Company recognized the difference between the consideration paid (i.e. the fair value of the new or modified preferred shares) and the carrying value of the original preferred shares as a deemed dividend to (from) the holder. Pursuant to such guidance the company recorded approximately $9,173,000 as a deemed dividend from the holder in the computation of Earnings Per Share.\nAs modified, shares of Series A Preferred accrue dividends at a rate of 4% per annum payable through the Conversion Period, as defined below, in shares of Common Stock. Each share of Series A Preferred has a liquidation preference of $1,000 per share and is convertible, at the option of the holder, into that number of shares of the Company\u2019s Common Stock equal to the Liquidation Preference, divided by $0.20. Each holder of the Series A Preferred is entitled to vote on all matters, together with the holders of Common Stock, on an as converted basis. The Series A Preferred is subordinate to and ranks junior to the Company\u2019s Series B Preferred, Series C Preferred, Series D Preferred and all indebtedness of the Company, and ranks senior to the Company\u2019s Common Stock and to all other classes and series of equity securities of the Company which by their terms rank junior to the Series A Preferred. Holders of Series A Preferred may elect to convert shares of Series A Preferred into Conversion Shares at any time. In the event the volume-weighted average price (\u201cVWAP\u201d) of the Company\u2019s Common Stock is at least $2.15 per share for at least 20 consecutive trading days, the Company may elect to convert one-half of the shares of Series A Preferred issued and outstanding, on a pro-rata basis, into Conversion Shares, or, if the VWAP of the Company\u2019s Common Stock is at least $2.15 for 80 consecutive trading days, the Company may convert all issued and outstanding shares of Series A Preferred into Conversion Shares. In addition, the Series A Certificate provides for a voluntary conversion window, beginning on the consummation of the Series D Financing, and ends on August 1, 2021 (the \u201cConversion Period\u201d), whereby holders may voluntarily convert all shares of Series A Preferred into Common Stock upon notice to the Company, and provides that holders of Series A Preferred that do not voluntarily convert all shares of Series A Preferred into Common Stock, a mandatory, automatic conversion of each such holder\u2019s shares of Series A Preferred at a rate of 10% per month beginning on the consummation of the Series D Financing, with all shares converting by August 1, 2021. In the event of a Change of Control, the Company will have the option to redeem all issued and outstanding shares of Series A Preferred for 115% of the Liquidation Preference per share.\nThe Company had 14,911 shares of Series A Preferred outstanding as of December 31, 2020. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company had cumulative undeclared dividends of $0. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company issued the holders of Series A Preferred 1,388,876 and 6,959,523 shares of Common Stock, respectively, as payment of dividends due.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company issued 18,640,000 shares of Common Stock upon the conversion of 3,728 shares of Series A Preferred Stock.\nSeries A-1 Convertible Preferred Stock\nIn July 2020, the Company filed the Series A-1 Certificate with the Secretary of State for the State of Delaware - Division of Corporations, designating 31,021 shares of the Company\u2019s Preferred Stock as Series A-1 Preferred. Shares of Series A-1 Preferred accrue cumulative dividends and are payable quarterly beginning March 31, 2021 at a rate of 8% per annum if paid in cash, or 10% per annum if paid by the issuance of shares of the Company\u2019s Common Stock.\nShares of Series A-1 Preferred rank senior to the Company\u2019s Common Stock, pari-passu to the Company's Series A Preferred, and are subordinate and rank junior to Series B Preferred and Series D Preferred.\nEach share of Series A-1 Preferred has a liquidation preference equal to the greater of (i) $1,000 per share plus all accrued and unpaid dividends, or (ii) such amount per share as would have been payable had each such share been converted into Common Stock immediately prior to such liquidation, dissolution or winding up (the amount payable pursuant to the foregoing is referred to herein as the \u201cSeries A-1 Liquidation Preference Amount\u201d) before any payment shall be made or any assets distributed to the holders of the Common Stock or any other classes and series of equity securities of the Company which by their terms rank junior to the Series A-1 Preferred.\nEach share of Series A-1 Preferred is convertible into that number of shares of the Company\u2019s Common Stock (\u201cSeries A-1 Conversion Shares\u201d) equal to that number of shares of Series A-1 Preferred being converted multiplied by $1,000, divided by $0.65, or the conversion price as defined in the Series A-1 Certificate in effect as of the date the holder delivers to the Company their notice of election to convert. Holders of Series A-1 Preferred may elect to convert shares of Series A-1 Preferred into Common Stock at any time. In addition to the aforementioned holder conversion option, if the volume weighted average closing price (VWAP) of the Company\u2019s Common Stock is at least $1.00 per share for 20 consecutive trading days, then the Company has the right to convert one-half of the issued and outstanding shares of Series A-1 Preferred into Common Stock. In the event of a Change of Control, the Company will have the option to redeem all issued and outstanding shares of Series A-1 Preferred for 115% of the Liquidation Preference per share.\nThe Series A-1 Preferred is a freestanding financial instrument that contains characteristics of both liabilities and equity. Guidance for accounting for freestanding financial instruments that contain characteristics of both liabilities and equity are contained in ASC 480 and ASR 268. Pursuant to this guidance, the Company evaluated the various provisions of the Series A-1 Preferred and determined that the instrument should be recorded as a component of permanent equity.\nThe Company noted that the Series A-1 Preferred Stock instrument was a hybrid instrument that contains several embedded features. In November 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-16 to amend ASC 815, \u201cDerivatives and Hedging\u201d, (\u201cASC 815\u201d) and require the use of the whole instrument approach (described below) to determine whether the nature of the host contract in a hybrid instrument issued in the form of a share is more akin to debt or to equity.\nUsing the whole instrument approach, the Company concluded that the host instrument is more akin to equity than debt as the majority of identified features contain more characteristics of equity.\nThe Company evaluated the identified embedded features of the Series A-1 Preferred host instrument and determined that certain features did not meet the definition of and did not contain the characteristics of derivative financial instruments requiring bifurcation at fair value from the host instrument.\nDuring July 2020, the Company entered into an Exchange Agreement, Consent and Waiver (\u201cExchange Agreement\u201d) with certain holders of its Series A Preferred (the \"Series A Holders\"), pursuant to which such Series A Holders exchanged 18,828 shares of Series A Preferred for an equivalent number of Series A-1 Preferred in consideration for their waiver of approximately $1,849,000 in dividends payable to the Series A Holders and payable for the quarters ended March 31, 2020 and June 30, 2020 (the \u201cSeries A Restructuring\u201d). Also, as part of the Exchange Agreement, 739,372 warrants held by those Series A Holders participating in the exchange were cancelled.\nAs there is no specific guidance under GAAP on whether an amendment to, or exchange of, an equity-classified preferred stock instrument (whether presented in temporary or permanent equity) that is not within the scope of ASC 718 should be accounted for as an extinguishment or a modification, the Company used, by analogy, the Guidance in ASC 470, (\u201cDebt\u201d) regarding the modification of debt instruments and determined that the exchange transaction was a modification.\nThe Company measured the fair value of the Series A and A-1 Preferred stock immediately before and after the modification date by measuring the value of Common Stock each instrument was convertible into and determined that the modification resulted in a deemed dividend of approximately $2,272,000.\nOn September 28, 2020, the Company's holders of Common Stock and Preferred Stock voted to revise the Series A-1 Certificate by i) amending and restating the Series A-1 Certificate to, without limitation, provide for (i) the voluntary conversion of all outstanding shares of the Company's Series A-1 Preferred into shares of the Company\u2019s Common Stock at a reduced conversion price of $0.20 per share of Common Stock, and (ii) the automatic conversion of all issued and outstanding shares of Series A Preferred and Series A-1 Preferred into shares of Common Stock at a rate of 10% per month, beginning on November 1, 2020, and ending on August 1, 2021, at the reduced conversion price of $0.20 per share of Common Stock;\nThe Company determined that the September 28, 2020 changes to the Series A Preferred Stock was a modification of its Series A-1 preferred stock. Using the fair value method, the Company concluded that the modification was significant and applied the guidance in ASC 260-10-S99 for extinguishments. Under such guidance, the difference between the consideration paid (i.e. the fair value of the new or modified preferred shares) and the carrying value of the original preferred shares was recognized as a deemed dividend to (from) the holder. Pursuant to such guidance the company recorded approximately $9,440,000 as a deemed dividend from the holder in the computation of Earnings Per Share.\nThe Company had 14,782 shares and 0 shares of Series A-1 Preferred outstanding as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company issued the holders of Series A-1 Preferred 1,159,416 and 0 shares of Common Stock, respectively, as payment of dividends due.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company issued 19,016,452 shares of Common Stock upon the conversion of 4,046 shares of Series A-1 Preferred.\nSeries B Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock\nThe Company had 239,400 shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock (\u201cSeries B Preferred\u201d) outstanding as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company had cumulative undeclared dividends of approximately $8,000 ($0.03 per share), respectively. There were no conversions of Series B Preferred into Common Stock during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. The Company paid dividends of approximately $51,000 to the holders of our Series B Preferred for each of the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nCommon Stock\nOn September 28, 2020, the Company received executed written consents from the requisite holders of the Company\u2019s voting securities, voting on as as-converted basis, approving the Amended Charter, which, among other things will increase the authorized number of shares of Common Stock from 345 million to 1 billion shares. This action did not become effective until 20 calendar days after an Information Statement was delivered to our shareholders. Such Information Statement was delivered on October 13, 2020.\nThe following table summarizes outstanding Common Stock activity for the following periods:\nCommon Stock\nShares outstanding at December 31, 2018\n98,223,632\nShares issued pursuant to payment of stock dividend on Series A Preferred\n6,959,523\nShares issued as payment of stock dividend on Series C Preferred\n1,857,438\nShares issued for cash\n5,954,545\nShares issued pursuant to option exercises\n351,334\nShares outstanding at December 31, 2019\n113,346,472\nShares issued pursuant to payment of stock dividend on Series A Preferred\n1,388,876\nShares issued pursuant to payment of stock dividend on Series A-1 Preferred\n1,159,416\nShares issued as payment of stock dividend on Series C Preferred\n6,455,149\nShares issued pursuant to Series A conversion to Common Stock\n18,640,000\nShares issued pursuant to Series A-1 conversion to Common Stock\n19,016,452\nShares issued to secure financing facility\n2,500,000\nShares issued for cash\n15,700,000\nShares issued pursuant to option exchange and RSU vesting\n1,883,248\nShares outstanding at December 31, 2020\n180,089,613\nWarrants\nAs of December 31, 2020, warrants to purchase 753,775 shares of Common Stock at prices ranging from $0.01 to $0.80 were outstanding. At December 31, 2020, no warrants are exercisable and become exercisable only upon the attainment of specified events. All warrants expire on September 19, 2028 with the exception of 150,000 warrants whose expiration date is 3 years from initial vesting, such vesting based on certain events . The intrinsic value of warrants outstanding at December 31, 2020 was $0. The Company has excluded from this computation any intrinsic value of the 603,775 warrants issued to the Series A Preferred stockholders due to the conversion exercise contingency associated with these warrants.\nThe following table summarizes warrant activity for the following periods:\nWarrants\nWeighted-Average\nExercise Price\nBalance at December 31, 2018\n1,813,856\n$0.19\nGranted\n-\nExpired / Canceled\n(80,000)\n$1.13\nExercised\n-\nBalance at December 31, 2019\n1,733,856\n$0.14\nGranted\n-\nExpired / Canceled\n(980,081)\n$ 0.15\nExercised\n-\nBalance at December 31, 2020\n753,775\n$ 0.17\nThere were no warrants issued or exercised during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. During the year ended December 31, 2020, 739,386 warrants were cancelled in conjunction with the exchange of Series A Preferred Stock into Series A-1 Preferred Stock, 150,695 warrants were cancelled pursuant to the mandatory conversion of Series A Preferred Stock into Common Stock and 90,000 warrants expired unexercised.\n15. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION\nStock Options\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company had one active stock-based compensation plan: the 2020 Omnibus Stock Incentive Plan (the \u201c2020 Plan\u201d).\n2020 Omnibus Stock Incentive Plan\nOn June 9, 2020, pursuant to authorization obtained from the Company\u2019s stockholders, the Company adopted the 2020 Omnibus Stock Incentive Plan (the \u201c2020 Plan\u201d). Such plan had been previously unanimously approved by the Company\u2019s Board. The purposes of our 2020 Plan are to enhance our ability to attract and retain highly qualified officers, non-employee directors, key employees and consultants, and to motivate those service providers to serve the Company and to expend maximum effort to improve our business results by providing to those service providers an opportunity to acquire or increase a direct proprietary interest in our operations and future success. The 2020 Plan also will allow us to promote greater ownership in our Company by the service providers in order to align the service providers\u2019 interests more closely with the interests of our stockholders. Awards granted under the 2020 Plan are designed to qualify for special tax treatment under Section 422 of the Code.\nPursuant to the adoption of the 2020 Plan, such plan will supersede and replace the Company\u2019s 1999 Plan and no new awards will be granted under the 1999 Plan thereafter. Any awards outstanding under the 1999 Plan on the date of approval of the 2020 Plan will remain subject to the 1999 Plan. Upon approval of our 2020 Plan, all shares of Common Stock remaining authorized and available for issuance under the 1999 Plan and any shares subject to outstanding awards under the 1999 Plan that subsequently expire, terminate, or are surrendered or forfeited for any reason without issuance of shares will automatically become available for issuance under our 2020 Plan. As of December 31, 2020, there are approximately 26,382,377 shares available for issuance under the 2020 Plan.\nThe Company estimates the fair value of its stock options using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model, consistent with the provisions of ASC 718, \u201cCompensation - Stock Compensation\u201d. The fair value of stock options granted is recognized to expense over the requisite service period. Stock-based compensation expense for all share-based payment awards is recognized using the straight-line single-option method. Stock-based compensation expense is reported in operating expense based upon the departments to which substantially all the associated employees report and credited to additional paid-in-capital.\nASC 718 requires the use of a valuation model to calculate the fair value of stock-based awards. The Company has elected to use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which incorporates various assumptions including volatility, expected life, and interest rates. The Company is required to make various assumptions in the application of the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Company has determined that the best measure of expected volatility is based on the historical weekly volatility of the Company\u2019s Common Stock. Historical volatility factors utilized in the Company\u2019s Black-Scholes computations for options granted during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 ranged from 57% to 83%. The Company has elected to estimate the expected life of an award based upon the SEC approved \u201csimplified method\u201d noted under the provisions of Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 14. The expected term used by the Company during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was 5.17 years. The difference between the actual historical expected life and the simplified method was immaterial. The interest rate used is the risk-free interest rate and is based upon U.S. Treasury rates appropriate for the expected term. Interest rates used in the Company\u2019s Black-Scholes calculations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 averaged 2.58%. Dividend yield is zero as the Company does not expect to declare any dividends on the Company\u2019s common shares in the foreseeable future.\nIn addition to the key assumptions used in the Black-Scholes model, the estimated forfeiture rate at the time of valuation is a critical assumption. The Company has adopted the provisions of ASU 2016-09 and will continue to use an estimated annualized forfeiture rate of approximately 5.0% for corporate officers, 4.1% for members of the Board of Directors and 15.0% for all other employees. The Company reviews the expected forfeiture rate annually to determine if that percent is still reasonable based on historical experience.\nA summary of the activity under the Company\u2019s stock option plans is as follows:\nOptions\nWeighted-Average\nExercise Price\nWeighted-Average\nRemaining Contractual\nTerm (Years)\nBalance at December 31, 2018\n7,227,248\n$1.4\n5.8\nGranted\n750,000\n$0.89\n-\nExpired/Cancelled\n(421,242)\n$1.52\n-\nExercised\n(351,334)\n$0.47\n-\nBalance at December 31, 2019\n7,204,672\n$1.32\n5.3\nGranted\n2,450,000\n$ 0.14\n-\nExpired/Cancelled\n(7,069,172)\n$ 1.33\n-\nExercised\n-\n$-\n-\nBalance at December 31, 2020\n2,585,500\n$ 0.19\n9.2\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company issued an aggregate 2,450,000 options to purchase common stock at exercise prices of $0.07 to $0.24. Of the options granted in 2020, 1,750,000 options are issuable to the Company\u2019s Chief Executive Officer and are included as granted options in the totals above, however such options have not been issued to the executive as of the date of this Annual Report, pending the negotiation of a new grant since the consummation of the offering of Series D Preferred in November 2020.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, certain terminated employees exchanged 1,225,500 Common Stock purchase options for 612,750 shares of Common Stock as a component of their severance agreement.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, certain employees exchanged 1,417,832 Common Stock purchase options for 708,916 Restricted Stock Units (\u201cRSUs\u201d) and certain members of the Company\u2019s Board of Directors and certain officers exchanged 3,467,000 Common Stock purchase options for 1,733,500 RSUs.\nIn addition to the aggregate 6,110,332 options exchanged, an additional 958,840 Common Stock purchase options expired unexercised during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, there were no options exercised for cash. During the year ended December 31, 2019, there were 351,334 options exercised for cash resulting in the issuance of 351,334 shares of the Company\u2019s Common Stock and proceeds of approximately $166,000.\nAt December 31, 2020, a total of 2,585,500 options were outstanding, of which 113,137 were exercisable at a weighted average price of $1.12 per share with a remaining weighted average contractual term of 6.13 years. The Company expects that, in addition to the 113,137 options that were exercisable as of December 31, 2020, another 2,472,363 will ultimately vest resulting in a combined total of 2,585,500. Those 2,585,500 shares have a weighted average exercise price of $0.19 and an aggregate intrinsic value of approximately $1,000 as of December 31, 2020. Stock-based compensation expense related to equity options was approximately $263,000 and $643,000 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nThe weighted-average grant-date fair value per share of options granted to employees during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $0.12 and $0.47, respectively. At December 31, 2020, the total remaining unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock options amounted to approximately $277,906, which will be amortized over the weighted-average remaining requisite service period of 1.7 years.\nThe intrinsic value of options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was approximately $0 and $222,000, respectively. The intrinsic value of options exercisable at December 31, 2020 and 2019 was approximately $0 and $0, respectively. The intrinsic value of options that vested during 2020 was approximately $0. The aggregate intrinsic value for all options outstanding as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 was approximately $1,000 and $1,000, respectively.\nThe Company periodically issues RSUs to certain employees which vest over time. When vested, each RSU represents the right to that number of shares of Common Stock equal to the number of RSUs granted. The grant date fair value for RSU\u2019s is based upon the market price of the Company's Common Stock on the date of the grant. The fair value is then amortized to compensation expense over the requisite service period or vesting term.\nA summary of the activity related to RSUs is as follows:\nRSU\u2019s\nWeighted-Average\nIssuance Price\nBalance at December 31, 2019\n-\n$-\nGranted\n3,857,416\n$0.15\nExpired/Cancelled\n(847,959)\n$0.17\nVested\n(2,164,351)\n$0.14\nBalance at December 31, 2020\n845,106\n$0.14\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company granted 708,916 RSUs to certain employees in exchange for options to purchase 1,417,832 shares of Common Stock held by such employees. During the year ended December 31, 2020, 336,998 of these RSUs vested with the remainder of such RSUs vesting quarterly over a period of two years.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company agreed to grant 1,733,500 RSUs to certain officers and members of the Company\u2019s Board of Directors in exchange for options to purchase 3,467,000 shares of Common Stock held by such officers and directors. During the year ended December 31, 2020, 1,000,684 of these RSUs vested with the remainder of such RSUs expiring unvested. At December 31, 2020, the Company had not issued 67,191 shares of its Common Stock pursuant to these vested RSUs.\nThe Company determined that the exchange agreements are a modification of a share-based payment award under ASC 718. Accordingly, the Company computed any incremental compensation expense as a component of the total compensation cost to be measured at the modification date. Aggregate incremental compensation expense measured from the modifications of stock options was approximately $385,000.\nIn addition and unrelated to the aforementioned exchanges, the Company granted 500,000 RSUs on July 29, 2020 at a per share price of $0.13, granted 885,000 RSUs on November 13, 2020 at a per share price of $0.09 and granted 30,000 RSU\u2019s on December 23, 2020 at a per share price of $0.07. During the year ended December 31, 2020, 826,676 of these RSUs vested with the remainder of the RSUs vesting at various dates over a two-year period. As of December 31, 2020, the Company has not issued the Common Stock shares pursuant to the vesting of the 826,669 shares.\nStock-based Compensation\nStock-based compensation related to equity options has been classified as follows in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations (in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31,\nCost of revenue\n$15\n$13\nGeneral and administrative\nSales and marketing\nResearch and development\nTotal\n$862\n$643\nCommon Stock Reserved for Future Issuance\nThe following table summarizes the Common Stock reserved for future issuance as of December 31, 2020:\nCommon Stock\nConvertible preferred stock - Series A, Series A-1, Series B and Series D\n540,677,052\nStock options outstanding\n2,585,500\nRestricted Stock Units\n845,106\nWarrants outstanding\n753,775\nAuthorized for future grant under stock option plans\n26,382,377\n16. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLAN\nDuring 1995, the Company adopted a defined contribution 401(k) retirement plan (the \u201cPlan\u201d). All U.S. based employees aged 21 years and older are eligible to become participants after the completion of 60 day's employment. The Plan provides for annual contributions by the Company of 50% of employee contributions not to exceed 8% of employee compensation. Effective April 1, 2009, the Plan was amended to provide for Company contributions on a discretionary basis. Participants may contribute up to 100% of the annual contribution limitations determined by the Internal Revenue Service.\nEmployees are fully vested in their share of the Company\u2019s contributions after the completion of five years of service. In 2019, the Company authorized contributions of approximately $184,000 for the 2019 plan year of which $138,000 were paid prior to December 31, 2019. In 2020, there were no contributions authorized or made.\n17.
