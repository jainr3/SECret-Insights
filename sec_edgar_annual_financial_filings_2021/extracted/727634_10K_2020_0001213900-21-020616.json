    "item_1": "Item 1. Business\nGeneral\niSign Solutions Inc. (the \u201cCompany\u201d or \u201ciSign\u201d), was incorporated in Delaware in October 1986. iSign is a leading supplier of digital transaction management (DTM) software enabling the paperless, secure and cost-effective management and authentication of document-based transactions. iSign\u2019s solutions encompass a wide array of functionality and services, including electronic signatures, simple-to-complex workflow management and various options for biometric authentication. These solutions are available across virtually all enterprise, desktop and mobile environments as a seamlessly integrated platform for both ad-hoc and fully automated transactions. iSign\u2019s platform can be deployed both on premise and as a cloud-based (\u201cSaaS\u201d) service, with the ability to easily transition between deployment models. The Company is headquartered in San Jose, California.\nIn December 2019, an outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) originated in Wuhan, China and has since spread to a number of other countries, including the U.S. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic. In addition, several states in the U.S., including California, where the Company is headquartered, have experienced an increase of new cases of COVID-19. It is uncertain if this trend will continue into 2021, as shown by the recent uptick in reported cases. The COVID-19 outbreak is disrupting supply chains and affecting production and sales across a wide range of industries. The extent of the impact of COVID-19 on our operational and financial performance will depend on certain developments, including the duration and spread of the outbreak, impact on our customers, employees and vendors all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted. At this point, the extent to which COVID-19 may impact our financial condition or results of operations is uncertain.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, total revenue was $966, an increase of $122, or 14%, compared to total revenue of $844 in the prior year. For the year ended December 31, 2020, software product revenue was $247, an increase of $52, or 27%, compared to product revenue of $195 in the prior year. Maintenance revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $719, an increase of $70, or 11%, compared to maintenance revenue of $649 in the prior year. These increases are primarily attributable to the Company\u2019s growth in recurring revenue and related engineering services.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, the net loss was $528, a decrease of $558, or 51%, compared to $1,086 in the prior year. For the year ended December 31, 2020, non-cash charges, consisting of interest expense, warrant expense and the amortization of debt discount were $293, a decrease of $11, or 4%, compared to $304 in the prior year. For the year ended December 31, 2020, operating expenses were $1,619, a decrease of $8, or 0.5%, compared to operating expenses of $1,627 for the prior year. The decrease in operating expenses resulted from reductions in the amortization of stock options and warrant compensation and professional service expenses.\nCore Technologies\nThe Company\u2019s core technologies can be referred to as \u201ctransaction-enabling\u201d and \u201cbusiness process work flow\u201d technologies. These technologies include various forms of electronic signature methods, such as handwritten, biometric, click-to-sign and others, as well as technologies related to signature verification, authentication, cryptography and the logging of audit trails to prove signers\u2019 intent. These technologies enable the appending of secure, legal and regulatory compliant electronic signatures coupled with an enhanced user experience, all at a fraction of the time and cost required by traditional, paper-based processes for signature capture.\nProducts\nThe Company\u2019s enterprise-class SignatureOne\u00ae and iSign\u00ae suite of electronic signature solutions enable businesses to implement truly paperless, electronic signature-driven business processes. The aggregate of the software functionality enabling the digitization of end-to-end work flow processes is sometimes referred to as \u201cdigital transaction management\u201d (DTM). Many applications provide electronic forms and allow users to fill-in information, but most of these applications still require users to print out a paper copy for a handwritten, ink signature. Solutions powered by iSign products allow legally binding electronic signatures to be added to digital documents, eliminating the need for paper to memorialize the completion, approval or authentication of the transaction. This allows users to reduce transaction times and processing costs.\nThe SignatureOne\u00ae and iSign\u00ae suite of products includes the following:\nSignatureOne\u00ae Ceremony\u00ae Server The SignatureOne\u00ae Ceremony\u00ae Server (\u201cCeremony Server\u201d) provides a highly secure, scalable, patent-protected and streamlined electronic signature solution. Its flexible, easy-to-configure and agile workflow can be rapidly integrated via standard Web services to become an ultimate and cost efficient endpoint in true straight-through processing (the complete removal of paper from business processes) and to facilitate end-to-end management of multi-party approvals for PDF and XHTML documents. The Ceremony Server contains iSign\u2019s core e-signature engine and signature ceremony management tools, and can be seamlessly integrated with numerous ancillary products. Its key features include:\n\u25cf Consent/disclosure management - integral part of audit record; easily reproducible in the event of a dispute;\n\u25cf Configurable document presentment - signatory receipt, access and viewing of document tracked in audit trail;\n\u25cf Multi-party ceremonies - complex processes, simplified; allows for dynamic, multi-channel workflow changes, including remote, face-to-face and mobile scenarios;\n\u25cf Supports complex business rules and dynamic user behaviors;\n\u25cf Configurable branding and workflow;\n\u25cf Flexible tracking and reporting - includes event notification service\n\u25cf Extensive audit trail - embedded in individual document in a tamper evident digital seal; and\n\u25cf Support for multiple signature methods - click-to-sign; biometric; and others.\niSign\u00ae Console\u2122 The iSign\u00ae Console\u2122 (\u201cConsole\u201d) leverages the Ceremony Server\u2019s core signature engine and is ideal for organizations looking for a standalone electronic signature solution. Through its intuitive graphical interface, the Console allows users to upload documents for signature, select signers and signature methods, and manage and enforce document workflow for routing, reviewing, signing and notifications. The Console offers a secure and intuitive solution that requires no integration and is available on-premise or in the cloud.\niSign\u00ae Enterprise iSign\u00ae Enterprise incorporates the features and function of the Ceremony Server and the Console.\niSign\u00ae Family The growing suite of iSign\u00ae products and service includes iSign\u00ae Mobile (for signing on iOS and Android mobile devices), iSign\u00ae Forms (for integrated use of templates and forms), and iSign\u00ae Live (iSign\u2019s patent-pending co-browsing solution for simultaneous browsing signature ceremonies).\nSign-it\u00ae Sign-it\u00ae is a family of desktop software products that enable the real-time capture of electronic and digital signatures, as well as their verification and binding within a standard set of applications, including Adobe Acrobat and Microsoft Word, web-based applications using HTML, XML and XHTML, and custom applications for .NET, C# and similar development environments for the enterprise market. The Sign-it\u00ae family of products combines the strengths of biometrics, and other forms of electronic signatures, with cryptography in a patented process that insures the creation of documents containing legally compliant electronic signatures. These signatures have the same legal standing as a traditional so-called wet signature on paper and are created pursuant to the Electronic Signature in National and Global Commerce Act, as well as other related legislation and regulations. With Sign-it\u00ae products, organizations wishing to process electronic forms, requiring varying levels of security, can reduce the cost and other inefficiencies inherent with paper documents by adding electronic signature technologies to their workflow solutions.\niSign\u00ae Toolkits The iSign\u00ae suite of application development tools for electronic signature capture, encryption and verification in custom applications and web-based processes captures and analyzes the image, speed, stroke sequence and acceleration of a person\u2019s handwritten electronic signature. This capability offers an effective and inexpensive solution for immediate authentication of handwritten signatures. iSign\u00ae toolkits also store certain forensic elements of an electronic signature for use in determining whether a person\u2019s electronic signature is legally valid. They also include software libraries for industry standard encryption and hashing to protect a user\u2019s signature, as well as the data captured in the Ceremony\u00ae process.\nProducts and upgrades that were introduced and first deployed in 2020 include the following:\niSign Enterprise 7.4.4\niSign Enterprise 7.5\niSign Enterprise 7.4.5\niSign Enterprise 7.5.1\niSign Enterprise 7.4.6\niSign Enterprise 7.5.2\niSign Enterprise 7.5.3\niSign Enterprise 7.5.4\niSign Enterprise 6.6.24\niSign Enterprise 7.6\niSign Enterprise 6.6.25\niSign Enterprise 7.5.5\niSign Enterprise 7.6.1\niSign Enterprise 7.5.6\nSign-it for Acrobat 10.7\nIntellectual Property\nThe Company relies on a combination of patent applications, trademarks, trade secrets and contractual provisions to protect its software offerings and technologies. The Company has a policy of requiring its employees and contractors to commit to the protection of proprietary information through written agreements. The Company also has a policy of requiring prospective business partners to enter into non-disclosure agreements before disclosure of any of its proprietary information.\nOver the years, the Company has developed and patented major elements of its software offerings and technologies. The Company currently has the following applications pending:\nPatent App. No.\nFiling Date\n14/650,271\nJune 5, 2015\n14/455,425\nAugust 8, 2014\nThe Company\u2019s technologies go beyond simple electronic signature and include biometric signatures, verification solutions, authentication and validation methods, that result in signed documents that are secure, legal and tamper-resistant.\nThe Company has over 20 registered and unregistered trademarks in the United States and other countries. The Company intends to register its trademarks in those jurisdictions where significant marketing of its products will be undertaken in the foreseeable future.\nResearch and Development\nOur research and development effort is focused on the development, advancement and refinement of our core products and the development of new products. In addition, our research and development team is responsible for the continuous quality measurement and assurance of both existing and new products. We conduct research on software technology, related computer hardware, competitive offerings and alternative solution approaches to develop appropriate product and service offerings for our target markets. Our research and development efforts are often aimed at assisting clients and licensees in further streamlining new and existing workflow processes that our software solutions support and at ensuring that we meet or exceed industry standards and competitive offerings. We provide certain customization and integration services to our clients, including software integration partners and enterprise customers. These efforts are conducted by our team in San Jose, California, supported by contracted staff, including offshore engineers.\nWe believe that our software technologies, platforms and products are now competitive and, while research and development activities will remain at the core of our operations, we intend, going forward, to invest an increasing amount of our resources in sales and marketing activities.\nOur research and development expense was $578 for the year ended December 31, 2020 and $630 for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nMaterial Customers\nHistorically, the Company\u2019s revenue has been derived from hundreds of customers, but a significant percentage of the revenue has been attributable to a limited number of customers. Four customers, as described in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial statements, accounted for 10%, 23%, 23% and 25%, respectively, of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nSeasonality of Business\nThe Company believes that the sale of its products is not subject to seasonal fluctuations.\nBacklog\nBacklog was approximately $215 and $416 at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, representing advanced payments on product and service maintenance agreements. One customer decided to convert their December renewal of a $94 annual maintenance contract to a maintenance contract on a time and materials basis in 2021.\nCompetition\nWe believe that our primary competitive advantages include the following:\n\u25cf Customer options and platform flexibility: Unlike most of our competitors, we offer many flexible configuration options for enterprise clients to address many variants of complex business work flows without the need for costly and time-consuming customization. These solution configurations can be rapidly and seamlessly integrated into a variety of enterprise technology environments.\n\u25cf Software deployment options: Unlike most of our competitors, our software solutions are available as an on demand, private cloud-based software as a service, and on the customer\u2019s premises, which is an important feature for most of our large enterprise clients for compliance, security and control reasons.\n\u25cf Lower cost structure: Through our technology, sales and marketing partners, including Cegedim SA, we believe we offer a lower relative cost structure and higher operating margin than most of our larger competitors.\nCurrently, our primary competition for basic click-to-sign electronic signatures includes Adobe EchoSign, DocuSign and OneSpan (f.k.a. VASCO Data Security International Inc.). We view the balance of the U.S. market as fragmented with a variety of smaller competitors focused on the consumer and small business markets rather than enterprise organizations.\nEmployees\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company employed five full-time employees, one part time employee and eight independent contractors. The Company has established longstanding strategic relationships that allow it to rapidly access product development and deployment capabilities that could be required to address most customer requirements. None of the Company\u2019s employees are party to any collective bargaining agreements. We believe our employee relations are good.\nGeographic Areas\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, sales in the United States as a percentage of total sales was 75% and 80%, respectively. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, long-lived assets located in the United States were $10 and $13, respectively. There were no long-lived assets located elsewhere as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nSegments\nThe Company reports its financial results in one segment.\nAvailable Information\nOur web site is located at www.isignnow.com.

The following discussion relating to projected growth and future results and events constitutes forward-looking statements. Actual results in future periods may differ materially from the forward-looking statements due to a number of risks and uncertainties. We cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements. Except as otherwise required under applicable law, we disclaim any obligation to revise or update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statements or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events.\nUnless otherwise stated herein, all figures in this Item 7, other than price per share data, are stated in thousands (\u201c000s\u201d).\nOverview and Recent Developments\nThe Company is a leading supplier of DTM software enabling the paperless, secure and cost-effective management and authentication of document-based transactions. iSign\u2019s solutions encompass a wide array of functionality and services, including electronic signatures, simple-to-complex workflow management and various options for biometric authentication. These solutions are available across virtually all enterprise, desktop and mobile environments as a seamlessly integrated platform for both ad-hoc and fully automated transactions. The Company\u2019s products and services result in legally binding transactions that are compliant with applicable laws and regulations and that can provide a higher level of security than paper-based processes. The Company has been a leading supplier of enterprise software solutions within the financial services and insurance industries and has made available to its customers significant expense reduction by enabling a completely electronic document and workflow process, as well as the resulting reduction in mailing, scanning, filing and other costs related to the use of paper.\nThe Company was incorporated in Delaware in October 1986. Except for the year ended December 31, 2004, in each year since its inception the Company has incurred losses. For the two-year period ended December 31, 2020, the net loss aggregated approximately $1,761, and at December 31, 2020, the Company\u2019s accumulated deficit was approximately $135,350.\nIn December 2019, an outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) originated in Wuhan, China and has since spread to a number of other countries, including the U.S. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic. In addition, several states in the U.S., including California, where the Company is headquartered, have experienced an increase of new cases of COVID-19. It is uncertain if this trend will continue into the 2021, as shown by the recent uptick in reported cases. The COVID-19 outbreak is disrupting supply chains and affecting production and sales across a wide range of industries. The extent of the impact of COVID-19 on our operational and financial performance will depend on certain developments, including the duration and spread of the outbreak, impact on our customers, employees and vendors all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted. At this point, the extent to which COVID-19 may impact our financial condition or results of operations is uncertain.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, total revenue was $966, an increase of $122, or 14%, compared to total revenue of $844 in the prior year. For the year ended December 31, 2020, software product revenue was $247, an increase of $52, or 27%, compared to product revenue of $195 in the prior year. Maintenance revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $719, an increase of $70, or 11%, compared to maintenance revenue of $649 in the prior year. These increases are primarily attributable to the Company\u2019s growth in recurring revenue and related engineering services.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, operating expenses were $1,619, a decrease of $8, or 0.5%, compared to operating expenses of $1,627 in the prior year. The decrease in operating expense resulted from reductions in the amortization of stock options and professional service expenses. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the loss from operations was $653, a decrease of $130, or 17%, compared to a loss from operations of $783 in the prior year.\nOn May 6, 2020, the Company received loan proceeds in the amount of approximately $123 under the Paycheck Protection Program (\u201cPPP\u201d). The PPP, established as part of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (\u201cCARES Act\u201d), provides for loans to qualifying businesses for amounts up to 2.5 times of the average monthly payroll expenses of the qualifying business. The Companies may apply for the loans and accrued interest to be forgiven after a period of either eight or twenty-four weeks, as long as the borrower uses the loan proceeds for eligible purposes, including payroll, benefits, rent and utilities, and maintains its payroll levels. The amount of loan forgiveness may be reduced if the borrower terminates employees or reduces salaries during the period in question. Under the terms of the related promissory note, the unforgiven portion of the PPP loan is payable over two years at an interest rate of 1%, with a deferral of payments for the first six months. The Company used the proceeds for purposes consistent with the PPP. While the Company currently believes that its use of the loan proceeds, for the most part, meet the conditions for forgiveness of the loan, we cannot assure you that we did not take actions that caused the Company to be ineligible for forgiveness of the loan, in whole or in part.\nThe Company recorded $3 in debt discount amortization for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 related to its debt financings.\nOn January 28, 2020, the Company issued 30 warrants to a consultant for services. The warrants are exercisable for three years with an exercise price of $0.50 per share. The Company ascribed a value of $13 to the warrants based on the Black-Scholes-Merton valuation model. The warrant cost was charged to general and administrative expense during the period.\nOn July 9, 2020, the Company entered into a settlement agreement with a vendor. In addition to a cash payment the Company issued 10 warrants to purchase 10 shares of common stock in settlement of the outstanding accounts payable balance. The warrants are exercisable for five years with an exercise price of $0.50 per share. The Company ascribed a value of $3 to the warrants based on the Black-Scholes-Merton valuation model. The warrant cost was charged to general and administrative expense during the period.\nOn August 11, 2020, the Company issued warrants to purchase 425 shares of common stock to two consultants associated with their unpaid consulting fees. The Company ascribed a value of $160 to the warrants which is booked as stock based compensation in general and administrative expense in the statement of operations. The warrants are only exercisable for deferred consulting fees. Upon exercise, the Company would not receive any cash and would reduce accrued expenses. The above warrants have a three year life from the date of grant and an exercise price of $0.50 per share.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 1, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part IV, Item 15 of this report on Form 10-K.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes. The amounts of assets and liabilities reported in its balance sheets and the amounts of revenue and expenses reported for each period presented are affected by these estimates and assumptions that are used for, but not limited to, revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts, intangible asset impairments, fair value of financial instruments, stock based compensation and valuation allowances on deferred tax assets. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The following critical accounting policies are significantly affected by judgments, assumptions and estimates used by the Company\u2019s management in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements.\nStock based Compensation: Stock-based compensation expense is based on the estimated grant date fair value of the portion of stock-based payment awards that are ultimately expected to vest during the period. The grant date fair value of stock-based awards to employees and directors is calculated using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model. Forfeitures of share-based payment awards are estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Forfeitures are estimated and it is assumed no dividends will be declared. The estimated fair value of stock-based compensation awards to employees is amortized on an accrual basis over the vesting period of the options.\nValuation of equity warrants: The Company values warrants issued using the Black-Scholes-Merton pricing model.\nDerivatives: The Company follows the relevant accounting guidance and records derivative instruments (including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts) in the consolidated balance sheet as either an asset or a liability measured at their fair value, with changes in the derivative\u2019s fair value recognized currently in earnings. The Company values these derivative securities under the fair value method at the end of each reporting period (quarter), and their value is marked-to-market at the end of each reporting period with the gain or loss recorded in earnings. The Company continues to revalue these instruments each quarter to reflect their current value in light of the current market price of our Common Stock. The Company used a simulated probability valuation model to value warrants containing embedded derivative instruments. Determining the appropriate fair-value model and calculating the fair value of such warrants requires considerable judgment. Any change in the estimates (specifically, probabilities) used may cause the value to be higher or lower than that reported. The assumptions used in the model require significant judgment by management and include the following: volatility, expected term, risk-free interest rate, dividends, and warrant holders\u2019 expected rate of return, reset provisions based on expected future financings, projected stock prices, and probability of exercise.\nThe conversion option included within the unsecured convertible promissory notes is accounted for as a derivative liability at its estimated fair value. The derivative is subject to re-measurement at the end of each reporting period, with changes in fair value recognized as a component of interest and other income, in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company will continue to adjust the liability for changes in fair value until the earlier of the conversion or maturity of the unsecured convertible promissory note purchase agreements.\nRevenue: The Company\u2019s principal sources of revenues are from the sale of software products, SOW (engineering services), annual software product, and software maintenance contracts. The Company also derives revenue from customers based on the numbers of signatures produced by the Company\u2019s signature software solutions imbedded within the customer\u2019s product.\nRevenue from contracts with customers is recognized using the following five steps:\na) Identify the contract(s) with a customer;\nb) Identify the performance obligations (a good or service) in the contract;\nc) Determine the transaction price; for each performance obligation within the contract\nd) Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and\ne) Recognize revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies a performance obligation.\nContracts contain performance obligation(s) for the transfer goods or services to a customer. The performance obligations are a promise (or a group of promises) that are distinct. The transaction price is the amount of consideration a Company expects to receive from a customer in exchange for satisfying the performance obligations specified in the contract.\nContracts may contain one or more performance obligations (a good or service). Performance obligations are accounted for separately if they are distinct. A good or service is distinct if the customer can benefit from the good or service either on its own or together with other resources readily available to the customer, and the good or service is distinct in the context of the contract. Otherwise performance obligations will be combined with other promised goods or services until the Company identifies a bundle of goods or services that is distinct.\nThe transaction price is allocated to all separate performance obligations within the contract based on their relative standalone selling prices (\u201cSSP\u201d). The best evidence for SSP is the price the Company would charge for that good or service when sold separately in similar circumstances to similar customers. If goods or services are not always sold separately, the Company would use the best estimate of SSP in the allocation of transaction price.\nThe transaction price reflects the amount of consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services, which may include an estimate of variable consideration to the extent that it is probable of not being subject to significant reversals in the future based on the Company\u2019s experience with similar arrangements. The transaction price also reflects the impact of the time value of money if there is a significant financing component present in an arrangement. The transaction price excludes amounts collected on behalf of third parties, such as sales taxes.\nRevenue is recognized when the Company satisfies each performance obligation identified within the contract by transferring control of the promised goods or services to the customer. Goods or services can transfer at a point in time or over time depending on the nature of the arrangement.\nDeferred revenue represents the Company\u2019s obligation to transfer goods or services to a customer for which the Company has received consideration from the customer. Our payment terms do not vary by the type of products or services offered. The term between invoicing and when payment is due is not significant. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recognized $413 of revenue that was included in deferred revenue at the beginning of the period.\nContract assets exist when the Company has satisfied a performance obligation but does not have an unconditional right to consideration (e.g., because the entity first must satisfy another performance obligation in the contract before it is entitled to invoice the customer).\nThe Company transfers all of its goods and services electronically with the associated costs recorded in cost of sales in the Company\u2019s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nSoftware. Revenue from the sale of software products is recognized when the control is transferred. For most of the Company\u2019s software product sales, the control is transferred at the time the product is electronically transferred because the customer has significant risks and rewards of ownership of the asset and the Company has a present right to payment at that time.\nStatement of Work (SOW). Revenue from SOW (engineering services) is recognized upon completion, transfer and satisfaction of the performance obligations identified with in the contract by the customer.\nTransactional revenue. For transactional type contracts, the Company\u2019s performance obligations are met upon transfer of the software master to the customer. Revenue from transactional customers is recognized as the customer reports the number of units (signatures) rendered over the specified reporting period, generally three months.\nRecurring Product revenue. The company has revenue contracts that allow the customer to utilize the Company\u2019s signature software on an annual basis. Maintenance and support costs are included in the annual price to the customer. The customer has the right to renew or cancel the contract on an annual basis. Recurring revenue is recognized on a straight line basis over the contract period, generally one year.\nMaintenance and support. Maintenance and support services are satisfied ratably over time as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the services. As a result, support and maintenance revenue is recognized on a straight line basis over the period of the contract.\nArrangements with Multiple Performance Obligations. The Company has, from time to time, revenue arrangements that include multiple performance obligations. The Company allocates transaction price to all separate performance obligations based on their relative standalone selling prices (\u201cSSP\u201d). The Company\u2019s best evidence for SSP is the price the Company would charge for that good or service when the Company sells it separately in similar circumstances to similar customers. If goods or services are not always sold separately, the Company uses the best estimate of SSP in the allocation of transaction price. The Company\u2019s process for determining best estimate of SSP involves management\u2019s judgment, and considers multiple factors including, but not limited to, major product groupings, gross margin objectives and pricing practices. Pricing practices may vary over time, depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable. If the facts and circumstances underlying the factors considered change or should future facts and circumstances lead the Company to consider additional factors, the Company\u2019s best estimate of SSP may also change.\nContract costs. The incremental costs of obtaining a contract are capitalized if the costs are expected to be recovered. Costs that are recognized as assets are amortized straight-line over the period as the related goods or services transfer to the customer. Costs incurred to fulfill a contract are capitalized if they are not covered by other relevant guidance, relate directly to a contract, will be used to satisfy future performance obligations, and are expected to be recovered.\nSignificant Judgments. The Company may exercise significant judgment when determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together.\nPractical Expedients and Exemptions. Under Topic 606, incremental costs of obtaining a contract, such as sales commissions, are capitalized if they are expected to be recovered. Expensing these costs as they are incurred is not permitted unless they qualify for the practical expedient. The Company elected the practical expedient to expense the costs to obtain a contract as incurred when the expected amortization period is one year or less.\nThe Company elected the practical expedient under Topic 606 to not disclose the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations, since the majority of the Company\u2019s arrangements have original expected durations of one year or less, or the invoicing corresponds to the value of the Company\u2019s performance completed to date.\nThe Company elected the practical expedient that allows the Company to not assess a contract for a significant financing component if the period between the customer\u2019s payment and the transfer of the goods or services is one year or less.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts: The allowance for doubtful accounts is based on the Company\u2019s assessment of the collectability of specific customer accounts and an assessment of international, political and economic risk as well as the aging of the accounts receivable. If there is a change in actual defaults from the Company\u2019s historical experience, the Company\u2019s estimates of recoverability of amounts due could be affected and the Company would adjust the allowance accordingly.\nLong-lived assets: The Company evaluates the recoverability of its long-lived assets, including intangible assets at least annually or whenever circumstances or events indicate such assets might be impaired. The Company would recognize an impairment charge in the event the net book value of such assets exceeded the future undiscounted cash flows attributable to such assets. Estimation of future cash flows from the products considers the following additional factors:\n\u25cf legal, regulatory or contractual provisions known to the Company that limit the useful life of any product technology to less than the assigned useful life;\n\u25cf whether the Company needs to incur material costs or make modifications in order for it to continue to be able to realize the benefits afforded by the product technologies;\n\u25cf effects of obsolescence or significant competitive pressure on the Company\u2019s current or future products are expected to reduce the anticipated cash flow from the products;\n\u25cf demand for products utilizing the technology will diminish, remain stable or increase; and\n\u25cf whether the current markets for the products based on the technology will remain constant or will change over the useful lives assigned to the technologies.\nCustomer Base: To date, the Company\u2019s electronic signature revenue has been derived primarily from financial service industry end-users and from resellers and channel partners serving the financial service industry primarily in North America, the ASEAN Region and Europe. The Company performs periodic credit evaluations of its customers and does not require collateral. The Company maintains reserves for potential credit losses. Historically, such losses have been within the range of management\u2019s expectations.\nCost of sales: Cost of sales includes direct engineering labor and overhead for specific revenue based projects initiated by customers and maintenance projects specific to customer needs, along with third party services related to the Company\u2019s transactional based revenues.\nResearch and Development Costs: Research and development costs are charged as expense as incurred.\nNet Operating Loss Carry-forwards: Utilization of the Company\u2019s net operating losses may be subject to an annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code and similar state provisions. As a result, a portion of the Company\u2019s net operating loss carry-forwards may not be available to offset future taxable income. The Company has provided a full valuation allowance for deferred tax assets at December 31, 2020 of approximately $65,121 based upon the Company\u2019s history of losses.\nSegments: The Company reports its financial results in one segment.\nRevision to Financial Statements for the Year Ended December 31, 2019\nThe Company is revising its financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2019 to revise the reporting for certain warrants issued by the Company on February 6, 2019 to four consultants and one employee to purchase 985 shares of common stock and other miscellaneous reclassifications.\nResults of Operations - Years Ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019\nRevenue\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, total revenue was $966, an increase of $122, or 14%, compared to total revenue of $844 in the prior year. For the year ended December 31, 2020, software product revenue was $247, an increase of $52, or 27%, compared to product revenue of $195 in the prior year. Maintenance revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020, was $719, an increase of $70, or 11%, compared to maintenance revenue of $649 in the prior year. The increase in product revenue is primarily attributable to the increase in engineering service revenue. The increase in maintenance revenue is primarily attributable to existing customers renewing maintenance contracts at higher price points.\nCost of Sales\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, cost of sales was $146, an increase of $25, or 21%, compared to cost of sales of $121 in the prior year. The increase was primarily due to an increase in direct engineering costs associated with the mix of engineering service and software product revenue during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior year.\nOperating Expenses\nResearch and Development Expenses\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, research and development expenses were $578, a decrease of $52, or 8%, compared to research and development expenses of $630 in the prior year. Research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs, outside contract engineering, maintenance items, and allocated facility expenses. The most significant factors contributing to the decrease in research and development expenses was a decrease in stock option expense, a reduction in outside engineering expense and the reduction in allocated facilities expenses. These reductions were enhanced by an increase in direct labor transfers to cost of sales due to the increase in engineering service revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2020, total research and development expenses before IT and cost of sales allocations were $723, a decrease of $27, or 4%, compared to $750 of total research and development expenses before allocations in the prior year.\nSales and Marketing Expenses\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, sales and marketing expenses were $83, a decrease of $26, or 24%, compared to sales and marketing expenses of $109 in the prior year. The decrease was primarily attributable to an increase in sales to non-commissionable accounts.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, administrative expenses were $812, an increase of $45, or 6%, compared to administrative expenses of $767 in the prior year. The increase was due to an increase in warrant expense of $108 issued in connection to deferred compensation, offset by a decrease of $57 in stock option compensation. All other overhead expenses increased $6.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther income (expense), net, for the year ended December 31, 2020, was $435, an increase of $433, or 21650%, compared to income of $2 in the prior year. The increase in other income and expense is due primarily to the forgiveness of $435 of accounts payable during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. Such forgiveness was generated in conjunction with cash payments of approximately $286.\nInterest Expense\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, related party interest expense was $104, an increase of $30, or 41%, compared to related party interest expense of $74 in the prior year. For the year ended December 31, 2020, other interest expense was $202, an increase of $8, or 4%, compared to other interest expense of $194 in the prior year. The increase in interest expense is primarily due to the increase in borrowings during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded $3 in debt discount amortization associated with its short-term borrowings, $1 of which is attributable to related parties and $2 of which is attributable to other investors, compared to $36 in the prior year, $10 of which is attributable to related parties and $26 of which is attributable to other investors. The decrease in debt discount amortization was primarily due to the extension of the due date of the notes from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2020 the entire amount of debt discount has been fully written off.\nThe due date of the notes was extended again in November 2020 to December 31, 2021.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCash and cash equivalents totaled $26 at December 31, 2020, compared to $25 at December 31, 2019.\nThe cash used in operations was primarily attributable to the net loss of $528. This amount was partially offset by non-cash depreciation and amortization of $6, amortization of warrants associated with long-term liabilities of $160, the issuance of warrants valued at $16 for services and stock-based compensation of $103.\nCash out flows for the acquisition of property and equipment for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $0.\nAccounts receivable were $100 at December 31, 2020, an increase of $39, or 64%, compared to accounts receivable of $61 at December 31, 2019. The increase in accounts receivable is primarily attributable to an increase in orders billed in the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior year.\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets were $10 at December 31, 2020, a decrease of $12, or 55%, compared to prepaid expenses and other current assets of $22 at December 31, 2019. The decrease is primarily due to the transfer to cost of sales of prepaid engineering expense associated with current year revenue.\nShort-term debt was $2,995 at December 31, 2020, an increase of $749, or 33%, compared to $2,246 in the prior year. See financing transactions below. Short term debt includes principal amount on notes for $2,649, accounts receivable advances of $183, a PPP loan of $123 and a vendor note of $40.The Company negotiated an extension of the due date of the notes to December 31, 2021\nAccounts payable were $353 at December 31, 2020, a decrease of $843, or 70%, compared to $1,196 at December 31, 2019. The decrease is due primarily to the forgiveness of $435 of accounts payable, related cash payments of approximately $286 and the issuance of a note payable of $130. These payments and other reductions were offset by the addition of $8 in new accounts payable.\nAccrued compensation was $82 at December 31, 2020, an increase of $11 or 15%, compared to $71 at December 31, 2019. The increase was due primarily to the accrual of commissions and an increase in accrued vacation. Deferred compensation of $219 was reclassified from other long-term liabilities at December 31, 2020 and represents amounts owed to former employees.\nOther accrued liabilities including the long term portion were $1,879 at December 31, 2020, compared to $1,630 at December 31, 2019, an increase of $249, or 15%. The increase is primarily attributable to the accrual of certain franchise taxes and professional service fees.\nDeferred revenue was $215 at December 31, 2020, a decrease of $201, or 48%, compared to deferred revenue, including the long-term portion, of $416 at December 31, 2019. The decrease is primarily due to the shift of one customer to a time and material basis rather than a prepayment bases and an increase in the amount of uncollected maintenance billed in the fourth quarter of 2019. The Company records deferred maintenance when the billing is collected.\nFinancing Transactions\nAdvances:\nDuring the current year the Company received advances against certain accounts receivable of $183, net of a partial repayment of $20 in December 2020 upon collection of the receivable in November of 2020.\nDebt:\nIn May of 2020 the Company applied for and received a PPP loan of $123. The Company used the proceeds for purposes consistent with the PPP. While the Company currently believes that its use of the loan proceeds meets the conditions for forgiveness of the loan, we cannot assure you that we did not take actions that caused the Company to be ineligible for forgiveness of the loan, in whole or in part.\nOn March 25, 2020, the Company issued an aggregate of $150 in unsecured notes to affiliates and other investors. The Company received $75 in cash and $75 in exchange for accounts receivable advances. The unsecured notes are convertible by the holder into common stock at any time at a price per share of $0.50. Upon closing a new financing of at least $1,000 in aggregate proceeds, the Company can force conversion at a price equal to the lesser of $0.50 per share or the price per share of the new financing. The notes bear interest at the rate of 10% per annum and are due December 31, 2021.\nOn June 19, 2020, the Company issued an additional unsecured note for $250,000. The note has the same terms and maturity date as the Company\u2019s other unsecured notes.\nOn July 1, 2020 the Company entered into a settlement agreement with one of its vendors whereby the Company paid $135 in cash and issued a promissory note in the amount of $130 in settlement of approximately $537 in outstanding accounts payable. The note bears interest at the rate of 4% per annum and is due in installments of $40, $45 and $45 on or before the anniversary date of the note over the next three years. The settlement agreement discussed above resulted in gain of $272 recorded as other income in the statement of operations.\nThe Company recorded $3 in debt discount amortization for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 related to prior year debt financings, $1 was to related parties and $2 was to other investors.\nContractual Obligations\nThe Company had no material commitments as of December 31, 2020.",
    "item_7A": "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\nInterest Rate Risk. Any investments in fixed income securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if the market interest rates increase. The Company attempts to limit this exposure by investing primarily in short-term securities.\nForeign Currency Risk. The Company operates a joint venture in China and from time-to-time could make certain capital equipment or other purchases denominated in foreign currencies. As a result, the Company\u2019s cash flows and earnings could be exposed to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. The Company would attempt to limit any such exposure through operational strategies and generally has not hedged currency exposure.\nFuture Results and Stock Price Risk. The Company\u2019s stock price may be subject to significant volatility. The public stock markets have experienced significant volatility in stock prices in recent years. The stock prices of technology companies have experienced particularly high volatility, including, at times, severe price changes that are unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of such companies. The trading price of the Company\u2019s Common Stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to, among other factors, quarter-to-quarter variations in operating results, announcements of technological innovations or new products by the Company or its competitors, competitor consolidation in the industry, announcements of new strategic relationships by the Company or its competitors, general conditions in the computer software industry or the global economy generally, or market volatility unrelated to the Company\u2019s business and operating results. The impact and severity of the above factors could be exacerbated by the Company\u2019s small size, public float and a lack of market liquidity for its Common Stock.\nRisks and Uncertainties. In December 2019, an outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) originated in Wuhan, China and has since spread to a number of other countries, including the U.S. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic. In addition, several states in the U.S., including California, where the Company is headquartered, have declared a state of emergency. The COVID-19 outbreak is disrupting supply chains and affecting production and sales across a wide range of industries. The extent of the impact of COVID-19 on our operational and financial performance will depend on certain developments, including the duration and spread of the outbreak, impact on our customers, employees and vendors all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted. At this point, the extent to which COVID-19 may impact our financial condition or results of operations is uncertain.",

    "item_9A": "Item 9A. Controls and Procedures\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures\nThe Company carried out an evaluation as of the end of the period covered by this report, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to paragraph (b) of Rule 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act of 1934 (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d). Based on that evaluation the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer have concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that the information required to be disclosed in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act (1) is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC\u2019s rules and forms, and (2) is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.\nThe Company does not expect that its disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all error and all fraud. A control procedure, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control procedures are met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control procedures, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control. The Company considered these limitations during the development of its disclosure controls and procedures, and will continually reevaluate them to ensure they provide reasonable assurance that such controls and procedures are effective.\nInternal Control over Financial Reporting\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect transactions and dispositions of assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.\nManagement has assessed the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria established in \u201cInternal Control, Integrated Framework\u201d issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (\u201cCOSO\u201d) in 2013. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company\u2019s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nIn performing this assessment, management identified the following material weaknesses:\nAs a small company with limited resources that are mainly focused on the development and sales of software products and services, iSign does not employ a sufficient number of staff in its finance department to possess an optimal segregation of duties or to provide optimal levels of oversight. This has resulted in certain audit adjustments and management believes that there may be a possibility for a material misstatement to occur in future periods while it employs the current number of personnel in its finance department.\nBased on its assessment, our management concluded that, as of December 31, 2020, our internal control over financial reporting was not effective. Management believes that the identified weaknesses have not affected our ability to present GAAP-compliant financial statements in this Form 10-K. During the year-end financial statement close the Company was able to adjust its financial records to properly present its financial statements and we were therefore able to present GAAP-compliant financial statements. Management does not believe that its weakness with respect to its procedures and controls have had a pervasive effect upon our financial reporting due to our ability to make the necessary reconciling adjustments to our financial statements.\nManagement\u2019s Remediation Initiatives\nManagement conducts a number of activities to address the material weaknesses noted above, including but not limited to the following:\n\u25cf Key managers and accounting personnel work closely with our independent audit firm in evaluating our progress in remediating our material weaknesses with oversight by the audit committee;\n\u25cf Evaluate control procedures on an ongoing basis, and, where possible, modify those control procedures to improve oversight;\n\u25cf Evaluate, and, where possible, employ additional third party resources that can provide oversight support within the Company\u2019s budget constraints; and\n\u25cf As the Company grows its business and the cash flow necessary to hire additional accounting personnel, management expects to pursue and implement such additional hires.\nElements of our remediation plan can only be accomplished over time and we can offer no assurances that those initiatives will ultimately have the intended effects. Ultimately, revenue growth and performance improvements are the most likely avenue to greater resources that will improve the Company\u2019s internal controls.\nManagement will continue the process of reviewing existing controls, procedures and responsibilities to more closely identify financial reporting risks and the required controls to address them. Key control and compensating control procedures will be developed to ensure that material weaknesses are properly addressed and related financial reporting risks are mitigated. Periodic control validation and testing will also be implemented to ensure that controls continue to operate consistently and as designed.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere have not been any changes in the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended December 31, 2020 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.",

(the Company) as of December 31, 2020, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, stockholders\u2019 deficit, and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2020, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The financial statements of iSign Solutions, Inc., as of December 31, 2019, were audited by other auditors whose report dated March 30, 2020, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company\u2019s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nGoing Concern\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company has suffered net losses from operations since inception and has an accumulated deficiency, which raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management\u2019s plans regarding those matters are discussed in Note 1. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nRevenue Recognition\nAs discussed in Note 1, the Company recognizes revenue upon transfer of control of promised services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for those products or services.\nAuditing management\u2019s evaluation of agreements with customers involves significant judgment, given the fact that some agreements require management\u2019s evaluation and allocation of the standalone transaction prices to the performance obligations.\nTo evaluate the appropriateness and accuracy of the assessment by management, we evaluated management\u2019s assessment in relationship to the relevant agreements.\n/s/ M&K CPAS, PLLC\nWe have served as the Company\u2019s auditor since 2020.\nHouston, TX\nApril 7, 2021\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nThe Board of Directors and Stockholders of\niSign Solutions Inc.\nSan Jose, California\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of iSign Solutions Inc. and subsidiary (the \u201cCompany\u201d) as of December 31, 2019, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, changes in stockholders\u2019 deficit, and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2019, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the \u201cfinancial statements\u201d). In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2019, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2019, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nThe Company\u2019s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company\u2019s significant recurring losses and accumulated deficit raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management\u2019s plans in regard to these matters are described in Note 1. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company\u2019s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (\u201cPCAOB\u201d) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.

Nature of Business, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies:\nThe Company:\nThe Company is a leading supplier of digital transaction management (DTM) software enabling the paperless, secure and cost-effective management of document-based transactions. iSign\u2019s solutions encompass a wide array of functionality and services, including electronic signatures, biometric authentication and simple-to-complex workflow management. These solutions are available across virtually all enterprise, desktop and mobile environments as a seamlessly integrated platform for both ad-hoc and fully automated transactions. The Company\u2019s products and services result in legally binding transactions that are compliant with applicable laws and regulations and that can provide a higher level of security than paper-based processes. The Company has been a leading supplier of enterprise software solutions within the financial services and insurance industries and has delivered significant expense reduction by enabling complete document and workflow automation and the resulting reduction in mailing, scanning, filing and other costs related to the use of paper.\nThe Company\u2019s research and development activities have given rise to numerous technologies and products. The Company\u2019s core DTM technologies include various forms of electronic signatures, such as handwritten biometric, click-to-sign and others, as well as signature verification, cryptography and the logging of audit trails to show signers\u2019 intent. These technologies can enable secure, legal and regulatory compliant electronic transactions that can enhance customer experience at a fraction of the time and cost required by traditional, paper-based processes. The Company\u2019s products include SignatureOne\u00ae Ceremony\u2122 Server, Sign-it\u00ae and the iSign\u00ae family of products and services.\nGoing concern and management plans:\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. Except for 2004, the Company has incurred significant losses since its inception and, at December 31, 2020, the Company\u2019s accumulated deficit was $135,203. The Company has primarily met its working capital needs through the sale of debt and equity securities. As of December 31, 2020, the Company\u2019s cash balance was $26. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern.\nThere can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in securing adequate capital resources to fund planned operations or that any additional funds will be available to the Company when needed, or if available, will be available on favorable terms or in amounts required by the Company. If the Company is unable to obtain adequate capital resources to fund operations, it may be required to delay, scale back or eliminate some or all of its operations, which may have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and ability to operate as a going concern. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nIn December 2019, an outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) originated in Wuhan, China and has since spread to a number of other countries, including the U.S. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic. In addition, several states in the U.S., including California, where the Company is headquartered, have declared a state of emergency. The COVID-19 outbreak is disrupting supply chains and affecting production and sales across a wide range of industries. The extent of the impact of COVID-19 on our operational and financial performance will depend on certain developments, including the duration and spread of the outbreak, impact on our customers, employees and vendors all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted. At this point, the extent to which COVID-19 may impact our financial condition or results of operations is uncertain.\nRevision to Financial Statements for the Year Ended December 31, 2019\nThe Company is revising its financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2019 to revise the reporting for certain warrants issued by the Company on February 6, 2019 to four consultants and one employee to purchase 985 shares of common stock and other miscellaneous reclassifications.\nBasis of consolidation:\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. All amounts shown in the accompanying consolidated financial statements are in thousands of dollars except per share amounts.\niSign Solutions Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(In thousands except per share amounts)\n1. Nature of Business, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued):\nUse of estimates:\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, at the date of the consolidated financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from these estimates.\nFair value measures:\nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset, or paid to transfer a liability, in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an ordinary transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Our policy on fair value measures requires us to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The policy establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the level of independent, objective evidence surrounding the inputs used to measure fair value. A financial instrument\u2019s categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The policy prioritizes the inputs into three levels that may be used to measure fair value:\nLevel 1: Applies to assets or liabilities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\nLevel 2: Applies to assets or liabilities for which there are inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions (less active markets); or model-derived valuations in which significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data.\nLevel 3: Applies to assets or liabilities for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities.\nThe Company\u2019s assets and liabilities measured at fair value, whether recurring or non-recurring, at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, and the fair value calculation input hierarchy level that we have determined applies to each asset and liability category.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments:\nThe Company carries financial instruments on the consolidated balance sheet at the fair value of the instruments as of the consolidated balance sheet date. At the end of each period, management assesses the fair value of each instrument and adjusts the carrying value to reflect its assessment. At December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the carrying values of accounts receivable and accounts payable approximated their fair values.\niSign Solutions Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(In thousands except per share amounts)\n1. Nature of Business, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued):\nTreasury Stock:\nShares of common stock returned to, or repurchased by, the Company are recorded at cost and are included as a separate component of stockholders\u2019 equity (deficit). Under the cost method, the gross cost of the shares reacquired is charged to a contra equity account titled treasury stock. The equity accounts that were credited for the original share issuance (Common Stock, additional paid-in capital, etc.) remain intact. When the treasury shares are reissued, proceeds in excess of cost are credited to additional paid-in capital. Any deficiency is charged to accumulated deficit (unless additional paid-in capital from previous treasury share transactions exists, in which case the deficiency is charged to that account, with any excess charged to accumulated deficit).\nDerivatives:\nThe Company, from time to time, enters into transactions which contain conversion privileges, the settlement of which may entitle the holder or the Company to settle the obligation(s) by issuance of Company securities. The Company applies a two-step model in determining whether a financial instrument or an embedded feature is indexed to an issuer\u2019s own stock and thus able to qualify for the scope exception. The fair value of each derivative is estimated each reporting period.\nThe conversion option included within the unsecured convertible promissory notes is accounted for as a derivative liability at its estimated fair value. The derivative is subject to re-measurement at the end of each reporting period, with changes in fair value recognized as a component of interest and other income, in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company will continue to adjust the liability for changes in fair value until the earlier of the conversion or maturity of the unsecured convertible promissory note purchase agreements.\nCash and cash equivalents:\nThe Company considers all highly liquid investments with maturities at the date of purchase of three months or less to be cash equivalents.\nThe Company\u2019s cash and cash equivalents, at December 31, consisted of the following:\nCash in bank $ 26 $ 25\nCash and cash equivalents $ 26 $ 25\nConcentrations of credit risk:\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash, cash equivalents, and accounts receivable. The Company maintains its cash and cash equivalents with various financial institutions. This diversification of risk is consistent with Company policy to maintain liquidity, and mitigate risk of loss as to principal.\nTo date, accounts receivable have been derived principally from revenue earned from end users, manufacturers, and distributors of computer products in North America. The Company performs periodic credit evaluations of its customers, and does not require collateral. The Company maintains reserves for potential credit losses; historically, such losses have been within management\u2019s expectations.\nThe allowance for doubtful accounts is based on the Company\u2019s assessment of the collectability of specific customer accounts and an assessment of international, political and economic risk as well as the aging of the accounts receivable. If there is a change in actual defaults from the Company\u2019s historical experience, the Company\u2019s estimates of recoverability of amounts due could be affected and the Company will adjust the allowance accordingly.\niSign Solutions Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(In thousands except per share amounts)\n1. Nature of Business, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued):\nDeferred financing costs:\nDeferred financing costs include costs paid in cash, such as professional fees and commissions. The costs associated with equity financings, such as in the sale of Common or Preferred Stock, are netted against the proceeds of the offering. In the case of note financings, costs are amortized to interest expense over the life of the notes or upon early payment using the effective interest method.\nProperty and equipment, net:\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets, ranging from three to five years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over their estimated useful lives, not to exceed the term of the related lease. The cost of additions and improvements is capitalized while maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Depreciation expense was $3 and $3 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nLong-lived assets:\nThe Company evaluates the recoverability of its long-lived assets at least annually or whenever circumstances or events indicate such assets might be impaired. The Company would recognize an impairment charge in the event the net book value of such assets exceeded the future undiscounted cash flows attributable to such assets. No such impairment charge was recorded during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nShare-based payment:\nShare-based compensation expense is based on the estimated grant date fair value of the portion of share-based payment awards that is ultimately expected to vest during the period. The grant date fair value of share-based awards to employees and directors is calculated using the Black-Scholes-Merton valuation model. Forfeitures of share-based payment awards are estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates and it is assumed no dividends will be declared. The estimated fair value of share-based compensation awards to employees is amortized over the vesting period of the options.\nRevenue from Contracts with Customers:\nThe Company\u2019s principal sources of revenues are from the sale of software products, SOW (engineering services), annual software product, and software maintenance contracts. The Company also derives revenue from customers based on the numbers of signatures produced by the Company\u2019s signature software solutions imbedded within the customer\u2019s product.\nRevenue from contracts with customers is recognized using the following five steps:\na) Identify the contract(s) with a customer;\nb) Identify the performance obligations (a good or service) in the contract;\nc) Determine the transaction price; for each performance obligation within the contract\nd) Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and\ne) Recognize revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies a performance obligation.\nContracts contain performance obligation(s) for the transfer goods or services to a customer. The performance obligations are a promise (or a group of promises) that are distinct. The transaction price is the amount of consideration a Company expects to receive from a customer in exchange for satisfying the performance obligations specified in the contract.\niSign Solutions Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(In thousands except per share amounts)\n1. Nature of Business, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued):\nContracts may contain one or more performance obligations (a good or service). Performance obligations are accounted for separately if they are distinct. A good or service is distinct if the customer can benefit from the good or service either on its own or together with other resources readily available to the customer, and the good or service is distinct in the context of the contract. Otherwise performance obligations will be combined with other promised goods or services until the Company identifies a bundle of goods or services that is distinct.\nThe transaction price is allocated to all separate performance obligations within the contract based on their relative standalone selling prices (\u201cSSP\u201d). The best evidence for SSP is the price the Company would charge for that good or service when sold separately in similar circumstances to similar customers. If goods or services are not always sold separately, the Company would use the best estimate of SSP in the allocation of transaction price.\nThe transaction price reflects the amount of consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services, which may include an estimate of variable consideration to the extent that it is probable of not being subject to significant reversals in the future based on the Company\u2019s experience with similar arrangements. The transaction price also reflects the impact of the time value of money if there is a significant financing component present in an arrangement. The transaction price excludes amounts collected on behalf of third parties, such as sales taxes.\nRevenue is recognized when the Company satisfies each performance obligation identified within the contract by transferring control of the promised goods or services to the customer. Goods or services can transfer at a point in time or over time depending on the nature of the arrangement.\nDeferred revenue represents the Company\u2019s obligation to transfer goods or services to a customer for which the Company has received consideration from the customer. Our payment terms do not vary by the type of products or services offered. The term between invoicing and when payment is due is not significant. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recognized $413 of revenue that was included in deferred revenue at the beginning of the period.\nContract assets exist when the Company has satisfied a performance obligation but does not have an unconditional right to consideration (e.g., because the entity first must satisfy another performance obligation in the contract before it is entitled to invoice the customer).\nThe Company transfers all of its goods and services electronically with the associated costs recorded in cost of sales in the Company\u2019s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nSoftware. Revenue from the sale of software products is recognized when the control is transferred. For most of the Company\u2019s software product sales, the control is transferred at the time the product is electronically transferred because the customer has significant risks and rewards of ownership of the asset and the Company has a present right to payment at that time.\nStatement of Work (SOW). Revenue from SOW (engineering services) is recognized upon completion, transfer and satisfaction of the performance obligations identified with in the contract by the customer.\nTransactional revenue. For transactional type contracts, the Company\u2019s performance obligations are met upon transfer of the software master to the customer. Revenue from transactional customers is recognized as the customer reports the number of units (signatures) rendered over the specified reporting period, generally three months.\nRecurring Product revenue. The company has revenue contracts that allow the customer to utilize the Company\u2019s signature software on an annual basis. Maintenance and support costs are included in the annual price to the customer. The customer has the right to renew or cancel the contract on an annual basis. Recurring revenue is recognized on a straight line basis over the contract period, generally one year.\niSign Solutions Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(In thousands except per share amounts)\n1. Nature of Business, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued):\nMaintenance and support. Maintenance and support services are satisfied ratably over time as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the services. As a result, support and maintenance revenue is recognized on a straight line basis over the period of the contract.\nArrangements with Multiple Performance Obligations. The Company has, from time to time, revenue arrangements that include multiple performance obligations. The Company allocates transaction price to all separate performance obligations based on their relative standalone selling prices (\u201cSSP\u201d). The Company\u2019s best evidence for SSP is the price the Company would charge for that good or service when the Company sells it separately in similar circumstances to similar customers. If goods or services are not always sold separately, the Company uses the best estimate of SSP in the allocation of transaction price. The Company\u2019s process for determining best estimate of SSP involves management\u2019s judgment, and considers multiple factors including, but not limited to, major product groupings, gross margin objectives and pricing practices. Pricing practices may vary over time, depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable. If the facts and circumstances underlying the factors considered change or should future facts and circumstances lead the Company to consider additional factors, the Company\u2019s best estimate of SSP may also change.\nContract costs. The incremental costs of obtaining a contract are capitalized if the costs are expected to be recovered. Costs that are recognized as assets are amortized straight-line over the period as the related goods or services transfer to the customer. Costs incurred to fulfill a contract are capitalized if they are not covered by other relevant guidance, relate directly to a contract, will be used to satisfy future performance obligations, and are expected to be recovered.\nSignificant Judgments. The Company may exercise significant judgment when determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together.\nPractical Expedients and Exemptions. Under Topic 606, incremental costs of obtaining a contract, such as sales commissions, are capitalized if they are expected to be recovered. Expensing these costs as they are incurred is not permitted unless they qualify for the practical expedient. The Company elected the practical expedient to expense the costs to obtain a contract as incurred when the expected amortization period is one year or less.\nThe Company elected the practical expedient under Topic 606 to not disclose the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations, since the majority of the Company\u2019s arrangements have original expected durations of one year or less, or the invoicing corresponds to the value of the Company\u2019s performance completed to date.\nThe Company elected the practical expedient that allows the Company to not assess a contract for a significant financing component if the period between the customer\u2019s payment and the transfer of the goods or services is one year or less.\nResearch and development:\nResearch and development costs are charged to expense as incurred.\nMarketing:\nThe Company expenses advertising (marketing) costs as incurred. These expenses are outbound marketing expenses associated with participation in industry events, related sales collateral and email campaigns aimed at generating customer participation in webinars. There were no advertising expenses for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\niSign Solutions Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(In thousands except per share amounts)\n1. Nature of Business, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued):\nNet loss per share:\nThe Company calculates net loss per share under the provisions of the relevant accounting guidance. That guidance requires the disclosure of both basic net loss per share, which is based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding, and diluted loss per share, which is based on the weighted average number of shares and dilutive potential shares outstanding.\nThe number of shares of Common Stock subject to outstanding options and shares issuable upon exercise of warrants excluded from the calculation of loss per share as their inclusion would be anti-dilutive are as follows:\nDecember 31,\nDecember 31,\nCommon Stock subject to outstanding options 1,338 1,077\nCommon Stock subject to outstanding warrants 3,001 2,536\nCommon stock subject to outstanding convertible debt plus accrued interest 6,761 5,439\nForeign currency assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars at the end-of-period exchange rates except for long-term assets and liabilities, which are translated at historical exchange rates. Revenue and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates in effect during each period except for those expenses related to consolidated balance sheet amounts which are translated at historical exchange rates.\nNet foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in interest and other income, net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses in 2020 and 2019 were insignificant.\nIncome taxes:\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial statement reported amounts and for tax loss and credit carry-forwards. A valuation allowance is provided against deferred tax assets when it is determined to be more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized.\nForeign currency translation:\nThere have been no unrecognized tax benefits and, accordingly, there has been no effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition or results of operations.\nThe Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions. The Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal tax examinations for years before 2011, and state tax examinations for years before 2010.\nThe Company\u2019s policy is to recognize interest and penalties accrued on any unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.\niSign Solutions Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(In thousands except per share amounts)\n1.
