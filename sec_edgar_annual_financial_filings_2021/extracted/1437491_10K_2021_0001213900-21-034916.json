    "item_1": "Item 1 Business\nGeneral Corporate History\nEcoark Holdings, Inc. was incorporated in the State of Nevada on November 19, 2007 under the name Magnolia Solar Corporation (\u201cMagnolia Solar\u201d). On March 18, 2016, Magnolia Solar filed a Certificate of Amendment to its Articles of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of Nevada thereby changing its name to Ecoark Holdings, Inc.\nOverview\nEcoark Holdings Inc. (\u201cEcoark Holdings\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) is a diversified holding company. Through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, the Company has operations in three areas: (i) oil and gas, including exploration, production and drilling operations and transportation services, (ii) post-harvest shelf-life and freshness food management technology, and (iii) financial services including consulting, fund administration and asset management. The Company\u2019s subsidiaries consist of Banner Midstream Corp., (\u201cBanner Midstream\u201d), White River Holdings Corp. (\u201cWhite River\u201d), Shamrock Upstream Energy LLC (\u201cShamrock\u201d), Pinnacle Frac Transport LLC (\u201cPinnacle Frac\u201d), Capstone Equipment Leasing LLC (\u201cCapstone\u201d), Ecoark, Inc. (\u201cEcoark\u201d), Zest Labs, Inc. (\u201cZest Labs\u201d), and Trend Discovery Holdings Inc. (\u201cTrend Holdings\u201d).\nWhite River and Shamrock are engaged in oil and gas exploration, production, and drilling operations on over 20,000 cumulative acres of active mineral leases in Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi.\nPinnacle Frac provides transportation of frac sand and logistics services to major hydraulic fracturing and drilling operations. Capstone procures and finances equipment to oilfield transportation service contractors.\nSince the acquisition of Banner Midstream on March 27, 2020, which currently comprises the exploration, production and drilling operations, the Company has focused its efforts to a considerable extent on expanding its exploration and production footprint and capabilities by acquiring real property and working interests in oil and gas mineral leases.\nOn June 11, 2020, the Company acquired certain energy assets from SR Acquisition I, LLC for $1,000 as part of the ongoing bankruptcy reorganization of Sanchez Energy Corporation. The transaction includes the transfer of 262 total wells in Mississippi and Louisiana, approximately 9,000 acres of active mineral leases, and drilling production materials and equipment. The 262 total wells include 57 active producing wells, 19 active disposal wells, 136 shut-in with future utility wells, and 50 shut-in pending plugging wells. Included in the assignment are 4 wells in the Tuscaloosa Marine Shale formation.\nOn June 18, 2020, the Company acquired certain energy assets from SN TMS, LLC for $500 as part of the ongoing bankruptcy reorganization of Sanchez Energy Corporation. The transaction includes the transfer of wells, active mineral leases, and drilling production materials and equipment.\nOn August 14, 2020, the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the \u201cAsset Purchase Agreement\u201d) by and among the Company, White River E&P LLC, a Texas Limited Liability Company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company Rabb Resources, LTD. and Claude Rabb, the sole owner of Rabb Resources, LTD. Pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement, the Company completed the acquisition of certain assets of Rabb Resources, LTD. The acquired assets consisted of certain real property and working interests in oil and gas mineral leases. The Company in June 2020 previously provided for bridge financing to Rabb Resources, LTD under the $225,000 Senior Secured Convertible Promissory Note. As consideration for entering into the Asset Purchase Agreement, the Company agreed to pay Rabb Resources, LTD. A total of $3,500,000 consisting of (i) $1,500,000 in cash, net of $304 in outstanding amounts related to the note receivable and accrued interest receivable, and (ii) $2,000,000 payable in common stock of the Company, which based on the closing price of the common stock as of the date of the Asset Purchase Agreement equaled 103,000 shares. The Company accounted for this acquisition as an asset acquisition under ASC 805 and that the Company has early adopted the amendments of Regulation S-X dated May 21, 2020 and has concluded that this acquisition was not significant. Accordingly, as a result of the amendment, the presentation of the Rabb Resources, LTD historical financial statements under Rule 3-05 and related pro forma information under Article 11 of Regulation S-X, respectively, were not required to be presented.\nOn September 4, 2020, White River SPV 3, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Banner Midstream entered into an Agreement and Assignment of Oil, Gas and Mineral Lease with a privately held limited liability company (the \u201cAssignor\u201d). Under the Lease Assignment, the Assignor assigned a 100% working interest (75% net revenue interest) in a certain oil and gas lease covering in excess of 1,600 acres (the \u201cLease\u201d), and White River paid $1,500,000 in cash to the Assignor. The Company accounted for this acquisition as an asset acquisition under ASC 805 and that the Company has early adopted the amendments of Regulation S-X dated May 21, 2020 and has concluded that this acquisition was not significant. Accordingly, as a result of the amendment, the presentation of the historical financial statements under Rule 3-05 and related pro forma information under Article 11 of Regulation S-X, respectively, were not required to be presented.\nOn October 9, 2020, the Company and White River SPV, entered into a Participation Agreement (the \u201cParticipation Agreement\u201d) by and among the Company, White River SPV, BlackBrush Oil & Gas, L.P. (\u201cBlackBrush\u201d) and GeoTerre, LLC, an unrelated privately-held limited liability company (the \u201cAssignor\u201d), to conduct drilling of wells in the Austin Chalk formation.\nPursuant to the Participation Agreement, the Company and White River SPV have agreed, among other things, to pre-fund a majority of the cost, approximately $5,800,000, associated with the drilling and completion of an initial deep horizontal well in the Austin Chalk formation of which $3,387,000 has been expensed as drilling costs. The Participation Agreement requires the estimated amount of the drilling costs that were paid into a designated escrow account by the commencement of drilling in January 2021. BlackBrush has agreed to assign to the other parties to the Participation Agreement, subject to certain exceptions and limitations specified therein, specified portions of its leasehold working interest in certain Austin Chalk formation units. The Participation Agreement provides for an initial allocation of the working interests and net revenue interests among the assignor, BlackBrush and the Company and then a re-allocation upon payout or payment of drilling and completion costs for each well drilled. Prior to payout, the Company will own 90% of the working interest and 67.5% of the net revenue interest in each well. Following payout, the Company will own 70% of working interest and 52.5% net revenue interest in each well.\nThe Parties to the Participation Agreement, except for the Company, had previously entered into a Joint Operating Agreement, dated September 4, 2020 (the \u201cOperating Agreement\u201d) establishing an area of mutual interest, including the Austin Chalk formation, and governing the parties\u2019 rights and obligations with respect to drilling, completion and operation of wells therein. The Participation Agreement and the Operating Agreement require, among other things, that White River SPV and the Company drill and complete at least one horizontal Austin Chalk well with a certain minimum lateral each calendar year and/or maintain leasehold by paying its proportionate share of any rental payments.\nActive drilling commenced on January 15, 2021 and on January 31, 2021 the drilling reached its targeted location in the Austin Chalk formation. On February 13, 2021, the drilling had reached its first milestone which initiated a contractual vesting of asset assignments with the successful drilling of a minimum lateral distance of 2,500 feet. On February 14, 2021, we reached its second milestone, with the conclusion of drilling of a lateral with a full vertical section distance of 4,046 feet. The well was drilled successfully using managed pressure drilling techniques, allowing for visibility of the productive intervals throughout the drilling process in the Austin Chalk.\nOn September 30, 2020, the Company and White River Energy, LLC (\u201cWhite River Energy\u201d), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company entered into three asset purchase agreements (the \u201cAsset Purchase Agreements\u201d) with privately-held limited liability companies to acquire working interests in the Harry O\u2019Neal oil and gas mineral lease (the \u201cO\u2019Neal OGML\u201d), the related well bore, crude oil inventory and equipment. Immediately prior to the acquisition, White River Energy owned an approximately 61% working interest in the O\u2019Neal OGML oil well and a 100% working interest in any future wells.\nThe purchase prices of these leases were $126,000, $312,000 and $312,000, respectively, totaling $750,000. The consideration paid to the Sellers was in the form of 68,000 shares of the Company\u2019s common stock. The Company accounted for this acquisition as an asset acquisition under ASC 805 and that the Company has early adopted the amendments of Regulation S-X dated May 21, 2020 and has concluded that this acquisition was not significant. Accordingly, as a result of the amendment, the presentation of the historical financial statements under Rule 3-05 and related pro forma information under Article 11 of Regulation S-X, respectively, were not required to be presented.\nIn February and March 2021, the Company acquired additional leases for $916,000 under the Blackbrush/Deshotel lease related to the Participation Agreement.\nReverse Stock Split\nEffective with the opening of trading on December 17, 2020, the Company implemented a one-for-five reverse split of its issued and outstanding common stock and a simultaneous proportionate reduction of its authorized common stock. The reverse stock split was effected without obtaining stockholder approval as permitted by Nevada law, and the authorized common stock was proportionately reduced to 40,000,000 shares. All share and per share figures are reflected on a post-split basis herein.\nRatification of Authorized Capital Increase\nAt the special meeting held on December 29, 2020, the stockholders of the Company ratified the previously approved increase of the number of shares of common stock the Company is authorized to issue from 20,000,000 shares to 40,000,000 shares.\nAuthorized Capital Reduction\nEffective December 29, 2020, the Company amended its articles of incorporation to reduce its authorized common stock from 40,000,000 to 30,000,000.\nRegistered Direct Offering of Common Stock and Warrants\nOn December 31, 2020, the Company completed a registered direct offering, whereby the Company issued 889,000 shares of common stock and 889,000 accompanying warrants to purchase common stock to one institutional investor under the effective Form S-3 at $9.00 per share and accompanying warrant for a total of $8,000,000 in gross proceeds, before placement agent fees and other offering expenses. The warrants are exercisable for a two-year term at a strike price of $10.00 per share. The Company granted 62,000 warrants to the placement agent as compensation in addition to the $560,000 cash commission received by the placement agent. The placement agent warrants are exercisable at $11.25 per share and expire on January 2, 2023.\nOur principal executive offices are located at 303 Pearl Parkway, Suite 200, San Antonio, TX 78215, and our telephone number is (800) 762-7293.

However, it did have a material impact on our management\u2019s ability to operate effectively. The impact included the difficulties of working remotely from home including slow Internet connection, the inability of our accounting and financial officers to collaborate as effectively as they would otherwise have in an office environment and issues arising from mandatory state quarantines.\nWhile it is not possible at this time to estimate with sufficient certainty the continued impact that COVID-19 could have on the Company\u2019s business, future outbreaks and the measures taken by federal, state, local and foreign governments could disrupt the operation of the Company\u2019s business. The COVID-19 outbreak and mitigation measures have also had and may continue to have an adverse impact on global and domestic economic conditions, including the reducing demand for oil, which could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and financial condition, including on its potential to conduct financings on terms acceptable to the Company, if at all. In addition, the Company has taken temporary precautionary measures intended to help minimize the risk of the virus to its employees, including temporarily requiring employees to work remotely, and discouraging employee attendance at in-person work-related meetings, which could negatively affect the Company\u2019s business. The extent to which the COVID-19 outbreak may impact the Company\u2019s results will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information that may emerge concerning the severity of the virus and the actions to contain its impact.\nThe Coronavirus, Aid, Relief and Security Act (\u201cCARES Act\u201d) includes, among other things, provisions relating to payroll tax credits and deferrals, net operating loss carryback periods, alternative minimum tax credits and technical corrections to tax depreciation methods for qualified improvement property. The CARES Act also established a Paycheck Protection Program (\u201cPPP\u201d), whereby certain small business are eligible for a loan to fund payroll expenses, rent and related costs. We have received funding under the PPP, and a majority of that as indicated in our Consolidated Statement of Operations has been forgiven.\nDescription of Business\nBanner Midstream Corp\nThrough its indirect wholly-owned operating subsidiaries Pinnacle Frac, Capstone, White River, and Shamrock, the Company is engaged in oil and gas exploration, production, and drilling operations on over 20,000 cumulative acres of active mineral leases in Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi, as well as transportation of frac sand and logistics services to major hydraulic fracturing and drilling operations, and procurement and financing of equipment to oilfield transportation service contractors.\nThe Company entered the oil and gas industry following the previously disclosed acquisition of Banner Midstream Corp. on March 27, 2020.\nZest Labs\nThrough its wholly-owned subsidiary Zest Labs, the Company offers freshness management solutions for fresh food growers, suppliers, processors, distributors, grocers and restaurants. Its Zest Fresh solution is a cloud-based post-harvest shelf-life and freshness management solution that improves delivered freshness of produce and protein and reduces post-harvest losses at the retailer due to temperature handling and processing by 50% or more by intelligently matching customer freshness requirements with actual product freshness. It focuses on four primary value propositions - operational efficiency, consistent food freshness, reduced waste, and improved food safety. Zest Fresh empowers workers with real-time analytic tools and alerts that improve efficiency while driving quality consistency through best practice adherence at a pallet level. Zest Labs also offers its Zest Delivery solution that provides real-time monitoring and control for prepared food delivery containers, helping delivery and dispatch personnel ensure the quality and safety of delivered food.\nOn June 6, 2019, Zest Labs announced a strategic collaboration between AgroFresh and Zest Labs to strengthen their end-to-end solutions. AgroFresh will incorporate Zest Labs\u2019 Zest Fresh\u2122 solution into its FreshCloud\u2122 Transit Insights platform. The agreement will utilize both companies\u2019 resources and strengths to provide customers with a comprehensive solution that improves operations, increases visibility into produce shelf-life and reduces food waste.\nZest Labs was incorporated in the State of Delaware on September 23, 2004.\nThe Zest Fresh value proposition is to reduce fresh food loss by improving quality consistency. In the U.S. produce market, it is reported that roughly 30% of post-harvest fresh food is lost or wasted and therefore not consumed. Both fresh food producers and retailers bear significant expense when harvested food is either rejected due to early spoilage or reduced in value due to early ripening. Zest Labs believes that a significant portion of this waste can be attributed to inconsistent quality or freshness based on variable post-harvest processing and handling. Fresh food producers and retailers manage food distribution and inventory based on the harvest date, with the assumption that all food harvested on the same day will have the same freshness. However, studies have shown that harvest conditions and post-harvest handling can have a significant effect on the actual remaining freshness and, if not properly accounted for, can result in food loss or spoilage ahead of expectations. Zest Fresh empowers fresh food producers and retailers to significantly reduce the post-harvest loss by providing real-time guidance to process adherence, intelligent distribution and best handling practices, with a goal of providing significant financial savings to fresh food producers and retailers.\nZest Labs has developed the industry\u2019s first freshness metric called the Zest Intelligent Pallet Routing Code (\u201cZIPR Code\u201d). The ZIPR Code has three main components: (i) Harvest Quality which sets total freshness capacity (for example, 12 days for strawberries), (ii) Handling Impact which reflects aging acceleration due to improper handling, and (iii) Future Handling which accurately reflects how the product will be handled (for example, store shelf temperature may be 40 degrees Fahrenheit instead of the ideal 34 degrees Fahrenheit).\nZest Fresh is offered to fresh food producers, processors, distributors, restaurants and grocers with pricing based on the number of pallets managed by Zest Fresh, typically from the field harvest through retail grocery delivery. The Zest Fresh service includes a re-usable wireless Internet of Things (\u201cIoT\u201d) condition sensor that travels with the pallet of fresh food from the field or processor through retail delivery, continuously collecting product condition data. The collected pallet product data is analyzed, using artificial intelligence-based predictive analytics in real time by the Zest Fresh cloud-based solution, with the fresh food producers and retailers accessing data through Zest Fresh web and mobile applications. Zest Fresh provides workers with real-time feedback on the current handling or processing of each pallet, empowering best practice adherence to achieve maximum freshness. Zest Fresh also provides dynamic updates as to actual product freshness for each pallet, enabling intelligent routing and inventory management of each pallet in a manner that ensures optimum delivered freshness. Zest Fresh also includes integrated blockchain support to grower and shipper customers via the Zest Fresh platform.\nZest Labs\u2019 Zest Delivery solution helps to manage prepared food delivery from the restaurant through to the customer. Zest Delivery manages the delivery container environment, both monitoring and controlling the product condition. The value of Zest Delivery is to manage prepared meals in an ideal state for consumption, while accommodating extended pre-staging or delivery times. Extended pre-staging times are associated with \u201cinstant delivery\u201d services of prepared meals, where the meals are often pre-staged in a delivery area ahead of demand. While pre-staging enables fast demand response time, it can result in prepared meals being staged for extended periods, which can potentially impact quality, value and safety. Zest Delivery monitors and controls the delivery container environment to preserve the prepared meal in ideal, ready to consume condition. Zest Delivery also provides the dispatcher with real-time remote visibility to the condition of available meals and confirming quality prior to dispatch. Zest Delivery provides automated, real-time visibility for a very distributed fleet of drivers, reflecting prepared meal food safety, quality and availability. Zest Delivery is offered to meal delivery companies based on the quantity of delivery containers and frequency of use.\nZest Labs currently holds rights to 75 U.S. patents (with additional patents pending), numerous related foreign patents, and U.S. copyrights relating to certain aspects of its Zest software, hardware devices including Radio-Frequency Identification (\u201cRFID\u201d) technology, software, and services. In addition, Zest Labs has registered, and/or has applied to register trademarks and service marks in the U.S. and a number of foreign countries for \u201cIntelleflex,\u201d the Intelleflex logo, \u201cZest,\u201d \u201cZest Data Services,\u201d and the Zest, Zest Fresh and Zest Delivery logos, and numerous other trademarks and service marks. Many of Zest Labs\u2019 products have been designed to include licensed intellectual property obtained from third-parties. Laws and regulations related to wireless communications devices in the jurisdictions in which Zest Labs operates and seeks to operate are extensive and subject to change. Wireless communication devices, such as RFID readers, are subject to certification and regulation by governmental and standardization bodies. These certification processes are extensive and time consuming, and could result in additional testing requirements, product modifications or delays in product shipment dates.\nAlthough most components essential to Zest Labs\u2019 business are generally available from multiple sources, certain key components including, but not limited to, microprocessors, enclosures, certain RFID or other wireless custom integrated circuits, and application-specific integrated circuits are currently obtained by Zest Labs from single or limited sources, principally in Asia.\nZest Labs is part of a very competitive industry that markets solutions to fresh food supply chain users, such as fresh food growers, producers and retailers. Many other companies that are both more established and command much greater resources compete in this market. While Zest Fresh and Zest Delivery offer new technical approaches and new user value, it remains uncertain if Zest Labs will gain sufficient adoption of its products to make them viable in the market. Further, it is unclear what industry competitors are developing that might address similar user needs. Zest Labs\u2019 products provide a new approach for industry participants, and as with any new approach, adoption is uncertain as many in the industry can be slow to embrace new technology and/or new approaches. These market challenges can lead to extended sales cycles that may include extended pilot testing often at Zest Labs\u2019 expense, for which the outcome remains unclear until the completion of each test. For these reasons, and others, forecasting new business adoption and future revenue can be very difficult and volatile; however, the Company believes that Zest Fresh offers fresh food retailers, growers, shippers, processors and distributors an opportunity to differentiate their businesses in ways that the shipment of canned and boxed food products cannot, as competition in the agriculture, grocery, food service and restaurant markets continues to accelerate.\nOur ability to execute our strategy with respect to our freshness management solutions depends in part on the outcome of the litigation related to protection of our intellectual property rights. See \u201cItem 3. Legal Proceedings\u201d for more information.\nTrend Capital Management\nBefore we acquired Trend Holdings in May 2019 by merging Trend Holdings with and into the Company, Trend Holdings was a financial services holding company with two primary subsidiaries: Trend Discovery Capital Management, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (\u201cTrend Capital Management\u201d), and Barrier Crest, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (\u201cBarrier Crest\u201d).\nTrend Capital Management was founded in 2011 and was Trend Holding\u2019s primary asset. Trend Capital Management provides services and collects fees from entities including Trend LP and Trend SPV, both of which invest in securities. Trend Capital Management neither invests in securities nor have any role in Trend LP and Trend SPV\u2019s purchase of securities. The investment capital in Trend LP and Trend SPV is from individual limited partners, and not from the Company.\nIn the near-term, Trend LP\u2019s performance will be driven by its investment in Volans-i, a fully autonomous vertical takeoff and landing drone delivery platform (\u201cVolans\u201d). Trend LP currently owns approximately 1% of Volans and has participation rights to future financings to maintain such ownership at 1% indefinitely. More information can be found at website. www.flyvoly.com, the contents of which are not incorporated into this report.\nBarrier Crest provides fund administration and fund formation services to institutional investors. Barrier Crest provides fund administration services to Trend LP and Trend SPV.\nCompetition\nThe Company faces intense competition with respect to its products and services in all markets in which it operates.\nIn the oil and gas industry, we are producing and selling crude oil as a commodity so we compete against. All producers including individual well owners through the supermajor oil companies. Some of these competitors at the major and supermajor categories possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than we do and our financial resources are relatively limited when contrasted with those of many of these competitors.\nThe market for cloud-based, real-time supply chain analytic solutions-the market in which Zest Labs competes-is highly competitive and is rapidly evolving. There are several new competitors with competing technologies, including companies that have greater resources than Ecoark Holdings, which operate in this space. Some of these companies are subsidiaries of large publicly traded companies that have brand recognition, established relationships with retailers, and own the manufacturing process.\nTrend Holdings and its subsidiaries have significant competition from larger companies with greater assets and resources.\nSales and Marketing\nThrough Banner Midstream and its subsidiaries, the Company sells and provides services to its customers via a blanket master services agreement (MSA). Banner Midstream sells hydrocarbon to midstream providers such as Plains Marketing L.P. and Shell Trading (US) Company.\nThe Company markets its technology products and services principally through direct sales efforts and the utilization of third-party agents. Zest Labs has marketing operations and programs for demand generation, public relations, and branding/messaging that are scaled based on market engagement and available resources.\nTrend Holdings and its subsidiaries provide fund administration and fund formation services to institutional investors and market their services through private marketing.\nGovernment Regulations\nBanner Midstream\nOil and gas production is regulated under a wide range of federal and state statutes, rules, orders and regulations. State and federal statutes and regulations require permits for drilling operations, drilling bonds and reports concerning operations. The states in which we operate, Texas, Louisiana, Oklahoma and New Mexico (the \u201cTerritory\u201d), have regulations governing conservation matters, including provisions for the unitization or pooling of oil and gas properties, the establishment of maximum rates of production from oil and gas wells, the regulation of spacing, and requirements for plugging and abandonment of wells. Also, states in the Territory impose a severance tax on production and sales of oil, and gas within its jurisdiction. Failure to comply with these rules and regulations can result in substantial penalties. Our competitors in the oil and gas industry are subject to the same regulatory requirements and restrictions that affect our operations.\nZest Labs\nLaws and regulations related to wireless communications devices in the jurisdictions in which Zest Labs seeks to operate are extensive and subject to change. Wireless communication devices, such as RFID readers, are subject to certification and regulation by governmental and standardization bodies. These certification processes are extensive and time consuming, and could result in additional testing requirements, product modifications or delays in product shipment dates. The Federal Communications Commission (the \u201cFCC\u201d), is responsible for the assignment of spectrum for non-government use in the United States in accordance with regulations established by an international organization known as the International Telecommunications Union (the \u201cITU\u201d). Any ITU or FCC reallocation of radio frequency spectrum, including frequency band segmentation or sharing of spectrum, could cause interference with the reception of GPS signals and may materially and adversely affect the utility and reliability of Zest Labs\u2019 products, which would, in turn, cause a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nEnvironmental Compliance Expenses\nWe are currently not experiencing any material expenses related to the environmental compliance.

Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations and stock price.\nSummary Risk Factors\nOur business is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that you should consider before investing in our common stock. Set forth below is a summary of the principal risks we face:\n\u25cf we have incurred significant losses since inception, we may continue to incur losses and negative cash flows in the future;\n\u25cf because we require additional capital to fund our business and support our growth, our inability to generate and obtain such capital on acceptable terms, or at all, could harm our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects;\n\u25cf significant ongoing capital requirements related to our exploration and production and transportation business;\n\u25cf the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the U.S. and global economy, and the uncertainty relating to its continuation and the pace of economic recovery;\n\u25cf the uncertainty of future results due to limited operating history;\n\u25cf we may be required to recognize goodwill impairment charges, which could have a material adverse impact on our operating results;\n\u25cf we may be required to record significant non-cash impairment charges related to a reduction in the carrying value of our proved oil and gas properties;\n\u25cf the uncertainty of future results due to limited operating history;\n\u25cf our future cash flows and results of operations, are highly dependent on our ability to efficiently develop our current oil reserves and economically find or acquire additional recoverable reserves;\n\u25cf the dependence of our future operating results on oil and gas prices that are highly volatile;\n\u25cf future changes in the climate change regulatory regime and continued focus on environmental, social and governance (\u201cESG\u201d) regulation and sustainability initiatives, which would have the effect of reducing demand for fossil fuels and negatively impact our operating results, stock price and ability to access capital markets;\n\u25cf potential future changes in the regulation of hydraulic fracturing;\n\u25cf potential inability to retain and attract qualified drivers, including owner-operators;\n\u25cf potential risk that the drivers who we rely upon in our transportation business will be classified as employees rather than independent contractors; and\n\u25cf the uncertainty related to the outcome of the pending Walmart litigation related to the protection of our intellectual property rights.\nRisk Factors Relating to Our Financial Condition\nWe had incurred net losses on an annual basis since our inception and may continue to experience losses and negative cash flow in the future.\nAs of June 22, 2021, we had cash (including restricted cash) of approximately $1,194,235. Prior to the acquisition of Banner Midstream, we funded our operations principally through the sale of our capital stock and debt instruments. On December 31, 2020, we raised approximately $7,666,000 in net proceeds from the sale of 889,000 shares of common stock and short-term warrants to purchase an aggregate of up to 889,000 shares of common stock in a registered direct offering. We have also raised substantial operating cash through the exercise of our warrants issued in capital raises over the past two years. Banner Midstream had financed its operations primarily through the issuance of debt securities. We have not been profitable on an annual basis since inception and had previously incurred significant operating losses. We recorded a net loss of approximately $20,888,000 for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021. Approximately 42% of the reported net loss for this fiscal year was due to non-cash charges, including a $18,518,000 non-cash charge from a change in the fair value of our warrant derivative liabilities and $21,084,000 in gain on exchange of warrants. While our warrant derivative liabilities cause us to incur a non-cash loss if our stock price goes up in a given quarter or a non-cash gain if it goes down in a quarter, we have experienced substantial exercises since the date of our July 28, 2020 prospectus registering the underlying shares of Common Stock. As of March 31, 2021, no warrants remained unexercised out of approximately 1,176,000 warrants (on a post-reverse split basis) we issued in 2020. However, we have an additional approximately 1,035,000 warrants (on a post-reverse split basis) which have derivative liabilities that will impact our future operating results. Although we expect our revenues to increase from our energy business, we will likely continue to incur losses and experience negative cash flows from operations for the foreseeable future. If we cannot achieve positive cash flow from operations or net income, it may make it more difficult to raise capital based on our Common Stock on acceptable terms.\nBecause we require additional capital to fund our business and support our growth, our inability to generate and obtain such capital on acceptable terms, or at all, could harm our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects.\nSince the Banner Midstream acquisition on March 27, 2020, we have increased our operating expenses in supporting our underlying business and consummating acquisitions of oil and gas properties. We intend to continue to make substantial investments to fund our business and support our growth. Among other things, we need to raise capital through the issuance of equity or debt in order to fund the drilling of oil wells for our previously announced joint venture with a Texas exploration company. Since we do not currently have a debt facility to support our growth and acquisition strategy, we are seeking to fund our growth through equity offerings at opportune times when the price of our Common Stock and external factors provide an opportunity. The availability and terms of any future financing will be dependent upon a variety of other factors which may affect the price of our Common Stock including among other things:\n\u25cf The pace of economic recovery following the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u25cf The condition of the capital markets in general and those for smaller capitalization issuers in particular;\n\u25cf The effect of the potential new legislation, regulation or government action which directly affect our business such as environmental, social and governance (\u201cESG\u201d), climate change, oil and gas drilling, fracking, growing market for electric vehicles and efforts to ban fossil fuels, and legislation such as California\u2019s AB5 which causes us to treat our owner-operators in our trucking business as employees, which will tend to increase our expenses;\n\u25cf The impact of ESG measures, potential new rules and recent stockholder votes of large energy producers on the investment community and disclosure practices;\n\u25cf The possibility that certain investors concerned about potential effects of climate change would limit or eliminate their investments in oil and gas companies and the growth of the alternative-energy markets with so-called \u201cgreen\u201d funds trading at record highs;\n\u25cf Potential regulation or government action requiring financial institutions to adopt policies that limit funding of fossil fuels companies; and\n\u25cf International factors including political unrest which may reduce the prices of oil and gas.\nWe may not be able to obtain such additional financing on the terms favorable to us, or at all. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when we require it, our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges could be significantly impaired, and our business may be adversely impacted. In addition, our inability to generate or obtain the financial resources needed may require us to delay, scale back, or eliminate some or all of our operations and sell some of our assets. For example, in May 2021, we assigned certain of our working interests in oil and gas leases in exchange for $600,000 in order to obtain the necessary working capital. If we were forced to delay, scale back, or eliminate some or all of our operations or sell a significant portion of our assets it would have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nFurther, if we raise additional funds through future issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution, and any new equity or debt securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges superior to those of holders of our Common Stock. Any debt financing that we may secure in the future could involve restrictive covenants relating to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has caused and may continue to cause a significant disruption to the United States and global economy, and its continuation for any extended period of time may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and future prospects.\nThe global COVID-19 pandemic and the unprecedented actions taken by U.S. federal, state and local governments and governments around the world in order to stop the spread of the virus have had and continue to have a profound impact on the U.S. and global economy, disrupting global supply chains and creating significant volatility in the financial markets. The contraction of the economy caused by the pandemic has, among other things, severely impacted demand for fossil fuels resulting in sharp decline in oil and gas prices. Oil demand significantly deteriorated as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and corresponding preventative measures taken around the world to mitigate its spread, including \u201cshelter-in-place\u201d orders, quarantines, executive orders and similar government orders and restrictions for their residents to control the spread of COVID-19.\nAlthough oil prices have increased in the past few months due to, among other things, the Biden administration anti-fossil fuel agenda, the vaccine rollouts and the decision by OPEC to restrain output into mid-2021, there can be no assurance that this increase will continue.\nFuture disruptions and/or uncertainties related to the COVID-19 pandemic, including, among others, delays in vaccine rollouts and the emergence of new variants of the virus, for a sustained period of time could have a material adverse impact on our business, our ability to execute our strategy and to realize the full benefits of the Banner Midstream acquisition. Our production and transportation businesses will likely be significantly affected if there is another reduction in oil prices or reduced demand for our services, caused by a global recession due to the ongoing effects of COVID-19.\nFurthermore, the effect of the pandemic on financial markets and on our Company may limit our ability to raise additional capital in the future on the terms acceptable to us at the time we need it, or at all.\nWe will need additional capital to support our operations and growth.\nUntil we achieve sustained profitability, we will need to raise additional capital through public or private financing transactions or secure a debt facility to support our operations and execute our growth strategy. We may not be able to obtain additional financing in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. We could also be required to seek funds through arrangements with collaborative partners or otherwise at an earlier stage than otherwise would be desirable, and we may be required to relinquish rights to some of our current master service agreements or otherwise agree to terms unfavorable to us, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and prospects. Even if we believe that we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans, we may seek additional capital if market conditions are favorable or if we have specific strategic considerations.\nIf we are able to close an equity financing, it may be very dilutive to our existing stockholders. There is no assurance that we will complete any financing or secure a debt facility. If we are unable to obtain funding on a timely basis, we may be unable to expand our operations or otherwise capitalize on our business opportunities, as desired and may be required to significantly curtail, delay or discontinue one or more of the lines of operations and/or sell more assets, which could materially affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe cannot predict our future results because we have a limited operating history.\nWe acquired our oil and gas business on March 27, 2020, which currently accounts for almost all of our revenues. Given our limited operating history, it may be difficult to evaluate our future performance or prospects. You should consider the uncertainties that we may encounter as a company that should still be considered an early stage company. These uncertainties include:\n\u25cf our ability to market our services and products for a profit;\n\u25cf our ability to secure and retain key customers; and\n\u25cf our evolving business model.\nIf we are not able to address successfully some or all of these uncertainties, we may not be able to expand our business, compete effectively or achieve profitability.\nBecause we must periodically evaluate our goodwill for impairment, we could be required to recognize non-cash impairment charges in future periods which could have a material adverse impact on our operating results.\nA considerable portion of our consolidated assets consists of goodwill. The Company recorded approximately $3.2 million of goodwill in connection with the Trend Holdings acquisition in May 2019, and approximately $7.0 million in connection with the Banner Midstream acquisition in March 2020. We assess goodwill for impairment annually during the fourth fiscal quarter and whenever facts or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the Company\u2019s goodwill may be impaired. Impairment analysis involves comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, we record an impairment charge. Determination of fair value requires considerable judgment and is sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions, estimates and market factors. Those assessments may be affected by (i) positive or negative reserve adjustments, (ii) results of drilling activities, (iii) management\u2019s outlook for commodity prices and costs and expenses, (iv) changes in our market capitalization, (v) changes in our weighted average cost of capital and (vi) changes in income taxes. If we are required to recognize noncash charges related to impairment of goodwill, our results of operations would be materially and adversely affected.\nRisk Factors Relating to Our Exploration and Production and Transportation Operations\nWe have significant ongoing capital requirements that could affect our profitability if we are unable to generate sufficient cash from operations or obtain financing on favorable terms.\nThe Company has pre-funded approximately $5,800,000 of the cost, associated with the drilling and completion of an initial deep horizontal well in the Austin Chalk formation of which $3,387,000 has been expensed as drilling costs, and we expect to continue to incur expenses related to our previously announced joint drilling venture. In addition, our transportation business is capital intensive and asset heavy, and our policy of maintaining a young, technology-equipped fleet requires us to expend significant amounts in capital expenditures annually. We expect to pay for projected capital expenditures with cash flows from operations or the proceeds from equity sales. If we were unable to generate sufficient cash from operations, we would need to seek alternative sources of capital, including financing, to meet our capital requirements. In the event that we are unable to generate sufficient cash from operations or obtain financing on favorable terms in the future, we may have to limit our fleet size, enter into less favorable financing arrangements or operate our revenue equipment for longer periods, any of which could have a materially adverse effect on our profitability.\nCompetition in the oil and natural gas industry is intense, making it more difficult for us to market the oil and gas we produce, to acquire interests in new leases, to secure trained personnel and appropriate services, and to raise capital.\nBanner Midstream is a relatively small participant in its industry and we face significant competition from major energy companies with substantial financial, management, technical and other resources as well as large and other privately held businesses which have competitive advantages. Our cost of operations is highly dependent on third-party services, and competition for these services can be significant, especially in times when commodity prices are rising. Similarly, we compete for trained, qualified personnel, and in times of lower prices for the commodities we produce, we and other companies with similar production profiles may not be able to attract and retain this talent. Our ability to acquire and develop reserves in the future will depend on our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment for acquiring properties, marketing oil and gas and securing trained personnel. Also, there is substantial competition for capital available for investment in the oil and gas industry. Our competitors may be able to pay more for personnel, property and services and to attract capital at lower rates. This may become more likely if prices for natural gas increase faster than prices for oil, as oil comprises a greater percentage of our overall production and transportation business. Because of our small size, we may be more affected than larger competitors.\nUnless we replace our existing reserves with new ones and develop those reserves, our reserves and production will decline, which would adversely affect our future cash flows and results of operations.\nProducing oil reservoirs generally are characterized by declining production rates that vary depending upon reservoir characteristics and other factors. Unless we conduct successful ongoing exploration and development activities or continually acquire properties containing proved reserves, our proved reserves will decline as those reserves are produced. Our future reserves and production, and therefore our future cash flow and results of operations, are highly dependent on our success in efficiently developing our current reserves and economically finding or acquiring additional recoverable reserves. We may not be able to develop, find or acquire sufficient additional reserves to replace our current and future production. If we are unable to replace our current and future production, the value of our reserves will decrease, and our business, financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected.\nDrilling for and producing crude oil involves significant risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur drilling and production activities are subject to many risks, including the risk that we will not discover commercially productive reservoirs. Drilling for crude oil can be unprofitable, not only from dry holes, but from productive wells that do not produce sufficient revenues to return a profit. In addition, our drilling and producing operations may be curtailed, delayed or cancelled as a result of other factors, including but not limited to:\n\u25cf unusual or unexpected geological formations and miscalculations;\n\u25cf fires;\n\u25cf explosions and blowouts;\n\u25cf pipe or cement failures;\n\u25cf environmental hazards, such as natural gas leaks, oil spills, pipeline and tank ruptures, encountering naturally occurring radioactive materials, and unauthorized discharges of toxic gases, brine, well stimulation and completion fluids, or other pollutants into the surface and subsurface environment;\n\u25cf loss of drilling fluid circulation;\n\u25cf title problems for the properties on which we drill and resulting restrictions or termination of lease for oil drilling and production operations;\n\u25cf facility or equipment malfunctions;\n\u25cf unexpected operational events, especially the need to drill significantly deeper than originally contemplated or finding, despite an engineering study to the contrary, that the drilling site is a dry hole that produces no appreciable amounts of crude oil or no crude oil;\n\u25cf shortages of skilled personnel or unexpected loss of key drilling and production workers;\n\u25cf shortages or delivery delays of equipment and services or of water used in hydraulic fracturing activities;\n\u25cf compliance with environmental and other regulatory requirements and any unexpected remedial requirements for violations of environmental or other regulatory requirements;\n\u25cf stockholder activism and activities by non-governmental organizations to restrict the exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas so as to minimize emissions of greenhouse gases of \u201cGHG\u2019s\u201d;\n\u25cf natural disasters; and\n\u25cf adverse weather conditions.\nAny of these risks can cause substantial losses, including personal injury or loss of life, severe damage to or destruction of property, natural resources and equipment, pollution, environmental contamination, clean-up responsibilities, loss of wells, repairs to resume operations; and regulatory fines or penalties. Further, our exposure to operational risks may increase as our drilling activity expands.\nWe may not be insured or fully insured against certain of the above operational risks, either due to unavailability of such insurance or the high premiums and deductibles. The occurrence of an event that is not covered in full or in part by insurance could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nLegislation, regulations or government actions related to climate change, greenhouse gas emissions and sustainability initiatives and other ESG laws, regulations and government action, could result in increased compliance and operating costs and reduced demand for fossil fuels, and concern in financial and investment markets over greenhouse gasses and fossil fuel production could adversely affect demand for our products, limit our access to capital and depress the price of our Common Stock.\nSince he took office in January 2021, President Biden has signed a series of executive orders seeking to adopt new regulations to address climate change and to suspend, revise, or rescind certain prior agency actions which were part of the Trump Administration\u2019s de-regulatory push, and the Biden Administration is expected to continue to aggressively seek to regulate the energy industry and seek to eliminate in time the use of fossil fuels. The new executive orders include, among other things, orders requiring a review of current federal lands leasing and permitting practices, as well as a temporary halt of new leasing of federal lands and offshore waters available for oil and gas exploration, directing federal agencies to eliminate subsidies for fossil fuels, and to develop a plan to improve climate-related disclosures.\nIn January 2021, President Biden also issued an executive order calling for methane emissions regulations to be reviewed and for the United States Environmental Protection Agency (the \u201cEPA\u201d) to establish new standards by September 2021. The EPA has adopted regulations under existing provisions of the Clean Air Act that, among other things, establish Prevention of Significant Deterioration (the \u201cPSD\u201d), construction and Title V operating permit reviews for certain large stationary sources. Facilities required to obtain PSD permits for their greenhouse gas emissions also will be required to meet \u201cbest available control technology\u201d standards that will be established on a case-by-case basis. The EPA also has adopted rules requiring the monitoring and reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from specified onshore and offshore natural gas and oil production sources in the United States on an annual basis, which include certain of our operations.\nAlthough Congress from time to time has considered legislation to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, there has not been significant activity in the form of adopted legislation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions at the federal level in recent years. In the absence of such federal climate legislation, a number of states, including states in which we operate, have enacted or passed measures to track and reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, primarily through the planned development of greenhouse gas emission inventories and regional greenhouse gas cap-and-trade programs. Most of these cap-and-trade programs require major sources of emissions or major producers of fuels to acquire and surrender emission allowances, with the number of allowances available for purchase reduced each year until the overall greenhouse gas emission reduction goal is achieved. These reductions may cause the cost of allowances to escalate significantly over time. We will be further subject to our regulatory efforts such as California announced goal of eliminating the sale of vehicles which use gas by 2035. Automobile manufacturers are beginning to announce that they will only manufacture electric vehicles in the future.\nAdditionally, the United States rejoined, effective February 19, 2021, the non-binding international treaty to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions (the \u201cParis Agreement\u201d), adopted by over 190 countries in December 2015. The Paris Agreement entered into force in November 2016 after more than 70 nations, including the United States, ratified or otherwise indicated their intent to be bound by the agreement. The United States had previously withdrawn from the Paris Agreement effective November 4, 2020. Following the United States rejoining the Paris Agreement, President Biden announced in April 2021 the United States\u2019 pledge to achieve an approximately 50% reduction from 2005 levels in \u201ceconomy-wide\u201d net greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. To the extent that the United States implements this agreement or imposes other climate change regulations on the oil and natural gas industry, or that investors insist on compliance regardless of legal requirements, it could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results and future growth. In February 2021, the Acting Chair of the SEC issued a statement directing the Division of Corporation Finance to enhance its focus on climate-related disclosure in public company filings and in March 2021 the SEC announced the creation of a Climate and ESG Task Force in the Division of Enforcement.\nThe adoption and implementation of these and other similar regulations could require us to incur material costs to monitor and report on greenhouse gas emissions or install new equipment to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases associated with our operations. In addition, these regulatory initiatives could drive down demand for our products and services in the oil and gas industry by stimulating demand for alternative forms of energy that do not rely on combustion of fossil fuels that serve as a major source of greenhouse gas emissions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition.\nFederal, state, and local legislative and regulatory initiatives in the United States relating to hydraulic fracturing or fracking could result in decreased demand for our transportation services, which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nAlthough we do not rely on hydraulic fracturing or fracking techniques in our exploration and production operations, our transportation business, which accounted for approximately 79% of our operating revenue in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, depends to a considerable extent on a continued use of such techniques. We expect to continue to derive a substantial portion of our revenue from our transportation operations for the foreseeable future.\nIn the United States, hydraulic fracturing is currently generally exempt from regulation under the Underground Injection Control program established under the federal Safe Drinking Water Act, and is typically regulated by state oil and gas commissions or similar agencies. From time to time, the U.S. Congress has considered adopting legislation intended to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing and to require disclosure of the additives used in the hydraulic-fracturing process. In addition, certain states have adopted, and other states are considering adopting, regulations that could impose new or more stringent permitting, disclosure, disposal and well-construction requirements on hydraulic-fracturing operations. The adoption of any federal, state or local laws or the implementation of regulations regarding hydraulic fracturing could cause a decrease in the completion of new oil and gas wells and an associated decrease in demand for our transportation services, which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur operating results fluctuate due to the effect of seasonality in the oil and gas industry.\nOperating levels of the oil industry have historically been lower in the winter months because of adverse weather conditions. Accordingly, our revenue generally follows a seasonal pattern. Revenue can also be affected by other adverse weather conditions, holidays and the number of business days during a given period because revenue is directly related to the available working days. From time to time, we may also suffer short-term impacts from severe weather and similar events, such as tornadoes, hurricanes, blizzards, ice storms, floods, fires, earthquakes, and explosions that could harm our results of operations or make our results of operations more volatile.\nWe may be subject to various claims and lawsuits in the ordinary course of business, and increases in the amount or severity of these claims and lawsuits could adversely affect us.\nWe are exposed to various claims and litigation related to commercial disputes, personal injury, property damage, environmental liability and other matters. Proceedings include claims by third parties, and certain proceedings have been certified or purport to be class actions. Developments in regulatory, legislative or judicial standards, material changes to litigation trends, or a catastrophic accident or series of accidents, involving any or all of property damage, personal injury, and environmental liability could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.\nThe extension of our active oil and gas mineral leases may be subject to performing continuous drilling operations.\nOur oil and gas mineral leases may contain acreage that is either held by production or not. In order to extend the leased acreage not held by production, the Company must maintain minimum continuous drilling operations in order to extend these leases to future periods. The Company\u2019s inability to perform operations during any given period could result in the Company\u2019s losing the rights to future operations on that lease.\nThe potential lack of availability of, or cost of, drilling rigs, equipment, supplies, personnel and crude oil field services could adversely affect our ability to execute on a timely basis our exploration and development plans within our budget.\nWhen the prices of crude oil increase, or the demand for equipment and services is greater than the supply in certain areas, we could encounter an increase in the cost of securing drilling rigs, equipment and supplies. In addition, larger producers may be more likely to secure access to such equipment by offering more lucrative terms. If we are unable to acquire access to such resources, or can obtain access only at higher prices, our ability to convert our reserves into cash flow could be delayed and the cost of producing those reserves could increase significantly, which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur exploration and production and transportation operations are subject to stringent environmental, oil and gas-related and occupational safety and health laws and regulations, and noncompliance with such laws and regulations could expose us to material costs and liabilities.\nOur exploration and production operations are subject to stringent federal, state and local laws and regulations governing, among other things, the drilling activities, production rates, the size and shape of drilling and spacing units or proration units, the transportation and sale of crude oil, gas, and the discharging of materials into the environment and environmental protection. These laws and regulations may limit the amount of oil and gas we can produce or limit the number of wells or the locations where we can drill.\nFurther, we are required to obtain and maintain numerous environmental and oil and gas-related permits, approvals and certificates from various federal, state and local governmental agencies in connection with our exploration and production operations, and may incur substantial costs in doing so. The need to obtain permits could potentially delay, curtail or cease the development of oil and gas projects. The Company may in the future be charged royalties on gas emissions or required to incur certain capital expenditures for air pollution control equipment or other air emissions-related issues. Additionally, our operations are subject to a number of federal and state laws and regulations, including the federal occupational safety and health and comparable state statutes, aimed at protecting the health and safety of employees.\nWe are also subject to various environmental laws and regulations dealing with the hauling and handling of hazardous materials, air emissions from our vehicles and facilities, and engine idling and discharge. Our transportation operations often involve traveling on unpaved roads located in rural areas, increasing the risk of accidents, and our staging pads often are located in areas where groundwater or other forms of environmental contamination could occur. Our operations involve the risks of environmental damage and hazardous waste disposal, among others. If we are involved in an accident involving hazardous substances, if there are releases of hazardous substances we transport, if soil or groundwater contamination is found at our facilities or results from our operations, or if we are found to be in violation of applicable environmental laws or regulations, we could owe cleanup costs and incur related liabilities, including substantial fines or penalties or civil and criminal liability, any of which could have a materially adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nFailure to comply with these laws and regulations may subject the Company to sanctions, including administrative, civil or criminal penalties, remedial cleanups or corrective actions, delays in permitting or performance of projects, natural resource damages and other liabilities. In addition, these laws and regulations may be amended and additional laws and regulations may be adopted in the future with more stringent legal requirements.\nBecause oil prices are highly volatile, any sustained decline in oil prices could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to meet our capital expenditure obligations and financial commitments.\nOur future revenues from exploration and production operations, profitability, cash flows, future growth and carrying value of our oil and gas properties will depend on oil prices. Commodity prices, including oil, are highly volatile and may fluctuate widely in response to relatively minor changes in supply and demand and market uncertainty. Additional factors which may affect oil prices and which are beyond our control include but are not limited to, the following factors:\n\u25cf worldwide and regional economic conditions impacting the global supply of and demand for oil, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u25cf the price and quantity of foreign imports of oil;\n\u25cf consumer and business demand;\n\u25cf political and economic conditions in or affecting other producing regions or countries, including the Middle East, Africa, South America and Russia;\n\u25cf actions of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, its members and other state-controlled oil companies relating to oil price and production controls;\n\u25cf the level of global exploration, development and production;\n\u25cf the level of global inventories;\n\u25cf prevailing prices on local price indexes in the area in which we operate;\n\u25cf the proximity, capacity, cost and availability of gathering and transportation facilities;\n\u25cf localized and global supply and demand fundamentals and transportation availability;\n\u25cf the cost of exploring for, developing, producing and transporting reserves;\n\u25cf weather conditions and other natural disasters;\n\u25cf technological advances affecting energy consumption;\n\u25cf the price and availability of alternative fuels;\n\u25cf government regulations, such as regulation of natural gas transportation and price controls;\n\u25cf U.S. federal, state and local and non-U.S. governmental regulation and taxes; and\n\u25cf market perceptions of future prices, whether due to the foregoing factors or others.\nWhile lower oil prices are helpful to our transportation business since it reduces our costs, it has an inverse effect on our exploration and production business. Lower commodity prices may reduce our cash flows and borrowing ability. If we are unable to obtain needed capital or financing on satisfactory terms, our ability to develop future reserves could be adversely affected. Also, using lower prices in estimating proved reserves may result in a reduction in proved reserve volumes due to economic limits.\nIf we are required to curtail our drilling program, we may be unable to continue to hold leases that are scheduled to expire, which may further reduce our reserves. As a result, a substantial or extended decline in commodity prices may materially and adversely affect our future business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and ability to finance planned capital expenditures.\nConservation measures and technological advances could reduce demand for oil and natural gas.\nFuel conservation measures, alternative requirements, future legislation and regulation increasing consumer demand for alternatives to oil, and natural gas, technological advances in fuel economy and energy generation devices could reduce demand for oil. The impact of the changing demand for oil may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may be required to record significant non-cash impairment charges related to a reduction in the carrying value of our proved oil and gas properties, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe will perform assessments of our oil and gas properties whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable. In order to perform these assessments, management will use various observable and unobservable inputs, including management\u2019s outlooks for (i) proved reserves and risk-adjusted probable and possible reserves, (ii) commodity prices, (iii) production costs, (iv) capital expenditures and (v) production. Significant or extended price declines could result in the need to adjust the carrying value of our proved oil and gas properties by recording non-cash impairment charges. To the extent such assessments indicate a reduction of the estimated useful life or estimated future cash flows, the carrying value of the oil and gas properties may not be recoverable and therefore we may be required to record an impairment charge reducing the carrying value of the proved properties to their fair value. If oil and natural gas prices decline in the future, we may be required to record impairment charges related to the oil and gas properties acquired as part of the Banner Acquisition, which would materially and adversely affect our results of operations in the period incurred.\nOur future revenue will depend upon the size of the markets which we target and our ability to achieve continuous and sufficient market acceptance.\nEven if we enter all necessary agreements with key customers in the oil industry and purchase enough equipment to satisfy the demand for freight services in the market, our future revenue will depend upon the size of the markets which we target and our ability to achieve continuous and sufficient market acceptance, and such factors as pricing, reimbursement from third-party payors and adequate market share for our services at the target markets.\nWe anticipate that the Banner Midstream expenses will increase substantially if and as they:\n\u25cf continue the research of the market and potential private companies to acquire;\n\u25cf expand the scope of our operations in the Territory;\n\u25cf establish a supply-demand chain and a respective trucking infrastructure to commercialize our market opportunities;\n\u25cf acquire existing businesses and revitalize their operations with the Companies framework;\n\u25cf seek to maintain, protect, and expand the Territory;\n\u25cf seek to attract and retain skilled personnel; and\n\u25cf create additional infrastructure to support our operations as a public company and plan future commercialization efforts.\nWe may not be able to successfully identify acquisition targets and complete strategic acquisitions to execute our growth strategy, and even if we are able to do so, we may not realize the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions.\nAs part of our growth strategy, we intend to pursue opportunities to acquire companies or assets that will enable us to expand our product and service offerings and to increase our geographic footprint. We routinely review potential acquisitions. However, identifying suitable acquisition targets can be difficult, costly and time-consuming, and we may not be able to do so or complete acquisitions in a timely manner, on a cost-effective basis or at all. Even if completed, we may not realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions. Our acquisitions have previously required, and any similar future transactions may also require, significant efforts and expenditures, in particular with respect to integration of acquired assets and business into our legacy operations. We may encounter unexpected difficulties, or incur unexpected costs, in connection with strategic acquisitions and integration efforts, including without limitation:\n\u25cf difficulties in the post-acquisition integration of operations and systems;\n\u25cf the termination of relationships with key personnel and customers of the acquired company;\n\u25cf a failure to add additional employees to manage the increased volume of business;\n\u25cf additional post acquisition challenges and complexities in areas such as tax planning, treasury management, financial reporting and legal compliance;\n\u25cf risks and liabilities from our acquisitions, some of which may not be discovered during the pre-acquisition due diligence process;\n\u25cf a disruption of our ongoing business or an inability of our ongoing business to receive sufficient management attention; and\n\u25cf a failure to realize the cost savings or other financial benefits we anticipated prior to acquisition.\nFailure to successfully identify suitable acquisition targets, complete strategic acquisitions, or realize the anticipated benefits of completed acquisitions, would undermine our ability to execute on our growth strategy, which would in turn have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and future prospects.\nBecause we have limited experience operating our oil and gas exploration and transportation businesses, our failure to effectively manage the risks and challenges inherent in such businesses could adversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition and growth prospects.\nUntil we acquired Banner Midstream on March 27, 2020, we had no experience in operating its oil and gas businesses. Although Jay Puchir, Banner Midstream\u2019s Chief Executive Officer joined us initially as our Chief Accounting Officer and then Treasurer and has continued to run the oil and gas businesses following the Banner Midstream acquisition, and Julia Olguin was appointed as the Chief Executive Officer of White River Holdings Corp (\u201cWhite River\u201d), our indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, we have limited experience operating these businesses, and, as a result, may encounter challenges and risks inherent in operating such businesses. If we fail to effectively manage the risks and challenges inherent in such businesses, our business, operating results, financial condition and growth prospects would be materially and adversely affected.\nOur transportation business is affected by industry-wide economic factors that are largely outside our control.\nWith the exception of minimal revenue from our investment advisory business, our revenue is from customers in the oil exploration and production industry. As such, our volumes are largely dependent on the economy and our results may be more susceptible to trends in unemployment and how it affects oil prices than carriers that do not have this focus. We believe that some of the most significant factors beyond our control that may negatively impact our operating results are economic changes that affect supply and demand in transportation markets.\nThe risks associated with these factors are heightened when the United States economy is weakened. Some of the principal risks during such times are as follows:\n\u25cf low overall demand levels, which may impair our asset utilization;\n\u25cf customers with credit issues and cash flow problems we are not currently aware of;\n\u25cf customers bidding out our services or selecting competitors that offer lower rates, in an attempt to lower their costs, forcing us to lower our rates or lose revenue; and\n\u25cf more unbilled miles incurred to obtain loads.\nEconomic conditions that decrease shipping demand or increase the supply of capacity in the trucking transportation industry on the Territory can exert downward pressure on rates and equipment utilization, thereby decreasing asset productivity. Declining freight levels and rates, a prolonged recession or general economic instability could result in declines in our results of operations, which declines may be material.\nWe also are subject to cost increases outside our control that could materially reduce our profitability if we are unable to increase our rates sufficiently. Such cost increases include, but are not limited to, fuel and energy prices, driver wages, taxes and interest rates, tolls, license and registration fees, insurance premiums, regulations, revenue equipment and related maintenance costs and healthcare and other benefits for our associates. We cannot predict whether, or in what form, any such cost increase or event could occur. Any such cost increase or event could adversely affect our profitability.\nIn addition, events outside our control, such as strikes or other work stoppages at our facilities or at customer, port, border or other shipping locations, weather, actual or threatened armed conflicts or terrorist attacks, efforts to combat terrorism, military action against a foreign state or group located in a foreign state or heightened security requirements could lead to reduced economic demand, reduced availability of credit or temporary closing of shipping locations or United States borders. Such events or enhanced security measures in connection with such events could impair our operations and result in higher operating costs.\nFluctuations in the price or availability of fuel, the volume and terms of diesel fuel purchase commitments and surcharge collection may increase our costs related to our transportation operations, which could materially and adversely affect our margins.\nFuel represents a significant expense for our transportation business while the sale of oil and to a lesser extent natural gas provides revenues for our business. Diesel fuel prices fluctuate greatly due to factors beyond our control, such as political events, terrorist activities, armed conflicts, depreciation of the dollar against other currencies and weather, such as hurricanes, and other natural or man-made disasters, each of which may lead to an increase in the cost of fuel. Fuel prices also are affected by the rising demand in developing countries and could be adversely impacted by diminished drilling activity and by the use of crude oil and oil reserves for other purposes. Such events may lead not only to increases in fuel prices, but also to fuel shortages and disruptions in the fuel supply chain. Because our operations are dependent upon diesel fuel, and a portion of our business is based on fuel purchased on the spot market at prevailing market rates, significant diesel fuel cost increases, shortages or supply disruptions could materially and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nIncreases in fuel costs, to the extent not offset by rate per mile increases or fuel surcharges, have an adverse effect on our operations and profitability. While a portion of our fuel costs are covered by pass-through provisions in customer contracts and compensatory fuel surcharge programs, we also incur fuel costs that cannot be recovered even with respect to customers with which we maintain fuel surcharge programs, such as those associated with unbilled miles, or the time when our engines are idling. Because our fuel surcharge recovery lags behind changes in fuel prices, our fuel surcharge recovery may not capture the increased costs we pay for fuel, especially when prices are rising, leading to fluctuations in our levels of reimbursement. Further, during periods of low freight volumes, shippers can use their negotiating leverage to impose less compensatory fuel surcharge policies. In addition, the terms of each customer\u2019s fuel surcharge agreement vary, and customers may seek to modify the terms of their fuel surcharge agreements to minimize recoverability for fuel price increases. Such fuel surcharges may not be maintained indefinitely or may not be sufficiently effective. As of the date of this prospectus, we had no derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to fuel price fluctuations.\nIf we fail to retain and attract qualified drivers, including owner-operators, it could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nIn our transportation operations, we rely almost exclusively on the fleet of vehicles owned and operated by independent contractors. These independent contractors are responsible for maintaining and operating their own equipment and paying their own fuel, insurance, licenses and other operating costs. Due to high turnover rates, the pool of qualified independent contractor drivers is often limited, which increases competition for their services, especially during times of increased economic activity. We currently face and may in the future continue to face from time- to-time, difficulty in attracting and retaining sufficient number of qualified independent contractor drivers. Additionally, our agreements with independent contractor drivers are terminable by either party without penalty and upon short notice. Our specialty equipment services targeting servicing oil exploration and oil development industries require special training to handle unique operating requirements. We may be legally obligated or otherwise subjected by the industry standards to use physical function tests and hair follicle and urine testing to screen and test all driver applicants, which we believe is a rigorous standard and could decrease the pool of qualified applicants available to us. If we are unable to retain our existing independent contractor drivers or recruit new qualified independent contractor drivers, our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe rates we offer our independent contractor drivers are subject to market conditions. Accordingly, we may be required to increase owner-operator compensation or take other measures to retain existing and attract new qualified independent contractor drivers. If we are unable to continue to attract and retain a sufficient number of independent contractor drivers, we could be required to increase our mileage rates and accessorial pay or operate with fewer trucks and face difficulty meeting our clients\u2019 demands, which would in turn have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results.\nIf owner-operators and their drivers that we rely upon in our transportation business were to be classified as employees instead of independent contractors, our business would be materially and adversely affected.\nA number of companies in the logistics industry have been faced with legislation that requires that many independent contractors be treated as employees and receive benefits only available to employees which increases costs. To date, this legislation has been limited to California and is being considered in states where we do not operate. Some companies recently been involved in lawsuits, including class actions, and state tax and other administrative proceedings that claim that owner-operators or their drivers should be treated as employees, rather than independent contractors. These lawsuits and proceedings involve substantial monetary damages (including claims for unpaid wages, overtime, failure to provide meal and rest periods, unreimbursed business expenses and other items), injunctive relief, or both. While we believe that owner-operators and their drivers are properly classified as independent contractors rather than as employees, if their independent contractor status is challenged, we may not be successful in defending against such challenges in some or all jurisdictions in which we offer transportation services. We also may encounter a risk if the National Labor Relations Board (\u201cNLRB\u201d) were to pass a rule to this effect, which could occur under the Boden administration. Furthermore, the costs associated with defending or resolving lawsuits relating to the independent contractor status of owner-operators and their drivers could be material to our business.\nIf legislation is passed in states where we operate, the NLRB passes a rule, or a court or an administrative agency were to determine that owner-operators and their drivers must be classified as employees rather than independent contractors, we could become subject to additional regulatory requirements, including but not limited to tax, wages, and wage and hour laws and requirements (such as those pertaining to minimum wage and overtime); employee benefits, social security, workers\u2019 compensation and unemployment; discrimination, harassment, and retaliation under civil rights laws; claims under laws pertaining to unionizing, collective bargaining, and other concerted activity; and other laws and regulations applicable to employers and employees. Compliance with such laws and regulations would require us to incur significant additional expenses, potentially including without limitation, expenses associated with the application of wage and hour laws (including minimum wage, overtime, and meal and rest period requirements), employee benefits, social security contributions, taxes, and penalties. Additionally, any such reclassification would require us to change our business model, and consequently have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nSimilar to many companies, we have experienced a spike in our insurance costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nInsurance premiums have recently escalated, and we are facing a similar increase in our insurance costs. Our future insurance and claims expense might exceed historical levels, which could reduce our earnings. We self-insure or maintain a high deductible for a portion of our claims exposure resulting from workers\u2019 compensation, auto liability, general liability, cargo and property damage claims, as well as associate health insurance. Estimating the number and severity of claims, as well as related judgment or settlement amounts is inherently difficult. This, along with legal expenses, incurred but not reported claims and other uncertainties can cause unfavorable differences between actual claim costs and our reserve estimates. We plan to reserve for anticipated losses and expenses and periodically evaluate and adjust our claims reserves to reflect our experience. However, ultimate results may differ from our estimates, which could result in losses over our reserved amounts.\nWe maintain insurance with licensed insurance carriers above the amounts which we retain. Although we believe our aggregate insurance limits should be sufficient to cover reasonably expected claims, the amount of one or more claims could exceed our aggregate coverage limits. If any claim were to exceed our coverage, we would be required to bear the excess, in addition to our other self-insured/retained amounts. As a result, our insurance and claims expense could increase, or we could raise our self-insured retention or deductible when our policies are renewed or replaced. Our operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected if (i) cost per claim, premiums, or the number of claims significantly exceed our estimates, (ii) there is one or more claims in excess of our coverage limits, (iii) our insurance carriers refuse to pay our insurance claims or (iv) we experience a claim for which coverage is not provided.\nRisks Factors Relating to Our Technology Solutions\nOur ability to execute our strategy with respect to our technology segment, depends to a large extent on the outcome of the litigation related to protection of our intellectual property rights.\nAs previously disclosed, in April 2021, a federal jury found in our favor on three claims and awarded us damages in the amount of $115 million in the lawsuit against Walmart Inc. Specifically, the jury found that Walmart misappropriated Zest\u2019s trade secrets, failed to comply with a written contract, and acted willfully and maliciously in misappropriating Zest\u2019s trade secrets. We had filed the complaint against Walmart Inc. in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas, Western Division, in August 2018. The complaint included claims for violation of the Arkansas Trade Secrets Act, violation of the Federal Defend Trade Secrets Act, breach of contract, unfair competition, unjust enrichment, breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, conversion and fraud. On April 27, 2021, we filed with the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas, Central Division a motion for attorneys\u2019 fees in the amount of $46 million or alternatively, $13,537,000, pre-judgment interest in the amount of $16,701,000 and 0.06% post-judgment interest, accruing from April 13, 2021.\nAdditionally, we expect to file an appeal arguing among other things, that we should have an opportunity to prove the full extent of our damages. We expect that Walmart will appeal the jury verdict and any award of attorneys\u2019 fees. Intellectual property and similar litigation is subject to uncertainty. There is no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts related to this lawsuit or if we are, which amounts we will be able to recover.\nIf we are unable to develop and generate additional demand for our technology services or products, we will likely suffer serious harm to our business.\nWe have invested significant resources in developing and marketing our technology services and products. Some of our services and products are often considered complex and involve a new approach to the conduct of business by our customers. As a result, intensive marketing and sales efforts may be necessary to educate prospective customers regarding the uses and benefits of our services and products in order to generate additional demand. The market for our services and products may weaken, competitors may develop superior offerings, or we may fail to develop acceptable solutions to address new market conditions. Any one of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flow and financial condition.\nUndetected errors or failures in our software, products or services could result in loss or delay in the market acceptance for our products or lost sales.\nBecause our software services and products, and the environments in which they operate, are complex, our software and products may contain errors that can be detected at any point in its lifecycle. While we continually test our services and products for errors, errors may be found at any time in the future. Detection of any significant errors may result in, among other things, loss of, or delay in, market acceptance and sales of our services and products, diversion of development resources, injury to our reputation, increased service and warranty costs, license terminations or renegotiations or costly litigation. Additionally, because our services and products support or rely on other systems and applications, any software or hardware errors or defects in these systems or applications may result in errors in the performance of our service or products, and it may be difficult or impossible to determine where the error resides.\nSales to many of our target customers involve long sales and implementation cycles, which may cause revenues and operating results to vary significantly.\nA prospective customer\u2019s decision to purchase our services or products may often involve lengthy evaluation and product qualification processes. Throughout the sales cycle, we anticipate often spending considerable time educating and providing information to prospective customers regarding the use and benefits of our services and products. Budget constraints and the need for multiple approvals within these organizations may also delay the purchase decision. Failure to obtain the timely required approval for a particular project or purchase decision may delay the purchase of our services or products. As a result, we expect that the sales cycle for some of our services and products will typically range to more than 360 days, depending on the availability of funding to the prospective customer. These long cycles may cause delays in any potential sale, and we may spend a large amount of time and resources on prospective customers who decide not to purchase our services or products, which could materially and adversely affect our business.\nAdditionally, some of our services and products are designed for corporate customers, which will require us to recruit a sales force that understands the needs of these customers, engage in extensive negotiations and provide support to complete sales. If we do not successfully market our services and products to these targeted customers, our operating results will be below our expectations and the expectations of investors and market analysts, which would likely cause the price of our Common Stock to decline.\nPatents, trademarks, copyrights and licenses are important to our technology business, and the inability to defend, obtain or renew such intellectual property could adversely affect the Company\u2019s operating results.\nThrough Zest Labs, the Company currently holds rights to patents and copyrights relating to certain aspects of its RFID technology, software, and services. In addition, the Company has registered, and/or has applied to register trademarks and service marks in the U.S. and a number of foreign countries for \u201cIntelleflex,\u201d the Intelleflex logo, \u201cZest,\u201d \u201cZest Data Services\u201d, the Zest logo, and numerous other trademarks and service marks. Although the Company believes the ownership of such patents, copyrights, trademarks and service marks is an important factor in its business and that its success does depend in part on the ownership thereof, the Company relies primarily on the innovative skills, technical competence, and marketing abilities of its personnel.\nMany of Zest Labs\u2019 products are designed to include intellectual property obtained from third parties. While it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of its products and business methods, the Company believes, based upon past experience and industry practice, such licenses generally could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms; however, there is no guarantee that such licenses could be obtained at all. Loss of a significant number of licenses may have an adverse effect of the Company\u2019s operations.\nThe Company relies on licenses to third-party patents and intellectual property, and the Company\u2019s future results could be materially adversely affected if it is alleged or found to have infringed intellectual property rights.\nMany of Zest Labs\u2019 products are designed to use third-party intellectual property, and it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of its products and business methods. Although the Company believes that, based on past experience and industry practice, such licenses generally could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms, there is no assurance that the necessary licenses would be available on acceptable terms or at all.\nIf we fail to protect our proprietary information and prevent third parties from making unauthorized use of our products and technology, our financial results could be harmed.\nMuch of our software and underlying technology is proprietary. We seek to protect our proprietary rights through a combination of confidentiality agreements and through copyright, patent, trademark, and trade secret laws. However, all of these measures afford only limited protection and may be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented by third parties. Any patent licensed by us or issued to us could be challenged, invalidated or circumvented or rights granted thereunder may not provide a competitive advantage to us. Furthermore, patent applications that we file may not result in issuance of a patent or, if a patent is issued, the patent may not be issued in a form that is advantageous to us. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights, others may independently develop similar products, duplicate our products or design around our patents and other rights. In addition, it is difficult to monitor compliance with, and enforce, our intellectual property in a cost-effective manner.\nThird parties claiming that we infringe on their proprietary rights could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and prevent us from selling our products and services.\nFrom time to time, third parties may claim that we have infringed on their intellectual property rights, including claims regarding patents, copyrights, and trademarks. Because of constant technological change in the markets in which we compete, the extensive patent coverage of existing technologies, and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, it is possible that the number of these claims may grow. In addition, former employers of our former, current, or future employees may assert claims that such employees have improperly disclosed to us the confidential or proprietary information of these former employers. Any such claim, with or without merit, could result in costly litigation and distract management from day-to-day operations. If we are not successful in defending such claims, we could be required to stop selling, delay shipments of, or redesign our products, pay significant amounts as monetary damages, enter into royalty or licensing arrangements, or satisfy indemnification obligations that we have with some of our customers. Royalty or licensing arrangements that we may seek in such circumstances may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all. We may incur significant expenditures to investigate, defend and settle claims related to the use of technology and intellectual property rights as part of our strategy to manage this risk.\nWe rely on third-party manufacturers for the final assembly of certain of our product related to our technology offerings. If these third-party manufacturers were to become unavailable, we may not be able to replace them on economical terms or at all, and our business would be harmed.\nA failure by such manufacturers to provide manufacturing services to us, or any disruption in such manufacturing services, may adversely affect our business. We may incur increased business disruption risk due to the dependence on these third-party manufacturers, as we are not able to exercise direct control over the assembly or related operations of certain of our products. If these third-party manufacturers experience financial difficulties or fail to meet our manufacturing needs, then we may be unable to satisfy customer product demands, lose sales, and be unable to maintain customer relationships. Longer production lead times may result in shortages of certain products and inadequate inventories during periods of unanticipated higher demand. Without such third parties continuing to manufacture our products, we may have no other means of final assembly of certain of our products until we are able to secure the manufacturing capability at another facility or develop an alternative manufacturing facility. This transition could be costly and time consuming.\nThe Company is subject to risks associated with laws, regulations and industry-imposed standards related to wireless communications devices.\nLaws and regulations related to wireless communications devices in the many jurisdictions in which Zest Labs operates and seeks to operate are extensive and subject to change. Such changes, which could include but are not limited to restrictions on production, manufacture, distribution, and use of the device, may have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results.\nWireless communication devices, such as RFID readers, are subject to certification and regulation by governmental and standardization bodies. These certification processes are extensive and time consuming, and could result in additional testing requirements, product modifications or delays in product shipment dates, which may have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results.\nBecause of technological changes in the business software, web and device applications, sensors and sensor-based devices, and RFID and wireless communication industries, current extensive patent coverage, and the rapid issuance of new patents, it is possible that certain components of Zest Labs\u2019 products and business methods may unknowingly infringe the patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties. From time to time, Zest Labs may be notified that it may be infringing such rights. Responding to such claims, regardless of their merit, can consume significant time and expense. In certain cases, the Company may consider the desirability of entering into licensing agreements, although no assurance can be given that such licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur. If there is a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting the Company from marketing or selling certain products or a successful claim of infringement against the Company requires it to pay royalties to a third party, the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected.\nThe inability to obtain certain components could adversely impact the Company\u2019s ability to deliver on its contractual commitments which could negatively impact our results of operations and cash flows.\nAlthough most components essential to the Company\u2019s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain key components including, but not limited to, microprocessors, enclosures, certain RFID custom integrated circuits, and application-specific integrated circuits are currently obtained by the Company from single or limited sources. Some key components, while currently available to the Company from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide availability constraints and pricing pressures. If the supply of a key or single-sourced component to the Company were to be delayed or curtailed or in the event a key manufacturing vendor delayed shipment of completed products to the Company, the Company\u2019s ability to ship related products in desired quantities, and in a timely manner, could be adversely affected. The Company\u2019s business and financial performance could also be adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source. Continued availability of these components may be affected if suppliers were to decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company\u2019s requirements. The Company attempts to mitigate these potential risks by working closely with these and other key suppliers on product introduction plans, strategic inventories, coordinated product introductions, and internal and external manufacturing schedules and levels. Consistent with industry practice, the Company acquires components through a combination of formal purchase orders, supplier contracts, and open orders based on projected demand information. However, adverse changes in the supply chain of the Company\u2019s vendors may adversely impact the supply of key components.\nGeneral Risks\nOur future success depends on our ability to retain and attract high-quality personnel, and the efforts, abilities and continued service of our senior management.\nOur future success depends on our ability to attract, hire, train and retain a number of highly skilled employees and on the service and performance of our senior management team and other key personnel, including service center managers. The loss of the services of our executive officers or other key employees and inadequate succession planning could cause substantial disruption to our business operations, deplete our institutional knowledge base and erode our competitive advantage, which would adversely affect our business. Competition for qualified personnel possessing the skills necessary to implement our strategy is intense, and we may fail to attract or retain the employees necessary to execute our business model successfully. We do not have \u201ckey person\u201d life insurance policies covering any of our executive officers, other than Peter Mehring, the president of Zest Labs.\nOur success will depend to a significant degree upon the continued efforts of our key management, engineering and other personnel, many of whom would be difficult to replace. In particular, we believe that our future success is highly dependent on Randy May, our Chief Executive Officer, William Hoagland, our Chief Financial Officer, Jay Puchir, our Treasurer and CEO and President of Banner Midstream Corp., Peter Mehring, President of Zest Labs, and Julia Olguin, the Chief Executive Officer of White River. If any members of our management team leave our employment, our business could suffer, and the share price of our Common Stock could decline.\nIf we cannot manage our growth effectively, our results of operations would be materially and adversely affected.\nWe have recently experienced significant growth commencing with and following the Banner Acquisition. Our business model relies on our rapidly growing our oil and gas drilling and transportation businesses. Businesses that grow rapidly often have difficulty managing their growth while maintaining their compliance and quality standards. If we continue to grow as rapidly as we anticipate, we will need to expand our management by recruiting and employing additional executive and key personnel capable of providing the necessary support. There can be no assurance that our management, along with our staff, will be able to effectively manage our growth. Our failure to meet the challenges associated with rapid growth could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting, our ability to produce timely and accurate financial statements or comply with applicable regulations could be impaired.\nWe are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d) and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act which requires, among other things, that public companies maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting.\nAlthough our management concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of March 31, 2021, any failure to maintain effective controls or any difficulties encountered in their implementation or improvement in the future could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations and may result in a restatement of our financial statements for prior periods. If we fail to maintain an effective system of disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting, our ability to produce timely and accurate financial statements or comply with applicable regulations could be impaired, which could result in loss of investor confidence and could have an adverse effect on our stock price.\nFailure of information technology systems or data security breaches, including as the result of cyber security attacks, affecting us, our business associates, or our industry, may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nWe depend on information technology systems and services in conducting our business. We and others in the industries in which we operate use these technologies for internal purposes, including data storage and processing, transmissions, as well as in our interactions with our business associates. Examples of these digital technologies include analytics, automation, and cloud services. If any of our financial, operational, or other data processing systems are compromised, fail or have other significant shortcomings, it could disrupt our business, require us to incur substantial additional expenses, result in potential liability or reputational damage or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results.\nFor example, the operator of the Colonial Pipeline was forced to pay $4.4 million in ransom to hackers as the result of a cyberattack disabling the pipeline for several days in May 2021. The attack also resulted in gasoline price increases and shortages across the East Coast of the United States. As we depend on the availability and price of gasoline in our transportation business, any significant increase in the price and/or shortage of gasoline would have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nBecause our Common Stock trades on the OTCQB, we are subject to the unwillingness of most institutional investors to purchase our Common Stock as well as the general limited liquidity of that trading market.\nOur Common Stock is currently traded on the OTCQB, which is not a national securities exchange. Most institutional investors will only purchase securities which trade on one of the markets operated by the Nasdaq Stock Market or the New York Stock Exchange. As a result, the OTCQB is generally less liquid than the leading stock exchanges. While the market for our Common Stock has been relatively active, we believe our failure to be listed on a leading national securities exchange has reduced our liquidity. We cannot assure you that our recent liquidity will be maintained or that investors will not encounter difficulties in selling their Common Stock in the future at present levels or if the absence of sufficient liquidity will harm our stockholders in the future.\nFuture sales of our Common Stock in the public market could lower the price of our Common Stock and impair our ability to raise funds in future securities offerings.\nOf 22,820,573 shares of Common Stock outstanding as of June 15, 2021, approximately 17,832,456 shares are held by investors who are not our affiliates or holders of restricted stock. All of these shares of unrestricted stock are freely tradeable. The remaining shares may be sold subject to the volume limits of Rule 144 which limits sales by any affiliate to 1% of outstanding shares in any three-month period. Future sales of a substantial number of shares of our Common Stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales may occur, could adversely affect the then prevailing market price of our Common Stock and could make it more difficult for us to raise funds in the future through an offering of our securities.\nThe price of our Common Stock is subject to volatility, including for reasons unrelated to our operating performance, which could lead to losses by investors and costly securities litigation.\nThe trading price of our Common Stock is likely to be highly volatile and could fluctuate in response to a number of factors, some of which may be outside our control, including but not limited to, the following factors:\n\u25cf any announcements relating to our pending Walmart litigation;\n\u25cf actual or anticipated variations in our operating results;\n\u25cf Developments relating to the Walmart litigation;\n\u25cf changes in market valuations of companies in the oil and gas industry;\n\u25cf announcements of developments by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf future oil prices;\n\u25cf announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, capital commitments, significant contracts, or other material developments that may affect our prospects;\n\u25cf the continuation of the COVID-19 pandemic and shutdowns in the Territory;\n\u25cf adoption of new accounting standards affecting our industry;\n\u25cf additions or departures of key personnel;\n\u25cf sales of our Common Stock or other securities in the open market; and\n\u25cf other events or factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nThe stock market is subject to significant price and volume fluctuations. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been initiated against such a company. Litigation initiated against us, whether or not successful, could result in substantial costs and diversion of our management\u2019s attention and Company resources, which could harm our business and financial condition.\nFuture changes in the fair value of outstanding warrants could result in volatility of our reported results of operations.\nBecause of the derivative liability caused by our outstanding warrants, the increase or decrease in our Common Stock price each quarter (measured from the first day to the last day) is either a non-cash expense or income. If the price rises as it did in the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2021, we are required to report the expense, which increases our actual operating loss. Contrarily a price decrease in a given quarter will cause us to report income. This could cause our reporting results to fluctuate otherwise as the result of our performance, which would increase volatility in our stock price.\nWe have recently experienced fluctuations in the market price of our Common Stock and if it again becomes subject to the \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules, brokers will not generally solicit the purchase of our Common Stock, which would adversely affect the liquidity and market price of our Common Stock.\nWe have recently experienced wide fluctuations in the price of our Common Stock. For example, our stock price decreased from approximately $12.00 per share in early April 2021 to approximately $3.25 in mid-May 2021, resulting in our Common Stock to be considered a \u201cpenny stock\u201d under SEC rules. The SEC has adopted regulations which generally define \u201cpenny stock\u201d as an equity security that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to specific exemptions. Such exceptions include among others any equity security listed on a national securities exchange and any equity security issued by an issuer that has (i) net tangible assets of at least $2,000,000, if such issuer has been in continuous operation for three years, net tangible assets of at least $5,000,000, if such issuer has been in continuous operation for less than three years, or (iii) average annual revenue of at least $6,000,000 for the last three years. Although the market price of our Common Stock on OTCQB was $6.25 per share as of June 28, 2021, there is no assurance that our stock price will rise or stay above $5.00 per share. The \u201cpenny stock\u201d designation requires any broker-dealer selling these securities to disclose certain information concerning the transaction, obtain a written agreement from the purchaser and determine that the purchaser is reasonably suitable to purchase the securities. These rules limit the ability of broker-dealers to solicit purchases of our Common Stock and therefore reduce its liquidity.\nMoreover, as a result of apparent regulatory pressure from the SEC and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, a growing number of broker-dealers decline to permit investors, or otherwise make it difficult, to purchase and sell \u201cpenny stocks.\u201d The \u201cpenny stock\u201d designation may have a depressive effect upon our Common Stock price.\nBecause we can issue \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock without stockholder approval, it could adversely impact the rights of holders of our Common Stock.\nUnder our Articles of Incorporation our Board of Directors may approve an issuance of up to 5,000,000 shares of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock without seeking stockholder approval. Any additional shares of preferred stock that we issue in the future may rank ahead of our Common Stock in terms of dividend or liquidation rights and may have greater voting rights than our Common Stock. In addition, such preferred stock may contain provisions allowing those shares to be converted into shares of Common Stock, which could dilute the value of Common Stock to current stockholders and could adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock. In addition, the preferred stock could be utilized, under certain circumstances, as a method of discouraging, delaying or preventing a change in control of our Company. Although we have no present intention to issue any additional shares of authorized preferred stock, there can be no assurance that we will not do so in the future.\nThe approval of the application to list our Common Stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market was significantly delayed due to factors outside our control; because our stock price is below the required minimum bid price of $4, our listing application may not be approved in the near future or at all, which would have a material adverse effect on our stock price and liquidity.\nLast year we applied to list our Common Stock on The Nasdaq Capital Market (\u201cNasdaq\u201d). In December 2020 we effected a one-for-five reverse split of the Company\u2019s issued and outstanding Common Stock and conducted a registered offering of Common Stock and warrants, in each case to meet the Nasdaq quantitative initial listing requirements. Following the reverse split and the December 2020 capital raise we believe we continued to meet the Nasdaq initial listing standards until a decrease in our stock price mid-April 2021. As of the date of this Form 10-K our listing application remained pending.\nAt the time we effected the reverse stock split, we did not know that the approval of our listing application was being delayed by Nasdaq pending an inquiry by FINRA involving potential manipulation of our Common Stock. Since we never engaged in any investor relations activities, we always assumed any alleged manipulation did not involve Ecoark or its management. Nasdaq recently advised us that the FINRA inquiry will no longer prevent it from approving our listing application once we satisfy the $4 minimum bid price requirement.\nEven if we meet the $4 bid price requirement, there is no assurance that our listing application will be approved in the near future or at all. We have no intention at this time to effect another reverse stock split. If our listing application is not approved, our Common Stock will continue to trade on the OTCQB, which would affect the liquidity and price of our Common Stock.",

Through Ecoark Holdings wholly owned subsidiaries, the Company has operations in three areas: (i) oil and gas, including exploration, production and drilling operations on over 20,000 cumulative acres of active mineral leases in Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi and transportation services, (ii) post-harvest shelf-life and freshness food management technology, and (iii) financial services including investing in a select number of early stage startups. The Company\u2019s subsidiaries include Banner Midstream, White River, Shamrock, Pinnacle Frac, Capstone, Zest Labs and Trend Holdings.\nThrough Pinnacle Frac the Company provides transportation of frac sand and logistics services to major hydraulic fracturing and drilling operations. Capstone procures and finances equipment to oilfield transportation service contractors. These two operating subsidiaries of Banner Midstream are revenue producing entities.\nThrough White River and Shamrock, we are engaged in oil and gas exploration, production, and drilling operations on over 20,000 cumulative acres of active mineral leases in Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi.\nWhile the Company\u2019s consolidated financial information for the fiscal ended March 31, 2021 reflects the operating results of Banner Midstream which currently comprises the Company\u2019s exploration and production and transportation business, Banner Midstream\u2019s operating results are not included in the Company\u2019s consolidated financial information for the fiscal ended March 31, 2020. The operating results of Trend Holdings are included in the Company\u2019s consolidated financial information beginning May 31, 2019.\nFiscal Year 2021 Highlights\nDuring the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, the Company focused its efforts to a considerable extent on expanding its exploration and production footprint and capabilities by acquiring real property and working interests in oil and gas mineral leases.\nOn June 11, 2020, the Company acquired certain energy assets from SR Acquisition I, LLC for $1 as part of the ongoing bankruptcy reorganization of Sanchez Energy Corporation. The transaction includes the transfer of 262 total wells in Mississippi and Louisiana, approximately 9,000 acres of active mineral leases, and drilling production materials and equipment. The 262 total wells include 57 active producing wells, 19 active disposal wells, 136 shut-in with future utility wells, and 50 shut-in pending plugging wells. Included in the assignment are 4 wells in the Tuscaloosa Marine Shale formation.\nOn June 18, 2020, the Company acquired certain energy assets from SN TMS, LLC for $1 as part of the ongoing bankruptcy reorganization of Sanchez Energy Corporation. The transaction includes the transfer of wells, active mineral leases, and drilling production materials and equipment.\nOn August 14, 2020, the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the \u201cAsset Purchase Agreement\u201d) by and among the Company, White River E&P LLC, a Texas Limited Liability Company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company Rabb Resources, LTD. and Claude Rabb, the sole owner of Rabb Resources, LTD. Pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement, the Company completed the acquisition of certain assets of Rabb Resources, LTD. The acquired assets consisted of certain real property and working interests in oil and gas mineral leases. The Company in June 2020 previously provided for bridge financing to Rabb Resources, LTD under the $225 Senior Secured Convertible Promissory Note. As consideration for entering into the Asset Purchase Agreement, the Company agreed to pay Rabb Resources, LTD. A total of $3,500 consisting of (i) $1,500 in cash, net of $304 in outstanding amounts related to the note receivable and accrued interest receivable, and (ii) $2,000 payable in common stock of the Company, which based on the closing price of the common stock as of the date of the Asset Purchase Agreement equaled 103 shares. The Company accounted for this acquisition as an asset acquisition under ASC 805 and that the Company has early adopted the amendments of Regulation S-X dated May 21, 2020 and has concluded that this acquisition was not significant. Accordingly, as a result of the amendment, the presentation of the Rabb Resources, LTD historical financial statements under Rule 3-05 and related pro forma information under Article 11 of Regulation S-X, respectively, were not required to be presented.\nOn September 4, 2020, White River SPV 3, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Banner Midstream entered into an Agreement and Assignment of Oil, Gas and Mineral Lease with a privately held limited liability company (the \u201cAssignor\u201d). Under the Lease Assignment, the Assignor assigned a 100% working interest (75% net revenue interest) in a certain oil and gas lease covering in excess of 1,600 acres (the \u201cLease\u201d), and White River paid $1,500 in cash to the Assignor. The Company accounted for this acquisition as an asset acquisition under ASC 805 and that the Company has early adopted the amendments of Regulation S-X dated May 21, 2020 and has concluded that this acquisition was not significant. Accordingly, as a result of the amendment, the presentation of the historical financial statements under Rule 3-05 and related pro forma information under Article 11 of Regulation S-X, respectively, were not required to be presented.\nOn October 9, 2020, the Company and White River SPV, entered into a Participation Agreement (the \u201cParticipation Agreement\u201d) by and among the Company, White River SPV, BlackBrush Oil & Gas, L.P. (\u201cBlackBrush\u201d) and GeoTerre, LLC, an unrelated privately-held limited liability company (the \u201cAssignor\u201d), to conduct drilling of wells in the Austin Chalk formation.\nPursuant to the Participation Agreement, the Company and White River SPV have agreed, among other things, to pre-fund a majority of the cost, approximately $5,800, associated with the drilling and completion of an initial deep horizontal well in the Austin Chalk formation of which $3,387 has been expensed as drilling costs. The Participation Agreement requires the estimated amount of the drilling costs that were paid into a designated escrow account by the commencement of drilling in January 2021. BlackBrush has agreed to assign to the other parties to the Participation Agreement, subject to certain exceptions and limitations specified therein, specified portions of its leasehold working interest in certain Austin Chalk formation units. The Participation Agreement provides for an initial allocation of the working interests and net revenue interests among the assignor, BlackBrush and the Company and then a re-allocation upon payout or payment of drilling and completion costs for each well drilled. Prior to payout, the Company will own 90% of the working interest and 67.5% of the net revenue interest in each well. Following payout, the Company will own 70% of working interest and 52.5% net revenue interest in each well.\nThe Parties to the Participation Agreement, except for the Company, had previously entered into a Joint Operating Agreement, dated September 4, 2020 (the \u201cOperating Agreement\u201d) establishing an area of mutual interest, including the Austin Chalk formation, and governing the parties\u2019 rights and obligations with respect to drilling, completion and operation of wells therein. The Participation Agreement and the Operating Agreement require, among other things, that White River SPV and the Company drill and complete at least one horizontal Austin Chalk well with a certain minimum lateral each calendar year and/or maintain leasehold by paying its proportionate share of any rental payments.\nOn September 30, 2020, the Company and White River Energy, LLC (\u201cWhite River Energy\u201d), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company entered into three asset purchase agreements (the \u201cAsset Purchase Agreements\u201d) with privately-held limited liability companies to acquire working interests in the Harry O\u2019Neal oil and gas mineral lease (the \u201cO\u2019Neal OGML\u201d), the related well bore, crude oil inventory and equipment. Immediately prior to the acquisition, White River Energy owned an approximately 61% working interest in the O\u2019Neal OGML oil well and a 100% working interest in any future wells.\nThe purchase prices of these leases were $126, $312 and $312, respectively, totaling $750. The consideration paid to the Sellers was in the form of 68 shares of common stock. The Company accounted for this acquisition as an asset acquisition under ASC 805 and that the Company has early adopted the amendments of Regulation S-X dated May 21, 2020 and has concluded that this acquisition was not significant. Accordingly, as a result of the amendment, the presentation of the historical financial statements under Rule 3-05 and related pro forma information under Article 11 of Regulation S-X, respectively, were not required to be presented.\nIn February and March 2021, the Company acquired additional leases for $916 under the Blackbrush/Deshotel lease related to the Participation Agreement.\nReverse Stock Split\nEffective with the opening of trading on December 17, 2020, the Company implemented a one-for-five reverse split of its issued and outstanding common stock and a simultaneous proportionate reduction of its authorized common stock. The reverse stock split was effected without obtaining stockholder approval as permitted by Nevada law, and the authorized common stock was proportionately reduced to 40,000 shares. All share and per share figures are reflected on a post-split basis herein.\nRatification of Authorized Capital Increase\nAt the special meeting held on December 29, 2020, the stockholders of the Company ratified the previously approved increase of the number of shares of common stock the Company is authorized to issue from 30,000 shares to 40,000 shares.\nAuthorized Capital Reduction\nEffective December 29, 2020, the Company amended its articles of incorporation to reduce its authorized common stock from 40,000 to 30,000.\nRegistered Direct Offering of Common Stock and Warrants\nOn December 31, 2020, the Company completed a registered direct offering, whereby the Company issued 889 shares of common stock and 889 accompanying warrants to purchase common stock to one institutional investor under the effective Form S-3 at $9.00 per share and accompanying warrant for a total of $8,000 in gross proceeds, before placement agent fees and other offering expenses. The warrants are exercisable for a two-year term at a strike price of $10.00 per share. The Company granted 62 warrants to the placement agent as compensation in addition to the $560 cash commission received by the placement agent. The placement agent warrants are exercisable at $11.25 per share and expire on January 2, 2023.\nOur principal executive offices are located at 303 Pearl Parkway, Suite 200, San Antonio, TX 78215, and our telephone number is (800) 762-7293. Our website address is http://ecoarkusa.com/. Our website and the information contained on, or that can be accessed through, our website is not deemed to be incorporated by reference in and are not considered part of this report.\nImpact of COVID-19\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound effect on the U.S. and global economy and may continue to affect the economy and the industries in which we operate, depending on the vaccine rollouts and the emergence of virus mutations.\nCOVID-19 did not have a material effect on the Consolidated Statements of Operations or the Consolidated Balance Sheets included in this Form 10-K. However, it did have a material impact on our management\u2019s ability to operate effectively. The impact included the difficulties of working remotely from home including slow Internet connection, the inability of our accounting and financial officers to collaborate as effectively as they would otherwise have in an office environment and issues arising from mandatory state quarantines.\nWhile it is not possible at this time to estimate with sufficient certainty the continued impact that COVID-19 could have on the Company\u2019s business, future outbreaks and the measures taken by federal, state, local and foreign governments could disrupt the operation of the Company\u2019s business. The COVID-19 outbreak and mitigation measures have also had and may continue to have an adverse impact on global and domestic economic conditions, including reducing the demand for oil, which could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and financial condition, including on its potential to conduct financings on terms acceptable to the Company, if at all. In addition, the Company has taken temporary precautionary measures intended to help minimize the risk of the virus to its employees, including temporarily requiring employees to work remotely, and discouraging employee attendance at in-person work-related meetings, which could negatively affect the Company\u2019s business. The extent to which the COVID-19 outbreak impacts the Company\u2019s results will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information that may emerge concerning the severity of the virus and the actions to contain its impact.\nThe CARES Act includes, among other things, provisions relating to payroll tax credits and deferrals, net operating loss carryback periods, alternative minimum tax credits and technical corrections to tax depreciation methods for qualified improvement property. The CARES Act also established a Paycheck Protection Program (\u201cPPP\u201d), whereby certain small business are eligible for a loan to fund payroll expenses, rent and related costs. We had received funding under the PPP, and a majority of that as indicated in our Consolidated Statement of Operations has been forgiven.\nCritical Accounting Policies, Estimates and Assumptions\nThe critical accounting policies listed below are those the Company deems most important to their operations.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates include, but are not limited to, management\u2019s estimate of provisions required for uncollectible accounts receivable, fair value of assets held for sale and assets and liabilities acquired, impaired value of equipment and intangible assets, including goodwill, asset retirement obligations, estimates of discount rates in lease, liabilities to accrue, fair value of derivative liabilities associated with warrants, cost incurred in the satisfaction of performance obligations, permanent and temporary differences related to income taxes and determination of the fair value of stock awards.\nActual results could differ from those estimates.\nThe estimates of proved, probable and possible oil and gas reserves are used as significant inputs in determining the depletion of oil and gas properties and the impairment of proved and unproved oil and gas properties. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in the estimation of quantities of proven, probable and possible reserves and in the projection of future rates of production and the timing of development expenditures. Similarly, evaluations for impairment of proved and unproved oil and gas properties are subject to numerous uncertainties including, among others, estimates of future recoverable reserves and commodity price outlooks. Actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions utilized.\nOil and Gas Properties\nThe Company uses the full cost method of accounting for its investment in oil and natural gas properties. Under the full cost method of accounting, all costs associated with acquisition, exploration and development of oil and gas reserves, including directly related overhead costs are capitalized. General and administrative costs related to production and general overhead are expensed as incurred.\nAll capitalized costs of oil and gas properties, including the estimated future costs to develop proved reserves, are amortized on the unit of production method using estimates of proved reserves. Disposition of oil and gas properties are accounted for as a reduction of capitalized costs, with no gain or loss recognized unless such adjustment would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves of oil and gas, in which case the gain or loss is recognized in operations. Unproved properties and development projects are not amortized until proved reserves associated with the projects can be determined or until impairment occurs. If the results of an assessment indicate that the properties are impaired, the amount of the loss from operations before income taxes and the adjusted carrying amount of the unproved properties is amortized on the unit-of-production method.\nLimitation on Capitalized Costs\nUnder the full-cost method of accounting, we are required, at the end of each reporting period, to perform a test to determine the limit on the book value of our oil and gas properties (the \u201cCeiling\u201d test). If the capitalized costs of our oil and natural gas properties, net of accumulated amortization and related deferred income taxes, exceed the Ceiling, the excess or impairment is charged to expense. The expense may not be reversed in future periods, even though higher oil and gas prices may subsequently increase the Ceiling. The Ceiling is defined as the sum of: (a) the present value, discounted at 10% and assuming continuation of existing economic conditions, of (1) estimated future gross revenues from proved reserves, which is computed using oil and gas prices determined as the unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within the 12-month hedging arrangements pursuant to SAB 103, less (2) estimated future expenditures (based on current costs) to be incurred in developing and producing the proved reserves; plus, (b) the cost of properties being amortized; plus, (c) the lower of cost or estimated fair value of unproven properties included in the costs being amortized; net of (d) the related tax effects related to the difference between the book and tax basis of our oil and natural gas properties.\nOil and Gas Reserves\nReserve engineering is a subjective process that is dependent upon the quality of available data and interpretation thereof, including evaluations and extrapolations of well flow rates and reservoir pressure. Estimates by different engineers often vary sometimes significantly. In addition, physical factors such as results of drilling, testing and production subsequent to the date of an estimate, as well as economic factors such as changes in product prices, may justify revision of such estimates. Because proved reserves are required to be estimated using recent prices of the evaluation, estimated reserve quantities can be significantly impacted by changes in product prices.\nInventories\nCrude oil, products and merchandise inventories are carried at the lower of cost (last-in-first-out (LIFO)) or net realizable value. Inventory costs include expenditures and other charges directly and indirectly incurred in bringing the inventory to its existing condition and location.\nAccounting for Asset Retirement Obligation\nAsset retirement obligations (\u201cARO\u201d) primarily represent the estimated present value of the amount the Company will incur to plug, abandon and remediate its producing properties at the projected end of their productive lives, in accordance with applicable federal, state and local laws. The Company determined its ARO by calculating the present value of the estimated cash flows related to the obligation. The retirement obligation is recorded as a liability at its estimated present value as of the obligation\u2019s inception, with an offsetting increase to proved properties or to exploration costs.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company accounts for revenue in accordance with ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers.\nThe Company accounts for a contract when it has been approved and committed to, each party\u2019s rights regarding the goods or services to be transferred have been identified, the payment terms have been identified, the contract has commercial substance, and collectability is probable. Revenue is generally recognized net of allowances for returns and any taxes collected from customers and subsequently remitted to governmental authorities.\nRevenue recognition for multiple-element arrangements requires judgment to determine if multiple elements exist, whether elements can be accounted for as separate units of accounting, and if so, the fair value for each of the elements.\nRevenue from software license agreements of Zest Labs is recognized over time or at a point in time depending on the evaluation of when the customer obtains control of the promised goods or services over the term of the agreement. For agreements where the software requires continuous updates to provide the intended functionality, revenue is recognized over the term of the agreement. For software as a service (\u201cSaaS\u201d) contracts that include multiple performance obligations, including hardware, perpetual software licenses, subscriptions, term licenses, maintenance and other services, the Company allocates revenue to each performance obligation based on estimates of the price that would be charged to the customer for each promised product or service if it were sold on a standalone basis. For contracts for new products and services where standalone pricing has not been established, the Company allocates revenue to each performance obligation based on estimates using the adjusted market assessment approach, the expected cost plus a margin approach or the residual approach as appropriate under the circumstances. Contracts are typically on thirty-day payment terms from when the Company satisfies the performance obligation in the contract. The Company did not have material revenue from software license agreements in the years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nRevenue under master service agreements is recorded upon the performance obligation being satisfied. Typically, the satisfaction of the performance obligation occurs upon the frac sand load being delivered to the customer site and this load being successfully invoiced and accepted by the Company\u2019s factoring agent.\nThe Company recognizes revenue under ASC 606 when: (i) the Company receives notification of the successful sale of a load of crude oil to a buyer; (ii) the buyer will provide a price based on the average monthly price of crude oil in the most recent month; and (iii) cash is received the following month from the crude oil buyer.\nThe Company accounts for contract costs in accordance with ASC Topic 340-40, Contracts with Customers. The Company recognizes the cost of sales of a contract as expense when incurred or at the time a performance obligation is satisfied. The Company recognizes an asset from the costs to fulfil a contract only if the costs relate directly to a contract, the costs generate or enhance resources that will be used in satisfying a performance obligation in the future and the costs are expected to be recovered. The incremental costs of obtaining a contract are capitalized unless the costs would have been incurred regardless of whether the contract was obtained.\nCost of sales for Pinnacle Frac includes all direct expenses incurred to produce the revenue for the period. This includes, but is not limited to, direct employee labor, direct contract labor and fuel.\nFair Value Measurements\nASC 820 Fair Value Measurements defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with GAAP, and expands disclosure about fair value measurements. ASC 820 classifies these inputs into the following hierarchy:\nLevel 1 inputs: Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.\nLevel 2 inputs: Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations whose inputs are observable or whose significant value drivers are observable.\nLevel 3 inputs: Instruments with primarily unobservable value drivers.\nSegment Information\nThe Company follows the provisions of ASC 280-10 Segment Reporting. This standard requires that companies disclose operating segments based on the manner in which management disaggregates the Company in making internal operating decisions. The Company and its chief operating decision makers determined that the Company\u2019s operations effective with the May 31, 2019, acquisition of Trend Holdings and the March 27, 2020 acquisition of Banner Midstream now consist of three segments, Trend Holdings (Finance), Banner Midstream (Commodities) and Zest Labs (Technology).\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nThe Company does not use derivative instruments to hedge exposures to cash flow, market, or foreign currency risks. Management evaluates all of the Company\u2019s financial instruments, including warrants, to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives. The Company generally uses a Black-Scholes model, as applicable, to value the derivative instruments at inception and subsequent valuation dates when needed. The classification of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is remeasured at the end of each reporting period. The Black-Scholes model is used to estimate the fair value of the derivative liabilities.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nIn August 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update (\u201cASU\u201d) No. 2020-06, Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging-Contracts in Entity\u2019s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40), Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contract\u2019s in an Entity\u2019s Own Equity. The ASU simplifies accounting for convertible instruments by removing major separation models required under current GAAP. Consequently, more convertible debt instruments will be reported as a single liability instrument with no separate accounting for embedded conversion features. The ASU removes certain settlement conditions that are required for equity contracts to qualify for the derivative scope exception, which will permit more equity contracts to qualify for it. The ASU simplifies the diluted net income per share calculation in certain areas. The ASU is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 31, 2021, and early adoption is permitted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that this new guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements.\nIn May 2021, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) issued ASU 2021-04 \u201cEarnings Per Share (Topic 260), Debt-Modifications and Extinguishments (Subtopic 470-50), Compensation- Stock Compensation (Topic 718), and Derivatives and Hedging-Contracts in Entity\u2019s Own Equity (Subtopic 815- 40) Issuer\u2019s Accounting for Certain Modifications or Exchanges of Freestanding Equity-Classified Written Call Options\u201d which clarifies and reduces diversity in an issuer\u2019s accounting for modifications or exchanges of freestanding equity-classified written call options (for example, warrants) that remain equity classified after modification or exchange. An entity should measure the effect of a modification or an exchange of a freestanding equity-classified written call option that remains equity classified after modification or exchange as follows: i) for a modification or an exchange that is a part of or directly related to a modification or an exchange of an existing debt instrument or line-of-credit or revolving-debt arrangements (hereinafter, referred to as a \u201cdebt\u201d or \u201cdebt instrument\u201d), as the difference between the fair value of the modified or exchanged written call option and the fair value of that written call option immediately before it is modified or exchanged; ii) for all other modifications or exchanges, as the excess, if any, of the fair value of the modified or exchanged written call option over the fair value of that written call option immediately before it is modified or exchanged. The amendments in this Update are effective for all entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, including interim periods within those fiscal years. An entity should apply the amendments prospectively to modifications or exchanges occurring on or after the effective date of the amendments. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this standard on its consolidated financial statements.\nThe Company does not discuss recent pronouncements that are not anticipated to have an impact on or are unrelated to its financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or disclosures.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nFiscal year ended March 31, 2021 compared to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020\nAs the Company acquired Trend Holdings and Banner Midstream during the year ended March 31, 2020 the latter of which was acquired on March 27, 2020, many of the variances between operating revenues and operating expenditures are the result of these acquisitions and the periods are not comparable.\nRevenues\nRevenues for the year ended March 31, 2021 were $15,563 as compared to $581 for the year ended March 31, 2020, an increase of $14,982. The increase was primarily due to the addition of the oil and gas operations as the result of the Banner Midstream acquisition on March 27, 2020. Revenues were comprised of $478 and $175 in the financial segment; $0 and $173 in the technology segment; and $15,085 and $233 in the commodity segment for the years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nCost of Revenues and Gross Profit\nCost of revenues for the year ended March 31, 2021 was $14,727 as compared to $259 for the year ended March 31, 2020, an increase of $14,468. The increase was primarily due to the addition of the oil and gas operations as the result of the Banner Midstream acquisition on March 27, 2020. Cost of Revenues was comprised of $0 and $0 in the financial segment; $0 and $165 in the technology segment; and $14,727 and $94 in the commodity segment for the years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Gross margins decreased from 45% for the year ended March 31, 2020 to 5% for the year ended March 31, 2021 due to costs involved with executing the projects and changes in inventory of crude oil.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses for the year ended March 31, 2021 were $19,437 as compared to $10,129 for the year ended March 31, 2020, an increase of $9,308. Operating expenses were comprised of $476 and $729 in the financial segment; $3,415 and $9,330 in the technology segment; and $15,546 and $70 in the commodity segment for the years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The $9,308 increase was due principally to the expenses, including wages and consulting fees, related to the addition of the oil and gas operations as the result of the Banner Midstream acquisition on March 27, 2020 and the depreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion for Banner Midstream in 2021 and 2020, partially offset by the reduction in the Zest Labs selling expenses.\nSelling, General and Administrative\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended March 31, 2021 were $8,405 compared with $1,370 for the year ended March 31, 2020. Cost reduction initiatives were focused on salary related and professional fees for the technology segment offset by the costs incurred for Banner Midstream as this was acquired in March 2020.\nDepreciation, Amortization, Depletion and Accretion\nDepreciation, amortization, depletion and accretion expenses for the year ended March 31, 2021 were $1,902 compared to $286 for the year ended March 31, 2020. Depreciation, amortization, depletion and accretion expenses were comprised of $0 and $0 in the financial segment; $250 and $282 in the technology segment; and $1,652 and $4 in the commodity segment for the years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The $1,616 increase resulted primarily from the acquisition of Banner Midstream and the depletion and accretion is the result of the oil and gas properties maintained by Banner Midstream. The technology and financing segment do not have depletion or accretion.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expense decreased 64% to $883 in the year ended March 31, 2021 compared with $2,472 in the year ended March 31, 2020. The $1,589 reduction in costs related primarily to the maturing of development of the Zest Labs freshness solutions.\nOther Income (Expense)\nChange in fair value of derivative liabilities for the year ended March 31, 2021 was a non-cash loss of ($18,518) as compared to a non-cash loss of ($369) for the year ended March 31, 2020. The $18,149 decrease was a result of the fluctuation in the stock price in the year ended March 31, 2021 compared to the year ended March 31, 2020. In addition, there was a non-cash gain in the year ended March 31, 2021 from the extinguishment of the derivative liabilities that when converted to shares of common stock of $21,084 compared to ($2,099) in the prior year. In the year ended March 31, 2021, there was a non-cash loss on the conversion of debt and other liabilities to shares of common stock of $3,969, a gain on forgiveness of debt of PPP loans of $1,850 and a loss on the sale of fixed assets and abandonment of oil and gas properties of $105 and $109, respectively.\nInterest expense, net of interest income, for the year ended March 31, 2021 was $2,520 as compared to $422 for the year ended March 31, 2020. The increase was the result of the interest incurred on the debt assumed in the Banner Midstream acquisition as well as the value related to the granting of warrants for interest of $2,042 and the amortization of debt discount of $149.\nNet Loss\nNet loss from continuing operations for the year ended March 31, 2021 was $20,888 as compared to $12,137 for the year ended March 31, 2020. The $8,751 increase in net loss was primarily due to the non-cash changes in the fair value of the derivative liability and the non-cash losses incurred on the conversion of debt to equity, offset by the non-cash gain on the exchange of warrants for common stock and forgiveness of debt of the PPP loans described herein. The net income (loss) was comprised of ($15) and ($554) in the financial segment; ($3,502) and ($11,637) in the technology segment; and net loss of ($17,371) and $52 in the commodity segment for the year ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nLiquidity is the ability of a company to generate funds to support its current and future operations, satisfy its obligations, and otherwise operate on an ongoing basis. Significant factors in the management of liquidity are funds generated by operations, levels of accounts receivable and accounts payable and capital expenditures.\nNet cash used in operating activities was ($12,639) for the year ended March 31, 2021, as compared to net cash used in operating activities of ($5,490) for the year ended March 31, 2020. Cash used in operating activities is related to the Company\u2019s net loss partially offset by non-cash expenses, including share-based compensation and the change in the fair value of the derivative liability and net losses incurred in the conversion of debt and liabilities to shares of common stock as well as losses on the sale of fixed assets and abandonment of oil and gas properties.\nNet cash used in investing activities was ($6,358) for the year ended March 31, 2021, as compared to ($775) net cash used in investing activities for the year ended March 31, 2020. Net cash used in investing activities in 2021 related to the advancement of a note receivable of $275, and the net purchases of fixed assets and oil and gas properties including drilling costs of $2,697.\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the year ended March 31, 2021 was $19,907 that included $24,287 (net of fees) raised via issuance of common stock in a direct registered offering, stock for the exercise of warrants and stock options, offset by proceeds and repayments of long-term debt and notes payable including related parties of $4,380. This compared with the year ended March 31, 2020 amounts of $6,427 provided by financing that included $1,137 provided through the credit facility, $2,000 from the exercise of warrants, $2,980 from proceeds received from the sale of preferred stock and $403 from proceeds from advances from related parties.\nTo date we have financed our operations through sales of common stock and the issuance of debt.\nIn addition to these transactions, the Company in the period from April 1, 2020 through March 31, 2021, entered into the following transactions:\n(a) On April 16, 2020, the Company received $386 in Payroll Protection Program funding related to Ecoark Holdings, and the Company also received on April 13, 2020, $1,482 in Payroll Protection Program funds for Pinnacle Frac LLC, a subsidiary of Banner Midstream. All but $29 has been forgiven as of December 31, 2020.\n(b) On May 1, 2020, an institutional investor elected to convert its remaining shares of Series B Preferred shares into 32 common shares.\n(c) On April 1 and May 5, 2020, two institutional investors elected to convert their 1 Series C Preferred share into 276 common shares.\n(d) On May 10, 2020, the Company received approximately $6,294 from accredited institutional investors holding 276 warrants issued on November 13, 2019 with an exercise price of $3.65 and holding 1,176 warrants with an exercise price of $4.50. The Company agreed to issue to these investors an additional number of warrants as a condition of their agreement to exercise the November 2019 warrants.\n(e) On December 31, 2020, the Company completed a registered direct offering, whereby the Company issued 889 shares of common stock and 889 accompanying warrants to purchase common stock to one institutional investor under the effective Form S-3 at $9.00 per share and accompanying warrant for a total of $8,000 in gross proceeds, before placement agent fees and other offering expenses. The warrants are exercisable for a two-year term at a strike price of $10.00 per share. The Company granted 62 warrants to the placement agent as compensation in addition to the $560 cash commission received by the placement agent The placement agent warrants are exercisable at $11.25 per share and expire on January 2, 2023.\nAt March 31, 2021 we had cash (including restricted cash) of $1,316, and $1,194 as of June 22, 2021. We had a working capital deficit of $11,845 and $16,689 as of March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The decrease in the working capital deficit is the result of the non-cash change in the fair value of the derivative liabilities offset by the repayment and conversion of debt and liabilities to shares of common stock. These liabilities were assumed in the Banner Midstream acquisition in March 2020. The Company believes it has adequate capital resources to meet its cash requirements during the next 12 months.\nThe Company raised approximately $16,119 in warrant exercises in the year ended March 31, 2021 as well as $8,001 in a registered direct offering. We expect that the revenue generating operations of Banner Midstream will continue to improve the liquidity of the Company moving forward. However, going forward, the effect of the pandemic on the capital markets may limit our ability to raise additional capital on the terms acceptable to us at the time we need it, if at all. As disclosed in the consolidated financial statements, COVID-19 has had an impact on our management\u2019s ability to operate effectively. The challenges related to remote work and travel restrictions that we as a smaller company have faced in striving to meet our disclosure obligations in a timely manner while taking the steps to protect the health and safety of our employees have impacted, and may continue to further impact, our ability to raise additional capital.\nThe Company pre-funded a majority of the cost, approximately $5,800, associated with the drilling and completion of an initial deep horizontal well in the Austin Chalk formation of which $3,387 was expensed as drilling costs as part of their Participation Agreement with Blackbrush Oil & Gas, L.P. The Company paid the amount of the drilling costs into a designated escrow account which occurred in January 2021.\nOn April 9, 2021, a Little Rock, Arkansas jury awarded Ecoark and Zest a total of $115 million in damages. See \u201cPart I. Item 3. Legal Proceedings\u201d for further information. However, due to expected appeals, the Company does not expect to receive the proceeds until approximately 2025.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of March 31, 2021 and 2020, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements.",

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company as of March 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the two year period ended March 31, 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company\u2019s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.\nOur audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nCritical audit matters are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments.

(\u201cEcoark Holdings\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) is a diversified holding company, incorporated in the state of Nevada on November 19, 2007. Through Ecoark Holdings wholly owned subsidiaries, the Company has operations in three areas: (i) oil and gas, including exploration, production and drilling operations on over 20,000 cumulative acres of active mineral leases in Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi and transportation services, (ii) post-harvest shelf-life and freshness food management technology, and (iii) financial services including investments in a select number of early stage startups each year. Since the acquisition of Banner Midstream Corp. on March 27, 2020, which currently comprises the exploration, production and drilling operations, the Company has focused its efforts to a considerable extent on expanding its exploration and production footprint and capabilities by acquiring real property and working interests in oil and gas mineral leases. The Company\u2019s subsidiaries consist of Ecoark, Inc. (\u201cEcoark\u201d), a Delaware corporation which is the parent of Zest Labs, Inc. (\u201cZest Labs\u201d), Banner Midstream Corp., a Delaware corporation (\u201cBanner Midstream\u201d) and Trend Discovery Holdings Inc., a Delaware corporation (\u201cTrend Holdings\u201d).\nOn March 27, 2020, the Company and Banner Energy Services Corp., a Nevada corporation (\u201cBanner Parent\u201d), entered into a Stock Purchase and Sale Agreement (the \u201cBanner Purchase Agreement\u201d) to acquire Banner Midstream Corp., a Delaware corporation (\u201cBanner Midstream\u201d). Pursuant to the acquisition, Banner Midstream became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and Banner Parent received shares of the Company\u2019s common stock in exchange for all of the issued and outstanding shares of Banner Midstream.\nBanner Midstream has four operating subsidiaries: Pinnacle Frac Transport LLC (\u201cPinnacle Frac\u201d), Capstone Equipment Leasing LLC (\u201cCapstone\u201d), White River Holdings Corp. (\u201cWhite River\u201d), and Shamrock Upstream Energy LLC (\u201cShamrock\u201d). Pinnacle Frac provides transportation of frac sand and logistics services to major hydraulic fracturing and drilling operations. Capstone procures and finances equipment to oilfield transportation service contractors. These two operating subsidiaries of Banner Midstream are revenue producing entities. White River and Shamrock are engaged in oil and gas exploration, production, and drilling operations on over 20,000 cumulative acres of active mineral leases in Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi.\nOn June 11, 2020, the Company acquired certain energy assets from SR Acquisition I, LLC for $1 as part of the ongoing bankruptcy reorganization of Sanchez Energy Corporation. The transaction includes the transfer of 262 total wells in Mississippi and Louisiana, approximately 9,000 acres of active mineral leases, and drilling production materials and equipment. The 262 total wells include 57 active producing wells, 19 active disposal wells, 136 shut-in with future utility wells, and 50 shut-in pending plugging wells. Included in the assignment are 4 wells in the Tuscaloosa Marine Shale formation. One of the leases acquired in this transaction was sold in November 2020.\nOn June 18, 2020, the Company acquired certain energy assets from SN TMS, LLC for $1 as part of the ongoing bankruptcy reorganization of Sanchez Energy Corporation. The transaction includes the transfer of wells, active mineral leases, and drilling production materials and equipment.\nECOARK HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(DOLLAR AMOUNTS AND SHARES IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE DATA)\nMARCH 31, 2021\nOn August 14, 2020, the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement by and among the Company, White River E&P LLC, a Texas Limited Liability Company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company Rabb Resources, LTD. and Claude Rabb, the sole owner of Rabb Resources, LTD. Pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement, the Company completed the acquisition of certain assets of Rabb Resources, LTD. The acquired assets consisted of certain real property and working interests in oil and gas mineral leases. The Company in June 2020 previously provided for bridge financing to Rabb Resources, LTD under the $225 Senior Secured Convertible Promissory Note. As consideration for entering into the Asset Purchase Agreement, the Company agreed to pay Rabb Resources, LTD. A total of $3,500 consisting of (i) $1,500 in cash, net of $304 in outstanding amounts related to the note receivable and accrued interest receivable, and (ii) $2,000 payable in common stock of the Company, which based on the closing price of the common stock as of the date of the Asset Purchase Agreement equaled 103 shares. The Company accounted for this acquisition as an asset acquisition under ASC 805 and that the Company has early adopted the amendments of Regulation S-X dated May 21, 2020 and has concluded that this acquisition was not significant. Accordingly, as a result of the amendment, the presentation of the Rabb Resources, LTD historical financial statements under Rule 3-05 and related pro forma information under Article 11 of Regulation S-X, respectively, were not required to be presented.\nOn September 4, 2020, White River SPV 3, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Banner Midstream entered into an Agreement and Assignment of Oil, Gas and Mineral Lease with a privately held limited liability company (the \u201cAssignor\u201d). Under the Lease Assignment, the Assignor assigned a 100% working interest (75% net revenue interest) in a certain oil and gas lease covering in excess of 1,600 acres (the \u201cLease\u201d), and White River paid $1,500 in cash to the Assignor. The Company accounted for this acquisition as an asset acquisition under ASC 805 and that the Company has early adopted the amendments of Regulation S-X dated May 21, 2020 and has concluded that this acquisition was not significant. Accordingly, as a result of the amendment, the presentation of the historical financial statements under Rule 3-05 and related pro forma information under Article 11 of Regulation S-X, respectively, were not required to be presented.\nOn October 9, 2020, the Company and White River SPV, entered into a Participation Agreement (the \u201cParticipation Agreement\u201d) by and among the Company, White River SPV, BlackBrush Oil & Gas, L.P. (\u201cBlackBrush\u201d) and GeoTerre, LLC, an unrelated privately-held limited liability company (the \u201cAssignor\u201d), to conduct drilling of wells in the Austin Chalk formation.\nPursuant to the Participation Agreement, the Company and White River SPV pre-funded a majority of the cost, approximately $5,800, associated with the drilling and completion of an initial deep horizontal well in the Austin Chalk formation of which $3,387 was expensed as drilling costs. The Participation Agreement required the drilling costs that were paid into a designated escrow account at the commencement of the drilling in January 2021, which it was. BlackBrush agreed to assign to the other parties to the Participation Agreement, subject to certain exceptions and limitations specified therein, specified portions of its leasehold working interest in certain Austin Chalk formation units. The Participation Agreement provides for an initial allocation of the working interests and net revenue interests among the assignor, BlackBrush and the Company and then a re-allocation upon payout or payment of drilling and completion costs for each well drilled. Prior to payout, the Company will own 90% of the working interest and 67.5% of the net revenue interest in each well. Following payout, the Company will own 70% of working interest and 52.5% net revenue interest in each well.\nECOARK HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(DOLLAR AMOUNTS AND SHARES IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE DATA)\nMARCH 31, 2021\nThe Parties to the Participation Agreement, except for the Company, had previously entered into a Joint Operating Agreement, dated September 4, 2020 (the \u201cOperating Agreement\u201d) establishing an area of mutual interest, including the Austin Chalk formation, and governing the parties\u2019 rights and obligations with respect to drilling, completion and operation of wells therein. The Participation Agreement and the Operating Agreement require, among other things, that White River SPV and the Company drill and complete at least one horizontal Austin Chalk well with a certain minimum lateral each calendar year and/or maintain leasehold by paying its proportionate share of any rental payments.\nOn September 30, 2020, the Company and White River Energy, LLC (\u201cWhite River Energy\u201d), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company entered into three Asset Purchase Agreements (the \u201cAsset Purchase Agreements\u201d) with privately-held limited liability companies to acquire working interests in the Harry O\u2019Neal oil and gas mineral lease (the \u201cO\u2019Neal OGML\u201d), the related well bore, crude oil inventory and equipment. Immediately prior to the acquisition, White River Energy owned an approximately 61% working interest in the O\u2019Neal OGML oil well and a 100% working interest in any future wells.\nThe purchase prices of these leases were $126, $312 and $312, respectively, totaling $750. The consideration paid to the Sellers was in the form of 68 shares of common stock. The Company accounted for this acquisition as an asset acquisition under ASC 805 and that the Company has early adopted the amendments of Regulation S-X dated May 21, 2020 and has concluded that this acquisition was not significant. Accordingly, as a result of the amendment, the presentation of the historical financial statements under Rule 3-05 and related pro forma information under Article 11 of Regulation S-X, respectively, were not required to be presented.\nIn February and March 2021, the Company acquired additional leases for $916 under the Blackbrush/Deshotel lease related to the Participation Agreement.\nEffective with the opening of trading on December 17, 2020, the Company effected a one-for-five reverse split of its issued and outstanding common stock and a simultaneous proportionate reduction of its authorized common stock. The reverse stock split was implemented without obtaining stockholder approval as permitted by Nevada law, and the authorized common stock was proportionately reduced to 40,000 shares. All share and per share figures are reflected on a post-split basis herein.\nEffective December 29, 2020, the Company amended its Articles of Incorporation to reduce the authorized common stock from 40,000 shares to 30,000 shares.\nOn December 31, 2020, the Company completed a registered direct offering, whereby the Company issued 889 shares of common stock and 889 accompanying warrants to one institutional investor under the effective Form S-3 at $9.00 per share and accompanying warrant for a total of $8,000 in gross proceeds, before placement agent fees and other offering expenses. The warrants are exercisable for a two-year term at a strike price of $10.00 per share. The Company granted 62 warrants to the placement agent as compensation in addition to the $560 cash commission received by the placement agent. The placement agent warrants are exercisable at $11.25 per share and expire on January 2, 2023.\nOn April 9, 2021, a Little Rock, Arkansas jury awarded Ecoark and Zest a total of $115 million in damages which includes $65 million in compensatory damages and $50 million in punitive damages and found Walmart Inc. liable on three counts. The federal jury found that Walmart Inc. misappropriated Zest\u2019s trade secrets, failed to comply with a written contract, and acted willfully and maliciously in misappropriating Zest\u2019s trade secrets. The Company has filed post-trial motions to add an award for their attorneys\u2019 fees as the prevailing party in the litigation.\nECOARK HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(DOLLAR AMOUNTS AND SHARES IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE DATA)\nMARCH 31, 2021\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nIn May 2018, the Ecoark Holdings Board approved a plan to sell key assets of Pioneer (including the assets of Sable) and Magnolia Solar. Both of these subsidiaries were sold in May 2019.\nOn May 31, 2019, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the \u201cMerger Agreement\u201d) with Trend Discovery Holdings Inc., a Delaware corporation (\u201cTrend Holdings\u201d) for the Company to acquire 100% of Trend Holdings pursuant to a merger of Trend Holdings with and into the Company (the \u201cMerger\u201d). The Merger was completed, and Trend Holdings is now included in the consolidated financial statements.\nOn March 27, 2020, the Company and Banner Parent, entered into the Banner Purchase Agreement to acquire Banner Midstream. Pursuant to the acquisition, Banner Midstream became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and Banner Parent received shares of the Company\u2019s common stock in exchange for all of the issued and outstanding shares of Banner Midstream.\nThe Company applies the guidance of Topic 810 Consolidation of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) Accounting Standards Codification (\u201cASC\u201d) to determine whether and how to consolidate another entity. Pursuant to ASC Paragraph 810-10-15-10 all majority-owned subsidiaries-all entities in which a parent has a controlling financial interest-are consolidated except when control does not rest with the parent. Pursuant to ASC Paragraph 810-10-15-8, the usual condition for a controlling financial interest is ownership of a majority voting interest, and, therefore, as a general rule ownership by one reporting entity, directly or indirectly, of more than 50 percent of the outstanding voting shares of another entity is a condition pointing toward consolidation. The power to control may also exist with a lesser percentage of ownership, for example, by contract, lease, agreement with other stockholders, or by court decree.\nReclassifications\nThe Company has reclassified certain amounts in the March 31, 2020 consolidated financial statements to be consistent with the March 31, 2021 presentation. Reclassifications relating to the discontinued operations are described in Note 2. The reclassifications had no impact on net loss or net cash flows for the years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020.\nECOARK HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(DOLLAR AMOUNTS AND SHARES IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE DATA)\nMARCH 31, 2021\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates include, but are not limited to, management\u2019s estimate of provisions required for uncollectible accounts receivable, fair value of assets held for sale and assets and liabilities acquired, impaired value of equipment and intangible assets, including goodwill, asset retirement obligations, estimates of discount rates in lease, liabilities to accrue, fair value of derivative liabilities associated with warrants, cost incurred in the satisfaction of performance obligations, permanent and temporary differences related to income taxes and determination of the fair value of stock awards.\nActual results could differ from those estimates.\nThe estimates of proved, probable and possible oil and gas reserves are used as significant inputs in determining the depletion of oil and gas properties and the impairment of proved and unproved oil and gas properties. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in the estimation of quantities of proven, probable and possible reserves and in the projection of future rates of production and the timing of development expenditures. Similarly, evaluations for impairment of proved and unproved oil and gas properties are subject to numerous uncertainties including, among others, estimates of future recoverable reserves and commodity price outlooks. Actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions utilized.\nOil and Gas Properties\nThe Company uses the full cost method of accounting for its investment in oil and natural gas properties. Under the full cost method of accounting, all costs associated with acquisition, exploration and development of oil and gas reserves, including directly related overhead costs are capitalized. General and administrative costs related to production and general overhead are expensed as incurred.\nAll capitalized costs of oil and gas properties, including the estimated future costs to develop proved reserves, are amortized on the unit of production method using estimates of proved reserves. Disposition of oil and gas properties are accounted for as a reduction of capitalized costs, with no gain or loss recognized unless such adjustment would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves of oil and gas, in which case the gain or loss is recognized in operations. Unproved properties and development projects are not amortized until proved reserves associated with the projects can be determined or until impairment occurs. If the results of an assessment indicate that the properties are impaired, the amount of the loss from operations before income taxes and the adjusted carrying amount of the unproved properties is amortized on the unit-of-production method.\nThere was $869 and $0 in depreciation, depletion and amortization expense for the Company\u2019s oil and gas properties for the years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nECOARK HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(DOLLAR AMOUNTS AND SHARES IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE DATA)\nMARCH 31, 2021\nLimitation on Capitalized Costs\nUnder the full-cost method of accounting, we are required, at the end of each reporting period, to perform a test to determine the limit on the book value of our oil and gas properties (the \u201cCeiling\u201d test). If the capitalized costs of our oil and natural gas properties, net of accumulated amortization and related deferred income taxes, exceed the Ceiling, the excess or impairment is charged to expense. The expense may not be reversed in future periods, even though higher oil and gas prices may subsequently increase the Ceiling. The Ceiling is defined as the sum of: (a) the present value, discounted at 10% and assuming continuation of existing economic conditions, of (1) estimated future gross revenues from proved reserves, which is computed using oil and gas prices determined as the unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within the 12-month hedging arrangements pursuant to SAB 103, less (2) estimated future expenditures (based on current costs) to be incurred in developing and producing the proved reserves; plus, (b) the cost of properties being amortized; plus, (c) the lower of cost or estimated fair value of unproven properties included in the costs being amortized; net of (d) the related tax effects related to the difference between the book and tax basis of our oil and natural gas properties. A ceiling test was performed as of March 31, 2021 and there was no indication of impairment on the oil and gas properties.\nOil and Gas Reserves\nReserve engineering is a subjective process that is dependent upon the quality of available data and interpretation thereof, including evaluations and extrapolations of well flow rates and reservoir pressure. Estimates by different engineers often vary sometimes significantly. In addition, physical factors such as results of drilling, testing and production subsequent to the date of an estimate, as well as economic factors such as changes in product prices, may justify revision of such estimates. Because proved reserves are required to be estimated using recent prices of the evaluation, estimated reserve quantities can be significantly impacted by changes in product prices.\nJoint Interest Activities\nCertain of our exploration, development and production activities are conducted jointly with other entities and, accordingly, the consolidated financial statements reflect only our proportionate interest in such activities.\nInventories\nCrude oil, products and merchandise inventories are carried at the lower of cost (last-in-first-out (LIFO)) or net realizable value. Inventory costs include expenditures and other charges directly and indirectly incurred in bringing the inventory to its existing condition and location.\nAccounting for Asset Retirement Obligation\nAsset retirement obligations (\u201cARO\u201d) primarily represent the estimated present value of the amount the Company will incur to plug, abandon and remediate its producing properties at the projected end of their productive lives, in accordance with applicable federal, state and local laws. The Company determined its ARO by calculating the present value of the estimated cash flows related to the obligation. The retirement obligation is recorded as a liability at its estimated present value as of the obligation\u2019s inception, with an offsetting increase to proved properties or to exploration costs.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company accounts for revenue in accordance with ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers.\nThe Company accounts for a contract when it has been approved and committed to, each party\u2019s rights regarding the goods or services to be transferred have been identified, the payment terms have been identified, the contract has commercial substance, and collectability is probable. Revenue is generally recognized net of allowances for returns and any taxes collected from customers and subsequently remitted to governmental authorities.\nECOARK HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(DOLLAR AMOUNTS AND SHARES IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE DATA)\nMARCH 31, 2021\nRevenue recognition for multiple-element arrangements requires judgment to determine if multiple elements exist, whether elements can be accounted for as separate units of accounting, and if so, the fair value for each of the elements.\nRevenue from software license agreements of Zest Labs is recognized over time or at a point in time depending on the evaluation of when the customer obtains control of the promised goods or services over the term of the agreement. For agreements where the software requires continuous updates to provide the intended functionality, revenue is recognized over the term of the agreement. For software as a service (\u201cSaaS\u201d) contracts that include multiple performance obligations, including hardware, perpetual software licenses, subscriptions, term licenses, maintenance and other services, the Company allocates revenue to each performance obligation based on estimates of the price that would be charged to the customer for each promised product or service if it were sold on a standalone basis. For contracts for new products and services where standalone pricing has not been established, the Company allocates revenue to each performance obligation based on estimates using the adjusted market assessment approach, the expected cost plus a margin approach or the residual approach as appropriate under the circumstances. Contracts are typically on thirty-day payment terms from when the Company satisfies the performance obligation in the contract. The Company did not have material revenue from software license agreements in the years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nRevenue under master service agreements is recorded upon the performance obligation being satisfied. Typically, the satisfaction of the performance obligation occurs upon the frac sand load being delivered to the customer site and this load being successfully invoiced and accepted by the Company\u2019s factoring agent.\nThe Company recognizes revenue under ASC 606 for their proportionate share of revenue when: (i) the Company receives notification of the successful sale of a load of crude oil to a buyer; (ii) the buyer will provide a price based on the average monthly price of crude oil in the most recent month; and (iii) cash is received the following month from the crude oil buyer.\nThe Company accounts for contract costs in accordance with ASC Topic 340-40, Contracts with Customers. The Company recognizes the cost of sales of a contract as expense when incurred or at the time a performance obligation is satisfied. The Company recognizes an asset from the costs to fulfil a contract only if the costs relate directly to a contract, the costs generate or enhance resources that will be used in satisfying a performance obligation in the future and the costs are expected to be recovered. The incremental costs of obtaining a contract are capitalized unless the costs would have been incurred regardless of whether the contract was obtained.\nCost of sales for Pinnacle Frac includes all direct expenses incurred to produce the revenue for the period. This includes, but is not limited to, direct employee labor, direct contract labor and fuel.\nAccounts Receivable and Concentration of Credit Risk\nThe Company considers accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, to be fully collectible. The allowance is based on management\u2019s estimate of the overall collectability of accounts receivable, considering historical losses, credit insurance and economic conditions. Based on these same factors, individual accounts are charged off against the allowance when management determines those individual accounts are uncollectible. Credit extended to customers is generally uncollateralized, however credit insurance is obtained for some customers. Past-due status is based on contractual terms.\nECOARK HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(DOLLAR AMOUNTS AND SHARES IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE DATA)\nMARCH 31, 2021\nFor Pinnacle Frac, accounts receivable is comprised of unsecured amounts due from customers that have been conveyed to a factoring agent without recourse. Pinnacle Frac receives an advance from the factoring agent of 98% of the amount invoiced to the customer within one business day. The Company recognizes revenue for 100% of the gross amount invoiced, records an expense for the 2% finance charge by the factoring agent, and realizes cash for the 98% net proceeds received. The Company has recognized an allowance for doubtful accounts of $709 and $500 as of March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nFair Value Measurements\nASC 820 Fair Value Measurements defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with GAAP, and expands disclosure about fair value measurements. ASC 820 classifies these inputs into the following hierarchy:\nLevel 1 inputs: Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.\nLevel 2 inputs: Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations whose inputs are observable or whose significant value drivers are observable.\nLevel 3 inputs: Instruments with primarily unobservable value drivers.\nSegment Information\nThe Company follows the provisions of ASC 280-10 Segment Reporting. This standard requires that companies disclose operating segments based on the manner in which management disaggregates the Company in making internal operating decisions. The Company and its chief operating decision makers determined that the Company\u2019s operations effective with the May 31, 2019, acquisition of Trend Holdings and the March 27, 2020 acquisition of Banner Midstream now consist of three segments, Financial, Commodities and Technology.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nThe Company does not use derivative instruments to hedge exposures to cash flow, market, or foreign currency risks. Management evaluates all of the Company\u2019s financial instruments, including warrants, to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives. The Company generally uses a Black-Scholes model, as applicable, to value the derivative instruments at inception and subsequent valuation dates when needed. The classification of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is remeasured at the end of each reporting period. The Black-Scholes model is used to estimate the fair value of the derivative liabilities.\nECOARK HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(DOLLAR AMOUNTS AND SHARES IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE DATA)\nMARCH 31, 2021\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nIn August 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update (\u201cASU\u201d) No. 2020-06, Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging-Contracts in Entity\u2019s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40), Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contract\u2019s in an Entity\u2019s Own Equity. The ASU simplifies accounting for convertible instruments by removing major separation models required under current GAAP. Consequently, more convertible debt instruments will be reported as a single liability instrument with no separate accounting for embedded conversion features. The ASU removes certain settlement conditions that are required for equity contracts to qualify for the derivative scope exception, which will permit more equity contracts to qualify for it. The ASU simplifies the diluted net income per share calculation in certain areas. The ASU is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 31, 2021, and early adoption is permitted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that this new guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements.\nIn May 2021, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) issued ASU 2021-04 \u201cEarnings Per Share (Topic 260), Debt-Modifications and Extinguishments (Subtopic 470-50), Compensation- Stock Compensation (Topic 718), and Derivatives and Hedging-Contracts in Entity\u2019s Own Equity (Subtopic 815- 40) Issuer\u2019s Accounting for Certain Modifications or Exchanges of Freestanding Equity-Classified Written Call Options\u201d which clarifies and reduces diversity in an issuer\u2019s accounting for modifications or exchanges of freestanding equity-classified written call options (for example, warrants) that remain equity classified after modification or exchange. An entity should measure the effect of a modification or an exchange of a freestanding equity-classified written call option that remains equity classified after modification or exchange as follows: i) for a modification or an exchange that is a part of or directly related to a modification or an exchange of an existing debt instrument or line-of-credit or revolving-debt arrangements (hereinafter, referred to as a \u201cdebt\u201d or \u201cdebt instrument\u201d), as the difference between the fair value of the modified or exchanged written call option and the fair value of that written call option immediately before it is modified or exchanged; ii) for all other modifications or exchanges, as the excess, if any, of the fair value of the modified or exchanged written call option over the fair value of that written call option immediately before it is modified or exchanged. The amendments in this Update are effective for all entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, including interim periods within those fiscal years. An entity should apply the amendments prospectively to modifications or exchanges occurring on or after the effective date of the amendments. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this standard on its consolidated financial statements.\nThe Company does not discuss recent pronouncements that are not anticipated to have an impact on or are unrelated to its financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or disclosures.\nLiquidity\nFor the years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company had a net loss of $20,888 and $12,137, respectively, has a working capital deficit of $11,845 and $16,689 as of March 31, 2021 and 2020, and has an accumulated deficit as of March 31, 2021 of $148,911. As of March 31, 2021, the Company has $1,316 in cash and cash equivalents. The Company alleviated the substantial doubt regarding this uncertainty as of March 31, 2020 which continues to be alleviated at March 31, 2021 as a result of the Company\u2019s acquisition of Banner Midstream on March 27, 2020 which bring revenue generating subsidiaries with reserves of oil properties over $6,000 and existing customer relationships over $2,000, coupled with the raising of $16,119 in the exercise of warrants, $502 in the exercise of options and $7,666 in a registered direct offering, net of fees of $334 in the year ended March 31, 2021.\nECOARK HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(DOLLAR AMOUNTS AND SHARES IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE DATA)\nMARCH 31, 2021\nIf the Company raises additional funds by issuing equity securities, its stockholders would experience dilution. Additional debt financing, if available, may involve covenants restricting its operations or its ability to incur additional debt. Any additional debt financing or additional equity that the Company raises may contain terms that are not favorable to it or its stockholders and require significant debt service payments, which diverts resources from other activities. If the Company is unable to obtain additional financing, it may be required to significantly scale back its business and operations. The Company\u2019s ability to raise additional capital will be impacted by the heightened societal and regulatory focus on climate change and may also be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe Company believes that the current cash on hand and anticipated cash from operations is sufficient to conduct planned operations for one year from the issuance of the consolidated financial statements.\nImpact of COVID-19\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound effect on the U.S. and global economy and may continue to affect the economy and the industries in which we operate, depending on the vaccine rollouts and the emergence of virus mutations.\nCOVID-19 did not have a material effect on the Consolidated Statements of Operations or the Consolidated Balance Sheets included in this Form 10-K. However, it did have a material impact on our management\u2019s ability to operate effectively. The impact included the difficulties of working remotely from home including slow Internet connection, the inability of our accounting and financial officers to collaborate as effectively as they would otherwise have in an office environment and issues arising from mandatory state quarantines.\nWhile it is not possible at this time to estimate with sufficient certainty the continued impact that COVID-19 could have on the Company\u2019s business, future outbreaks and the measures taken by federal, state, local and foreign governments could disrupt the operation of the Company\u2019s business. The COVID-19 outbreak and mitigation measures have also had and may continue to have an adverse impact on global and domestic economic conditions, including the reducing demand for oil, which could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and financial condition, including on its potential to conduct financings on terms acceptable to the Company, if at all. In addition, the Company has taken temporary precautionary measures intended to help minimize the risk of the virus to its employees, including temporarily requiring employees to work remotely, and discouraging employee attendance at in-person work-related meetings, which could negatively affect the Company\u2019s business. The extent to which the COVID-19 outbreak may impact the Company\u2019s results will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information that may emerge concerning the severity of the virus and the actions to contain its impact.\nThe Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (\u201cCARES Act\u201d) includes, among other things, provisions relating to payroll tax credits and deferrals, net operating loss carryback periods, alternative minimum tax credits and technical corrections to tax depreciation methods for qualified improvement property. The CARES Act also established a Paycheck Protection Program (\u201cPPP\u201d), whereby certain small business are eligible for a loan to fund payroll expenses, rent and related costs. We had received funding under the PPP, and a majority of that as indicated in our Consolidated Statement of Operations has been forgiven.\nECOARK HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(DOLLAR AMOUNTS AND SHARES IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE DATA)\nMARCH 31, 2021\nIn April 2020, the Company and one of its subsidiaries entered into PPP loans with financial institutions, Of the $1,869 in PPP loans obtained this fiscal year, the Company was informed that $1,850 (including $11 in accrued interest) has been forgiven in the three months ended December 31, 2020. The remaining $30 with accrued interest of $2 was converted into a loan that is due in May 2022, with payments of $2 per month that commenced December 19, 2020.\nNOTE 2: DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS\nPursuant to ASC 205-20, Presentation of Financial Statements - Discontinued Operations, ASC-20-45-1B, paragraph 360-10-45-15, Pinnacle Vac will be disposed of other than by sale via an abandonment and termination of operations with no intent to classify the entity or assets as Available for Sale. Pursuant to ASC 205-20-45-3A, the results of operations of Pinnacle Vac from inception to discontinuation of operations will be reclassified to a separate component of income, below Net Income/(Loss), as a Loss on Discontinued Operations.\nAll of the equipment assets of Pinnacle Vac and the related loan liabilities will be subsequently transitioned into Capstone to continue servicing the debt. The remaining current assets of Pinnacle Vac will be used to settle any outstanding current liabilities of Pinnacle Vac. A loss contingency will be recorded if any of the outstanding liabilities or obligations of Pinnacle Vac resulting from this abandonment are reasonably estimable and likely to be incurred.\nBanner Midstream made the decision to discontinue the operations of its wholly owned subsidiary, Pinnacle Vac Service LLC (\u201cPinnacle Vac\u201d), effective October 31, 2018 due to the inability of Pinnacle Vac\u2019s management to develop a sustainable, profitable business model. The managerial staff of Pinnacle Vac was terminated on November 15, 2018 and Pinnacle Vac\u2019s rental facility at Sligo Rd. was vacated on November 15, 2018.\nECOARK HOLDINGS, INC.

During 2021, the Company traded in a vehicle for a new right of use asset for Pinnacle Frac for $55. In addition, the Company paid off a majority of the accounts payable with only $9 remaining.\nAfter consideration of all the evidence, both positive and negative, management has recorded a full valuation allowance due to the uncertainty of realizing income tax benefit for all periods presented, and the income tax provision for all periods presented was considered immaterial. Thus, no separate tax provision or benefit relating to discontinued operations is included here or on the face of the consolidated statements of operations.\nNOTE 3: REVENUE\nThe following table disaggregates the Company\u2019s revenue by major source for the years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020:\nYears Ended\nMarch 31,\nRevenue:\nSoftware as a Service (\u201cSaaS\u201d) $ - $ 28\nProfessional Services -\nFinancial Services\nOil and Gas Production 2,363 -\nTransportation Services 12,318\nFuel Rebate\nEquipment Rental\n$ 15,563 $ 581\nThere were no significant contract asset or contract liability balances for all periods presented.

The Company had an existing note in the amount of $25 that had not been secured, and rolled an additional $200 into Rabb Resources, LTD, whereby the entire amount became secured. The note was non-interest bearing if paid or converted within forty-five days of the issuance date of June 18, 2020 (August 2, 2020, which is the maturity date). If not paid or converted, the note bore interest at 11% per annum, paid in cash on a quarterly basis.\nThis note was convertible into shares of Rabb Resources, LTD. based on a valuation of Rabb Resources, LTD. into shares of that company at a value of the $225. The Company advanced an additional $50 on July 8, 2020 and $25 on August 7, 2020 to bring the total note receivable to $300. This amount plus the accrued interest receivable of $4 was due as of August 14, 2020.\nOn August 14, 2020, the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with Rabb Resources, LTD. which included the acquisition of real property. The purchase price for this acquisition was $3,500, of which $1,196 was paid in cash (after applying the outstanding principal of the note receivable and accrued interest receivable against the $1,500 agreed upon cash consideration) and the balance was paid in common stock of the Company.

The Derivative Warrant Instruments have been accounted for utilizing ASC 815 \u201cDerivatives and Hedging.\u201d The Company has incurred a liability for the estimated fair value of Derivative Warrant Instruments. The estimated fair value of the Derivative Warrant Instruments has been calculated using the Black-Scholes fair value option-pricing model with key input variables provided by management, as of the date of issuance, with changes in fair value recorded as gains or losses on revaluation in other income (expense).\nECOARK HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(DOLLAR AMOUNTS AND SHARES IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE DATA)\nMARCH 31, 2021\nThe Company identified embedded features in the March and May 2017 warrants which caused the warrants to be classified as a liability.

To the best of our knowledge, no governmental authority is contemplating any proceeding to which we are a party or to which any of our properties or businesses are subject, which would reasonably be likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company.\n\u25cf On August 1, 2018, Ecoark Holdings, Inc. and Zest Labs, Inc. filed a complaint against Walmart Inc. in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas, Western Division. The complaint includes claims for violation of the Arkansas Trade Secrets Act, violation of the Federal Defend Trade Secrets Act, breach of contract, unfair competition, unjust enrichment, breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, conversion and fraud. On April 9, 2021, a Little Rock, Arkansas jury awarded Ecoark and Zest a total of $115 million in damages which includes $65 million in compensatory damages and $50 million in punitive damages and found Walmart Inc. liable on three claims. The federal jury found that Walmart Inc. misappropriated Zest\u2019s trade secrets, failed to comply with a written contract, and acted willfully and maliciously in misappropriating Zest\u2019s trade secrets. The Company has filed post-trial motions to add an award for their attorneys\u2019 fees as the prevailing party in the litigation.\n\u25cf On December 12, 2018, a complaint was filed against the Company in the Twelfth Judicial Circuit in Sarasota County, Florida by certain investors who invested in the Company before it was public. The complaint alleges that the investment advisors who solicited the investors to invest into the Company made omissions and misrepresentations concerning the Company and the shares. The Company filed a motion to dismiss the complaint which is pending.\nIn the opinion of management, there are no legal matters involving us that would have a material adverse effect upon the Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nJoint Participation Agreement\nOn October 9, 2020, the Company and White River SPV, entered into a Participation Agreement (the \u201cParticipation Agreement\u201d) by and among the Company, White River SPV, BlackBrush Oil & Gas, L.P. (\u201cBlackBrush\u201d) and GeoTerre, LLC, an unrelated privately-held limited liability company (the \u201cAssignor\u201d), to conduct drilling of wells in the Austin Chalk formation.\nECOARK HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(DOLLAR AMOUNTS AND SHARES IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE DATA)\nMARCH 31, 2021\nPursuant to the Participation Agreement, the Company and White River SPV funded 100% of the cost, approximately $5,800, associated with the drilling and completion of an initial deep horizontal well in the Austin Chalk formation. The Participation Agreement required the drilling costs that were paid into a designated escrow account at the commencement of the drilling in January 2021, which it was. BlackBrush agreed to assign to the other parties to the Participation Agreement, subject to certain exceptions and limitations specified therein, specified portions of its leasehold working interest in certain Austin Chalk formation units. The Participation Agreement provides for an initial allocation of the working interests and net revenue interests among the assignor, BlackBrush and the Company and then a re-allocation upon payout or payment of drilling and completion costs for each well drilled. Prior to payout, the Company will own 90% of the working interest and 67.5% of the net revenue interest in each well. Following payout, the Company will own 70% of working interest and 52.5% net revenue interest in each well.\nThe Parties to the Participation Agreement, except for the Company, had previously entered into a Joint Operating Agreement, dated September 4, 2020 (the \u201cOperating Agreement\u201d) establishing an area of mutual interest, including the Austin Chalk formation, and governing the parties\u2019 rights and obligations with respect to drilling, completion and operation of wells therein. The Participation Agreement and the Operating Agreement require, among other things, that White River SPV and the Company drill and complete at least one horizontal Austin Chalk well with a certain minimum lateral each calendar year and/or maintain leasehold by paying its proportionate share of any rental payments.\nNOTE 15: CONCENTRATIONS\nCustomer Concentration. Three and two customers, all in the commodity segment accounted for more than 10% of the accounts receivable balance at March 31, 2021 and 2020 for a total of 76% and 63% of accounts receivable, respectively. In addition, two customers represent approximately 69% and 32% of total revenues for the Company for the years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nSupplier Concentration. Certain of the raw materials, components and equipment used by the Company in the manufacture of its products are available from single-sourced vendors. Shortages could occur in these essential materials and components due to an interruption of supply or increased demand in the industry. If the Company were unable to procure certain materials, components or equipment at acceptable prices, it would be required to reduce its manufacturing operations, which could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations. In addition, the Company may make prepayments to certain suppliers or enter into minimum volume commitment agreements. Should these suppliers be unable to deliver on their obligations or experience financial difficulty, the Company may not be able to recover these prepayments.\nThe Company occasionally maintains cash balances in excess of the FDIC insured limit. The Company does not consider this risk to be material.\nCommodity price risk\nWe are exposed to fluctuations in commodity prices for oil and natural gas. Commodity prices are affected by many factors, including but not limited to, supply and demand.\nECOARK HOLDINGS, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(DOLLAR AMOUNTS AND SHARES IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE DATA)\nMARCH 31, 2021\nNOTE 17: FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\nThe Company measures and discloses the estimated fair value of financial assets and liabilities using the fair value hierarchy prescribed by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The fair value hierarchy has three levels, which are based on reliable available inputs of observable data. The hierarchy requires the use of observable market data when available. The three-level hierarchy is defined as follows:\nLevel 1 - quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets;\nLevel 2 - quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model derived valuations in which significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets; and\nLevel 3 - fair value measurements derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable.\nFinancial instruments consist principally of cash, accounts receivable and other receivables, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, notes payable, and amounts due to related parties. The fair value of cash is determined based on Level 1 inputs. There were no transfers into or out of \u201cLevel 3\u201d during the years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020. The recorded values of all other financial instruments approximate their current fair values because of their nature and respective relatively short maturity dates or durations.\nFair value estimates are made at a specific point in time, based on relevant market information and information about the financial instrument. These estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and therefore cannot be determined with precision. Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates. The Company records the fair value of the of the warrant derivative liabilities disclosed in accordance with ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging. The fair values of the derivatives were calculated using the Black-Scholes Model. The fair value of the derivative liabilities is revalued on each balance sheet date with corresponding gains and losses recorded in other income (expense) in the consolidated statement of operations. The following table presents assets and liabilities that are measured and recognized at fair value on a recurring basis as of:\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Gains\nand (Losses)\nMarch 31, 2021\nWarrant derivative liabilities - - $ 7,213 $ (18,518 )\nMarch 31, 2020\nWarrant derivative liabilities - - $ 2,775 $ (369 )\nNOTE 18: SEGMENT INFORMATION\nThe Company follows the provisions of ASC 280-10 Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information. This standard requires that companies disclose operating segments based on the manner in which management disaggregates the Company in making operating decisions. As of March 31, 2021 and 2020, and for the years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company operated in three segments.

The Company had had only short-term leases up through the acquisition of Banner Midstream. The Company acquired a right of use asset and lease liability of $731 and $732, respectively on March 27, 2020. The Company recorded these amounts at present value, in accordance with the standard, using discount rates ranging between 2.5% and 6.8%. The right of use asset is composed of the sum of all lease payments, at present value, and is amortized straight line over the life of the expected lease term. For the expected term of the lease the Company used the initial terms ranging between 42 and 60 months. Upon the election by the Company to extend the lease for additional years, that election will be treated as a lease modification and the lease will be reviewed for remeasurement. This lease will be treated as an operating lease under the new standard. In addition, the Company entered into a new 39 month operating lease for office space in September 2020 as well as a new 36 month operating lease in March 2021 which are also included in the right of use asset and lease liabilities.\nECOARK HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(DOLLAR AMOUNTS AND SHARES IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE DATA)\nMARCH 31, 2021\nThe Company has chosen to implement this standard using the modified retrospective model approach with a cumulative-effect adjustment, which does not require the Company to adjust the comparative periods presented when transitioning to the new guidance. The Company has also elected to utilize the transition related practical expedients permitted by the new standard.

All of the Company\u2019s activities are in the United States.\nThe Company has performed due diligence in addition to the determination of estimated proved producing reserves on over 20,000 acres of oil and gas mineral rights, both shallow and deep levels and identified an estimated recoverable cumulative production of 2,654,865 barrels of oil at the SEC price deck of $40.01/Bbl and 4,896,826 barrels of oil at $58.00/Bbl based on analogous and comparative proved produced production in nearby areas. This due diligence is not included in any of the amounts provided as of and for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020.\nResults of Operations\nResults of Operations March 31,\nMarch 31,\nSales $ 2,363 $ -\nLease operating costs (9,476 ) -\nDepletion, accretion and impairment (933 ) -\n$ (8,046 ) $ -\nReserve Quantity Information\nThe supplemental unaudited presentation of proved reserve quantities and related standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows provides estimates only and does not purport to reflect realizable values or fair market values of the Company\u2019s reserves. The Company emphasizes that reserve estimates are inherently imprecise and that estimates of new discoveries are more imprecise than those of producing oil and gas properties. Accordingly, significant changes to these estimates can be expected as future information becomes available.\nProved reserves are those estimated reserves of crude oil (including condensate and natural gas liquids) and natural gas that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions. Proved developed reserves are those expected to be recovered through existing wells, equipment, and operating methods.\nEstimated Quantities of Proved Reserves (Mbbl)\nEstimated Quantities of Proved Reserves March 31,\nMarch 31,\nProved Developed, Producing\nProved Developed, Non-Producing - -\nTotal Proved Developed\nProved Undeveloped - -\nTotal Proved\nECOARK HOLDINGS, INC.

Future production and development costs are computed by estimating the expenditures to be incurred in developing and producing the proved oil and natural gas reserves at year-end, based on year-end costs and assuming continuation of existing economic conditions.\nFuture income tax expenses are calculated by applying appropriate year-end tax rates to future pretax net cash flows relating to proved oil and natural gas reserves, less the tax basis of properties involved. Future income tax expenses give effect to permanent differences, tax credits and loss carry forwards relating to the proved oil and natural gas reserves. Future net cash flows are discounted at a rate of ten percent annually to derive the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows. This calculation procedure does not necessarily result in an estimate of the fair market value of the Company\u2019s oil and natural gas properties.\nThe standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to proved oil and natural gas reserves for the years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020 are as follows:\nStandardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flow March 31,\nMarch 31,\nFuture gross revenue $ 17,839 $ 767\nLess: Future production tax expense (1,181 ) (35 )\nFuture gross revenue after production taxes 16,658\nLess: Future operating costs (5,058 ) (565 )\nLess: Ad Valorem Taxes (160 ) -\nLess: Development costs (870 ) (295 )\nFuture net income (loss) before taxes 10,570 (128 )\n10% annual discount for estimated timing of cash flows (3,347 )\nStandardized measure of discounted future net cash flows (PV10) $ 7,223 $ (88 )\nECOARK HOLDINGS, INC.

Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, within the meaning of Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (\u201cPCAOB\u201d) Auditing Standard AS 2201, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company\u2019s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nOur management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2021. In making this assessment, our management used the criteria set forth in the Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (\u201cCOSO\u201d).
