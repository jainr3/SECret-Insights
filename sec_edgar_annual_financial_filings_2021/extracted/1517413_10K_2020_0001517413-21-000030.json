    "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nInvesting in our Class A common stock involves a high degree of risk. Investors should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the section titled \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" and our consolidated financial statements and related notes, before deciding to invest in our Class A common stock. Unless otherwise indicated, references to our business being harmed in these risk factors will include harm to our business, reputation, customer growth, results of operations, financial condition, or prospects. Any of these events could cause the trading price of our Class A common stock to decline, which would cause our stockholders to lose all or part of their investment. Our business, results of operations, financial condition, or prospects could also be harmed by risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently do not believe are material.\nSelect Risk Factors Affecting Our Business\nOur business is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those risks discussed at-length below. These risks include, among others, the following:\n\u2022If our platform fails to perform properly due to defects, interruptions, delays in performance, or similar problems, and if we fail to develop enhancements to resolve any defect, interruption, delay, or other problems, we could lose customers, become subject to service performance or warranty claims or incur significant costs.\n\u2022If we are unable to attract new customers, in particular, enterprise customers, and to have existing enterprise customers continue and increase their use of our platform, our business will likely be harmed.\n\u2022If we fail to forecast our revenue accurately, or if we fail to manage our expenditures, our operating results could be adversely affected.\n\u2022We receive a substantial portion of our revenues from a limited number of customers, and the loss of, or a significant reduction in usage by, one or more of our major customers would result in lower revenues and could harm our business.\n\u2022Our limited operating history and our history of operating losses makes it difficult to evaluate our current business and prospects and may increase the risks associated with your investment.\n\u2022If we fail to adapt and respond effectively to rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards, changing regulations, and changing customer needs, requirements, or preferences, our products may become less competitive.\n\u2022Failure to effectively develop and expand our marketing and sales capabilities could harm our ability to increase our customer base and achieve broader market acceptance of our platform.\n\u2022The markets in which we participate are competitive, and if we do not compete effectively, our business will be harmed.\n\u2022If we fail to maintain and enhance our brand, our ability to expand our customer base will be impaired and our business, results of operations and financial condition may suffer.\n\u2022Acquisitions, strategic investments, partnerships, or alliances, including our recent acquisition of Signal Sciences, could be difficult to identify and integrate, divert the attention of management, disrupt our business, and dilute stockholder value.\n\u2022We are, and in the future may be, involved in class-action lawsuits and other litigation matters that are expensive and time-consuming. If resolved adversely, lawsuits and other litigation matters could seriously harm our business.\n\u2022Health epidemics, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, have had, and could in the future have, an adverse impact on our business, operations, and the markets and communities in which we, our partners and customers operate.\n\u2022We have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, and if we are unable to remediate and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in the future, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, and the market price of our Class A common stock may be seriously harmed.\n\u2022Our stock price may be volatile, and the value of our Class A common stock may decline.\nRisks Related to Our Business, Industry and Technology\nIf our platform fails to perform properly due to defects, interruptions, delays in performance, or similar problems, and if we fail to develop enhancements to resolve any defect, interruption, delay, or other problems, we could lose customers, become subject to service performance or warranty claims or incur significant costs.\nOur operations are dependent upon our ability to prevent system interruption. The applications underlying our edge cloud computing platform are inherently complex and may contain material defects or errors, which may cause disruptions in availability or other performance problems. We have from time to time found defects and errors in our platform and may discover additional defects or errors in the future that could result in data unavailability, unauthorized access to, loss, corruption, or other harm to our customers\u2019 data. These defects or errors could also be found in third-party applications or open source software on which we rely. We may not be able to detect and correct defects or errors before implementing our products. Consequently, we or our customers may discover defects or errors after our products have been deployed.\nWe currently serve our customers from our POPs located around the world. Our customers need to be able to access our platform at any time, without interruption or degradation of performance. However, we have not developed redundancies for all aspects of our platform. We depend, in part, on our third-party facility providers\u2019 ability to protect these facilities against damage or interruption from natural disasters, power or telecommunications failures, criminal acts, public health issues, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and similar events. In some cases, third-party cloud providers run their own platforms that we access, and we are, therefore, vulnerable to their service interruptions. In the event that there are any defects or errors in software, failures of hardware, damages to a facility, or misconfigurations of any of our services, we may have to divert resources away from other planned work, could experience lengthy interruptions in our platform, and also incur delays and additional expenses in arranging new facilities and services. Our customers may choose to divert their traffic away from our platform as a result of interruptions or delays. Disaster recovery arrangements, including the existence of redundant data centers that are designed to become active during certain lapses of service, may not function as intended, and any disruptions to our service could harm our business.\nWe design our system infrastructure and procure and own or lease the computer hardware used for our platform. Design and mechanical errors, spikes in usage volume, and failure to follow system protocols and procedures could cause our systems to fail, resulting in interruptions on our platform. Moreover, we have experienced and may in the future experience system failures or interruptions in our platform as a result of human error. For example, in January 2021, we experienced a platform interruption that affected certain of our customers. Any interruptions or delays in our platform, whether caused by our products or our data centers, third-party error, our own error, natural disasters, or security breaches, or whether accidental or willful, could harm our relationships with customers, reduce customers\u2019 usage of our platform, cause our revenue to decrease and/or our expenses to increase, and divert resources away from product development. Also, in the event of damage or interruption, our insurance policies may not adequately compensate us for any losses that we may incur. These factors in turn could further reduce our revenue, subject us to liability and cause us to issue service credits or cause customers to fail to renew their customer contracts, any of which could harm our business.\nThe occurrence of any defects, errors, disruptions in service, failures involving redundant data centers, or other performance problems, interruptions, or delays with our platform, whether in connection with the day-to-day operations or otherwise, could result in:\n\u2022loss of customers;\n\u2022reduced customer usage of our platforms;\n\u2022lost or delayed market acceptance and sales of our products, or the failure to launch products or features on anticipated timelines;\n\u2022delays in payment to us by customers;\n\u2022injury to our reputation and brand;\n\u2022legal claims, including warranty and service level agreement claims, against us; or\n\u2022diversion of our resources, including through increased service and warranty expenses or financial concessions, and increased insurance costs.\nThe costs incurred in correcting any material defects, errors, or other performance problems in our platform may be substantial and could harm our business.\nIf we are unable to attract new customers, in particular, enterprise customers, and to have existing enterprise customers continue and increase their use of our platform, our business will likely be harmed.\nTo grow our business, we must continue to attract new customers, in particular, enterprise customers. To do so, we must successfully convince potential customers of the benefits and the value of our platform. This may require significant and costly sales efforts that are targeted at larger enterprises and senior management of these potential customers. Sales to enterprise customers may involve longer sales cycles as a result of customers requiring considerable time to evaluate our platform, requiring participation in a competitive purchasing process, having more formal processes for approval of purchases, and more complex requirements. These factors significantly impact our ability to add new customers and increase the time, resources, and sophistication required to do so. In addition, numerous other factors, some of which are out of our control, may now or in the future impact our ability to acquire new customers, including potential customers\u2019 commitments to other providers, real or perceived costs of switching to our platform, our failure to expand, retain, and motivate our sales and marketing personnel, our failure to develop or expand relationships with potential customers and channel partners, failure by us to help our customers to successfully deploy our platform, negative media or industry or financial analyst commentary regarding us or our solutions, litigation, and deteriorating general economic conditions. If we fail to attract new customers, particularly enterprise customers, as a result of these and other factors, our business will likely be harmed.\nIn addition, our ability to grow and generate incremental revenue depends on our ability to maintain and grow our relationships with our existing enterprise customers so that they continue and increase their usage of our platform. If these customers do not maintain and increase their usage of our platform, our revenue may decline and our results of operations will likely be harmed. For example, our largest customer in the year ended December 31, 2020 significantly decreased its usage in the second half of the year, which negatively impacted our revenue for the year.\nWe charge our customers based on the usage of our platform. Most of our customers, including some of our largest enterprise customers, do not have long-term contractual financial commitments to us. And a majority of our current customer contracts are only one year in duration. In order for us to maintain or improve our results of operations, it is important that our customers, in particular, our enterprise customers, use our platform in excess of their commitment levels, if any, and continue to use our platform on the same or more favorable terms. Our ability to retain our largest customers and expand their usage could be impaired for a variety of reasons, including customer budget constraints, customer satisfaction, changes in our customers\u2019 underlying businesses, changes in the type and size of our customers, pricing changes, competitive conditions, the acquisition of our customers by other companies, governmental actions, or the possibility thereof, and general economic conditions. Because many of our largest customers\u2019 minimum usage commitments for our platform are relatively low compared to their expected usage, it can be easy for certain customers to quickly reallocate usage or switch from our platform to an alternative platform altogether. And they may reduce or cease their use of our products at any time without penalty or termination charges, even after prior period of usage expansion.\nWe base our decisions about expense levels and investments on estimates of our future revenue and future anticipated rate of growth. Many of our expenses are fixed cost in nature for some minimum amount of time, such as with colocation and bandwidth providers, so if we do experience slower usage growth on our platform it may not be possible to reduce costs in a timely manner or without the payment of fees to exit certain obligations early. If any of these events were to occur, our business may be harmed.\nIn addition, many of our customers have negotiated and may continue to negotiate lower rates for their usage in exchange for an agreement to renew, expand their usage in the future, or adopt new products. As a result, in certain cases, even though customers have not reduced their usage of our platform, the revenue we derive from that usage has decreased. If our usage or revenue fall significantly below the expectations of the public market, securities analysts, or investors, our business would be harmed, which could cause our stock price to decline.\nOur future success also depends in part on our ability to expand our existing customer relationships, in particular, with enterprise customers, by increasing their usage of our platform and selling them additional products. The rate at which our customers increase their usage of our platform and purchase products from us depends on a number of factors, including our ability to grow our platform and maintain the security and availability of it, develop and deliver new features and products, maintain customer satisfaction, general economic conditions and pricing and services offered by our competitors. If our efforts to increase usage of our platform by, or sell additional products to, our enterprise customers are not successful, our business would be harmed. In addition, even if our largest customers increase their usage of our platform, we cannot guarantee that they will maintain those usage levels for any meaningful period of time. In addition, because many of our products endeavor to deliver increased efficiency and functionality, the successful sale of an additional product to an existing customer could result in a reduction of the customer's overall usage of our platform.\nIf we fail to forecast our revenue accurately, or if we fail to manage our expenditures, our operating results could be adversely affected.\nBecause our recent growth has resulted in the rapid expansion of our business and revenues, we do not have a long history upon which to base forecasts of future revenue and operating results. We cannot accurately predict customers\u2019 usage or renewal rates given the diversity of our customer base across industries, geographies and size, and ability of customers to allocate usage, among other factors. If we do not realize returns on these investments in our growth, our results of operations could differ materially from our forecasts, which would adversely affect our results of operations and could disappoint analysts and investors, causing our stock price to decline.\nWe receive a substantial portion of our revenues from a limited number of customers, and the loss of, or a significant reduction in usage by, one or more of our major customers would result in lower revenues and could harm our business.\nOur future success is dependent on establishing and maintaining successful relationships with a diverse set of customers. We currently receive a substantial portion of our revenues from a limited number of customers. For year ended December 31, 2020, our top ten customers accounted for approximately 38% of our revenue and our top five customers accounted for approximately 27% of our revenue. It is likely that we will continue to be dependent upon a limited number of customers for a significant portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future and, in some cases, the portion of our revenues attributable to individual customers may increase in the future. The loss of one or more key customers or a reduction in usage by any major customers would reduce our revenues. If we fail to maintain existing customers or develop relationships with new customers, our business would be harmed.\nOur limited operating history and our history of operating losses makes it difficult to evaluate our current business and prospects and may increase the risks associated with your investment.\nWe were founded in 2011 and have experienced net losses and negative cash flows from operations since inception. Our limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our current business and our future prospects, including our ability to plan for and model future growth. We have encountered and will continue to encounter risks and difficulties frequently experienced by rapidly growing companies in constantly evolving industries, including the risks described in this report. If we do not address these risks successfully, our business may be harmed.\nWe generated a net loss of $95.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, and as of December 31, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of $288.2 million. We will need to generate and sustain increased revenue levels and manage costs in future periods in order to become profitable; even if we achieve profitability, we may not be able to maintain or increase our level of profitability. We intend to continue to expend significant funds to support further growth and further develop our platform, including expanding the functionality of our platform, expanding our technology infrastructure and business systems to meet the needs of our customers, expanding our direct sales force and partner ecosystem, increasing our marketing activities, and growing our international operations. We will also face increased compliance costs associated with growth, expansion of our customer base, and the costs of being a public company. Our efforts to grow our business may be costlier than we expect, and we may not be able to increase our revenue enough to offset our increased operating expenses. We may incur significant losses\nin the future for a number of reasons, including the other risks described herein, and unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications and delays, and other unknown events. If we are unable to achieve and sustain profitability, our business may be harmed.\nFurther, we have limited historical financial data and operate in a rapidly evolving market. As such, any predictions about our future revenue and expenses may not be as accurate as they would be if we had a longer operating history or operated in a more predictable market.\nIf we fail to adapt and respond effectively to rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards, changing regulations, and changing customer needs, requirements, or preferences, our products may become less competitive.\nThe market in which we compete is relatively new and subject to rapid technological change, evolving industry standards and regulatory changes, as well as changing customer needs, requirements, and preferences. The success of our business will depend, in part, on our ability to adapt and respond effectively to these changes on a timely basis. If we are unable to develop and sell new products that satisfy our customers and provide enhancements, new features, and capabilities to our platform that keep pace with rapid technological and industry change, our revenue and operating results could be adversely affected. If new technologies emerge that enable large internet platform companies to utilize their own data centers and implement delivery approaches that limit or eliminate reliance on third-party providers like us, or that enable our competitors to deliver competitive products and applications at lower prices, more efficiently, more conveniently, or more securely, such technologies could adversely impact our ability to compete. If our platform does not allow us or our customers to comply with the latest regulatory requirements, our existing customers may decrease their usage on our platform and new customers will be less likely to adopt our platform.\nOur platform must also integrate with a variety of network, hardware, mobile, and software platforms and technologies, and we need to continuously modify and enhance our products and platform capabilities to adapt to changes and innovation in these technologies. If developers widely adopt new software platforms, we would have to attempt to develop new versions of our products and enhance our platform\u2019s capabilities to work with those new platforms. These development efforts may require significant engineering, marketing, and sales resources, all of which would affect our business and operating results. Any failure of our platform\u2019s capabilities to operate effectively with future infrastructure platforms, technologies, and software platforms could reduce the demand for our platform. If we are unable to respond to these changes in a cost-effective manner, our products may become less marketable and less competitive or obsolete, and our business may be harmed.\nMoreover, our platform is highly technical and complex and, for example, our delivery products rely on knowledge of the Varnish Configuration Language (\"VCL\") to utilize many features of this platform. Potential developers may be unfamiliar or opposed to working with VCL and therefore decide to not adopt our platform, which may harm our business.\nFailure to effectively develop and expand our marketing and sales capabilities could harm our ability to increase our customer base and achieve broader market acceptance of our platform.\nWe have historically benefited from word-of-mouth and other organic marketing to attract new customers. Through this word-of-mouth marketing, we have been able to build our brand with relatively low marketing and sales costs. This strategy has allowed us to build a substantial customer base and community of users who use our products and act as advocates for our brand and our platform, often within their own corporate organizations. However, our ability to further increase our customer base and achieve broader market acceptance of our edge cloud platform will significantly depend on our ability to expand our marketing and sales operations. We plan to continue expanding our sales force and strategic partners, both domestically and internationally. We also plan to continue to dedicate significant resources to sales, marketing, and demand-generation programs, including various online marketing activities as well as targeted account-based advertising. The effectiveness of our targeted account-based advertising has varied over time and may vary in the future. All of these efforts will require us to invest significant financial and other resources and if they fail to attract additional customers our business will be harmed. We have also used a strategy of offering free trial versions of our platform in order to strengthen our relationship and reputation within the developer community by providing these developers with the ability to familiarize themselves with our platform without first becoming a paying customer. However, most trial accounts do not convert to paid versions of our platform, and to date, only a few users who have converted to paying customers have gone on to generate meaningful revenue. If our other lead generation methods do not result in broader market acceptance of our platform and the users of trial versions of our platform do not become, or are unable to convince their organizations to become, paying customers, we will not realize the intended benefits of this strategy, and our business will be harmed.\nWe believe that there is significant competition for sales personnel, including sales representatives, sales managers, and sales engineers, with the skills and technical knowledge that we require. Our ability to achieve significant revenue growth will depend, in large part, on our success in recruiting, training, and retaining sufficient numbers of sales personnel to support our growth. New hires require significant training and may take significant time before they achieve full productivity. Our recent hires may not become productive as quickly as we expect, if at all, and we may be unable to hire or retain sufficient numbers of qualified individuals in the markets where we do business or plan to do business. In addition, particularly if we continue to grow rapidly, new members of our sales force will have relatively little experience working with us, our platform, and our business model. If we are unable to hire and train sufficient numbers of effective sales personnel, our sales personnel do not reach significant levels of productivity in a timely manner, or our sales personnel are not successful in acquiring new customers or expanding usage by existing customers, our business will be harmed.\nThe markets in which we participate are competitive, and if we do not compete effectively, our business will be harmed.\nThe market for cloud computing platforms, particularly enterprise grade products, is highly fragmented, competitive, and constantly evolving. With the introduction of new technologies and market entrants, we expect that the competitive environment in which we compete will remain intense going forward. Legacy CDNs, such as Akamai, Limelight, EdgeCast (part of Verizon Digital Media), Level3, and Imperva, and small business-focused CDNs, such as Cloudflare, InStart, StackPath, and Section.io, offer products that compete with ours. We also compete with application and API security vendors like Akamai, Cloudflare, Imperva, Amazon Web Services and (Shape), with cloud providers who are starting to offer compute functionality at the edge like Amazon\u2019s CloudFront, AWS Lambda, and Google Cloud Platform, as well as traditional data center and appliance vendors like, Citrix, A10 Networks, Cisco, Imperva, Radware, and Arbor Networks, who offer a range of on-premise solutions for load balancing, WAF, and DDoS. Some of our competitors have made or may make acquisitions or may enter into partnerships or other strategic relationships that may provide more comprehensive offerings than they individually had offered. Such acquisitions or partnerships may help competitors achieve greater economies of scale than us. In addition, new entrants not currently considered to be competitors may enter the market through acquisitions, partnerships, or strategic relationships. We compete on the basis of a number of factors, including:\n\u2022our platform\u2019s functionality, scalability, performance, ease of use, reliability, security availability, and cost effectiveness relative to that of our competitors\u2019 products and services;\n\u2022our global network coverage;\n\u2022our ability to utilize new and proprietary technologies to offer services and features previously not available in the marketplace;\n\u2022our ability to identify new markets, applications, and technologies;\n\u2022our ability to attract and retain customers;\n\u2022our brand, reputation, and trustworthiness;\n\u2022our credibility with developers;\n\u2022the quality of our customer support;\n\u2022our ability to recruit software engineers and sales and marketing personnel;\n\u2022our ability to protect our intellectual property; and\n\u2022our ability to identify opportunities for acquisitions and strategic relationships and successfully execute on them, including our acquisition of Signal Sciences.\nWe face substantial competition from legacy CDNs, small business-focused CDNs, cloud providers, traditional data center, and appliance vendors. In addition, existing and potential customers may not use our platform, or may limit their use, because they pursue a \u201cdo-it-yourself\u201d approach by putting in place equipment, software, and other technology products for content and application delivery within their internal systems; enter into relationships directly with network providers instead of relying on an overlay network like ours; or implement multi-vendor policies to reduce reliance on external providers like us.\nOur competitors vary in size and in the breadth and scope of the products and services offered. Many of our competitors and potential competitors have greater name recognition, longer operating histories, more established customer relationships and installed customer bases, larger marketing budgets, and greater resources than we do. While some of our competitors provide a platform with applications to support one or more use cases, many others provide point-solutions that address a single use case. Other potential competitors not currently offering competitive applications may expand their product offerings, and our current customers may develop their own products or features, to compete with our offerings. Our competitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards, and customer requirements. An existing competitor or new entrant could introduce new technology that reduces demand for our platform. In addition to application and technology competition, we face pricing competition. Some of our competitors offer their applications or services at a lower price, which has resulted in pricing pressures. Some of our larger competitors have the operating flexibility to bundle competing applications and services with other offerings, including offering them at a lower price or for no additional cost to customers as part of a larger sale of other products. For all of these reasons, we may not be able to compete successfully and competition could result in the failure of our platform to achieve or maintain market acceptance, the market for our edge cloud platform may grow more slowly than we anticipate, any of which could harm our business.\nIf we fail to maintain and enhance our brand, our ability to expand our customer base will be impaired and our business, results of operations and financial condition may suffer.\nWe believe that maintaining and enhancing our brand is important to continued market acceptance of our existing and future products, attracting new customers, and retaining existing customers. We also believe that the importance of brand recognition will increase as competition in our market increases. Successfully maintaining and enhancing our brand will depend largely on the effectiveness of our marketing efforts, our ability to provide reliable products that continue to meet the needs of our customers at competitive prices, our ability to maintain our customers\u2019 trust, our ability to continue to develop new functionality and products, and our ability to successfully differentiate our platform from competitive products and services. Additionally, our brand and reputation may be affected if customers do not have a positive experience with our partners\u2019 services. Our brand promotion activities may not generate customer awareness or yield increased revenue, and even if they do, any increased revenue may not offset the expenses we incurred in building our brand. If we fail to successfully promote and maintain our brand, our business may be harmed.\nAcquisitions, strategic investments, partnerships, or alliances could be difficult to identify and integrate, divert the attention of management, disrupt our business, and dilute stockholder value.\nOn October 1, 2020, we completed the acquisition of Signal Sciences. We may in the future seek to acquire or invest in businesses, products, or technologies that we believe could complement or expand our platform, enhance our technical capabilities, or otherwise offer growth opportunities. The pursuit of potential acquisitions may divert the attention of management and cause us to incur various expenses in identifying, investigating, and pursuing acquisitions, whether or not such acquisitions are completed. In addition, we have limited experience in acquiring other businesses and we may not successfully identify desirable acquisition targets or, when we acquire additional businesses, such as Signal Sciences, we may not be able to integrate them effectively following the acquisition. Acquisitions could also result in dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt, which could adversely affect our operating results, may cause unfavorable accounting treatment, may expose us to claims and disputes by third parties, including intellectual property claims, and may not generate sufficient financial returns to offset additional costs and expenses related to the acquisitions. We may also incur significant, and sometimes unanticipated, costs in connection with these acquisitions or in integration with our business. In addition, if an acquired business, such as Signal Sciences, fails to meet our expectations, our business may be harmed.\nFurther, it is possible that there could be a loss of our or any acquired company's key employees and customers, disruption of either company\u2019s or both companies\u2019 ongoing businesses or unexpected issues, higher than expected costs and an overall post-completion process that takes longer than originally anticipated. Specifically, the following issues, among others, must be addressed in combining any company\u2019s, including Signal Sciences\u2019, operations with ours in order to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition so the combined company performs as the parties hope:\n\u2022combining the companies\u2019 corporate functions;\n\u2022combining their business with our business in a manner that permits us to achieve the synergies anticipated to result from the acquisition, the failure of which would result in the anticipated benefits of the acquisition not being realized in the time frame currently anticipated or at all;\n\u2022maintaining existing and new agreements with customers, service providers, and vendors;\n\u2022determining whether and how to address possible differences in corporate cultures, management philosophies and strategies relating to channels, resellers, and partners;\n\u2022integrating the companies\u2019 administrative and information technology infrastructure;\n\u2022developing products and technology that allow value to be unlocked in the future; and\n\u2022evaluating and forecasting the financial impact of the acquisition transaction, including accounting charges.\nIn addition, at times the attention of certain members of our management and resources may be focused on completion of the acquisition and integration planning of the businesses of the two companies and diverted from day to day business operations, which may disrupt our ongoing business and the business of the combined company. For example, certain members of our management team and other personnel have spent significant time on the acquisition and integration of Signal Sciences.\nWe are, and in the future may be, involved in class-action lawsuits and other litigation matters that are expensive and time-consuming. If resolved adversely, lawsuits and other litigation matters could seriously harm our business.\nWe are, and in the future may be, subject to litigation such as putative class action and shareholder derivative lawsuits brought by stockholders. We anticipate that we will continue to be a target for lawsuits in the future. For example, on August 27, 2020 and September 15, 2020, we and certain of our officers were named as defendants in putative securities class action purportedly brought on behalf of holders of our Class A common stock. On December 28, 2020 and February 2, 2021, certain of our officers and directors were named as defendants in shareholder derivative actions. Any litigation to which we are a party may result in an onerous or unfavorable judgment that may not be reversed on appeal, or we may decide to settle lawsuits on similarly unfavorable terms. Any such negative outcome could result in payments of substantial monetary damages and accordingly our business could be seriously harmed. The results of lawsuits and claims cannot be predicted with certainty. Regardless of the final outcome, defending these claims, and associated indemnification obligations, are costly and can impose a significant burden on management and employees, and we may receive unfavorable preliminary, interim, or final rulings in the course of litigation, which could seriously harm our business.\nHealth epidemics, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, have had, and could in the future have, an adverse impact on our business, operations, and the markets and communities in which we, our partners and customers operate.\nOur business and operations could be adversely affected by health epidemics, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, impacting the markets and communities in which we, our partners and customers operate. In December 2019, a disease referred to as COVID-19 was first reported and has spread to many countries worldwide, including the United States, and was declared a pandemic.\nThe ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted, and may continue to adversely impact, many aspects of our business. As certain of our customers or potential customers experience downturns or uncertainty in their own business operations and revenue resulting from the spread of COVID-19, they have and may continue to decrease or delay their technology spending, request pricing concessions or payment extensions, or seek renegotiation of their contracts. In addition, a portion of our revenue is related to usage of our platform in connection with live events, such as sporting events that have been or may be postponed or cancelled. While we initially saw an increase in usage of our platform following the implementation of preventative measures to contain or mitigate the outbreak of COVID-19, we cannot predict how usage levels will continue to be impacted by these preventative measures. There is no assurance that customers will continue to use our platform, or to the same extent, after the COVID-19 pandemic begins to taper or has ended. As a result, it has been difficult to accurately forecast our revenues or financial results, especially given that the near and long term impact of the pandemic remains uncertain. Our results of operations could be materially below our forecasts, which could adversely affect our results of operations, disappoint analysts and investors, or cause our stock price to decline.\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, many state, local, and foreign governments have put in place restrictions in order to control the spread of the disease. Such restrictions, or the perception that such restrictions could occur, have resulted in business closures, work stoppages, slowdowns and delays, work-from-home policies, travel restrictions, and cancellation or postponement of events, among other effects that impacted productivity and disrupted our operations and those of our partners and customers. For example, we experienced delays in the ramping of new traffic due to travel and data center restrictions in\nSouth Asia that delayed network build outs and the timing of customer code freezes, each affected in part due to COVID-19-related issues. In March 2020, we closed all of our offices, suspended non-essential travel, cancelled or postponed Fastly-sponsored in-person events, and we are not permitting in-person employee attendance at industry events or work-related meetings. We have instead shifted to hosting virtual events, including Altitude, our signature Fastly event. We may take further actions that alter our operations as may be required by federal, state, or local authorities, or which we determine are in our best interests. While much of our operations can be performed remotely, certain activities such as expanding and maintaining our network of POPs around the world often require personnel to be on-site, and our ability to carry out these activities have been, and may continue to be negatively impacted if our employees or local data center personnel are not able to travel. In addition, travel restrictions have affected our ability to conduct audits of our data centers and facilities, requiring us to use alternative procedures to the standard on-site visit. Any inability to complete these audits could affect our compliance certifications and cause customers to reduce or cease using our services. In addition, for activities that may be conducted remotely, there is no guarantee that we will be as effective while working remotely because our team is dispersed and many employees and their families have been negatively affected, mentally or physically, by the COVID-19 pandemic. Decreased effectiveness and availability of our team could harm our business. Moreover, our finance organization\u2019s ability to ensure that we comply with the requirements of Section 404 may be impaired in the future, including the ability of our registered public accounting firm to issue an attestation report on management\u2019s assessment of our internal control over financial reporting. Furthermore, we may decide to postpone or cancel planned investments in our business in response to changes in our business as a result of the spread of COVID-19, which may impact our ability to attract and retain customers and our rate of innovation, either of which could harm our business.\nIn addition, while the potential impact and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy and our business in particular may be difficult to assess or predict, the pandemic has resulted in, and may continue to result in, significant disruption of global financial markets, and may reduce our ability to access capital, which could negatively affect our liquidity in the future.\nWe do not yet know the full extent of potential delays or impacts on our business, operations, or the global economy as a whole. While the spread of COVID-19 may eventually be contained or mitigated, there is no guarantee that a future outbreak of this or any other widespread epidemics will not occur, or that the global economy will recover, either of which could harm our business.\nWe may not be able to scale our business quickly enough to meet our customers\u2019 growing needs. If we are not able to grow efficiently, our business could be harmed.\nAs usage of our edge cloud computing platform grows and as the breadth of use cases for our platform expands, we will need to devote additional resources to improving our platform architecture, integrating with third-party applications and maintaining infrastructure performance. In addition, we will need to appropriately scale our processes and procedures that support our growing customer base, including increasing our number of POPs around the world and investments in systems, training, and customer support.\nAny failure of or delay in these efforts could cause impaired system performance and reduced customer satisfaction. These issues could reduce the attractiveness of our platform to customers, resulting in decreased sales to new customers, lower renewal rates by existing customers, the issuance of service credits, or requested refunds, which would hurt our revenue growth and our reputation. Even if we are able to upgrade our systems and expand our staff, any such expansion will be expensive and complex, and require the dedication of significant management time and attention. We could also face inefficiencies or operational failures as a result of our efforts to scale our cloud infrastructure. We cannot be sure that the expansion and improvements to our cloud infrastructure will be effectively implemented on a timely basis, if at all, and such failures would harm our business.\nWe may have insufficient transmission bandwidth and colocation space, which could result in disruptions to our platform and loss of revenue.\nOur operations are dependent in part upon transmission bandwidth provided by third-party telecommunications network providers and access to colocation facilities to house our servers. There can be no assurance that we are adequately prepared for unexpected increases in bandwidth demands by our customers, particularly when customers experience cyber-attacks. The bandwidth we have contracted to purchase may become unavailable for a variety of reasons, including service outages, payment disputes, network providers going out of business, natural disasters, networks imposing traffic limits, or governments adopting regulations that impact network operations. In some regions, bandwidth providers have their own services that compete with us,\nor they may choose to develop their own services that will compete with us. These bandwidth providers may become unwilling to sell us adequate transmission bandwidth at fair market prices, if at all. This risk is heightened where market power is concentrated with one or a few major networks. We also may be unable to move quickly enough to augment capacity to reflect growing traffic or security demands. Failure to put in place the capacity we require could result in a reduction in, or disruption of, service to our customers and ultimately a loss of those customers. Such a failure could result in our inability to acquire new customers demanding capacity not available on our platform.\nSecurity incidents and attacks on our platform could lead to significant costs and disruptions that could harm our business, financial results, and reputation.\nOur business is dependent on providing our customers with fast, efficient, and reliable distribution of applications and content over the internet. We transmit and store our customers\u2019 information, data, and encryption keys as well as our own; customer information and data may include personally identifiable data of and about their end-users. Maintaining the security and availability of our platform, network, and internal IT systems and the security of information we hold on behalf of our customers is a critical issue for us and our customers. Attacks on our customers and our own network are frequent and take a variety of forms, including DDoS attacks, infrastructure attacks, botnets, malicious file attacks, cross-site scripting, credential abuse, ransomware, bugs, viruses, worms, and malicious software programs. Malicious actors can attempt to fraudulently induce employees or suppliers to disclose sensitive information through spamming, phishing, or other tactics. In addition, unauthorized parties may attempt to gain physical access to our facilities in order to infiltrate our information systems. We have in the past been subject to cyber-attacks from third parties, including parties who we believe are sponsored by government actors. Since our customers share our multi-tenant architecture, an attack on any one of our customers could have a negative effect on other customers. These attacks have significantly increased the bandwidth used on our platform and have strained our network. If attacks like these were to occur in the future and if we do not have the systems and processes in place to respond to them, our business could be harmed.\nSecurity incidents, whether as a result of third-party action, employee or customer error, technology impairment or failure, malfeasance or criminal activity, or hostile state actors, could result in unauthorized access to, or loss or unauthorized disclosure of, this information, litigation, indemnity obligations, and other possible liabilities. Incidents involving customer information have in the past resulted in pricing and other concessions, decreased customer usage and terminations by affected customers, and similar security incidents could occur in the future that result in pricing concessions, indemnity obligations, and other possible liabilities related to such unauthorized access, loss or disclosure, including litigation. Further, certain of our insurance policies and the laws of some states may limit or prohibit insurance coverage for punitive or certain other types of damages or liability arising from gross negligence or intentional misconduct of us and our suppliers and we cannot assure you that we are adequately insured against the risks that we face.\nIn recent years, cyber-attacks have increased in size, sophistication, and complexity, increasing exposure for our customers and us. In addition, as we expand our emphasis on selling security-related products, we may become a more attractive target for attacks on our infrastructure intended to destabilize, overwhelm, or shut down our platform. For example, we have had security incidents in the past that have tested the limits of our infrastructure and impacted the performance of our platform. The costs to us to avoid or alleviate cyber or other security problems and vulnerabilities are significant. However, our efforts to address these problems and vulnerabilities may not be successful. Any significant breach of our security measures could:\n\u2022lead to the dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive, personal, or confidential data about us, our employees, or our customers-including personally identifiable information of individuals involved with our customers and their end-users;\n\u2022lead to interruptions or degradation of performance in our platform;\n\u2022threaten our ability to provide our customers with access to our platform;\n\u2022generate negative publicity about us;\n\u2022result in litigation and increased legal liability or fines; or\n\u2022lead to governmental inquiry or oversight.\nThe occurrence of any of these events could harm our business or damage our brand and reputation, lead to customer credits, loss of customers, higher expenses, and possibly impede our present and future success in retaining and attracting new customers. A successful security breach or attack on our infrastructure would be damaging to our reputation and could harm our business.\nSimilar security risks exist with respect to our business partners and the third-party vendors that we rely on for aspects of our information technology support services and administrative functions. As a result, we are subject to the risk that cyber-attacks on our business partners and third-party vendors may adversely affect our business even if an attack or breach does not directly impact our systems. It is also possible that security breaches sustained by our competitors could result in negative publicity for our entire industry that indirectly harms our reputation and diminishes demand for our platform.\nThe nature of our business exposes us to inherent liability risks.\nOur platform and related applications, including our security solutions, are designed to provide rapid protection against web application vulnerabilities and cyber-attacks. However, no security product can provide absolute protection against all vulnerabilities and cyber-attacks. Our platform is subject to cyber-attacks, and the failure of our platform and related applications to adequately protect against these cyber-attacks may allow our customers to be attacked. Any adverse consequences of these attacks, and our failure to meet our customers\u2019 expectations as they relate to such attacks, could harm our business.\nDue to the nature of our applications, we are potentially exposed to greater risks of liability for product or system failures than may be inherent in other businesses. Although substantially all of our customer agreements contain provisions that limit our liability to our customers, these limitations may not be sufficient, and we cannot assure you that these limitations will be enforced or the costs of any litigation related to actual or alleged omissions or failures would not have a material adverse effect on us even if we prevail.\nOur dedication to our values may negatively influence our financial results.\nWe have taken, and may continue to take, actions that we believe are in the best interests of our customers, our employees, and our business, even if those actions do not maximize financial results in the short term. For instance, we do not knowingly allow our platform to be used to deliver content from groups that promote violence or hate, and that conflict with our values like strong ethical principles of integrity and trustworthiness, among others. However, this approach may not result in the benefits that we expect, and our employees or third parties may disagree with our interpretation of our values, or take issue with how we execute on our values, which may result in us becoming a target for negative publicity, increased scrutiny, lawsuits, or network attacks, in which case our business could be harmed.\nOur growth depends in large part on the success of our partner relationships.\nWe maintain a partner ecosystem of companies who build edge applications to integrate with our platform. We are dependent on these partner relationships to amplify our reach and provide our customers with enhanced value from our platform. Our future growth will be increasingly dependent on the success of our partner relationships, including their development of useful applications for our platform. If those partnerships do not provide these benefits or if our partners are unable to serve our customers effectively, we may need to allocate resources internally to provide these services or our customers may not realize the full value of our platform, which could harm our business.\nMoreover, our partners\u2019 business partners may not completely align with our core values and therefore may do business with companies that we otherwise would not. Our association with these companies could damage our brand and reputation and potentially harm our business.\nWe operate in an emerging and evolving market, which may develop more slowly or differently than we expect. If our market does not grow as we expect, or if we cannot expand our services to meet the demands of this market, our revenue may decline, or fail to grow, and we may incur operating losses.\nThe market for edge computing is in an early stage of development. There is considerable uncertainty over the size and rate at which this market will grow, as well as whether our platform will be widely adopted. Our success will depend, to a substantial extent, on the widespread adoption of our platform as an alternative to other solutions, such as legacy CDNs,\nenterprise data centers, central cloud, and small business-focused CDNs. Some organizations may be reluctant or unwilling to use our platform for a number of reasons, including concerns about additional costs, uncertainty regarding the reliability, and security of cloud-based offerings or lack of awareness of the benefits of our platform. Moreover, many organizations have invested substantial personnel and financial resources to integrate traditional on-premise services into their businesses, and therefore may be reluctant or unwilling to migrate to cloud-based services. Our ability to expand sales of our product into new and existing markets depends on several factors, including potential customer awareness of our platform; the timely completion of data centers in those markets; introduction and market acceptance of enhancements to our platform or new applications that we may introduce; our ability to attract, retain and effectively train sales and marketing personnel; our ability to develop relationships with partners; the effectiveness of our marketing programs; the pricing of our services; and the success of our competitors. If we are unsuccessful in developing and marketing our product into new and existing markets, or if organizations do not perceive or value the benefits of our platform, the market for our product might not continue to develop or might develop more slowly than we expect, either of which may harm our business.\nThe estimates of market opportunity and forecasts of market growth may prove to be inaccurate, and any real or perceived inaccuracies may harm our reputation and negatively affect our business. Even if the market in which we compete achieves the forecasted growth, our business could fail to grow at similar rates, if at all.\nMarket opportunity estimates and growth forecasts are subject to significant uncertainty and are based on assumptions and estimates that may not prove to be accurate. The variables that go into the calculation of our market opportunity are subject to change over time, and there is no guarantee that any particular number or percentage of addressable companies or end-users covered by our market opportunity estimates will purchase our products at all or generate any particular level of revenues for us. Even if the market in which we compete meets the size estimates and growth forecasted, our business could fail to grow for a variety of reasons, including reasons outside of our control, such as competition in our industry.\nUsage of our platform accounts for substantially all of our revenue.\nWe expect that we will be substantially dependent on our edge cloud platform to generate revenue for the foreseeable future. As a result, our operating results could suffer due to:\n\u2022any decline in demand for our edge cloud platform;\n\u2022the failure of our edge cloud platform to achieve continued market acceptance;\n\u2022the market for edge cloud computing services not continuing to grow, or growing more slowly than we expect;\n\u2022the introduction of products and technologies that serve as a replacement or substitute for, or represent an improvement over, our edge cloud platform;\n\u2022technological innovations or new standards that our edge cloud platform does not address;\n\u2022sensitivity to current or future prices offered by us or our competitors;\n\u2022our customers\u2019 development of their own edge cloud platform; and\n\u2022our inability to release enhanced versions of our edge cloud platform on a timely basis.\nIf the market for our edge cloud platform grows more slowly than anticipated or if demand for our edge cloud platform does not grow as quickly as anticipated, whether as a result of competition, pricing sensitivities, product obsolescence, technological change, unfavorable economic conditions, uncertain geopolitical environment, budgetary constraints of our customers, or other factors, our business would be harmed.\nWe expect fluctuations in our financial results and key metrics, making it difficult to project future results, and if we fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors, our stock price and the value of your investment could decline.\nOur operating results, as well as our key metrics, including our DBNER, NRR and LTM NRR, have fluctuated in the past and are expected to fluctuate in the future due to a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control. We also present certain key metrics for Signal Sciences separately. As a result, our past results may not be indicative of our future\nperformance and period-to-period comparisons of our operating results and key metrics may not be meaningful. In addition to the other risks described herein, factors that may affect our operating results include the following:\n\u2022fluctuations in demand for or pricing of our platform;\n\u2022our ability to attract new customers;\n\u2022our ability to retain our existing customers;\n\u2022fluctuations in the usage of our platform by our customers, which is directly related to the amount of revenue that we recognize from our customers;\n\u2022fluctuations in customer delays in purchasing decisions in anticipation of new products or product enhancements by us or our competitors;\n\u2022changes in customers\u2019 budgets and in the timing of their budget cycles and purchasing decisions;\n\u2022the timing of customer payments and any difficulty in collecting accounts receivable from customers;\n\u2022timing of new functionality of our existing platform;\n\u2022our ability to control costs, including our operating expenses;\n\u2022the amount and timing of payment for operating expenses, particularly research and development and sales and marketing expenses, including commissions;\n\u2022the amount and timing of costs associated with recruiting, training, and integrating new employees;\n\u2022the effects of acquisitions or other strategic transactions;\n\u2022expenses in connection with acquisitions or other strategic transactions;\n\u2022our ability to successfully deploy POPs in new regions;\n\u2022general economic conditions, both domestically and internationally, as well as economic conditions specifically affecting industries in which our customers participate;\n\u2022the ability to maintain our partnerships;\n\u2022the impact of new accounting pronouncements;\n\u2022changes in the competitive dynamics of our market, including consolidation among competitors or customers;\n\u2022significant security breaches of, technical difficulties with, or interruptions to, the delivery and use of our platform; and\n\u2022awareness of our brand and our reputation in our target markets.\nAdditionally, certain large scale events, such as major elections and sporting events, can significantly impact usage of our platform, which could cause fluctuations in our results of operations. While increased usage of our platform during these events could result in increased revenue, these seasonal and one-time events could also impact the performance of our platform during those events and lead to a sub-optimal experience for some customers. Such annual and one-time events may cause fluctuations in our results of operations as they would impact both our revenue and our operating expenses.\nAny of the foregoing and other factors may cause our results of operations to vary significantly. If our quarterly results of operations fall below the expectations of investors and securities analysts who follow our stock, the price of our Class A common stock could decline substantially, and our business could be harmed.\nOur pricing models subject us to various challenges that could make it difficult for us to derive sufficient value from our customers, and we do not have sufficient history with our pricing models to accurately predict the optimal pricing necessary to attract new customers and retain existing customers.\nWe generally charge our customers for their usage of our platform based on the combined total usage, as well as the features and functionality enabled. Additionally, once our product is purchased, customers can also buy a combination of our add-on products. We do not know whether our current or potential customers or the market in general will continue to accept this pricing model going forward and, if it fails to gain acceptance, our business could be harmed. We also generally purchase bandwidth from internet service providers and server colocation space from third parties based on expected usage from our customers. Moreover, if our customers use our platform in a manner that is inconsistent with how we have purchased bandwidth, servers, and colocation space, our business could be harmed.\nWe have limited experience with respect to determining the optimal prices for our products and, as a result, we have in the past changed our pricing model and expect that we may need to do so in the future. As the market for our products matures, or as new competitors introduce new products or services that compete with ours, we may be unable to attract new customers at the same price or based on the same pricing models as we have used historically. Pricing decisions may also impact the mix of adoption among our customers and negatively impact our overall revenue. Moreover, larger organizations may demand substantial price concessions. As a result, in the future we may be required to reduce our prices or develop new pricing models, which could adversely affect our revenue, gross margin, profitability, financial position, and cash flow.\nOur sales and onboarding cycles with customers can be long and unpredictable, and our sales and onboarding efforts require considerable time and expense.\nThe timing of our sales with our enterprise customers and related revenue recognition is difficult to predict because of the length and unpredictability of the sales cycle for these customers. In addition, for our enterprise customers, the lengthy sales cycle for the evaluation and implementation of our products may also cause us to experience a delay between expenses for such sales efforts and the generation of corresponding revenue. The length of our sales cycle for these customers, from initial evaluation to payment, can range from several months to well over a year and can vary substantially from customer to customer. Similarly, the onboarding and ramping process with new enterprise customers, or with existing customers that are moving additional traffic onto our platform, can take several months. As the purchase of our products can be dependent upon customer initiatives, our sales cycle can extend to even longer periods of time. Customers often view a switch to our platform as a strategic decision requiring significant investment and, as a result, frequently require considerable time to evaluate, test, and qualify our product offering prior to entering into or expanding a contract commitment. During the sales cycle, we expend significant time and money on sales and marketing and contract negotiation activities, which may not result in a completed sale. Additional factors that may influence the length and variability of our sales cycle include:\n\u2022the effectiveness of our sales force, particularly new salespeople, as we increase the size of our sales force and train our new salespeople to sell to enterprise customers;\n\u2022the discretionary nature of customers\u2019 purchasing decisions and budget cycles;\n\u2022customers\u2019 procurement processes, including their evaluation of competing products;\n\u2022economic conditions and other factors affecting customer budgets;\n\u2022the regulatory environment in which our customers operate;\n\u2022integration complexity for a customer deployment;\n\u2022the customer\u2019s familiarity with edge cloud computing platforms;\n\u2022evolving customer demands;\n\u2022selling new products to enterprise customers; and\n\u2022competitive conditions.\nGiven these factors, it is difficult to predict whether and when a customer will switch to our platform.\nGiven that it can take several months for our customers to ramp up their usage of our platform, during that time, we may not be able to generate enough revenue from a particular customer or that customer may not increase their usage in a meaningful way. Moreover, because the switching costs are fairly low, our customers are able to switch from our platform to alternative services relatively easily. As a result, actual usage could be materially above or below our forecasts, which could adversely affect our results of operations, disappoint analysts and investors, or cause our stock price to decline.\nIf our platform does not achieve sufficient market acceptance, our financial results and competitive position will suffer.\nTo meet our customers\u2019 rapidly evolving demands, we invest substantial resources in research and development of enhanced products to incorporate additional functionality or expand the use cases that our platform addresses. Maintaining adequate research and development resources, such as the appropriate personnel and development technology, to meet the demands of the market is essential. If we are unable to develop products internally due to inadequate or ineffective research and development resources, we may not be able to address our customers\u2019 needs on a timely basis or at all. In addition, if we seek to supplement our research and development capabilities or the breadth of our products through acquisitions, such acquisitions could be expensive and we may not successfully integrate acquired technologies or businesses into our business. When we develop or acquire new or enhanced products, we typically incur expenses and expend resources upfront to develop, market, promote, and sell the new offering. Therefore, when we develop or acquire and introduce new or enhanced products, they must achieve high levels of market acceptance in order to justify the amount of our investment in developing or acquiring and bringing them to market. Our new products or enhancements and changes to our existing products could fail to attain sufficient market acceptance for many reasons, including:\n\u2022failure to predict market demand accurately in terms of functionality and a failure to supply products that meet this demand in a timely fashion;\n\u2022defects, errors, or failures;\n\u2022negative publicity about our platform\u2019s performance or effectiveness;\n\u2022changes in the legal or regulatory requirements, or increased legal or regulatory scrutiny, adversely affecting our platform;\n\u2022emergence of a competitor that achieves market acceptance before we do;\n\u2022delays in releasing enhancements to our platform to the market; and\n\u2022introduction or anticipated introduction of competing products by our competitors.\nIf our platform and any future enhancements do not achieve adequate acceptance in the market, or if products and technologies developed by others achieve greater acceptance in the market, our business could be harmed.\nBeyond overall acceptance of our platform by our customers, it is important that we maintain and grow acceptance of our platform among the developers that work for our customers. We rely on developers to choose our platform over other options they may have, and to continue to use and promote our platform as they move between companies. These developers often make design decisions and influence the product and vendor processes within our customers. If we fail to gain or maintain their acceptance of our platform, our business would be harmed.\nWe rely on third-party hosting providers that may be difficult to replace.\nWe rely on third-party hosting services such as Amazon Web Services (\"AWS\"), Google, Softlayer (acquired by IBM), and other cloud providers that facilitate the offering of our platform. Some of these third-party hosting services offer competing products to ours and therefore may not continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. These providers may be unwilling to do business with us if they view our platform as a threat. Any loss of the right to use any of the hosting providers could impair our ability to offer our platform until we are able to obtain alternative hosting providers.\nIf we do not or cannot maintain the compatibility of our platform with third-party applications that our customers use in their businesses, our business will be harmed.\nBecause our customers choose to integrate our products with certain capabilities provided by third-party providers, the functionality and popularity of our platform depends, in part, on our ability to integrate our platform and applications with third-party applications. These third parties may change the features of their technologies, restrict our access to their applications, or alter the terms governing use of their applications in a manner that is adverse to our business. Such changes could functionally limit or prevent our ability to use these third-party technologies in conjunction with our platform, which would negatively affect adoption of our platform and harm our business. If we fail to integrate our platform with new third-party applications that our customers use, we may not be able to offer the functionality that our customers need, which would harm our business.\nWe provide service level commitments under our customer agreements. If we fail to meet these contractual commitments, we could be obligated to provide credits for future service, or face contract termination with refunds of prepaid amounts, which could harm our business.\nMost of our customer agreements contain service level commitments. If we are unable to meet the stated service level commitments, including failure to meet the uptime and delivery requirements under our customer agreements, we have in the past and may in the future be contractually obligated to provide the affected customers with service credits which could significantly affect our revenues in the periods in which the uptime and/or delivery failure occurs and the credits are applied. For example, as a result of a platform interruption in January 2021, certain of our affected customers with whom we have service level commitments are entitled to receive service credits. We could also face customer terminations with refunds of prepaid amounts, which could significantly affect both our current and future revenues. Any service level failures could harm our business.\nIf we fail to offer high quality support, our business may be harmed.\nOur customers rely on our support team to assist them in deploying our products effectively and resolve technical and operational issues. High-quality support is important for the renewal and expansion of our agreements with existing customers. The importance of maintaining high quality support will increase as we expand our business and pursue new customers. If we do not help our customers quickly resolve issues and provide effective ongoing support, our ability to maintain and expand our relationships with existing and new customers could suffer and our business could be harmed. Further, increased demand for customer support, without corresponding revenue, could increase costs and adversely affect our business. In addition, as we continue to grow our operations and expand internationally, we will need to be able to provide efficient customer support that meets our customers\u2019 needs globally at scale and our customer support team will face additional challenges, including those associated with delivering support and documentation in multiple languages. Our failure to do so could harm our business.\nRisks Related to Employees and Managing Our Growth\nWe rely on the performance of highly skilled personnel, including our management and other key employees, and the loss of one or more of such personnel, or of a significant number of our team members, could harm our business.\nWe believe our success has depended, and continues to depend, on the efforts and talents of senior management and key personnel, including Artur Bergman, our Chief Architect and Executive Chairman and Joshua Bixby, our Chief Executive Officer. From time to time, there may be changes in our management team resulting from the hiring or departure of executives and key employees, or the transition of executives within our business, such as with respect to Mr. Bergman and Mr. Bixby, which could disrupt our business. We also are dependent on the continued service of our existing software engineers because of the complexity of our platform. Our senior management and key employees are employed on an at-will basis. We cannot ensure that we will be able to retain the services of any member of our senior management or other key employees or that we would be able to timely replace members of our senior management or other key employees should any of them depart. The loss of one or more of our senior management or other key employees could harm our business.\nThe failure to attract and retain additional qualified personnel could prevent us from executing our business strategy.\nTo execute our business strategy, we must attract and retain highly qualified personnel. Competition for executive officers, software developers, sales personnel, and other key employees in our industry is intense. In particular, we compete with many other companies for software developers with high levels of experience in designing, developing, and managing cloud-based software, as well as for skilled sales and operations professionals. In addition, we believe that the success of our\nbusiness and corporate culture depends on employing people with a variety of backgrounds and experiences, and the competition for such diverse personnel is significant. The market for such talented personnel is competitive. Many of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater resources than we do and can frequently offer such personnel substantially greater compensation than we can offer. If we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel, our business would be harmed.\nOur recent rapid growth may not be indicative of our future growth and, if we continue to grow rapidly, we may not be able to manage our growth effectively.\nWe have experienced substantial growth in our business since inception. For example, our headcount has grown from 630 employees as of December 31, 2019 to 939 employees as of December 31, 2020, and grew by approximately 149 employees on October 1, 2020 in connection with our acquisition of Signal Sciences. In addition, we are rapidly expanding, and expect to continue to expand in the future, our international operations. We have also experienced significant growth in the number of customers, usage, and amount of data delivered across our platform. This growth has placed and may continue to place significant demands on our corporate culture, operational infrastructure, and management. We may not continue to grow as rapidly in the future. Overall growth of our revenue depends on a number of factors, including our ability to:\n\u2022address new and developing markets, such as large enterprise customers outside the United States;\n\u2022control expenses;\n\u2022recruit, hire, train, and manage additional qualified engineers;\n\u2022recruit, hire, train, and manage additional sales and marketing personnel;\n\u2022maintain our corporate culture;\n\u2022expand our international operations;\n\u2022implement and improve our administrative, financial and operational systems, procedures, and controls;\n\u2022attract new customers and increase our existing customers\u2019 usage on our platform;\n\u2022expand the functionality and use cases for the products we offer on our platform;\n\u2022provide our customers with customer support that meets their needs; and\n\u2022successfully identify and acquire or invest in businesses, products, or technologies that we believe could complement or expand our products, such as our acquisition of Signal Sciences.\nWe may not successfully accomplish any of the above objectives. We expect to continue to expend substantial financial and other resources on:\n\u2022sales and marketing, including a significant expansion of our sales organization;\n\u2022our infrastructure, including POP deployments, systems architecture, management tools, scalability, availability, performance, and security, as well as disaster recovery measures;\n\u2022product development, including investments in our product development team and the development of new products and new functionality for our existing products;\n\u2022acquisitions or strategic investments;\n\u2022international expansion; and\n\u2022general administration, including increased legal and accounting expenses associated with being a public company.\nIf we cannot maintain our company culture as we grow, our success and our business may be harmed.\nWe believe our culture has been a key contributor to our success to date and that the critical nature of the products that we provide promotes a sense of greater purpose and fulfillment in our employees. We have invested in building a strong corporate culture and believe it is one of our most important and sustainable sources of competitive advantage. Any failure to preserve our culture could negatively affect our ability to recruit and retain personnel and to effectively focus on and pursue our corporate objectives. As we grow and develop the systems and processes associated with being a public company, we may find it difficult to maintain these important aspects of our culture. In addition, while we have historically benefited from having a dispersed workforce, as we grow and our resources become more globally dispersed and our organizational management structures become more complex, we may find it increasingly difficult to maintain these beneficial aspects of our corporate culture. If we fail to maintain our company culture, our business may be harmed.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Position and Need for Additional Capital\nBecause substantially all of our revenue from usage on our platform is recognized over the term of the relevant contract, downturns or upturns in sales contracts are not immediately reflected in full in our operating results.\nRevenue for usage on our platform accounts for substantially all of our total revenue. We recognize revenue over the term of each of our customer contracts, which are typically one year in length but may be longer in length. As a result, much of our revenue is generated from contracts entered into during previous periods. Consequently, a decline in new or renewed contracts in any one quarter may not significantly reduce our revenue for that quarter but could negatively affect our revenue in future quarters. Our revenue recognition model also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue through new contracts in any period, as revenue from customers is recognized over the applicable term of their contracts.\nSeasonality may cause fluctuations in our sales and operating results.\nWe have experienced, and expect to continue to experience in the future, seasonality in our business, and our operating results and financial condition may be affected by such trends in the future. We generally experience seasonal fluctuations in demand for our platform. For example, we have some customers who increase their usage and requests when they need more capacity during busy periods, especially in the fourth quarter of the year, and then subsequently scale back. Since we have built our network to handle seasonal capacity fluctuations, we may not be able to reduce our capacity in a timely manner, and as such sustain more costs. We believe that the seasonal trends that we have experienced in the past may continue for the foreseeable future, particularly as we expand our sales to larger enterprises. To the extent we experience this seasonality, it may cause fluctuations in our operating results and financial metrics, and make forecasting our future operating results and financial metrics difficult. Additionally, we do not have sufficient experience in selling certain of our products to determine if demand for these products are or will be subject to material seasonality.\nOur current operations are international in scope and we plan on further geographic expansion, creating a variety of operational challenges.\nA component of our growth strategy involves the further expansion of our operations and customer base internationally. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the percentage of revenue generated from customers outside the United States was 32% of our total revenue. We currently have offices in Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States, as well as employees located throughout the world. We are continuing to adapt to and develop strategies to address international markets but there is no guarantee that such efforts will have the desired effect. As of December 31, 2020, approximately 17% of our full-time employees were located outside of the United States. We expect that our international activities will continue to grow over the foreseeable future as we continue to pursue opportunities in existing and new international markets, which will require significant management attention and financial resources. In connection with such expansion, we may face difficulties including costs associated with, varying seasonality patterns, potential adverse movement of currency exchange rates, longer payment cycle difficulties in collecting accounts receivable in some countries, tariffs and trade barriers, a variety of regulatory or contractual limitations on our ability to operate, adverse tax events, reduced protection of intellectual property rights in some countries, and a geographically and culturally diverse workforce and customer base. Failure to overcome any of these difficulties could harm our business.\nOur current and future international business and operations involve a variety of risks, including:\n\u2022changes in a specific country\u2019s or region\u2019s political or economic conditions;\n\u2022greater difficulty collecting accounts receivable and longer payment cycles;\n\u2022potential or unexpected changes in trade relations, regulations, or laws;\n\u2022more stringent regulations relating to privacy and data security and the unauthorized use of, or access to, commercial and personal information, particularly in Europe;\n\u2022differing labor regulations, especially in Europe and Japan, where labor laws are generally more advantageous to employees as compared to the United States, including deemed hourly wage and overtime regulations in these locations;\n\u2022challenges inherent in efficiently managing an increased number of employees over large geographic distances, including the need to implement appropriate systems, policies, benefits, and compliance programs;\n\u2022challenges to our corporate culture resulting from a dispersed workforce;\n\u2022difficulties in managing a business in new markets with diverse cultures, languages, customs, legal systems, alternative dispute systems, and regulatory systems;\n\u2022increased travel, real estate, infrastructure, and legal compliance costs associated with international operations;\n\u2022currency exchange rate fluctuations and the resulting effect on our revenue and expenses, and the cost and risk of entering into hedging transactions if we chose to do so in the future;\n\u2022challenges related to providing support and developing products in foreign languages;\n\u2022limitations on our ability to reinvest earnings from operations in one country to fund the capital needs of our operations in other countries;\n\u2022laws and business practices favoring local competitors or general market preferences for local vendors;\n\u2022potential tariffs and trade barriers;\n\u2022limited or insufficient intellectual property protection or difficulties enforcing our intellectual property;\n\u2022political instability or terrorist activities;\n\u2022exposure to liabilities under anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws, and similar laws and regulations in other jurisdictions; and\n\u2022adverse tax burdens and foreign exchange controls that could make it difficult to repatriate earnings and cash.\nOur limited experience in operating our business internationally increases the risk that any potential future expansion efforts that we may undertake will not be successful. If we invest substantial time and resources to further expand our international operations and are unable to do so successfully and in a timely manner, our business may be harmed.\nOur business is dependent upon the timely supply of certain parts and components manufactured in China to construct our servers. To the extent that our suppliers are impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, it likely will reduce the availability, or result in delays, of parts and components to us, which in turn could interrupt our ability to complete the construction of our servers to meet the usage needs of our customers.\nOur ability to timely raise capital in the future may be limited, or may be unavailable on acceptable terms, if at all, and our failure to raise capital when needed could harm our business, and debt or equity issued to raise additional capital may reduce the value of our Class A common stock.\nWe have funded our operations since inception primarily through payments received from our customers, sales of equity securities, and borrowings under our credit facilities. We cannot be certain when or if our operations will generate sufficient\ncash to fully fund our ongoing operations or the growth of our business. We intend to continue to make investments to support our business and may require additional funds. Our future capital requirements may vary materially from those currently planned and will depend on many factors, including our growth rate, market acceptance of our platform, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, strategic transactions, as well as overall economic conditions. For example, on October 1, 2020 we\nacquired Signal Sciences for an aggregate purchase price of $759.4 million, consisting of approximately $223.0 million in cash and 6,367,709 shares of our Class A common stock, including 896,499 shares which are restricted as they are subject to revesting conditions. The aggregate purchase price reflects the value of the net shares issued, which excludes the above mentioned shares that are restricted.\nWe may need to engage in equity or debt financings to secure additional funds. Additional financing may not be available on favorable terms, if at all and any additional financing will need to be in compliance with the terms of our Senior Secured Credit Facilities Credit Agreement (\"Credit Agreement\"), dated as of February 16, 2021, with the lenders party thereto and Silicon Valley Bank (\"SVB\") as a lender and as the administrative agent, issuing bank and swingline lender. If adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms, we may be unable to invest in future growth opportunities, which could harm our business, operating results, and financial condition. Furthermore, if we issue additional equity securities, stockholders will experience dilution, and the new equity securities could have rights senior to those of our common stock. Any debt financing we secure could involve additional restrictive covenants relating to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions. If we were to violate such restrictive covenants, we could incur penalties, increased expenses and an acceleration of the payment terms of our outstanding debt, which could in turn harm our business. Because our decision to issue securities in future offerings will depend on numerous considerations, including factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing, or nature of any future issuances of debt or equity securities. As a result, our stockholders bear the risk of future issuances of debt or equity securities reducing the value of our Class A common stock and diluting their interests.\nIf our estimates or judgments relating to our critical accounting policies prove to be incorrect, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, as provided in the section titled \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Policies.\u201d The results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets, liabilities, and equity and the amount of revenue and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Significant assumptions and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements include those related to allowance for doubtful accounts, fair value of financial instruments, valuation of stock-based compensation, valuation of warrant liabilities, and the valuation allowance for deferred income taxes. Our results of operations may be adversely affected if our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions, which could cause our results of operations to fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in the trading price of our Class A common stock.\nCurrent and future indebtedness could restrict our operations, particularly our ability to respond to changes in our business or to take specified actions.\nOur Credit Agreement with SVB contains, and any future indebtedness would likely contain, a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us, including restrictions on our ability to incur additional indebtedness, grant liens, pay dividends and make distributions, transfer property, make investments, and take other actions that may otherwise be in our best interests. In addition, our Credit Agreement contains a financial covenant that requires us to maintain a consolidated adjusted quick ratio of at least 1:25 to 1:00 tested on a quarterly basis as well as a springing revenue growth covenant for certain periods if our consolidated adjusted quick ratio falls below 1.75 to 1:00 on the last day of any fiscal quarter. Our ability to meet these financial covenants can be affected by events beyond our control, and we may not be able to continue to meet those covenants. In addition, a breach of a covenant under our Credit Agreement or any other current or future credit facility of ours may result cross-default under a separate credit facility. If we seek to enter into one or more additional credit facilities in the future we may not be able to obtain debt financing on terms that are favorable to us, if at all. Holders of our existing debt have, and holders of any future debt we may incur would have, rights senior to holders of common stock to make claims on our assets. In addition, the terms of our existing debt do, and the terms of any future debt could, restrict our operations, including our ability to pay dividends on our common stock. If we are unable to obtain adequate\nfinancing or financing on terms that are satisfactory to us when we require it, our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges could be significantly impaired, and our business may be harmed.\nWe have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, and if we are unable to remediate and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in the future, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, and the market price of our Class A common stock may be seriously harmed.\nAs a public company, we are required to maintain internal control over financial reporting and to report any material weaknesses in those internal controls. For example, we are required to perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting to allow management to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act 9 (\"Section 404\"). Our independent registered public accounting firm also needs to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. We designed, implemented, and tested internal control over financial reporting required to comply with this obligation. That process is time-consuming, costly, and complicated.\nWe and our independent registered public accounting firm identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, which remains partially unremediated for the year ended December 31, 2020. The material weakness related to the lack of sufficient qualified accounting resources, including those with the appropriate level of technical accounting knowledge, to timely identify and assess accounting implications of complex transactions which resulted in the incorrect application of generally accepted accounting principles. We reported this material weakness in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019.\nThe process of implementing an effective financial reporting system is a continuous effort that requires us to anticipate and react to changes in our business and the economic and regulatory environments and to expand significant resources to maintain a financial reporting system that is adequate to satisfy our reporting obligations. We continue to evaluate and take actions to improve our internal control over financial reporting, which includes but is not limited to hiring additional resources, to address control deficiencies.\nIf we fail to remediate our existing material weakness or identify future material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, or if we are unable to comply with the requirements of Section 404 or assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an unqualified opinion or expresses a qualified or adverse opinion about the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the market price of our Class A common stock could be negatively affected. In addition, we could become subject to investigations by the stock exchange on which our securities are listed, the SEC, and other regulatory authorities, which could require additional financial and management resources.\nWe may not be able to successfully manage the growth of our business if we are unable to improve our internal systems, processes and controls.\nWe need to continue to improve our internal systems, processes, and controls to effectively manage our operations and growth. We may not be able to successfully implement and scale improvements to our systems and processes in a timely or efficient manner or in a manner that does not negatively affect our operating results. For example, we may not be able to effectively monitor certain extraordinary contract requirements or provisions that are individually negotiated by our sales force as the number of transactions continues to grow. In addition, our systems and processes may not prevent or detect all errors, omissions, or fraud. We may experience difficulties in managing improvements to our systems, processes, and controls or in connection with third-party software, which could impair our ability to offer our platform to our customers in a timely manner, causing us to lose customers, limit us to smaller deployments of our products, or increase our technical support costs.\nOur financial results may be adversely affected by changes in accounting principles applicable to us.\nGenerally accepted accounting principles in the United States (\"U.S. GAAP\") are subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\"), the SEC and other various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles. A change in these principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported financial results for periods prior to and subsequent to such change, and could affect the reporting of transactions completed before the announcement of a change.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued new guidance, Accounting Standard Update No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which supersedes nearly all existing lease disclosures under U.S. GAAP. As we ceased to be an emerging growth company as of December 31, 2020, we adopted the standard on December 31, 2020, presenting the initial application of ASC 842 beginning on January 1, 2020, in our annual financial statements included in our Form 10-K for year ended December 31, 2020. Its impact is reflected in our consolidated financial statements, which includes several newly required disclosures. Market practices with respect to these new disclosures are continuously evolving, and securities analysts and investors may not fully understand the implications of our disclosures or how or why they may differ from similar disclosures by other companies. Any additional new accounting standards could have a significant effect on our reported results. If our reported results fall below analyst or investor expectations, our stock price could decline.\nRisks Related to Laws, Regulations, and the Global Economy\nFailure to comply with U.S. and foreign governmental laws and regulations could harm our business.\nOur business is subject to regulation by various federal, state, local, and foreign governments. If we do not comply with these laws or regulations or if we become liable under these laws or regulations due to the failure of our customers to comply with these laws, we could face direct liability or delivery of content by our platform may be blocked by certain governments. In certain jurisdictions, these regulatory requirements may be more stringent than those in the United States. For example, in June 2020, China passed a national security law for Hong Kong that imposes criminal liability for the violation of content regulations, it is currently not clear how broadly such legislation will be interpreted or applied in relation to our customers or our business, and additional developments in our understanding of the application of this law could cause us to remove our POP from Hong Kong. Noncompliance with applicable regulations or requirements could subject us to investigations, sanctions, enforcement actions, disgorgement of profits, fines, damages, civil and criminal penalties, injunctions, or other collateral consequences. If any governmental sanctions are imposed, or if we do not prevail in any possible civil or criminal litigation, our business could be harmed. In addition, responding to any action will likely result in a significant diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources and an increase in professional fees. Enforcement actions and sanctions could harm our business.\nIf the U.S. government prohibits our current or potential customers from doing business with us, whether through policy, regulations or laws, we could face direct liability or our delivery of content by our platform may be blocked. For example, in the current environment of economic trade negotiations and tensions between the Chinese and U.S. governments, the U.S. government has expressed concerns about the ability of companies operating in China to do business in the U.S. or with U.S. companies. As a result, we could lose the ability to contract with current or potential customers or usage of our platform may decrease by affected customers, including our largest customer during the year ended December 31, 2020, which could harm our business and reputation. For example, our largest customer during the year ended December 31, 2020 has strong business ties to China and significantly reduced its usage of our platform in the later part of 2020. We believe this was in response to various actions taken by the U.S. and other governments against them. Even in the absence of new restrictions or trade actions imposed by the U.S. or other governments, our customers that operate in China, target China as a market, or that have strong business ties to China, may take actions to reduce dependence on our platform, which could harm our business.\nWe are subject to governmental regulation and other legal obligations, particularly those related to privacy, data protection, and information security, and our actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations could harm our business, by resulting in litigation, fines, penalties, or adverse publicity and reputational damage that may negatively affect the value of our business and decrease the price of our common stock. Compliance with such laws could also result in additional costs and liabilities to us or inhibit sales of our products.\nWe receive, store, and process personal information and other data from and about actual and prospective customers and users, in addition to our employees and service providers. In addition, our customers use our platform to collect personally identifiable information, personal health information, and personal financial information from their end-users. Our handling of data is subject to a variety of laws and regulations, including regulation by various government agencies, such as the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (\"FTC\"), and various state, local, and foreign agencies. Our data handling also is subject to contractual obligations and industry standards.\nThe U.S. federal and various state and foreign governments have adopted or proposed limitations on the collection, distribution, use, and storage of data relating to individuals and businesses, including the use of contact information and other data for marketing, advertising, and other communications with individuals and businesses. In the United States, various laws and regulations apply to the collection, processing, disclosure, and security of certain types of data, including the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of\n1996, the Gramm Leach Bliley Act, and state laws relating to privacy and data security, including the California Consumer Privacy Act (the \u201cCCPA\u201d), which became effective on January 1, 2020. The CCPA requires companies that process information on California residents to make new disclosures to consumers about their data collection, use and sharing practices, allows consumers to opt out of certain data sharing with third parties and provides a new cause of action for data breaches. It remains unclear how the CCPA will be interpreted and the extent of its impact on our business. Additionally, the FTC and many state attorneys general are interpreting federal and state consumer protection laws as imposing standards for the online collection, use, dissemination, and security of data. The laws and regulations relating to privacy and data security are evolving, can be subject to significant change and may result in ever-increasing regulatory and public scrutiny and escalating levels of enforcement and sanctions.\nIn addition, several foreign countries and governmental bodies, including the EU, have laws and regulations dealing with the handling and processing of personal information obtained from their residents, which in certain cases are more restrictive than those in the United States. Laws and regulations in these jurisdictions apply broadly to the collection, use, storage, disclosure, and security of various types of data, including data that identifies or may be used to identify an individual, such as names, email addresses, and in some jurisdictions, Internet Protocol (\"IP\") addresses. Such laws and regulations may be modified or subject to new or different interpretations, and new laws and regulations may be enacted in the future.\nWithin the EU, the General Data Protection Regulation (\"GDPR\") significantly increases the level of sanctions for non-compliance from those in existing EU data protection law and imposes direct obligations on data processors in addition to data controllers and may require us to make further changes to our policies and procedures in the future, beyond what we have already done. EU data protection authorities will have the power to impose administrative fines for violations of the GDPR of up to a maximum of \u20ac20 million or 4% of the data controller\u2019s or data processor\u2019s total worldwide global revenue for the preceding fiscal year, whichever is higher, and violations of the GDPR may also lead to damages claims by data controllers and data subjects. Such penalties are in addition to any civil litigation claims by data controllers, customers, and data subjects. Since we act as a data processor for our customers, we are taking steps to cause our processes to be compliant with applicable portions of the GDPR, but we cannot assure you that such steps will be effective. In particular, although the UK enacted a Data Protection Act in May 2018 that is designed to be consistent with the GDPR, uncertainty remains regarding how data transfers to and from the UK will be regulated.\nThe scope and interpretation of the laws that are or may be applicable to us are often uncertain and may be conflicting, particularly laws outside the United States, as a result of the rapidly evolving regulatory framework for privacy issues worldwide. For example, laws relating to the liability of providers of online services for activities of their users and other third parties are currently being tested by a number of claims, including actions based on invasion of privacy and other torts, unfair competition, copyright and trademark infringement, and other theories based on the nature and content of the materials searched, the ads posted, or the content provided by users. We are also following developments in 2020 regarding the frameworks that address the transfer of personal information outside of the EU, including the Privacy Shield framework and the standard contractual clauses. Specifically, in July 2020, the Court of Justice of the EU invalidated the EU-US Privacy Shield framework. If local authorities block transfers of data between the EU and the US, for example, by stating that the Standard Contractual Clauses are not an adequate data transfer mechanism to the US under the GDPR, our vendor and customer relationships may be impacted. We have encountered and may continue to encounter heightened concerns relating to privacy from customers and potential customers conducting business in Europe since the invalidation of the US-EU Privacy Shield framework. Specifically, we have received more requests relating to EU privacy requirements, impacting the sales negotiation process, and have also had potential customers decline to do business with us due to privacy concerns related to updated interpretations of the laws applicable to transfers of personal data to the United States. As a result of the laws that are or may be applicable to us, and due to the sensitive nature of the information we collect, we have implemented policies and procedures to preserve and protect our data and our customers\u2019 data against loss, misuse, corruption, misappropriation caused by systems failures, unauthorized access, or misuse. If our policies, procedures, or measures relating to privacy, data protection, marketing, or customer communications fail to comply with laws, regulations, policies, legal obligations, or industry standards, we may be subject to governmental enforcement actions, litigation, regulatory investigations, fines, penalties, and negative publicity and could cause our application providers, customers, and partners to lose trust in us, and have an adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nIn addition to government regulation, privacy advocates, and industry groups may propose new and different self-regulatory standards that may apply to us. Because the interpretation and application of privacy and data protection laws, regulations, rules, and other standards are still uncertain, it is possible that these laws, rules, regulations, and other actual or alleged legal obligations, such as contractual or self-regulatory obligations, may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our existing data management practices or the functionality of our platform. If so, in addition to the possibility\nof fines, lawsuits, and other claims, we could be required to fundamentally change our business activities and practices or modify our software, which could have an adverse effect on our business.\nAny failure or perceived failure by us to comply with laws, regulations, policies, legal, or contractual obligations, industry standards, or regulatory guidance relating to privacy or data security, may result in governmental investigations and enforcement actions (including, for example, a ban by EU Supervisory Authorities on the processing of EU personal data under the GDPR), litigation, fines and penalties, or adverse publicity, and could cause our customers and partners to lose trust in us, which could have an adverse effect on our reputation and business. Our obligation to assist our customers in their compliance with laws, regulations, and policies, like data processing and data protection requirements under the GDPR may also result in government enforcement actions litigation, fines and penalties, or adverse publicity. We expect that there will continue to be new proposed laws, regulations, and industry standards relating to privacy, data protection, marketing, consumer communications, and information security in the United States, the EU, and other jurisdictions, and we cannot determine the impact such future laws, regulations, and standards may have on our business. Future laws, regulations, standards, and other obligations or any changed interpretation of existing laws or regulations could impair our ability to develop and market new functionality and maintain and grow our customer base and increase revenue. Future restrictions on the collection, use, sharing, or disclosure of data or additional requirements for express or implied consent of our customers, partners, or end-users for the use and disclosure of such information could require us to incur additional costs or modify our platform, possibly in a material manner, and could limit our ability to develop new functionality.\nIf we are not able to comply with these laws or regulations or if we become liable under these laws or regulations, we could be directly harmed, and we may be forced to implement new measures to reduce our exposure to this liability. This may require us to expend substantial resources or to discontinue certain products, which would negatively affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, the increased attention focused upon liability issues as a result of lawsuits and legislative proposals could harm our reputation or otherwise adversely affect the growth of our business. Furthermore, any costs incurred as a result of this potential liability could harm our operating results.\nOur sales to highly regulated organizations and government entities are subject to a number of challenges and risks.\nWe sell to customers in highly regulated industries such as financial services, insurance, and healthcare, as well as to various governmental agency customers, including state and local agency customers, and foreign governmental agency customers. Sales to such entities are subject to a number of challenges and risks. Selling to such entities can be highly competitive, expensive, and time-consuming, often requiring significant upfront time and expense without any assurance that these efforts will generate a sale. Government contracting requirements may change and in doing so restrict our ability to sell into the government sector until we comply with the revised requirements. Government demand and payment for our offerings are affected by public sector budgetary cycles and funding authorizations, with funding reductions or delays adversely affecting public sector demand for our offerings.\nFurther, highly regulated and governmental entities may demand shorter contract terms or other contractual provisions that differ from our standard arrangements, including terms that can lead those customers to obtain broader rights in our offerings than would be standard. Such entities may have statutory, contractual, or other legal rights to terminate contracts with us or our partners due to a default or for other reasons, and any such termination may harm our business. In addition, these governmental agencies may be required to publish the rates we negotiate with them, which could harm our negotiating leverage with other potential customers and in turn harm our business.\nThe success of our business depends on customers\u2019 continued and unimpeded access to our platform on the internet.\nOur customers must have internet access in order to use our platform. Some internet providers may take measures that affect their customers\u2019 ability to use our platform, such as degrading the quality of the content we transmit over their lines, giving that content lower priority, giving other content higher priority than ours, blocking our content entirely, or attempting to charge their customers more for using our platform.\nIn December 2010, the Federal Communications Commission (\"FCC\") adopted net neutrality rules barring internet providers from blocking or slowing down access to online content, protecting services like ours from such interference. The FCC has repealed the net neutrality rules, and it is currently uncertain how the U.S. Congress will respond to this decision. To the extent network operators attempt to interfere with our platform, extract fees from us to deliver our platform, or otherwise engage in discriminatory practices, our business could be adversely impacted. Within such a regulatory environment, we could\nexperience discriminatory or anti-competitive practices that could impede our domestic and international growth, cause us to incur additional expense, or otherwise harm our business.\nWe are subject to anti-corruption, anti-bribery, anti-money laundering and similar laws, and non-compliance with such laws can subject us to criminal and/or civil liability and harm our business.\nWe are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.S. domestic bribery statute contained in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 201, the U.S. Travel Act, the UK Bribery Act, and other anti-bribery and anti-money laundering laws in the countries in which we conduct activities. Anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws have been enforced aggressively in recent years and are interpreted broadly to generally prohibit companies and their employees and third-party intermediaries from authorizing, offering or providing, directly or indirectly, improper payments, or benefits to recipients in the public or private sector. As we increase our international sales and business and sales to the public sector, we may engage with business partners and third-party intermediaries to market our platform and to obtain necessary permits, licenses, and other regulatory approvals. In addition, we or our third-party intermediaries may have direct or indirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies or state-owned or affiliated entities. We can be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of these third-party intermediaries, our employees, representatives, contractors, partners, and agents, even if we do not explicitly authorize such activities.\nWhile we have policies and procedures to address compliance with such laws, we cannot assure you that all of our employees and agents will not take actions in violation of our policies and applicable laws, for which we may be ultimately held responsible. As we increase our international sales and business, our risks under these laws may increase.\nDetecting, investigating, and resolving actual or alleged violations can require a significant diversion of time, resources, and attention from senior management. In addition, noncompliance with anti-corruption, anti-bribery, or anti-money laundering laws could subject us to whistleblower complaints, investigations, sanctions, settlements, prosecution or other enforcement actions, disgorgement of profits, significant fines, damages, other civil and criminal penalties or injunctions, suspension or debarment from contracting with certain persons, the loss of export privileges, reputational harm, adverse media coverage, and other collateral consequences. If any subpoenas or investigations are launched, or governmental or other sanctions are imposed or if we do not prevail in any possible civil or criminal litigation, our business could be harmed. In addition, responding to any action will likely result in a materially significant diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources and significant defense costs and other professional fees. Enforcement actions and sanctions could further harm our business.\nChanges in our effective tax rate or tax liability may harm our business.\nOur effective tax rate could be adversely impacted by several factors, including:\n\u2022Changes in the relative amounts of income before taxes in the various jurisdictions in which we operate that have differing statutory tax rates;\n\u2022Changes in tax laws, tax treaties, and regulations or the interpretation of them, including the Tax Act;\n\u2022Changes to our assessment about our ability to realize our deferred tax assets that are based on estimates of our future results, the prudence and feasibility of possible tax planning strategies, and the economic and political environments in which we do business;\n\u2022The outcome of current and future tax audits, examinations, or administrative appeals; and\n\u2022Limitations or adverse findings regarding our ability to do business in some jurisdictions.\nShould our effective tax rate rise, our business could be harmed.\nWe could be required to collect additional sales taxes or be subject to other tax liabilities that may increase the costs our clients would have to pay for our offering and harm our business.\nAn increasing number of states have considered or adopted laws that attempt to impose tax collection obligations on out-of-state companies. Additionally, the Supreme Court of the United States recently ruled in South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc. et\nal (\"Wayfair\") that online sellers can be required to collect sales and use tax despite not having a physical presence in the buyer\u2019s state. In response to Wayfair, or otherwise, states or local governments may adopt, or begin to enforce, laws requiring us to calculate, collect, and remit taxes on sales in their jurisdictions. A successful assertion by one or more states requiring us to collect taxes where we presently do not do so, or to collect more taxes in a jurisdiction in which we currently do collect some taxes, could result in substantial tax liabilities, including taxes on past sales, as well as penalties and interest. The imposition by state governments or local governments of sales tax collection obligations on out-of-state sellers could also create additional administrative burdens for us, put us at a competitive disadvantage if they do not impose similar obligations on our competitors and decrease our future sales, which could harm our business.\nAdverse tax laws or regulations could be enacted or existing laws could be applied to us, which could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nWe operate and are subject to taxes in the United States and numerous other jurisdictions throughout the world. Changes to federal, state, local, or international tax laws on income, sales, use, indirect, or other tax laws, statutes, rules, regulations, or ordinances on multinational corporations are currently being considered by the United States and other countries where we do business. These contemplated legislative initiatives include, but are not limited to, changes to transfer pricing policies and definitional changes to permanent establishment that could be applied solely or disproportionately to services provided over the internet. These contemplated tax initiatives, if finalized and adopted by countries, may ultimately impact our effective tax rate and could adversely affect our sales activity resulting in a negative impact on our operating results and cash flows.\nIn addition, existing tax laws, statutes, rules, regulations, or ordinances could be interpreted, changed, modified, or applied adversely to us (possibly with retroactive effect), which could require us to pay additional tax amounts, fines or penalties, and interest for past amounts. The additional tax obligations could relate to our taxes or obligations to report or withhold on customer taxes. We could take steps to collect customer related taxes, but if we are unsuccessful in collecting such taxes from our customers, we could be held liable for such costs, thereby adversely impacting our operating results and cash flows. Further, if our customers must pay additional fines or penalties, it could adversely affect demand for our services.\nOn December 22, 2017, President Trump signed into law H.R. 1, \u201cAn Act to provide for reconciliation pursuant to titles II and V of the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2018,\u201d informally titled the Tax Act, which significantly revises the Code. The Tax Act, among other things, reduces the corporate tax rate from a top marginal rate of 35% to a flat rate of 21%, limits the tax deduction for interest expense to 30% of adjusted taxable income (except for certain small businesses), limits the deduction for net operating losses carried forward from taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 to 80% of current year taxable income, eliminates net operating loss carrybacks, imposes a one-time tax on offshore earnings at reduced rates regardless of whether they are repatriated, eliminates U.S. tax on foreign earnings (subject to certain important exceptions), allows immediate deductions for certain new investments instead of deductions for depreciation expense over time, and modifies or repeals many business deductions and credits. Notwithstanding the reduction in the corporate income tax rate, the overall impact of the Tax Act is uncertain and our business and financial condition could be adversely affected. In addition, it is uncertain if and to what extent various states will conform to the Tax Act. The impact of the Tax Act on holders of our Class A common stock is also uncertain and could be adverse. More recently, on March 18, 2020, the Families First Coronavirus Response Act (\"FFCR Act\"), and on March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (\"CARES Act\") were each enacted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The FFCR Act and the CARES Act contain numerous income tax provisions, such as relaxing limitations on the deductibility of interest and the use of net operating losses arising in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. In December 2020, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 (\"CAA\") was signed into law. The CAA included additional funding through tax credits as part of its economic package for 2021. The Company evaluated these items in its tax computation and determined that the items do not have a material impact on the Company\u2019s financial statements as of and for the period ended December 31, 2020. Future regulatory guidance under the FFCR Act and the CARES Act (as well as under the TCJA) remains forthcoming, and such guidance could ultimately increase or lessen their impact on our business and financial condition. It is also possible that Congress will enact additional legislation in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, some of which could have an impact on us. We urge our stockholders to consult with their legal and tax advisors with respect to this legislation and the potential tax consequences of investing in or holding our Class A common stock.\nOur ability to use our net operating losses to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations.\nOur net operating loss (\"NOL\") carryforwards could expire unused and be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities because of their limited duration or because of restrictions under U.S. tax law. Our NOLs generated in tax years ending on or prior to December 31, 2017 are only permitted to be carried forward for 20 years under applicable U.S. tax law.\nUnder the Tax Act, our federal NOLs generated in tax years ending after December 31, 2017 may be carried forward indefinitely, but the deductibility of such federal NOLs is limited. It is uncertain if and to what extent various states will conform to the Tax Act.\nIn addition, under Section 382 of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \"Code\"), a corporation that undergoes an \"ownership change\" is generally subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its pre-change NOLs to offset future taxable income. We may have experienced ownership changes in the past and may experience ownership changes in the future as a result of subsequent shifts in our stock ownership (some of which shifts are outside our control). Furthermore, our ability to utilize NOLs of companies that we have acquired or may acquire in the future may be subject to limitations. For these reasons, we may not be able to utilize a material portion of the NOLs, even if we were to achieve profitability.\nOur international operations may subject us to potential adverse tax consequences.\nWe are expanding our international operations and staff to better support our growth into international markets. Our corporate structure and associated transfer pricing policies contemplate future growth into the international markets, and consider the functions, risks, and assets of the various entities involved in the intercompany transactions. The amount of taxes we pay in different jurisdictions may depend on: the application of the tax laws of the various jurisdictions, including the United States, to our international business activities; changes in tax rates; new or revised tax laws or interpretations of existing tax laws and policies; and our ability to operate our business in a manner consistent with our corporate structure and intercompany arrangements. The taxing authorities of the jurisdictions in which we operate may challenge our methodologies for pricing intercompany transactions pursuant to our intercompany arrangements or disagree with our determinations as to the income and expenses attributable to specific jurisdictions. If such a challenge or disagreement were to occur, and our position was not sustained, we could be required to pay additional taxes, interest, and penalties, which could result in one-time tax charges, higher effective tax rates, reduced cash flows, and lower overall profitability of our operations. Our financial statements could fail to reflect adequate reserves to cover such a contingency.\nWe are subject to governmental export and import controls that could impair our ability to compete in international markets or subject us to liability if we violate such controls.\nOur products are subject to U.S. export controls, including the Export Administration Regulations administered by the U.S. Commerce Department, and economic sanctions administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the U.S. Treasury Department (\"OFAC\"), and we incorporate encryption technology into certain of our products. These encryption products and the underlying technology may be exported outside of the United States only with the required export authorizations.\nFurthermore, our activities are subject to U.S. economic sanctions laws and regulations that generally prohibit the direct or indirect exportation or provision of products and services without the required export authorizations to countries, governments, and individuals and entities targeted by U.S. embargoes or sanctions, except to the extent authorized by OFAC or exempt from sanctions. Obtaining the necessary export license or other authorization for a particular sale may not always be possible, and, even if the export license is ultimately granted, the process may be time-consuming and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities. Violations of U.S. sanctions or export control laws can result in significant fines or penalties, and possible incarceration for responsible employees and managers could be imposed for criminal violations of these laws.\nOther countries also regulate the import and export of certain encryption products and technology through import and export licensing requirements, and have enacted laws that could limit our ability to distribute our products or could limit our customers\u2019 ability to implement our products in those countries. Changes in our products or future changes in export and import regulations may create delays in the introduction of our products in international markets, prevent our customers with international operations from deploying our products globally, or, in some cases, prevent the export or import of our products to certain countries, governments, or persons altogether. From time to time, various governmental agencies have proposed additional regulation of encryption products and technology, including the escrow and government recovery of private encryption keys. Any change in export or import regulations, economic sanctions or related legislation, increased export and import controls, or change in the countries, governments, persons, or technologies targeted by such regulations could result in decreased use of our products by, or in our decreased ability to export or sell our products to, existing or potential customers with international operations. Any decreased use of our products or limitation on our ability to export or sell our products would harm our business.\nWe are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates.\nOur sales contracts are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars, and therefore a majority of our revenue is not subject to foreign currency revaluation. However, a strengthening of the U.S. dollar could increase the real cost of our platform to our customers outside of the United States, which could adversely affect our operating results. In addition, an increasing portion of our operating expenses is incurred outside the United States. These operating expenses are denominated in foreign currencies and are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. While we do not currently engage in hedging efforts, if we do not successfully hedge against the risks associated with currency fluctuations, our business may be harmed.\nThe phase-out of the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d), or the replacement of LIBOR with a different reference rate, may adversely affect interest rates.\nOn July 27, 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority (the authority that regulates LIBOR) announced that it would phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. It is unclear whether new methods of calculating LIBOR will be established such that it continues to exist after 2021, or if alternative rates or benchmarks will be adopted. The interest rate under our Credit Agreement with Silicon Valley Bank dated February 16, 2021 (the \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d) is calculated based on LIBOR. While the Credit Agreement contains limited \u201cfallback\u201d provisions providing for the adoption of a successor rate that has been broadly accepted by the syndicated loan market in the United States in lieu of LIBOR in the event LIBOR is unavailable, these provisions may not adequately address the actual changes to LIBOR or its successor rates. Changes in the method of calculating LIBOR, or the replacement of LIBOR with an alternative rate or benchmark, may adversely affect interest rates and result in higher borrowing costs. This could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. We cannot predict the effect of the potential changes to LIBOR or the establishment and use of alternative rates or benchmarks.\nUnfavorable conditions in our industry or the global economy or reductions in information technology spending could harm our business.\nOur results of operations may vary based on the impact of changes in our industry or the global economy on us or our customers and potential customers. Current or future economic uncertainties or downturns could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Negative conditions in the general economy both in the United States and abroad, including conditions resulting from changes in gross domestic product growth, financial and credit market fluctuations, political turmoil, natural catastrophes, warfare, public health issues, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and terrorist attacks on the United States, Europe, the Asia Pacific region, or elsewhere, could cause a decrease in business investments, including spending on information technology, which would harm our business. To the extent that our platform and our products are perceived by customers and potential customers as too costly, or difficult to deploy or migrate to, our revenue may be disproportionately affected by delays or reductions in general information technology spending. Also, our competitors, many of whom are larger and have greater financial resources than we do, may respond to market conditions by lowering prices and attempting to lure away our customers. In addition, the increased pace of consolidation in certain industries may result in reduced overall spending on our products. We cannot predict the timing, strength, or duration of any economic slowdown, instability, or recovery, generally or within any particular industry.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\nWe could incur substantial costs in protecting or defending our proprietary rights, and any failure to adequately protect our rights could impair our competitive position and we may lose valuable assets, experience reduced revenue, and incur costly litigation to protect our rights.\nOur success is dependent, in part, upon protecting our proprietary technology. We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, service marks, trade secret laws, and contractual provisions in an effort to establish and protect our proprietary rights. However, the steps we take to protect our intellectual property may be inadequate. While we have issued patents in the United States and other countries and have additional pending patent applications, we may be unable to obtain patent protection for the technology covered in our patent applications. In addition, any patents issued in the future may not provide us with competitive advantages, or may be successfully challenged by third parties. Any of our patents, trademarks, or other intellectual property rights may be challenged or circumvented by others or invalidated through administrative process or litigation. There can be no guarantee that others will not independently develop similar products, duplicate any of our products, or design around our patents. Furthermore, legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability, and scope of protection of\nintellectual property rights are uncertain. Despite our precautions, it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy our products and use information that we regard as proprietary to create products and services that compete with ours. Some license provisions protecting against unauthorized use, copying, transfer, and disclosure of our products may be unenforceable under the laws of jurisdictions outside the United States. To the extent we expand our international activities, our exposure to unauthorized copying and use of our products and proprietary information may increase.\nWe enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and consultants and enter into confidentiality agreements with the parties with whom we have strategic relationships and business alliances. No assurance can be given that these agreements will be effective in controlling access to and distribution of our products and proprietary information. Further, these agreements do not prevent our competitors or partners from independently developing technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our platform.\nIn order to protect our intellectual property rights, we may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect these rights. Litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights and to protect our trade secrets. Litigation brought to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights could be costly, time consuming, and distracting to management and could result in the impairment or loss of portions of our intellectual property. Furthermore, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights may be met with defenses, counterclaims, and countersuits attacking the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights. Our inability to protect our proprietary technology against unauthorized copying or use, as well as any costly litigation or diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources, could delay further sales or the implementation of our platform, impair the functionality of our platform, delay introductions of new products, result in our substituting inferior or more costly technologies into our products, or injure our reputation. We will not be able to protect our intellectual property if we are unable to enforce our rights or if we do not detect unauthorized use of our intellectual property. Moreover, policing unauthorized use of our technologies, trade secrets, and intellectual property may be difficult, expensive, and time-consuming, particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not be as protective of intellectual property rights as those in the United States and where mechanisms for enforcement of intellectual property rights may be weak. If we fail to meaningfully protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights, our business may be harmed.\nWe may in the future be subject to legal proceedings and litigation relating to intellectual property disputes, which are costly and may subject us to significant liability and increased costs of doing business. Our business may suffer if it is alleged or determined that our technology infringes the intellectual property rights of others.\nThe software industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, and other intellectual property rights. Companies in the software industry are often required to defend against litigation claims based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. Our technologies may not be able to withstand any third-party claims or rights against their use. In addition, many of these companies have the capability to dedicate substantially greater resources to enforce their intellectual property rights and to defend claims that may be brought against them. Any litigation may also involve patent holding companies or other adverse patent owners that have no relevant product revenue and against which our patents may therefore provide little or no deterrence. If a third party is able to obtain an injunction preventing us from accessing such third-party intellectual property rights, or if we cannot license or develop technology for any infringing aspect of our business, we would be forced to limit or stop selling products impacted by the claim or injunction or cease business activities covered by such intellectual property, and may be unable to compete effectively. Any inability to license third party technology in the future would have an adverse effect on our business or operating results, and would adversely affect our ability to compete. We may also be contractually obligated to indemnify our customers in the event of infringement of a third party\u2019s intellectual property rights. We receive demands for such indemnification from time to time and expect to continue to do so. Responding to such claims, including those currently pending, regardless of their merit, can be time consuming, costly to defend in litigation, and damage our reputation and brand.\nLawsuits are time-consuming and expensive to resolve and they divert management\u2019s time and attention. Although we carry insurance, our insurance may not cover potential claims of this type or may not be adequate to indemnify us for all liability that may be imposed. We cannot predict the outcome of lawsuits, and the results of any such actions may harm our business.\nElements of our platform and our products use open source software, which may restrict the functionality of our platform and our products, or require that we release the source code of certain products subject to those licenses.\nOur platform incorporates software licensed under open source licenses. Such open source licenses typically require that source code subject to the license be made available to the public and that any modifications or derivative works to open source software continue to be licensed under open source licenses. Few courts have interpreted open source licenses, and the manner in which these licenses may be interpreted and enforced is therefore subject to some uncertainty. We rely on multiple software programmers to design our proprietary technologies, and we do not exercise complete control over the development efforts of our programmers and we cannot be certain that our programmers have not incorporated open source software into our proprietary products and technologies or that they will not do so in the future. In the event that portions of our proprietary technology are determined to be subject to an open source license, we could be required to publicly release the affected portions of our source code, re-engineer all or a portion of our technologies, or otherwise be limited in the licensing of our technologies, each of which could reduce or eliminate the value of our platform and technologies and materially and adversely affect our ability to sustain and grow our business.\nProvisions in various agreements potentially expose us to substantial liability for intellectual property infringement, data protection, and other losses.\nOur agreements with customers and other third parties generally include provisions under which we are liable or agree to indemnify them for losses suffered or incurred as a result of claims of intellectual property infringement, data protection, damages caused by us to property or persons, or other liabilities relating to or arising from our platform, services, or other contractual obligations. Some of these agreements provide for uncapped liability for which we would be responsible, and some provisions survive termination or expiration of the applicable agreement. Large liability payments could harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Although we normally contractually limit our liability with respect to such obligations, we may still incur substantial liability related to them, and in case of an intellectual property infringement indemnification claim, we may be required to cease use of certain functions of our platform as a result of any such claims. Any dispute with a customer with respect to such obligations could have adverse effects on our relationship with that customer and other existing customers and new customers and harm our business. Even when we have contractual protections against such customer claims, we may choose to honor a customer\u2019s request for indemnification or otherwise seek to maintain customer satisfaction by issuing customer credits, assisting our customer in defending against claims, or in other ways.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock\nOur stock price may be volatile, and the value of our Class A common stock may decline.\nHistorically, our stock price has been volatile. During the year ended December 31, 2020, our stock traded as high as $136.50 per share and as low as $10.63 per share, and from January 1, 2021 to February 26, 2021, our stock price has ranged from $122.75 per share to $68.75 per share. The market price of our Class A common stock may continue to be highly volatile and may fluctuate or decline substantially as a result of a variety of factors, some of which are beyond our control or are related in complex ways, including:\n\u2022actual or anticipated fluctuations in our financial condition and operating results;\n\u2022decreased usage by one or more of our customers;\n\u2022variance in our financial performance from expectations of securities analysts or investors;\n\u2022changes in the pricing we offer our customers;\n\u2022changes in our projected operating and financial results;\n\u2022changes in laws or regulations applicable to our platform or related products;\n\u2022announcements by us or our competitors of significant business developments, acquisitions, or new offerings;\n\u2022publicity associated with network downtime and problems;\n\u2022our involvement in litigation;\n\u2022changes in senior management or key personnel;\n\u2022the trading volume of our Class A common stock;\n\u2022changes in the anticipated future size and growth rate of our market; and\n\u2022general economic, regulatory, and market conditions.\nBroad market and industry fluctuations, as well as general economic, political, regulatory, and market conditions, may impact the market price of our Class A common stock. For example, in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, we initially experienced an increase in the usage of our platform, and as a result, the trading price of our Class A common stock significantly increased, and has since experienced significant volatility, along with the broader market. Following the announcement of our results for our third quarter ended September 30, 2020, which included a significant reduction in revenue from our largest customer in that quarter, volatility increased and the trading price of our Class A common stock decreased. There are no assurances that the trading price of our Class A common stock will continue at its current level for any period of time. Moreover, the trading price of our Class A common stock could experience a significant decrease once the scope and impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is better understood. These fluctuations could cause you to lose all or part of your investment in our Class A common stock.\nIn addition, extreme price and volume fluctuations in the stock markets have affected and continue to affect many\ntechnology companies\u2019 stock prices. Often, their stock prices have fluctuated in ways unrelated or disproportionate to the\ncompanies\u2019 operating performance. In the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their securities have been subject to securities class action litigation. We may be the target of this type of litigation in the future, which could result in substantial costs and divert our management\u2019s attention.\nThe dual class structure of our common stock has the effect of concentrating voting control with the holders of our Class B common stock, including our executive officers, employees, and directors and their affiliates, and limiting your ability to influence corporate matters.\nOur Class B common stock has 10 votes per share, and our Class A common stock has one vote per share. As of December 31, 2020, our Class B common stock held by stockholders, including our executive officers and directors and their affiliates, represents approximately 49.8% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock, and our Chief Architect and Executive Chairman, Artur Bergman, holds approximately 8.1% of our outstanding classes of common stock as a whole, but controls approximately 44.11% of the voting power of our outstanding common stock. As a result, our executive officers, directors, and other affiliates and our Chief Architect and Executive Chairman on his own currently have and will continue to have significant influence over our management and affairs and over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including election of directors and significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of the company or our assets, for the foreseeable future. If Mr. Bergman\u2019s employment with us is terminated, he will continue to have the same influence over matters requiring stockholder approval.\nIn addition, the holders of Class B common stock collectively will continue to be able to control all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval even if their stock holdings represent less than 50% of the outstanding shares of our common stock. Because of the 10-to-1 voting ratio between our Class B and Class A common stock, the holders of our Class B common stock collectively will continue to control a majority of the combined voting power of our common stock even when the shares of Class B common stock represent as little as 10% of the combined voting power of all outstanding shares of our Class A and Class B common stock. This concentrated control limits the ability for holders of Class A common stock to influence corporate matters for the foreseeable future, and, as a result, the market price of our Class A common stock could be adversely affected.\nTransfers by holders of Class B common stock will generally result in those shares converting to Class A common stock, which will have the effect, over time, of increasing the relative voting power of those holders of Class B common stock who retain their shares in the long term. If, for example, Mr. Bergman retains a significant portion of his holdings of Class B common stock for an extended period of time, he could, in the future, control a majority of the combined voting power of our Class A and Class B common stock. As a board member, Mr. Bergman owes a fiduciary duty to our stockholders and must act in good faith in a manner he reasonably believes to be in the best interests of our stockholders. As a stockholder, even a controlling stockholder, Mr. Bergman is entitled to vote his shares in his own interests, which may not always be in the interests of our stockholders generally.\nOn October 12, 2020 (the \u201cSunset Trigger Date\u201d), the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represented less than 10% of the aggregate number of shares of the then outstanding Class A common stock and Class B common stock. As a result, all our outstanding shares of Class B common stock will automatically convert into the same number of shares of Class\nA common stock under the terms of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation on July 12, 2021, the trading day falling nine months after the Sunset Trigger Date (the \u201cConversion\u201d). No additional Class B shares may be issued following the Conversion.\nFuture sales and issuances of our capital stock or rights to purchase capital stock could result in dilution of the percentage ownership of our stockholders and could cause the price of our Class A common stock to decline.\nFuture sales and issuances of our capital stock or rights to purchase our capital stock could result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders. We may sell Class A common stock, convertible securities, and other equity securities in one or more transactions at prices and in a manner as we may determine from time to time. If we sell any such securities in subsequent transactions, investors may be materially diluted. New investors in such subsequent transactions could gain rights, preferences, and privileges senior to those of holders of our Class A common stock.\nFuture sales of our Class A common stock in the public market could cause the market price of our Class A common stock to decline.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our Class A common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales might occur, could depress the market price of our Class A common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. We are unable to predict the effect that such sales may have on the prevailing market price of our Class A common stock.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we have outstanding a total of 104,178,933 shares of Class A common stock and 10,319,677 shares of Class B common stock. All of our outstanding shares are eligible for sale in the public market, other than shares and options held by directors, executive officers, and other affiliates that are subject to volume limitations under Rule 144 of the Securities Act, various vesting agreements, and shares that must be sold under an effective registration statement. Additionally, the shares of Class A and Class B common stock subject to outstanding options and restricted stock unit awards under our equity incentive plans and the shares reserved for future issuance under our equity incentive plans will become eligible for sale in the public market upon issuance, subject to applicable insider trading policies.\nFuture sales also could cause the trading price of our Class A common stock to decline and make it more difficult for investors to sell shares of our Class A common stock.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish unfavorable or inaccurate research about our business, our Class A common stock price and trading volume could decline.\nOur stock price and trading volume are heavily influenced by the way analysts and investors interpret our financial information and other disclosures. If securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, delay publishing reports about our business, or publish negative reports about our business, regardless of accuracy, our Class A common stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our Class A common stock depends, in part, on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. We do not have any control over these analysts. We expect that only a limited number of analysts will cover our company following our initial public offering. If the number of analysts that cover us declines, demand for our Class A common stock could decrease and our Class A common stock price and trading volume may decline.\nEven if our Class A common stock is actively covered by analysts, we do not have any control over the analysts or the measures that analysts or investors may rely upon to forecast our future results. Over-reliance by analysts or investors on any particular metric to forecast our future results may result in forecasts that differ significantly from our own.\nRegardless of accuracy, unfavorable interpretations of our financial information and other public disclosures could have a negative impact on our stock price. If our financial performance fails to meet analyst estimates, for any of the reasons discussed above or otherwise, or one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our Class A common stock or change their opinion of our Class A common stock, our stock price would likely decline.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our capital stock, and we do not intend to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Any determination to pay cash dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors and are restricted by the terms of our Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement permits the payment of cash dividends so long as, after giving effect to any such dividend, we maintain a consolidated adjusted quick ratio of at least 1.50 to 1.00 and are otherwise in pro forma compliance with all covenants under the Credit Agreement. In addition, the Credit Agreement permits us to pay up to $10.0 million in cash dividends per fiscal year so long as, after giving effect to any such dividend, we are in pro forma compliance with all covenants under the Credit Agreement, including a consolidated adjusted quick ratio of at least 1.25 to 1.00. Accordingly, investors must rely on sales of their Class A common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investments.\nWe incur increased costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management is required to devote substantial time to compliance with our public company responsibilities and corporate governance practices.\nAs a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting, and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. We expect such expenses to further increase now that we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company.\u201d The Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the listing requirements of the NYSE, and other applicable securities rules and regulations impose various requirements on public companies. Furthermore, the senior members of our management team do not have significant experience with operating a public company. As a result, our management and other personnel have to devote a substantial amount of time to compliance with these requirements. Moreover, these rules and regulations increase our legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more time-consuming and costly. We cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional costs we will incur as a public company or the timing of such costs.\nAs a result of being a public company, we are obligated to develop and maintain proper and effective internal control over financial reporting and any failure to maintain the adequacy of these internal controls may adversely affect investor confidence in our company and, as a result, the value of our Class A common stock.\nWe are required, pursuant to Section 404 to furnish a report by management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. This assessment includes disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our management in our internal control over financial reporting. In addition, our independent registered public accounting firm is required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in our first annual report required to be filed with the SEC following the date we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company.\u201d Based on the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates as of June 30, 2020, we ceased to be an emerging growth company as of December 31, 2020, which expedited our obligation for our independent registered public accounting firm to issue an attestation report on management's assessment of our internal control over financial reporting and accelerated our adoption of accounting standards. Our compliance with Section 404 requires that we incur substantial accounting expense and expend significant management efforts. We currently have an internal audit group and have hired additional accounting and financial staff. We may need to hire additional accounting and financial staff with appropriate public company experience and technical accounting knowledge and update the system and process documentation necessary to perform the evaluation needed to comply with Section 404.\nDuring the evaluation and testing process of our internal controls, if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting, we will be unable to certify that our internal controls over financial reporting is effective. We and our independent registered public accounting firm identified a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, which remains partially unremediated for the year ended December 31, 2020. The material weakness related to the lack of sufficient qualified accounting resources, including those with the appropriate level of technical accounting knowledge, to timely identify and assess accounting implications of complex transactions which resulted in the incorrect application of generally accepted accounting principles. While we are actively working on remediating this identified weakness, we may discover additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting in the future. Any failure to maintain internal control over financial reporting could severely inhibit our ability to accurately report our financial condition or results of operations. If we are unable to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our independent registered public accounting firm determines we have a material weakness or significant deficiency in our internal control over financial reporting, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, the market price of our Class A common stock could decline and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the exchange on which our shares of Class A common stock are listed, the SEC or other regulatory authorities. Failure to remedy any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, or to implement or maintain other effective control systems required of public companies, could also restrict our future access to the capital markets.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of our company more difficult, limit attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management and limit the market price of our Class A common stock.\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in our management. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws include provisions that:\n\u2022authorize our board of directors to issue, without further action by the stockholders, shares of undesignated preferred stock with terms, rights, and preferences determined by our board of directors that may be senior to our common stock;\n\u2022require that any action to be taken by our stockholders be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting and not by written consent;\n\u2022specify that special meetings of our stockholders can be called only by our board of directors, the chairperson of our board of directors, or our chief executive officer;\n\u2022establish an advance notice procedure for stockholder proposals to be brought before an annual meeting, including proposed nominations of persons for election to our board of directors;\n\u2022establish that our board of directors is divided into three classes, with each class serving three-year staggered terms;\n\u2022prohibit cumulative voting in the election of directors;\n\u2022provide that our directors may be removed for cause only upon the vote of the holders of a majority of our outstanding shares of common stock;\n\u2022provide that vacancies on our board of directors may be filled only by a majority of directors then in office, even though less than a quorum; and\n\u2022reflect our two classes of common stock as described above.\nThese provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management. In addition, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which generally, subject to certain exceptions, prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any of a broad range of business combinations with any \u201cinterested\u201d stockholder for a period of three years following the date on which the stockholder became an \u201cinterested\u201d stockholder. Any delay or prevention of a change of control transaction or changes in our management could cause the market price of our Class A common stock to decline.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and, to the extent enforceable, the federal district courts of the United States of America will be the exclusive forums for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or employees.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive forum for the following types of actions or proceedings under Delaware statutory or common law for:\n\u2022any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf;\n\u2022any action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty;\n\u2022any action asserting a claim against us arising under the Delaware General Corporation Law,\n\u2022our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, or our amended and restated bylaws; and\n\u2022any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal-affairs doctrine.\nThis provision would not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Exchange Act. Furthermore, Section 22 of the Securities Act creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all such Securities Act actions. Accordingly, both state and federal courts have jurisdiction to entertain such claims. To prevent having to litigate claims in multiple jurisdictions and the threat of inconsistent or contrary rulings by different courts, among other considerations, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the federal district courts of the United States of America will be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act. While the Delaware courts have determined that such choice of forum provisions are facially valid, a stockholder may nevertheless seek to bring such a claim arising under the Securities Act against us, our directors, officers, or other employees in a venue other than in the federal district courts of the United States of America. In such instance, we would expect to vigorously assert the validity and enforceability of the exclusive forum provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation. This may require significant additional costs associated with resolving the dispute in other jurisdictions, and there can be no assurance that the provisions will be enforced by a court in those other jurisdictions.\nThese exclusive-forum provisions may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors, officers, and other employees. If a court were to find either exclusive-forum provision in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur further significant additional costs associated with resolving the dispute in other jurisdictions, all of which could harm our business.",

The number of beneficial stockholders is substantially greater than the number of holders of record because a large portion of our common stock is held through brokerage firms.\nDividend Policy\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain any future earnings and do not expect to pay any dividends in the foreseeable future. Any future determination to declare cash dividends will be made at the discretion of our Board of Directors, subject to applicable laws, and will depend on a number of factors, including our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, contractual restrictions, general business conditions, and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant. In addition, the terms of our revolving credit facility place certain limitations on the amount of cash dividends we can pay, even if no amounts are currently outstanding.\nStock Performance Graph\nThis performance graph shall not be deemed \u201csoliciting material\u201d or to be \u201cfiled\u201d with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, or otherwise subject to the liabilities under that Section, and shall not be deemed to be incorporated by reference into any of our filings under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act.\nWe have presented below the cumulative total return to our stockholders between May 17, 2019 (the date our Class A common stock commenced trading on the NYSE) through December 31, 2020 in comparison to the S&P 500 Index and S&P 500 Information Technology Index. The graph assumes a $100 initial investment at the market close on May 17, 2019 which was the initial trading day of our Class A common stock, and the reinvestment of dividends. The comparisons are based on historical data and are not indicative of, nor intended to forecast, the future performance of our Class A common stock.\nUnregistered Sales of Equity Securities\nAs previously disclosed in our Form S-3ASR filed with the SEC on August 15, 2020, as partial consideration for our acquisition of Signal Sciences on October 1, 2020, we issued 6,367,709 shares of our Class A common stock to certain former\nholders of capital stock and employees of Signal Sciences (together, the \u201cHolders\u201d), including 896,499 shares which are restricted as they are subject to revesting conditions. The aggregate consideration to acquire Signal Sciences\u2019 outstanding stock was $759.4 million, consisting of approximately $223.0 million in cash and the balance in shares of our Class A Common Stock. The aggregate purchase price reflects the value of the net shares issued, which excludes the above mentioned shares that are restricted.\nThe shares of Class A common stock were issued in reliance on the exemption from registration pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, on the basis of representations of eligibility and suitability made to the Company by the Holders.\nUse of Proceeds from Public Offering of Class A Common Stock\nOn May 21, 2019, we closed our initial public offering (\"IPO\"), in which we sold 12,937,500 shares of Class A common stock at a price to the public of $16.00 per share, including 1,687,500 shares sold in connection with the exercise of the underwriters\u2019 option to purchase additional shares, and raised $192.5 million in net proceeds after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with the consolidated financial statements and related notes that are included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements based upon current plans, expectations, and beliefs that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth under \u201cRisk Factors\u201d and in other parts of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our fiscal year ends on December 31.\nAs used herein, \"Fastly,\" \"we,\" \"our,\" \"the Company\" and similar terms include Fastly, Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless the context indicates otherwise.\nOverview\nDevelopers are reinventing the way we live, work, and play online. Yet they repeatedly encounter innovation barriers when delivering modern digital experiences. Expectations for digital experiences are at an all-time high; they must be fast, secure, and highly personalized. If they aren\u2019t reliable, end-users simply take their business elsewhere. The challenge today is enabling developers to deliver a modern digital experience while simultaneously providing scale, security, and performance. We built our edge cloud platform to solve this problem.\nThe edge cloud is an emerging category of Infrastructure as a Service (\"IaaS\") that enables developers to build, secure, and deliver digital experiences, at the edge of the internet. This service represents the convergence of the Content Delivery Network (\"CDN\") with functionality that has been traditionally delivered by hardware-centric appliances such as Application Delivery Controllers (\"ADC\"), Web Application Firewalls (\"WAF\"), Bot Detection, and Distributed Denial of Service (\"DDoS\") solutions. It also includes the emergence of a new, but growing, edge computing market which aims to move compute power and logic as close to the end-user as possible. The edge cloud uses the emerging cloud computing, serverless paradigm in which the cloud provider runs the server and dynamically manages the allocation of machine resources. When milliseconds matter, processing at the edge is an ideal way to handle highly dynamic and time-sensitive data. The edge cloud complements data center, central cloud, and hybrid solutions.\nOur mission is to fuel the next modern digital experience by providing developers with a programmable and reliable edge cloud platform that they adopt as their own.\nOrganizations must keep up with complex and ever-evolving end-user requirements. We help them surpass their end-users\u2019 expectations by powering fast, secure, and scalable digital experiences. We built a powerful edge cloud platform, designed from the ground up to be programmable and support agile software development. We believe our platform gives our customers a significant competitive advantage, whether they were born into the digital age or are just embarking on their digital transformation journey. Our platform consists of four key components: a programmable edge, a software-defined modern network, safety in depth, and a philosophy of customer empowerment. Our programmable edge provides developers with real-time visibility and control, where they can write and deploy code in a serverless environment and to push application logic to the edge. It supports modern application delivery processes, freeing developers to innovate without constraints. Our software-defined modern network is built for the software-defined future. It is powerful, efficient, and flexible, designed to enable us to rapidly scale to meet the needs of the most demanding customers and never be a barrier to their growth. Our 117 terabit software-centric network is located across 56 markets as of December 31, 2020. We define markets as unique metropolitan areas where we have one or more Points of Presence (\"POPs\"). Our safety in depth approach integrates security into multiple layers of development: architecture, engineering, and operations. That's why we invest in building security into the fabric of our platform, alongside performance. We provide developers and security operations teams with a fast, safe environment to create, build, and run modern applications.\nOur platform provides developers and security operations teams with solutions that foster innovation without impacting performance. Finally, being developers ourselves, we empower customers to build great things while supporting their efforts through frictionless tools and a deeply technical support team that facilitates ongoing collaboration.\nWe serve both established enterprises, mid-market companies and technology-savvy organizations. Our customers represent a diverse set of organizations across many industries with one thing in common: they are competing by using the\npower of software to build differentiation at the edge. With our edge cloud platform, our customers are disrupting existing industries and creating new ones. For example, several of our customers have reinvented digital publishing by connecting readers through subscription models to indispensable content, helping people understand the world through deeply reported independent journalism. Our customers\u2019 software applications use our edge cloud platform to deliver consistently excellent online shopping experiences, fast and more secure financial transactions, and broadcast quality live streaming on any device. The range of applications that developers build with our edge cloud platform continues to expand rapidly.\nSo where do we go from here? Our vision is to create a trustworthy internet, where good thrives. We want all developers to have the ability to deliver the next transformative digital experience on a global scale. And because big ideas often start small, we love it when developers experiment and iterate on our edge cloud platform, coming up with exciting new ways to solve today\u2019s complex problems.\nWe generate substantially all of our revenue from charging our customers based on their usage of our platform. Initially, customers typically choose to become platform customers, for which we charge fees based on their committed or actual use of our platform, as measured in gigabytes and requests. Many of our customers generate billings in excess of their minimum commitment. We also generate revenue from additional products as well as professional and other services, such as implementation. We charge a flat one-time or recurring fee for these additional products and services. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2020, we also began offering subscriptions to access a unified security web application and application programming interface at a fixed rate.\nWe focus our direct selling efforts on medium to large organizations as well as smaller companies that are exhibiting significant growth. We engage with and support these customers with our field sales representatives, account managers, and technical account managers who focus on customer satisfaction and drive expansion of their usage of our platform and products. These teams work with technical and business leaders to help our customers\u2019 end-users receive the best possible digital experience, while also lowering our customers\u2019 total cost of ownership.\nWe are continuing to bring new innovations to our edge cloud platform and software-defined modern network architecture, and are seeing an increased interest from customers in our programmable edge computing solution. The success of these direct selling efforts is reflected by our 324 enterprise customers, which excludes Signal Sciences enterprise customers, as of December 31, 2020 that generated 89% of our total revenue for the trailing 12 months ended December 31, 2020.\nOur usage-based revenue grows as our customers\u2019 websites and applications deliver, process, and protect more traffic, as they adopt more features of our edge platform and as they more broadly adopt our platform across their organizations. A meaningful indicator of the increased activity from our existing customers is our Dollar-Based Net Expansion Rate (\"DBNER\"), Net Retention Rate (\"NRR\") and Last-Twelve Months Net Retention Rate (\"LTM NRR\"), metrics used in measuring the revenue growth from existing customers attributed to increased usage of our platform and purchase of additional services. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2020, we also offer subscriptions to access a unified security web application and application programming interface at a fixed rate.\nThe financial results of Signal Sciences from the acquisition date on October 1, 2020 have been consolidated into our financial results for 2020 and the quarter ended December 31, 2020. We have excluded Signal Sciences from certain key metrics this quarter, including DBNER, NRR and LTM NRR. We intend to begin reporting these key metrics on a consolidated basis later on in 2021. Excluding Signal Sciences, our DBNER was 142.9% and 135.5% for the trailing 12 months ended December 31, 2020, and 2019, respectively. Excluding Signal Sciences, our NRR was 115% and 143.7% for the trailing twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Excluding Signal Sciences, our LTM NRR was 137% and 131.6% for the trailing 12 months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We believe the LTM NRR is supplemental as it removes some of the volatility inherent in a usage-based business model from the measurement of the NRR metric.\nWe believe that an annual cohort analysis of Fastly's customers as depicted in the chart below, demonstrates our success in customer expansion. Once a customer begins to generate revenue for us, they tend to increase their usage of our platform, in particular in their second year. Customer accounts acquired in 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020 are referred to as the 2016 Cohort, 2017 Cohort, 2018 Cohort, 2019 Cohort and 2020 Cohort, respectively. Our 2016 Cohort increased its revenue 2.3 times after its first year and has grown at approximately a 70% CAGR over the last four years. We have excluded Signal Sciences' customers from this cohort analysis.\nIn 2016, we generated $6.6 million of revenue from the 2016 Cohort. Revenue from the 2016 Cohort grew to $22.0 million in 2017, representing 233% year-over-year growth. In 2017, we generated $5.6 million of revenue from the 2017\nCohort. Revenue from the 2017 Cohort grew to $16.8 million in 2018, representing 200% year-over-year growth. In 2018, we generated $11.2 million of revenue from the 2018 Cohort. Revenue from the 2018 Cohort grew to $34.4 million in 2019, representing 207% year-over-year growth. In 2019, we generated $9.1 million of revenue from the 2019 Cohort. Revenue from the 2019 Cohort grew to $47.7 million in 2020, representing 424% year-over-year growth.\nSummary of Revenue Generated by Customer Cohorts Over Time (in millions) (excludes Signal Sciences):\nCustomers that have negotiated contracts with us generate a substantial majority of our revenue. These customers typically purchase one or more products, for which we charge a monthly recurring or one-time fee depending on the products selected. Some of these customers also choose to purchase various levels of account management and enhanced customer support for a monthly fee. Typically, the term of these contracts is 12 months and includes a minimum monthly billing commitment in exchange for more favorable pricing terms. Many of these customers generate billings in excess of their minimum commitment. In addition, customers can sign up online by providing their credit card information and agreeing to a minimum monthly fee. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2020, we also offer subscriptions to access a unified security web application and application programming interface at a fixed rate.\nThe timing of new revenue from our sales efforts is difficult to predict. The length of our sales cycle, from initial evaluation to payment, can range from several months to well over a year and can vary substantially from customer to customer. Similarly, the onboarding and ramping process with new enterprise customers can take several months, as well as existing enterprise customers with new business, can take several months and can be subject to delays for unanticipated reasons. For example, we experienced delays in the ramping of new traffic due to travel and data center restrictions in South Asia that delayed network build outs and the timing of customer code freezes, each affected in part by COVID-19-related issues.\nWe have achieved significant growth in recent periods. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, our revenue was $290.9 million and $200.5 million, respectively. Our 10 largest customers generated an aggregate of 38% and 29% of our\nrevenue in the trailing 12 months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We incurred a net loss of $95.9 million and $51.6 million in the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nAcquisition of Signal Sciences Corp.\nIn October 2020, we acquired Signal Sciences, for an aggregate purchase price of $759.4 million, consisting of approximately $223.0 million in cash and 6,367,709 shares of our Class A common stock, including 896,499 shares which are restricted as they are subject to revesting conditions. The aggregate purchase price reflects the value of the net shares issued, which excludes the above mentioned shares that are restricted. We also assumed all unvested and outstanding equity awards of Signal Sciences\u2019 continuing employees as converted into our equity awards at the conversion ratio provided in the Agreement and Plan of Reorganization (the \"Merger Agreement\"), which became options to purchase 251,754 shares of our Class A common stock, with a value of $20.7 million related to the assumed unvested equity awards that are subject to future service conditions.\nWe have included Signal Sciences in our results of operations as of the acquisition date, October 1, 2020. Because the acquisition of Signal Sciences occurred during the year ended December 31, 2020, the information presented in this section with respect to the year ended December 31, 2020 includes the contribution of Signal Sciences starting from October 1, 2020. The information with respect to the prior-year comparable periods relates to Fastly on a standalone basis. As a result, comparisons to the prior-year period may not be indicative of future results or future rates of growth.\nPlease refer to Note 5-Business Combination for further details on the acquisition of Signal Sciences.\nAdjustments subsequent to the release of earnings on February 17, 2021\nSubsequent to our announcement of earnings and issuance of our shareholder letter, furnished in a Form 8-K on February 17, 2021, as of December 31, 2020, we recorded an adjustment to our Goodwill and additional-paid in capital balances. Our determination to record the adjustment following our earnings announcement was the result of identifying an adjustment needed to the share value of awards issued on the Signal Sciences acquisition. The amounts reflected in our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020, reflect an increase in goodwill of $57.4 million and a corresponding increase in additional paid-in capital of $57.4 million to what was previously disclosed in our earnings announcement and shareholder letter.\nSubsequent to our announcement of earnings and issuance of our shareholder letter, furnished in a Form 8-K on February 17, 2021, for the year ended December 31, 2020, we reclassified $1.7 million of finance lease payments from investing cash flows to financing cash flows. Our determination to record the reclassification following our earnings announcement was the result of identifying certain payments made relating to our network equipment leases should that be classified as financing cash outflows. The amounts reflected in our consolidated statement of cash flows reflect a decrease in cash used in investing activities of $1.7 million and an increase in cash used in financing activities of $1.7 million to what was previously disclosed in our shareholder letter for the year ended December 31, 2020. Separately, in our consolidated statement of cash flows, we also updated our supplemental disclosures around value of common stock issued and stock awards assumed in a business combination, which increased by $57.4 million to reflect the impact of the adjustment outlined in the paragraph above.\nFactors Affecting Our Performance\nWinning New Customers\nWe are focused on continuing to attract new customers. Our customer base includes both large, established enterprises that are undergoing digital transformation and emerging companies spanning a wide array of industries and verticals. In both instances, developers within these companies often use and advocate the adoption of our platform by their companies. We also benefit from word-of-mouth promotion across the broader developer community. We will continue to invest in our developer outreach, leveraging it as a cost-efficient approach to attracting new customers. With our newly expanded security portfolio from the acquisition of Signal Sciences and our edge computing capabilities we will increase our focus on brand awareness, public relations and analyst relations in efforts to help generate awareness and demand for these offerings. We also plan to dedicate significant resources to sales and marketing programs, including various online marketing activities as well as targeted account-based advertising.\nThis will require us to dedicate significant resources to further develop the market for our platform and differentiate our platform from competitive products and services. We will also need to expand, retain, and motivate our sales and marketing personnel in order to target our sales efforts at larger enterprises and senior management of these potential customers.\nUncertainty surrounding the EU-US Privacy Shield framework, which was invalidated by the Court of Justice of the EU in July 2020, could impact customer growth and acquisition for customers and potential customers conducting business in Europe. We have encountered and may continue to encounter heightened concerns relating to privacy from customers and potential customers conducting business in Europe since the invalidation of the EU-US Privacy Shield framework. Specifically, we have received more requests relating to EU privacy requirements, impacting the sales negotiation process, and had potential customers decline to do business with us due to privacy concerns related to updated interpretations of the laws applicable to transfers of personal data to the United States. For additional details, refer to \"Item 1A.-Risk Factors\".\nExpanding within our Existing Customer Base\nWe emphasize retaining our customers and expanding their usage of our platform and adoption of our other products. Customers often begin with smaller deployments of our programmable edge platform and then expand their usage over time. In addition, our programmable edge platform includes a variety of other offerings, such as load balancing, shielding, web security, and WAF. As our customers mature, we assist them in expanding their use of our platform, including the use of additional offerings beyond edge cloud delivery. As enterprises grow and experience increased traffic, their needs evolve, leading them to find additional use cases for our platform and expand their usage accordingly. In addition, given that customer acquisition costs are incurred largely for acquiring and initial onboarding, we gain operating leverage to the extent that existing customers expand their use of our platform and products.\nOur ability to retain our customers and expand their usage could be impaired for a variety of reasons, including a customer moving to another provider or reducing usage within the term of their contract to their minimum usage commitment. Even if our customers expand their usage of our platform, we cannot guarantee that they will maintain those usage levels for any meaningful period of time or that they will renew their commitments.\nIn addition, we cannot be certain what actions the U.S. or another country's government may take with respect to certain of our customers that may adversely affect our ability to do business with our customers that operate in China, target China as a market or that have strong business ties to China. For example, our largest customer during the year ended December 31, 2020 has strong business ties to China and significantly reduced its usage of our platform in the later part of 2020. We believe this was in response to various actions taken by the U.S. and other governments against them. Further reductions in this customer's traffic levels could have an additional negative impact on our business.\nFor additional details, refer to \"Item 1A.-Risk Factors\".\nInternational Customer Growth\nWe intend to continue expanding our efforts to attract customers outside of the United States by augmenting our sales teams and strategically increasing our presence in the number of markets in select international locations. Excluding Signal Sciences, as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had 1,068 and 852 customers headquartered outside of the United States, respectively, representing 51% and 49% of our total customers as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nOur international expansion, including our global sales efforts, will add increased complexity and cost to our business. This will require us to significantly expand our sales and marketing capabilities outside of the United States, as well as increase the number of markets we have a presence in around the world to support our customers. We have limited experience managing the administrative aspects of a global organization, and we have only recently begun to establish and operate offices in foreign countries, which could place a strain on our business and culture.\nInvesting in Sales and Marketing\nOur customers have been pivotal in driving brand awareness and broadening our reach. While we continue to leverage our self-service approach to drive adoption by developers, we intend to continue to expand our sales and marketing efforts, with an increased focus on sales to enterprises globally. Utilizing our direct sales force, we have multiple selling points within organizations to acquire new customers and increase usage from our existing customers. We intend to increase our discretionary\nmarketing spend, including account based and brand spend, to drive the effectiveness of our sales teams. As a result, we expect our total operating expenses to increase as we continue to expand. Our investments in our sales and marketing teams are intended to help accelerate our sales, onboarding, and ramp cycles.\nThese efforts will require us to invest significantly in financial and other resources. Furthermore, we believe that there is significant competition for sales personnel with the skills and technical knowledge that we require. Our ability to achieve significant revenue growth will depend, in large part, on our success in recruiting, training, and retaining sufficient numbers of sales personnel to support our growth.\nContinued Investment in Our Platform and Network Infrastructure\nWe must continue to invest in our platform and network infrastructure to maintain our position in the market. We expect our revenue growth to be dependent on an expanding customer base and continued adoption of our edge cloud platform. In anticipation of winning new customers and staying ahead of our customers\u2019 needs, we plan to continue to invest in order to expand the scale and capacity of our software-defined modern network, resulting in increased network service provider fees, which could adversely affect our gross margins if we are unable to offset these costs with revenue from new customers and increase revenue from existing customers. Our customers require constant innovation within their own organizations and expect the same from us. Therefore, we will continue to invest in resources to enhance our development capabilities and introduce new products and features on our platform. We believe that investment in research and development will contribute to our long-term growth but may also negatively impact our short-term profitability. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, our research and development expenses as a percentage of revenue was 26% and 23%, respectively. We may also seek to acquire or invest in businesses, products, or technologies that we believe could complement or expand our platform, enhance our technical capabilities, or otherwise offer growth opportunities. For example, on October 1, 2020, we acquired Signal Sciences, a security software company that provides protection from web, API, and mobile security threats.\nDevelopers use our platform to build custom applications and require a state-of-the-art infrastructure to test and run these applications. We will continue to invest in our network infrastructure by strategically increasing our POPs. We also anticipate making investments in upgrading our technology and hardware to continue providing our customers a fast and secure platform. Our total investment in property and equipment for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were $49.0 million and $30.3 million, respectively, representing 17% and 15% of our revenue in such periods. We expect our investment in property and equipment to increase on an absolute basis and may increase as a percentage of revenue in future periods. Our gross margins and operating results are impacted by these investments. As of December 31, 2020, our network is located in 56 markets across 26 countries.\nIn the event that there are errors in software, failures of hardware, damages to a facility or misconfigurations of any of our services-whether caused by our products, third-party error, our own error, natural disasters, or security breaches-we could experience lengthy interruptions in our platform as well as delays and additional expenses in arranging new facilities and services. In addition, there can be no assurance that we are adequately prepared for unexpected increases in bandwidth demands by our customers, particularly when customers experience cyber-attacks. The bandwidth we have contracted to purchase may become unavailable for a variety of reasons, including service outages, payment disputes, network providers going out of business, natural disasters, networks imposing traffic limits, or governments adopting regulations that impact network operations.\nUncertainty of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic\nOur business and operations could be adversely affected by health epidemics, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, impacting the markets and communities in which we, our partners and customers operate. In December 2019, a disease referred to as COVID-19 was first reported and has spread to many countries worldwide, including the United States, and was declared a pandemic.\nThe ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted, and may continue to adversely impact, many aspects of our business. As certain of our customers or potential customers experience downturns or uncertainty in their own business operations and revenue resulting from the spread of COVID-19, they have and may continue to decrease or delay their technology spending, request pricing concessions or payment extensions, or seek renegotiation of their contracts. In addition, a portion of our revenue is related to usage of our platform in connection with live events, such as sporting events that have been or may be postponed or cancelled. While we initially saw an increase in usage of our platform following the implementation of preventative measures to contain or mitigate the outbreak of COVID-19, we cannot predict how usage levels will continue to be\nimpacted by these preventative measures. There is no assurance that customers will continue to use our platform, or to the same extent, after the COVID-19 pandemic begins to taper or has ended. As a result, it has been difficult to accurately forecast our revenues or financial results, especially given that the near and long term impact of the pandemic remains uncertain. Our results of operations could be materially below our forecasts, which could adversely affect our results of operations, disappoint analysts and investors, or cause our stock price to decline.\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, many state, local, and foreign governments have put in place restrictions in order to control the spread of the disease. Such restrictions, or the perception that such restrictions could occur, have resulted in business closures, work stoppages, slowdowns and delays, work-from-home policies, travel restrictions, and cancellation or postponement of events, among other effects that impacted productivity and disrupted our operations and those of our partners and customers. For example, we experienced delays in the ramping of new traffic due to travel and data center restrictions in South Asia that delayed network build outs and the timing of customer code freezes, each affected in part due to COVID-19-related issues. In March 2020, we closed all of our offices, suspended non-essential travel, cancelled or postponed Fastly-sponsored in-person events, and we are not permitting in-person employee attendance at industry events or work-related meetings. We have instead shifted to hosting virtual events, including Altitude, our signature Fastly event. We may take further actions that alter our operations as may be required by federal, state, or local authorities, or which we determine are in our best interests. While much of our operations can be performed remotely, certain activities such as expanding and maintaining our network of POPs around the world often require personnel to be on-site, and our ability to carry out these activities have been, and may continue to be negatively impacted if our employees or local data center personnel are not able to travel. In addition, travel restrictions have affected our ability to conduct audits of our data centers and facilities, requiring us to use alternative procedures to the standard on-site visit. Any inability to complete these audits could affect our compliance certifications and cause customers to reduce or cease using our services. In addition, for activities that may be conducted remotely, there is no guarantee that we will be as effective while working remotely because our team is dispersed and many employees and their families have been negatively affected, mentally or physically, by the COVID-19 pandemic. Decreased effectiveness and availability of our team could harm our business. Moreover, our finance organization\u2019s ability to ensure that we comply with the requirements of Section 404 may be impaired in the future, including the ability of our registered public accounting firm to issue an attestation report on management\u2019s assessment of our internal control over financial reporting. Furthermore, we may decide to postpone or cancel planned investments in our business in response to changes in our business as a result of the spread of COVID-19, which may impact our ability to attract and retain customers and our rate of innovation, either of which could harm our business.\nIn addition, while the potential impact and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy and our business in particular may be difficult to assess or predict, the pandemic has resulted in, and may continue to result in, significant disruption of global financial markets, and may reduce our ability to access capital, which could negatively affect our liquidity in the future.\nWe do not yet know the full extent of potential delays or impacts on our business, operations, or the global economy as a whole. While the spread of COVID-19 may eventually be contained or mitigated, there is no guarantee that a future outbreak of this or any other widespread epidemics will not occur, or that the global economy will recover, either of which could harm our business.\nFor additional details, refer to our risk factors included in Part I. Item 1A. of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nKey Business Metrics\nWe regularly review a number of metrics, including the key metrics presented in the table below, to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, prepare financial projections, and make strategic decisions. The calculation of the key metrics and other measures discussed below may differ from other similarly titled metrics used by other companies, securities analysts, or investors.\nWe recently completed the acquisition of Signal Sciences and are currently integrating our business operations. The financial results of Signal Sciences from the acquisition date on October 1, 2020 have been consolidated into our financial results for 2020 and the quarter ended December 31, 2020. We have provided separate Fastly (excluding Signal Sciences) and Signal Sciences customer count metrics, such as the total customer count and total enterprise customer count. Separately, we\nhave excluded Signal Sciences from certain key metrics this quarter, including DBNER, NRR and LTM NRR. We intend to begin reporting consolidated customer metrics later in 2021.\nAs of December 31,\n2020 2019\nNumber of customers (as of end of period) (excludes Signal Sciences) 2,084 1,743\nNumber of enterprise customers (as of end of period) (excludes Signal Sciences) 324 288\nNumber of customers (as of end of period) (Signal Sciences) 280 -\nNumber of enterprise customers (as of end of period) (Signal Sciences) 78 -\nDollar-Based Net Expansion Rate (\"DBNER\") (trailing 12 months) (excludes Signal Sciences) 142.9 % 135.5 %\nNRR (as of end of period) (excludes Signal Sciences) 114.5 % 143.7 %\nLTM NRR (trailing 12 months) (excludes Signal Sciences) 136.5 % 131.6 %\nNumber of Customers\nWe believe that the number of customers is an important indicator of the adoption of our platform. Our definition of a customer consists of identifiable operating entities with which we have a billing relationship in good standing, from which we recognized revenue during the period, and are active as of the end of the period. In addition to our paying customers, we also have trial, developer, nonprofit and open source program, and other non-paying accounts that are excluded from our customer count metric. Excluding Signal Sciences, as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had 2,084 and 1,743 customers, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, Signal Sciences had 280 total customers, some of which overlap with existing Fastly customers.\nNumber of Enterprise Customers\nHistorically our revenue has been driven primarily by a subset of customers who have leveraged our platform substantially from a usage standpoint. These enterprise customers are defined as customers with revenue in excess of $100,000 over the previous 12-month period. Excluding Signal Sciences, as of December 31, 2020, we had 324 enterprise customers which generated 89% of our revenue for the trailing 12 months ended December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2019, we had 288 enterprise customers which generated 87% of our revenue for the trailing 12 months ended December 31, 2019. We believe the recruitment and cultivation of enterprise customers is critical to our long-term success. As of December 31, 2020, Signal Sciences had 78 enterprise customers, some of which overlap with existing Fastly enterprise customers. Signal Sciences enterprise customers are defined as customers that spend $100,000 or more on an annualized basis, in other words, spending $8,333.34 or more per month as of December 31, 2020.\nDollar-Based Net Expansion Rate (\"DBNER\") (Excludes Signal Sciences)\nOur ability to generate and increase our revenue is dependent upon our ability to increase the number of new customers and usage of our platform and increase the purchase of additional products by our existing customers. We track our growth, in part, by measuring DBNER. Our DBNER increases when customers increase their usage of our platform or purchase additional products, and declines when they reduce their usage, benefit from lower pricing on their existing usage, or curtail their purchases of additional products. We believe DBNER is a key metric in measuring the long-term value of our customer relationships and our ability to grow our revenue through increased usage of our platform and purchase of additional products by our existing customers. However, our calculation of DBNER indicates only expansion among continuing customers and does not indicate any decrease in revenue attributable to former customers, which may differ from similar metrics of other companies.\nWe calculate DBNER by dividing the revenue for a given period from customers who remained customers as of the last day of the given period (\"current period\") by the revenue from the same customers for the same period measured one year prior (\"base period\"). The revenue included in the current period excludes revenue from (i) customers that churned after the end of the base period and (ii) new customers that entered into a customer agreement after the end of the base period. For example, to calculate our DBNER for the trailing 12 months ended December 31, 2020, we divide (i) revenue for the trailing 12 months ended December 31, 2020, from customers that entered into a customer agreement prior to January 1, 2020, and that remained customers as of December 31, 2020, by (ii) revenue for the trailing 12 months ended December 31, 2019 from the same set of customers.\nFor the trailing 12 months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 our DBNER was 142.9% and 135.5%, respectively. We believe that an annual cohort analysis of our customers demonstrates our success in customer expansion. Once a customer begins to generate revenue for us, they tend to increase their usage of our platform, in particular in their second year. Customer accounts acquired in 2018, 2019, and 2020 are referred to as the 2018 Cohort, 2019 Cohort, and 2020 Cohort, respectively. As described above, our customers tend to increase their usage of our platform in their second year, which is typically followed by more modest increases in usage, if any, in ensuing years. For example, the DBNER for the 2018 Cohort was 310.6% for the year ended December 31, 2019. However, the DBNER for the 2018 Cohort was 163.2% for the year ended December 31, 2020, which generally represents their third year as a customer, depending on when they entered into a customer agreement. While DBNER may fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on, among other things, the timing associated with new customer accounts, we expect our DBNER to decrease as customers that have used our platform for more than two years become a larger portion of both our overall customer base and the revenue that we use to calculate DBNER.\nWe separately monitor customer retention and churn on an annual basis by measuring our annual revenue retention rate, which we calculate by multiplying the final full month of revenue from a customer that terminated its contract with us (a \"Churned Customer\") by the number of months remaining in the same calendar year (\"Annual Revenue Churn\"). The quotient of the Annual Revenue Churn from all of our Churned Customers divided by our annual revenue of the same calendar year is then subtracted from 100% to determine our annual revenue retention rate. We believe this calculation is helpful in that it is based on the amount of revenue that we would expect to have received in the remaining portion of a particular period had a customer not terminated its contract with us. It is not indicative of the actual revenue contribution from churned customers in past periods. By comparing this amount to actual revenue for the period, we are able to assess our ability to replace terminated revenue by generating revenue from new and continuing customers. Excluding Signal Sciences, our annual revenue retention rate for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was 99.0% and 99.3%, respectively.\nNet Retention Rate (\"NRR\") and Last-Twelve Months Net Retention Rate (\"LTM NRR\") (Excludes Signal Sciences)\nOur ability to generate and increase our revenue is also dependent upon our ability to retain our existing customers. In addition to measuring expansion using DBNER, NRR and LTM NRR also allow us to track customer retention which demonstrates the stickiness of our edge cloud platform.\nOur NRR measures the net change in monthly revenue from existing customers in the last month of the period (the \u201ccurrent\" period month) compared to the last month of the same period one year prior (the \u201cprior\" period month), and includes revenue contraction due to billing decreases or customer churn, revenue expansion due to billing increases, but excludes revenue from new customers. We believe the LTM NRR is supplemental as it removes some of the volatility inherent in a usage-based business model from the measurement of the NRR metric. We calculate Net Retention Rate by dividing the revenue from the current period month by the revenue in the prior period month. For the last month of the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 our NRR was 114.5% and 143.7%, respectively.\nOur LTM NRR is intended to be supplemental to our NRR as we believe that it removes some of the volatility that is inherent in a usage-based business model. We calculate LTM NRR by dividing the total customer revenue for the prior twelve-month period (\u201cprior 12-month period\u201d) ending at the beginning of the last twelve-month period (\u201cLTM period\u201d) minus revenue contraction due to billing decreases or customer churn, plus revenue expansion due to billing increases during the LTM period from the same customers by the total prior 12-month period revenue. For the last month of the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 our LTM NRR was 136.5% and 131.6%, respectively.\nKey Components of Statement of Operations\nRevenue\nWe derive our revenue primarily from usage-based fees earned from customers using our platform. We also earn fixed-rate recurring revenue from certain products, services and subscriptions.\nOur usage-based fees earned from customers using our platform are generally billed in arrears. Our security products are primarily annual subscriptions that are billed in advance. Many customers have tiered usage pricing which reflects discounted rates as usage increases. For most contracts, usage charges are determined on a monthly basis based on actual usage within the\nmonth and do not impact usage charges within any other month. Our larger customers often enter into contracts that contain minimum billing commitments and reflect discounted pricing associated with such usage levels.\nWe define U.S. revenue as revenue from customers that have a billing address in the United States, and we define international revenue as revenue from customers that have a billing address outside of the United States. Our revenue has been and will continue to be impacted by new and existing customers\u2019 usage of our products, international expansion, and the success of our sales efforts.\nCost of Revenue and Gross Margin\nCost of revenue consists primarily of fees paid for bandwidth, peering, and colocation. Cost of revenue also includes personnel costs, such as salaries, benefits, bonuses, and stock-based compensation for our customer support and infrastructure employees, and non-personnel costs, such as amortization of capitalized internal-use software development costs, depreciation of our network equipment and amortization of our intangible assets. Our arrangements with network service providers require us to pay fees based on bandwidth use, in some cases subject to minimum commitments, which may be underutilized. We expect our cost of revenue to continue to increase on an absolute basis and may increase as a percentage of revenue.\nOur gross margin has been and will continue to be affected by a number of factors, including the timing and extent of our investments in our operations, our ability to manage our network service providers and cloud infrastructure-related fees, the timing of amortization of capitalized software development costs, depreciation of our network equipment, and the extent to which we periodically choose to pass on our cost savings from network optimization efforts to our customers in the form of lower usage rates.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs, including salaries, benefits, bonuses, and stock-based compensation. Research and development expenses also include cloud infrastructure fees for development and testing, amortization of capitalized internal-use software development costs, and an allocation of our general overhead expenses. We capitalize the portion of our software development costs that meet the criteria for capitalization.\nWe continue to focus our research and development efforts on adding new features and products including new use cases, improving the efficiency and performance of our network, and increasing the functionality of our existing products. Over the long term we expect our research and development expenses to decrease as a percentage of our revenue. However, our research and development expenses may fluctuate as a percentage of our revenue from period to period due to the timing and extent of these expenses.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel costs, including commissions for our sales employees, salaries, benefits, bonuses, and stock-based compensation. Sales and marketing expenses also include expenditures related to advertising, marketing, our brand awareness activities, costs related to our Altitude conferences, professional services fees, amortization of our intangible assets and an allocation of our general overhead expenses.\nWe focus our sales and marketing efforts on generating awareness of our company, platform and products, creating sales leads, and establishing and promoting our brand, both domestically and internationally. We plan to increase our investment in sales and marketing by hiring additional sales and marketing personnel, expanding our sales channels, driving our go-to-market strategies, building our brand awareness, and sponsoring additional marketing events. Over the long term, we expect our sales and marketing expenses to decrease as a percentage of our revenue. However, our sales and marketing expenses may fluctuate as a percentage of our revenue from period to period due to the timing and extent of these expenses.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs, including salaries, benefits, bonuses, and stock-based compensation for our accounting, finance, legal, trust, human resources and administrative support personnel, and executives. General and administrative expenses also include costs related to legal and other professional services fees, sales and other taxes, depreciation and amortization, an allocation of our general overhead expenses, bad debt expense and\nacquisition-related costs. We expect that we will incur costs associated with supporting the growth of our business, our operation as a public company, and to meet the increased compliance requirements associated with our international expansion.\nOur general and administrative expenses include a significant amount of sales and other taxes to which we are subject based on the manner we sell and deliver our products. Historically, we have not collected such taxes from our customers and have therefore recorded such taxes as general and administrative expenses. We expect that these expenses will decline in future years as we continue to implement our sales tax collection mechanisms and start collecting these taxes from our customers.\nOverall, we expect our general and administrative expenses to continue to increase on an absolute basis and may increase as a percentage of revenue in future periods. Over the long term, we expect our general and administrative expenses to decrease as a percentage of our revenue.\nIncome Taxes\nOur income tax benefit is primarily the result of a reduction in the valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets. In connection with the acquisition of Signal Science, the Company recorded a net deferred tax liability which provides an additional source of taxable income to support the realization of the pre-existing deferred tax assets. Our income tax benefit is partially offset by income taxes from certain foreign jurisdictions where we conduct business and state minimum income taxes in the United States. We have a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, including net operating loss carryforwards. We expect to maintain this valuation allowance for the foreseeable future.\nResults of Operations\nThe following tables set forth our results of operations for the period presented and as a percentage of our revenue for that period.\nYear ended\nDecember 31,\n2020 2019 2018\n(in thousands)\nConsolidated Statement of Operations:\nRevenue $ 290,874 $ 200,462 $ 144,563\nCost of revenue(1)\n120,007 88,322 65,499\nGross profit 170,867 112,140 79,064\nOperating expenses:\nResearch and development(1)\n74,814 46,492 34,618\nSales and marketing(1)\n101,181 71,097 50,134\nGeneral and administrative(1)\n102,084 41,099 23,450\nTotal operating expenses 278,079 158,688 108,202\nLoss from operations (107,212) (46,548) (29,138)\nInterest income\n1,628 3,287 939\nInterest expense\n(1,549) (5,236) (1,810)\nOther expenses, net\n(279) (2,561) (741)\nLoss before income tax expense (benefit) (107,412) (51,058) (30,750)\nIncome tax expense (benefit) (11,480) 492 185\nNet loss attributable to common stockholders $ (95,932) $ (51,550) $ (30,935)\n__________\n(1)Includes stock-based compensation expense as follows:\nYear ended December 31,\n2020 2019 2018\n(in thousands)\nCost of revenue $ 3,889 $ 1,410 $ 265\nResearch and development 17,112 2,920 1,332\nSales and marketing 17,028 3,497 1,023\nGeneral and administrative 26,404 4,318 1,459\nTotal $ 64,433 $ 12,145 $ 4,079\nYear ended December 31,\n2020 2019 2018\nConsolidated Statements of Operations, as a percentage of revenue:*\nRevenue 100 % 100 % 100 %\nCost of revenue 41 44 45\nGross profit 59 56 55\nOperating expenses:\nResearch and development 26 23 24\nSales and marketing 35 35 35\nGeneral and administrative 35 21 16\nTotal operating expenses 96 79 75\nLoss from operations (37) (23) (20)\nInterest income 1 2 1\nInterest expense (1) (3) (1)\nOther expenses, net - (1) (1)\nLoss before income taxes (37) (25) (21)\nIncome taxes (4) - -\nNet loss attributable to common stockholders (41) % (25) % (21) %\n__________\n* Columns may not add up to 100% due to rounding.\nRevenue\nYear ended December 31,\n2020 2019 2018 2019 to 2020 Change 2018 to 2019 Change\n(in thousands)\nRevenue $ 290,874 $ 200,462 $ 144,563 45 % 39 %\n2020 compared to 2019\nRevenue was $290.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $200.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $90.4 million, or 45%.\nWe recently completed the acquisition of Signal Sciences and are currently in the midst of integrating our business operations. The financial results of Signal Sciences have been consolidated into our financial results for 2020 and the quarter ended December 31, 2020. We have not included Signal Sciences in most of our key metrics this quarter and intend to report consolidated key metrics later in 2021. Excluding Signal Sciences, we had 2,084 customers and 324 enterprise customers as of December 31, 2020. We had 1,743 customers and 288 enterprise customers as of December 31, 2019. This represents an increase of 341, or 20%, in customers and 36, or 13%, in enterprise customers from December 31, 2019. As of December 31,\n2020, Signal Sciences had 280 customers and 78 enterprise customers, some of which overlap with existing Fastly customers and enterprise customers.\nApproximately 94% of our revenue in the year ended December 31, 2020 was driven by usage on our platform, primarily from existing customers, as revenue from new customers contributed less than 10% of our revenue, and includes revenue from Signal Sciences after the acquisition date. The proportion of the revenue contribution between new and existing customers is consistent with typical customer behavior as customers tend to contribute more revenue over time as their use of the platform increases. The remainder of our revenue was generated by our other products and services, including support and professional services.\nU.S. revenue was $196.5 million and 68% of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020, and $142.8 million and 71% of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019. This represents an increase of $53.7 million, or 38%. International revenue was $94.3 million and 32% of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020, and $57.6 million and 29% of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019. This represents an increase of $36.7 million, or 64%.\nExcluding Signal Sciences, we had 1,016 domestic customers and 1,068 international customers as of December 31, 2020. This is an increase in domestic customers of 125, or 14%, and an increase in international customers of 216, or 25%, compared to December 31, 2019.\n2019 compared to 2018\nRevenue was $200.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $144.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $55.9 million, or 39%.\nWe had 1,743 customers and 288 enterprise customers as of December 31, 2019. We had 1,582 customers and 227 enterprise customers as of December 31, 2018. This was an increase of 161, or 10%, in customers and 61, or 27%, in enterprise customers from December 31, 2018.\nApproximately 93% of our revenue in 2019 was driven by usage on our platform, primarily from existing customers, as revenue from new customers contributed less than 10% of our revenue. The proportion of the revenue contribution between new and existing customers is consistent with typical customer behavior as customers tend to contribute more revenue over time as their use of the platform increases. The remainder of our revenue was generated by our other products and services, including support and professional services.\nU.S. revenue was $142.8 million and 71% of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019. U.S. revenue was $110.8 million and 77% of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018. This was an increase of $32.0 million, or 29%, from U.S. revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018. International revenue was $57.6 million and 29% of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019. International revenue was $33.8 million and 23% of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018. This was an increase of $23.9 million, or 71%, from international revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nWe had 891 domestic customers and 852 international customers as of December 31, 2019. This was an increase in domestic customers of 30, or 3%, compared to December 31, 2018, and an increase in international customers of 131, or 18%, compared to December 31, 2018.\nCost of Revenue\nYear ended December 31,\n2020 2019 2018 2019 to 2020 Change 2018 to 2019 Change\n(in thousands)\nCost of revenue $ 120,007 $ 88,322 65,499 36 % 35 %\n2020 compared to 2019\nCost of revenue was $120.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $88.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $31.7 million, or 36%. The increase in cost of revenue was primarily due to an increase in bandwidth costs of $12.5 million, an increase in colocation costs of $3.8 million, and an increase in other network costs of $2.4 million due to increased traffic on our platform. There was an increase in depreciation and amortization expense of $6.9 million as we continue to invest in our platform, which includes $2.5 million of amortization of intangible assets acquired from the Signal Sciences acquisition. There was also a $6.1 million increase in personnel costs, such as salaries, benefits, and stock-based compensation, due to the increased headcount to support the growth of our business, including an $0.8 million increase related to the increased headcount and personnel costs associated with the Signal Sciences acquisition. There was also an increase of $1.3 million in software costs. The increases were partially offset by a $1.3 million decrease due to an overall reduction in travel costs due to COVID-19.\n2019 compared to 2018\nCost of revenue was $88.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $65.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $22.8 million, or 35%. The increase in cost of revenue was due to an increase in bandwidth costs of $6.2 million, an increase of colocation costs of $3.9 million, and an increase in other network costs of $2.5 million due to increased traffic on our platform. Personnel costs, such a salaries, benefits, and stock-based compensation increased by $5.5 million due to an increase in headcount to support the growth of our business. Depreciation and amortization expense increased by $2.9 million due to increased investments in our platform. Travel costs increased by $0.7 million due to travel associated with the deployment of new POPs. Software license costs increased by $0.5 million.\nGross Profit and Gross Margin\nYear ended December 31,\n2020 2019 2018 2019 to 2020 Change 2018 to 2019 Change\n(in thousands)\nGross profit $ 170,867 $ 112,140 $ 79,064 52 % 42 %\nGross margin 59 % 56 % 55 % 3 % 1 %\n2020 compared to 2019\nGross profit was $170.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $112.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $58.7 million, or 52%. Gross margin was 59% for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 56% for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of 3%. The improvements to our gross profit and gross margin were due to the better optimization of our platform, such that our revenue from usage of our platform was outpacing the increase in associated costs of revenue. This improvement was offset by lower gross margins related to Signal Sciences, related to the impact of purchase accounting adjustments including a reduction of deferred revenue and amortization of intangible assets.\n2019 compared to 2018\nGross profit was $112.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $79.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $33.1 million, or 42%. The increase in gross profit is due to an increase in revenue from usage of our platform.\nGross margin was 56% for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 55% for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of 1%. The increase is due to better utilization of our platform.\nOperating Expenses\nYear ended December 31,\n2020 2019 2018 2019 to 2020 Change 2018 to 2019 Change\n(in thousands)\nResearch and development $ 74,814 $ 46,492 $ 34,618 61 % 34 %\nSales and marketing 101,181 71,097 50,134 42 % 42 %\nGeneral and administrative 102,084 41,099 23,450 148 % 75 %\nTotal operating expenses $ 278,079 $ 158,688 $ 108,202 75 % 47 %\nPercentage of revenue:\nResearch and development 26 % 23 % 24 % (3) % 1 %\nSales and marketing 35 % 35 % 35 % - % - %\nGeneral and administrative 35 % 21 % 16 % (14) % (5) %\nResearch and development-2020 compared to 2019\nResearch and development expenses were $74.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $46.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $28.3 million, or 61%. This is primarily due to an increase of $31.0 million of personnel related costs due to an increase in headcount and an increase in stock-based compensation expense. The increase in personnel costs includes $3.9 million related to the increased headcount and personnel costs associated with the Signal Sciences acquisition. There was also a $0.7 million increase in data center costs, which was offset by an increase in the capitalization for internal-use software of $3.3 million. The increase is also partially offset by a $2.5 million decrease due to an overall reduction in travel costs due to COVID-19.\nResearch and development-2019 compared to 2018\nResearch and development expenses were $46.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $34.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $11.9 million, or 34%. This is primarily due to an increase of $8.1 million of personnel related costs, such as salaries, benefits, and stock-based compensation, due to an increase in headcount and stock-based compensation expense. Software license costs increased by $1.6 million. Travel costs increased by $1.2 million. Facilities and information system costs increased by $0.9 million.

This is primarily due to an increase of $21.3 million of personnel related costs, such as salaries, sales commissions, benefits, and stock-based compensation, due to an increase in headcount and stock-based compensation expense. The increase in personnel costs includes $6.0 million related to the increased headcount and personnel costs associated with the Signal Sciences acquisition. We also recorded $4.8 million of stock-based compensation and $0.6 million of severance relating to an employee termination in the second quarter of 2020. The increase is also driven by $2.6 million of amortization of certain intangible assets acquired from the Signal Science acquisition, in addition to a $1.1 million increase in professional fees, a $0.8 million increase in software costs, and a $0.6 million increase in marketing costs. The increase is partially offset by a $2.7 million decrease due to an overall reduction in travel costs due to COVID-19.\nSales and marketing-2019 compared to 2018\nSales and marketing expenses were $71.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $50.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $21.0 million, or 42%. This is primarily due to a $13.2 million increase in personnel related costs, such as salaries, sales commissions, benefits, and stock-based compensation, due to an increase in headcount, and an increase in stock-based compensation expense.

This is primarily due to an increase of $31.4 million of personnel related costs, such as salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation, due to an increase in headcount and stock-based compensation. The increase in personnel costs includes $12.7 million related to the increased headcount and personnel costs associated with the Signal Sciences acquisition. We also incurred $19.5 million of acquisition-related expenses. The increase is also driven by a $6.3 million increase in external professional services such as legal, accounting, and enterprise systems, and a $1.2 million increase in business insurance costs to support the growth of our business as a public company including our efforts to comply with the regulations of SOX. We also had a $1.4 million increase in bad debt expenses due to an increase in revenue and due to impacts of COVID-19 on certain customers. We also recorded a $1.2 million increase in uncollected sales tax reserve due to an increase in revenue, as well as a $1.0 million increase in software licenses. The increase is partially offset by a $1.0 million decrease due to an overall reduction in travel costs due to COVID-19, and a $0.9 million decrease in corporate and overhead costs.\nGeneral and administrative-2019 compared to 2018\nGeneral and administrative costs were $41.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $23.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $17.6 million, or 75%. This is primarily due to an increase of $8.5 million of personnel related costs, such as salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation, due to an increase in headcount and an increase in stock-based compensation expense.

This decrease is primarily due to a tax benefit recognized related to the acquisition of Signal Sciences. Please refer to Note 12 - Income Taxes for further details.\n2019 compared to 2018\nIncome tax expense was $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $0.3 million or 166%. This increase is primarily due increase in taxes in our foreign jurisdictions.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities totaling $214.6 million. Our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities primarily consisted of bank deposits and money market funds held at major financial institutions and investment-grade commercial paper and corporate debt securities. As of December 31, 2020, our marketable securities balance includes $20.3 million of marketable securities classified as long term investments.\nOn May 21, 2019, upon the completion of our IPO, we received net proceeds of $192.5 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions, from sales of 12,937,500 shares of our Class A common stock in the IPO. The net proceeds include additional proceeds of $25.1 million, net of underwriters' discounts and commissions, from the exercise of the underwriters' option to purchase an additional 1,687,500 shares of our Class A common stock.\nOn May 26, 2020, we completed a follow-on public offering in which we sold 6,900,000 shares of Class A common stock, which included 900,000 shares sold pursuant to the exercise by the underwriters of an option to purchase additional shares, at the public offering price of $41.50 per share. We received net proceeds of $274.9 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions, from sales of our shares in the public offering.\nTo date, we have financed our operations primarily through equity issuances, payments received from customers, the net proceeds we received through sales of equity securities, and borrowings under our credit facilities. Our principal uses of cash in recent periods have been funding our operations and capital expenditures. We also enter into finance leases to finance our infrastructure assets in co-location facilities that we directly lease and operate.\nWe believe that our cash and cash equivalents balances, our credit facilities, and the cash flows generated by our operations will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months. We have generated losses from operations in the past and expect to continue to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future due to the investments we intend to make and may require additional capital resources to execute strategic initiatives to grow our business.\nCash Collateralized Revolving Credit Agreement\nIn November 2019, we entered into a Revolving Credit Agreement for an aggregate commitment amount of $70.0 million with a maturity date of November 3, 2022 (the \"Revolver\"). The amount of borrowings available under the Revolving Credit Agreement at any time were collateralized by our cash. The interest rate associated with each advance under the Revolving Credit Agreement was equal to the sum of LIBOR for the applicable interest period plus 1.50%, which was a per annum rate based on outstanding borrowings. The commitment fee was 0.20% per annum based on the average daily unused amount of the commitment amount. Interest payments on outstanding borrowings were due on the last day of each interest period and payments for the commitment fee were due at the end of each calendar quarter.\nIn November 2020, we terminated the Revolving Credit Agreement. Please refer to Note 9 - Debt Instruments for details on the subsequent termination of our Revolving Credit Agreement.\nOn January 28, 2021, we entered into an additional finance lease agreement with the equipment provider for $2.0 million in network equipment at an annual interest rate of 4.89% over a term of three years. The agreement provides for a bargain purchase price at the end of the term. The amortization of leased assets is included in depreciation and amortization expense.\nOn February 16, 2021, we entered into a Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement (\"Credit Agreement\") with Silicon Valley Bank for an aggregate commitment amount of $100.0 million. The Credit Agreement bears interest at a rate per annum equal to the sum of LIBOR for the applicable interest period plus 1.75% - 2.00%, depending on the average daily outstanding balance of all loans and letters of credit under the Credit Agreement. Interest payments on outstanding borrowings are due on the last day of each interest period. The Credit Agreement has a commitment fee on the unused portion of the borrowing commitment, which is payable on the last day of each calendar quarter at a rate per annum of 0.20% - 0.25% depending on the average daily outstanding balance of all loans and letters of credit under the Credit Agreement. In addition, our Credit Agreement contains a financial covenant that requires us to maintain a consolidated adjusted quick ratio of at least 1:25 to 1:00 tested on a quarterly basis as well as a springing revenue growth covenant for certain periods if our consolidated adjusted quick ratio falls below 1.75 to 1:00 on the last day of any fiscal quarter.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the period indicated:\nYear ended December 31,\n2020 2019 2018\n(in thousands)\nCash used in operating activities $ (19,916) $ (31,303) $ (16,985)\nCash used in investing activities (275,023) (87,678) (47,107)\nCash provided by financing activities 272,739 168,148 69,637\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, cash used in operating activities consisted primarily of our net loss of $95.9 million adjusted for non-cash items, including $20.0 million of depreciation and amortization, $5.1 million of amortization related to acquired intangibles, $64.4 million of stock-based compensation expense, $21.8 million of lease amortization expense, amortization of deferred contract costs of $3.5 million and bad debt expense of $1.7 million.

Purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancellable without penalty. Our purchase obligations exclude our operating lease commitments associated with our colocation arrangements which have been separately disclosed under our operating lease commitments.\n(3) Finance lease obligations represents principal and interest payments under our networking equipment leases.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements and do not have any holdings in variable interest entities.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs, expenses, and related disclosures. Actual results and outcomes could differ significantly from our estimates, judgments, and assumptions. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our future financial statement presentation, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows will be affected.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services. The processing and recording of certain revenue requires a manual process, and therefore we use a complex set of procedures to generate complete and accurate data to record its revenue transactions. We enter into contracts that can include various combinations of products and services, each of which are distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations. Revenue is recognized net of any taxes collected from customers, which are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities.\nA performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer and is the unit of account. Our contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. Determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment. For contracts with multiple performance obligations, we allocate the contract transaction price to each performance obligation using our estimate of the standalone selling price (\"SSP\") of each distinct good or service in the contract.\nJudgment is required to determine the SSP for each distinct performance obligation. We analyze separate sales of our products and services as a basis for estimating the SSP of our products and services. We then use that SSP as the basis for allocating the transaction price when our product and services are sold together in a contract with multiple performance obligations. In instances where SSP is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the product or service separately, we determine the SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. We typically have more than one SSP for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by customers and circumstances. In these instances, we may use information, such as geographic region and distribution channel, in determining the SSP.\nThe transaction price in a contract for usage-based services is typically equal to the minimum commit price in the contract less any discounts provided. The transaction price in a contract that does not contain usage-based services is equal to the total contract value. Because our typical contracts represent distinct services delivered over time with the same pattern of transfer to the customer, usage-based consideration primarily related to actual consumption over the minimum commit levels is allocated to the period to which it relates. The amount of consideration recognized for usage above the minimum commit price is limited to the amount we expect to be entitled to receive in exchange for providing services. We have elected to apply the practical expedient for estimating and disclosing the variable consideration when variable consideration is allocated entirely to a wholly unsatisfied performance obligation or to a wholly unsatisfied promise to transfer a distinct good or service that forms part of a single performance obligation from our remaining performance obligations under these contracts.\nPerformance obligations represent stand-ready obligations that are satisfied over time as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by us. These obligations can be content delivery, security, subscription services, professional services, support, edge cloud platform services, and others. Accordingly, our revenue is recognized over time, consistent with the pattern of benefit provided to the customer over the term of the agreement.\nAt times, customers may request changes that either amend, replace, or cancel existing contracts. Judgment is required to determine whether the specific facts and circumstances within the contracts should be accounted for as a separate contract or as a modification.\nIn contracts where there are timing differences between when we transfer a promised good or service to the customer and when the customer pays for that good or service, we have determined our contracts do not include a significant financing component. We have also elected the practical expedient to not measure financing components for any contract where the timing difference is less than one year.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe account for stock-based employee compensation plans under the fair value recognition and measurement provisions, which require all stock-based payments, including grants of stock options, restricted stock units (\"RSUs\"), restricted stock awards (\"RSAs\"), performance stock awards (\"PSUs\") and shares issued under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan (\"ESPP\") to be measured based on the grant-date fair value of the award and recognized as expense over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective award. We account for forfeitures as they occur.\nThe fair value of RSUs and RSAs granted to our employees and directors is based on the grant date fair value. The fair value of PSUs granted to our employees is based on the fair value determined when the performance metrics were set. The fair value of stock options granted to our employees and directors, and of the shares to be issued under our ESPP are based on the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The determination of the fair value of a stock-based award is affected by the deemed fair value of the underlying stock price on the grant date, as well as assumptions regarding a number of other complex and subjective variables. These variables include the fair value of our common stock, the expected stock price volatility over the expected term of the options, stock option exercise and cancellation behaviors, risk-free interest rates, and expected dividends:\nThese assumptions and estimates are as follows:\n\u2022Fair Value of Common Stock. We use the market closing price of our Class A common stock, as reported on the New York Stock Exchange, for the fair value. Prior to our IPO, our board of directors considered numerous objective and subjective factors to determine the fair value of our common stock at each meeting at which awards are approved. These factors included, but were not limited to (i) contemporaneous third-party valuations of Common Stock; (ii) the rights and preferences of Series Preferred relative to Common Stock; (iii) the lack of marketability of Common Stock; (iv) developments in the business; and (v) the likelihood of achieving a liquidity event, such as an IPO or sale of the Company, given prevailing market conditions.\n\u2022Expected Term. The expected term represents the period that our stock-based awards are expected to be outstanding. The expected term assumptions were determined based on the vesting terms, exercise terms, and contractual lives of the options. The expected term was estimated using the simplified method allowed under Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) guidance.\n\u2022Volatility. Since we do not have a long trading history of our common stock, the expected volatility is determined based on the historical stock volatilities of its comparable companies. Comparable companies consist of public companies in our industry, which are similar in size, stage of life cycle, and financial leverage. We intend to continue to apply this process using the same or similar public companies until a sufficient amount of historical information regarding the volatility of its share price becomes available, or unless circumstances change such that the identified companies are no longer similar to us, in which case, more suitable companies whose share prices are publicly available would be used in the calculation.\n\u2022Risk-free Interest Rate. The risk-free interest rate used in the Black-Scholes option pricing model is the implied yield available on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term equivalent to that of the options for each expected term.\n\u2022Dividend Yield. The expected dividend assumption is based on our current expectations of our anticipated dividend policy. We have no history of paying any dividends and therefore used an expected dividend yield of zero.\nValuation of Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangible Assets in Business Combination\nAccounting for business combinations requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date with respect to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed. We use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately assign fair value to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date as well as the useful lives of those acquired intangible assets. Examples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets and goodwill we have acquired include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from acquired developed technologies; the acquired company\u2019s trade name, existing customer relationships and backlog. These estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable, and if different estimates were used the purchase price for the acquisition could be allocated to the acquired assets and liabilities differently from the allocation that we have made. Additionally, unanticipated events and circumstances may occur, which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results.\nThe authoritative guidance allows a measurement period of up to one year from the date of acquisition to make adjustments to the preliminary allocation of the purchase price. As a result, during the measurement period we may record adjustments to the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill to the extent that it identifies adjustments to the preliminary purchase price allocation. Upon conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments will be recorded to the Consolidated Statement of Operations.\nImpairment of Goodwill, Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets\nGoodwill is the amount by which the cost of acquired net assets in a business combination exceeds the fair value of the net identifiable assets on the date of purchase and is carried at its historical cost. We test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. We determined that we operate as one reporting unit and we perform our annual impairment test of goodwill as of October 31 and whenever events or circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired.\nLong-lived assets, including property and equipment and intangible assets, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances, such as service discontinuance, technological obsolescence, significant decreases in our market capitalization, facility closures, or work-force reductions indicate that the carrying amount of the long-lived asset or asset group may not be recoverable. When such events occur, we compare the carrying amount of the asset or asset group to the undiscounted expected future cash flows related to the asset or asset group. If this comparison indicates that an impairment is present, the amount of the impairment is calculated as the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset or asset group.\nLeases\nWe lease office space and data centers (\"Colocation leases\") under non-cancelable operating leases with various expiration dates through 2027. We also lease server equipment under non-cancelable operating finance leases with various expiration dates through 2024. We determine if an arrangement contains a lease at inception.\nOperating lease right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the present value of the future lease payments at commencement date. The interest rate implicit in our operating leases is not readily determinable, and therefore an incremental borrowing rate is estimated to determine the present value of future payments. The estimated incremental borrowing rate factors in a hypothetical interest rate on a collateralized basis with similar terms, payments, and economic environments. Operating lease right-of-use assets also include any prepaid lease payments and lease incentives.\nCertain of the operating lease agreements contain rent concession, rent escalation, and option to renew provisions. Rent concession and rent escalation provisions are considered in determining the single lease cost to be recorded over the lease term. Single lease cost is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term commencing on the date we have the right to use the leased property. The lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease. We generally use the base, non-cancelable, lease term when recognizing the lease assets and liabilities, unless it is reasonably certain that the option will be exercised. Our lease agreements may contain variable costs such as common area maintenance, operating expenses or other\ncosts. Variable lease costs are expensed as incurred on the consolidated statements of operations. Our lease agreements generally do not contain any residual value guarantees or restrictive covenants.\nWe lease networking equipment from a third party, through equipment finance leases. These leases include a bargain purchase option, resulting in a full transfer of ownership at the completion of the lease term.\nOperating leases are reflected in operating lease right-of-use assets, operating lease liabilities, and operating lease liabilities, non-current on our consolidated balance sheets. Finance leases are included in property and equipment, net, finance lease liabilities, and finance lease liabilities, non-current on our consolidated balance sheets.\nInternal-Use Software Development Costs\nLabor and related costs associated with internal-use software during the application development stage are capitalized. Capitalization of costs begins when the preliminary project stage is completed, management has committed to funding the project, and it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used to perform the function intended. Capitalization ceases at the point when the project is fully tested and substantially complete and is ready for its intended purpose. The capitalized amounts are included in property and equipment, net on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We amortize such costs over the estimated useful life of the software; completed internal-use software that is used on our network is amortized to cost of revenue over its estimated useful life. Costs incurred during the planning, training, and post-implementation stages of the software development life-cycle are expensed as incurred.\nLegal and Other Contingencies\nFrom time to time, we have been and will continue to be subject to legal proceedings and claims. Periodically, we evaluate the status of each legal matter and assess our potential financial exposure. If the potential loss from any legal proceeding or litigation is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, we accrue a liability for the estimated loss. Significant judgment is required to determine the probability of a loss and whether the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. The outcome of any proceeding is not determinable in advance. As a result, the assessment of a potential liability and the amount of accruals recorded are based only on the information available to us at the time. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to the legal proceeding or litigation, and may revise our estimates. Any revisions could have a material effect on our results of operations.\nPlease refer to Note 10-Commitments and Contingencies for discussion around our legal proceedings.\nWe conduct operations in many tax jurisdictions throughout the United States. In many of these jurisdictions, non-income-based taxes, such as sales and use and telecommunications taxes are assessed on our operations. We are subject to indirect taxes, and may be subject to certain other taxes, in some of these jurisdictions. Historically, we have not billed or collected these taxes and, in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we have recorded a provision for our tax exposure in these jurisdictions when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the exposure can be reasonably estimated. As a result, we have recorded a liability of $6.3 million as of December 31, 2020. These estimates are based on several key assumptions, including the taxability of our products, the jurisdictions in which we believe we have nexus and the sourcing of revenues to those jurisdictions. In the event these jurisdictions challenge our assumptions and analysis, our actual exposure could differ materially from our current estimates.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nPlease refer to Note 2-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies included in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.",
    "item_7A": "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\nWe are exposed to certain market risks in the ordinary course of our business. Our market risk exposure is primarily the result of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange and interest rates.\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe had cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities of $214.6 million, as of December 31, 2020, which consisted of bank deposits, money market funds, corporate notes and bonds, commercial paper, U.S. Treasury securities, and asset-backed securities. The cash and cash equivalents are held for working capital purposes. Such interest-earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk. To date, fluctuations in interest income have not been significant. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while generating income without significantly increasing risk. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes and have not used any derivative financial instruments to manage our interest rate risk exposure. Due to the short-term nature of our investments, we have not been exposed to, nor do we anticipate being exposed to, material risks due to changes in interest rates. A hypothetical 10% change in interest rates during the period presented would not have had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nCurrency Exchange Risks\nThe functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar. Therefore, we are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as we convert the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries into U.S. dollars. The local currencies of our foreign subsidiaries are the British pound and Japanese Yen. Our subsidiaries remeasure monetary assets and liabilities at period-end exchange rates, while non-monetary items are remeasured at historical rates. Revenue and expense accounts are remeasured at the average exchange rate in effect during the period. If there is a change in foreign currency exchange rates, the conversion of our foreign subsidiaries\u2019 financial statements into U.S. dollars would result in a realized gain or loss which is recorded in our consolidated statements of operations. We do not currently engage in any hedging activity to reduce our potential exposure to currency fluctuations, although we may choose to do so in the future. A hypothetical 10% change in foreign exchange rates during the period presented would not have had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.",

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated March 1, 2021, expressed an adverse opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting because of a material weakness.\nChange in Accounting Principle\nAs discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company has changed its method of accounting for leases effective January 1, 2020 due to adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 842, Leases.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nAcquisition of Signal Science - Refer to Notes 2 and 5 to the Financial Statements.\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nOn October 01, 2020, the Company completed the acquisition of Signal Sciences. The Company accounted for this acquisition under the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations. Accordingly, the purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values, including developed technology of $49.5 million and customer relationships of $69.1 million related to Signal Sciences.\nWe identified the valuation of the developed technology and customer relationships acquired from Signal Sciences to be a critical audit matter due to the significant judgments made by management to estimate its fair value, particularly the estimates and assumptions related to the forecast of future revenue and the selection of the royalty rate and discount rate. This required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our fair value specialists.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to the forecast of future revenue and the selection of the royalty rate and discount rate for the valuation of the developed technology and customer relationships included the following, among others:\n\u2022We tested the effectiveness of controls over the valuation of developed technology and customer relationships, including management\u2019s controls over the forecast of future revenue and the selection of the royalty rate and discount rate.\n\u2022We evaluated the reasonableness of the forecast of future revenue by comparing the Company\u2019s forecast to (i) the acquired entity\u2019s historical results, (ii) actual results of competitors at similar stages of development, and (iii) certain industry data.\n\u2022We performed inquiries with appropriate individuals within the Company\u2019s operations, engineering and finance departments regarding the forecast of future revenue.\n\u2022We tested the mathematical accuracy of the calculation.\n\u2022We evaluated whether the forecasts of future revenue were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit.\n\u2022With the assistance of our fair value specialists, we evaluated the fair value estimates for developed technology and customer relationships, including developing a range of independent royalty rate and discount rate estimates and comparing those to the royalty and discount rates selected by management, and evaluating whether the fair value model being used is appropriate considering the Company\u2019s circumstances and valuation premise identified.\nRevenue - Refer to Note 3 to the financial statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nRevenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for those products or services. The processing and recording of certain revenue requires a manual process, and therefore the Company uses a complex set of procedures to generate complete and accurate data to record its revenue transactions. For the year ended December 31, 2020, total revenue was $290.9 million, which includes the manually processed revenue.\nWe identified manually processed revenue as a critical audit matter as the Company has a significant volume of manually processed revenue and a complex set of manual procedures to generate complete and accurate data to process and record revenue. This required an increased extent of effort to audit these manually processed revenue transactions.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to manually processed revenue included the following, among others:\n\u2022We tested the effectiveness of controls over the recognition of manually processed revenue.\n\u2022We obtained an understanding of the nature of the manually processed revenue through inquiry with the Company personnel responsible for the invoice as well as review of the contract with the customer.\n\u2022For a sample of manually processed revenue transactions, we recalculated the manually processed revenue and evaluated the accuracy of the data used in our recalculation of manually processed revenue by comparing key attributes utilized in our recalculation to source information and documents, including usage, bandwidth, and other services provided. We compared our recalculation of manually processed revenue transactions to the Company\u2019s recorded revenue and evaluated any differences.\n/s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP\nSan Francisco, California\nMarch 1, 2021\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2014.\nFASTLY, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(in thousands)\nAs of December 31, 2020 As of December 31, 2019\nASSETS\nCurrent assets:\nCash and cash equivalents $ 62,900 $ 16,142\nMarketable securities 131,283 114,967\nAccounts receivable, net of allowance for credit losses of $3,248 and allowance for doubtful accounts of $1,816 as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively\n50,258 37,136\nRestricted cash 87 70,087\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets 16,728 10,991\nTotal current assets 261,256 249,323\nProperty and equipment, net 95,979 60,037\nOperating lease right-of-use assets, net 60,019 -\nGoodwill 635,590 372\nIntangible assets, net 121,742 1,125\nOther assets 45,365 10,112\nTotal assets $ 1,219,951 $ 320,969\nLIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY\nCurrent liabilities:\nAccounts payable $ 9,150 $ 4,602\nAccrued expenses 34,334 19,878\nFinance lease liabilities 11,033 4,472\nOperating lease liabilities, current 19,895 -\nOther current liabilities 19,677 8,169\nTotal current liabilities 94,089 37,121\nLong-term debt, less current portion -

Nature of Business\nFastly, Inc. has built an edge cloud platform that can process, serve, and secure its customer\u2019s applications as close to their end users as possible. Our edge network spans across 56 markets, as of December 31, 2020. We were incorporated in Delaware in 2011 and are headquartered in San Francisco, California.\nAs used herein, \"Fastly,\" \"we,\" \"our,\" \"the Company,\" and similar terms include Fastly, Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless the context indicates otherwise.\nStock Split\nOn May 3, 2019, we implemented a 1-for-2 reverse stock split of our stock. All shares of common stock, stock-based instruments, and per-share data included in these financial statements give effect to the stock split and the changes in authorized shares have been adjusted retroactively for all periods presented.\nInitial Public Offering (\"IPO\")\nOn May 21, 2019 we completed an IPO in which we sold 12,937,500 shares of our newly authorized Class A common stock, which included 1,687,500 shares sold pursuant to the exercise by the underwriters of an option to purchase additional shares, at the public offering price of $16.00 per share. We received net proceeds of $192.5 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions, from sales of our shares in the IPO. The net proceeds include additional proceeds of $25.1 million, net of underwriters' discounts and commissions, from the exercise of the underwriters' option to purchase an additional 1,687,500 shares of our Class A common stock. Prior to the closing of the IPO, all shares of common stock then outstanding were reclassified as Class B common stock.\nImmediately upon the closing of the IPO, all shares of convertible preferred stock then outstanding were converted into 53,630,213 shares of Class B common stock on a one-to-one basis. Prior to the IPO, we had seven outstanding series of convertible preferred stock each with a par value of $0.00002 per share, convertible at the option of the holder, that was classified as temporary equity on our consolidated balance sheet. On May 17, 2019, immediately upon closing of the IPO, our convertible preferred stock was automatically converted to shares of our Class B common stock. As of both December 31, 2019 and 2020, we had zero convertible preferred stock issued or outstanding.\nFollow-on Public Offering\nOn May 26, 2020, we completed a follow-on public offering in which we sold 6,900,000 shares of Class A common stock, which included 900,000 shares sold pursuant to the exercise by the underwriters of an option to purchase additional shares, at the public offering price of $41.50 per share. We received net proceeds of $274.9 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions, from sales of our shares in the public offering.\n2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (\"U.S. GAAP\").\nCertain changes in presentation have been made to conform the prior period presentation to the current period reporting. Such reclassifications did not affect total revenues, operating income, or net income. We have made certain presentation changes to distinguish and disclose as a separate line item, the non-cash amortization expense of our deferred contract costs balance from other assets within operating cash flows in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. With the adoption of the new leasing standard Accounting Standards Codification No. 842, Leases (\"ASC 842\"), we have also made certain presentation changes to distinguish and disclose as separate line items, our current and noncurrent finance leases liabilities from our current and noncurrent debt amounts in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. Actual results and outcomes could differ significantly from our estimates, judgments, and assumptions. Significant estimates, judgments, and assumptions used in these financial statements include, but are not limited to, those related to revenue, accounts receivable and related reserves, fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed for business combinations, useful lives and realizability of long-lived assets, income tax reserves, and accounting for stock-based compensation. Estimates are periodically reviewed in light of changes in circumstances, facts, and experience. The effects of material revisions in estimates are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the period of change and prospectively from the date of the change in estimate.\nThe ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic has impacted many operational aspects of our business and may continue to do so in the future. We assessed the impact that COVID-19 had on our results of operations, including, but not limited to an assessment of our allowance for doubtful accounts, the carrying value of short-term and long-term investments, the carrying value of goodwill and other long-lived assets, and the impact to revenue recognition and cost of revenues. While the COVID-19 pandemic has not had a material adverse impact on our financial operations to date, the future impacts of the pandemic and any resulting economic impact are largely unknown and rapidly evolving. We will continue to actively monitor the impact that COVID-19 has on the results of our business operations, and may make decisions required by federal, state or local authorities, or that are determined to be in the best interests of our employees, customers, partners, suppliers and stockholders. As a result, our estimates and judgments may change materially as new events occur or additional information becomes available to us.\nCash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities\nWe invest our excess cash primarily in short-term fixed income securities, including government and investment-grade debt securities and money market funds. We classify all liquid investments with stated maturities of three months or less from date of purchase as cash equivalents. Marketable securities with original maturities greater than three months from purchase date and remaining maturities less than one year are classified as short-term marketable securities. Marketable securities with remaining maturities greater than one year as of the balance sheet date and which we intend to hold for greater than one year, are classified as long-term marketable securities. The fair market value of cash equivalents at December 31, 2020 and 2019 approximated their carrying value. Cost of securities sold is based on specific identification. We determine the appropriate classification of our investments in marketable securities at the time of purchase and reevaluate such designation at each balance sheet date. We have classified and accounted for our marketable securities as available-for-sale. After considering our capital preservation objectives, as well as our liquidity requirements, we may sell securities prior to their stated maturities. We carry our available-for-sale securities at fair value, and report the unrealized gains and losses as a component of other comprehensive loss, except for unrealized losses determined to be other-than-temporary which are recorded as other expense, net. We determine any realized gains or losses on the sale of marketable securities on a specific identification method and record such gains and losses as a component of other expense, net. Interest earned on cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities was approximately $1.4 million and $3.1 million during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. These balances are recorded in interest income in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Loss.\nWe evaluate the investments periodically for possible other-than-temporary impairment. A decline in fair value below the amortized costs of debt securities is considered an other-than-temporary impairment if we have the intent to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of the entire amortized cost basis. In those instances, an impairment charge equal to the difference between the fair value and the amortized cost basis is recognized in other expense. Regardless of our intent or requirement to sell a debt security, impairment is considered other-than-temporary if we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis.\nRestricted Cash\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had recorded a restricted cash balance of approximately $70.1 million on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet. This restricted cash balance primarily consisted of cash deposited and held in money market funds as collateral underlying the Cash Collateralized Revolving Credit Agreement (\"Revolving Credit Agreement\") entered into on November 4, 2019. Interest income earned on restricted cash was approximately $0.2 million and $0.1 million during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. These balances were recorded in interest income in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. In November 2020, we terminated the Revolving Credit Agreement in accordance with its terms. In connection with the termination of the Revolving Credit Agreement, we repaid the then outstanding aggregate principal amount and the associated restrictions on the collateralized cash of $70.0 million was also released, accordingly.\nAs of December 31, 2020, our remaining restricted cash balance was $1.0 million, of which $0.9 million consists of letters of credit related to its lease arrangements that is collateralized by restricted cash which is classified under other assets.\nAccounts Receivable, net\nAccounts receivable are recorded and carried at the original invoiced amount less an allowance for any potential uncollectible amounts. We determine our trade accounts receivable allowances in line with the current expected credit losses model, based upon the assessment of various factors, such as: historical experience, credit quality of our customers, age of the accounts receivable balances, geographic related risks, economic conditions, and other factors that may affect a customer's ability to pay. Increases and decreases in the allowance for doubtful accounts are included as a component of General and administrative expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. We do not have any off-balance sheet credit exposure related to our customers.\nIncremental Costs to Obtain a Contract with a Customer\nWe capitalize incremental costs associated with obtaining customer contracts, specifically certain commission payments. We pay commissions based on contract value upon signing a new arrangement with a customer and upon renewal and upgrades of existing contracts with customers only if the renewal and upgrades result in an incremental increase in contract value. To the extent that renewals and upgrades do not result in an increase in contract value, no additional commissions are paid. These costs are deferred on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and amortized over the expected period of benefit on a straight-line basis. We also incur commission expense on an ongoing basis based upon revenue recognized. In these cases, no incremental costs are deferred, as the commissions are earned and expensed in the same period for which the associated revenue is recognized. Based on the nature of our unique technology and services, and the rate at which we continually enhance and update our technology, the expected life of the customer arrangement is determined to be approximately five years. Commissions for new arrangements and renewals are both amortized over five years. Amortization is primarily included in sales and marketing\nexpense in the consolidated statements of income. The current portion of deferred commission and incentive payments is included in prepaid expenses and other current assets, and the long-term portion is included in other assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nConcentrations of Credit Risk\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject us to significant concentration of credit risk consist primarily of cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, and accounts receivable. The primary focus of our investment strategy is to preserve capital and meet liquidity requirements. Our investment policy addresses the level of credit exposure by limiting the concentration in any one corporate issuer or sector and establishing a minimum allowable credit rating. To manage the risk exposure, we invest cash equivalents and marketable securities in a variety of fixed income securities, including government and investment-grade debt securities and money market funds. We place our cash primarily in checking and money market accounts with reputable financial institutions. Deposits held with these financial institutions may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits, if any.\nConcentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are primarily limited to certain customers to which we make substantial sales. Our customer base consists of a large number of geographically dispersed customers diversified across several industries. To reduce risk, we routinely assess the financial strength of our customers. Based on such assessments, we believe that our accounts receivable credit risk exposure is limited. No customer accounted for more than 10% of revenue for\nthe years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. One customer accounted for 10% of the total accounts receivable balance as of December 31, 2020. No customer accounted for more than 10% of the total accounts receivable balance as of December 31, 2019.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nOur financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued expenses and debt. Cash equivalents and marketable securities, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued expenses are stated at their carrying value, which approximates fair value due to the short time to the expected receipt or payment date. The carrying amount of our debt approximates fair value as the stated interest rate approximates market rates currently available to us.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization are computed on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The estimated useful life of each asset category is as follows:\nComputer and networking equipment 3-5 years\nLeasehold improvements\nShorter of lease term or 5 years\nFurniture and fixtures 3 years\nOffice equipment 3 years\nInternal-use software 3 years\nWe periodically review the estimated useful lives of property and equipment and any changes to the estimated useful lives are recorded prospectively from the date of the change.\nUpon retirement or sale, the cost of the assets disposed of and the related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts, and any resulting gain or loss is included in other expense, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.\nInternal-Use Software Development Costs\nLabor and related costs associated with internal-use software during the application development stage are capitalized. Capitalization of costs begins when the preliminary project stage is completed, management has committed to funding the project, and it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used to perform the function intended. Capitalization ceases at the point when the project is fully tested and substantially complete and is ready for its intended purpose. The capitalized amounts are included in property and equipment, net on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We amortize such costs over the estimated useful life of the software; completed internal-use software that is used on our network is amortized to cost of revenue over its estimated useful life. Costs incurred during the planning, training, and post-implementation stages of the software development life-cycle are expensed as incurred.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe account for our acquisitions using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires, among other things, allocation of the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values on the acquisition date. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. Acquisition costs, such as legal and consulting fees, are expensed as incurred.\nAccounting for business combinations requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date with respect to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed. We use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately assign fair value to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date as well as the useful lives of those acquired intangible assets. Examples of critical estimates in valuing certain\nof the intangible assets and goodwill we have acquired include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from acquired developed technologies; the acquired company\u2019s trade name, existing customer relationships and backlog. These estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable, and if different estimates were used the purchase price for the acquisition could be allocated to the acquired assets and liabilities differently from the allocation that we have made. Additionally, unanticipated events and circumstances may occur, which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results.\nThe authoritative guidance allows a measurement period of up to one year from the date of acquisition to make adjustments to the preliminary allocation of the purchase price. As a result, during the measurement period we may record adjustments to the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill to the extent that it identifies adjustments to the preliminary purchase price allocation. Upon conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments will be recorded to the Consolidated Statement of Operations.\nGoodwill, Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets\nGoodwill is the amount by which the cost of acquired net assets in a business combination exceeds the fair value of the net identifiable assets on the date of purchase and is carried at its historical cost. We test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. We determined that we operate as one reporting unit and we perform our annual impairment test of goodwill as of October 31 and whenever events or circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. We did not record any impairment to goodwill during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018.\nIntangible assets with determinable economic lives are carried at cost, less accumulated amortization. Amortization is computed over the estimated useful life of each asset on a straight-line basis. We determine the useful lives of identifiable intangible assets after considering the specific facts and circumstances related to each intangible asset. Factors we consider when determining useful lives include the contractual term of any agreement related to the asset, the historical performance of the asset, our long-term strategy for using the asset, any laws or other local regulations which could impact the useful life of the asset and other economic factors, including competition and specific market conditions. Intangible assets without determinable economic lives are carried at cost, not amortized, and reviewed for impairment at least annually.\nThe useful lives of our intangible assets are as follows:\nCustomer relationships 8 years\nDeveloped technology 5 years\nTrade names 3 years\nBacklog 2 years\nDomain names 3 years\nInternet protocol addresses 10 years\nIPR&D Indefinite\nLong-lived assets, including property and equipment and intangible assets, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances, such as service discontinuance, technological obsolescence, significant decreases in our market capitalization, facility closures, or work-force reductions indicate that the carrying amount of the long-lived asset or asset group may not be recoverable. When such events occur, we compare the carrying amount of the asset or asset group to the undiscounted expected future cash flows related to the asset or asset group. If this comparison indicates that an impairment is present, the amount of the impairment is calculated as the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset or asset group.\nLeases\nWe lease office space and data centers (\"Colocation leases\") under non-cancelable operating leases with various expiration dates through 2027. We also lease server equipment under non-cancelable operating finance leases with various expiration dates through 2024. We determine if an arrangement contains a lease at inception.\nOperating lease right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the present value of the future lease payments at commencement date. The interest rate implicit in our operating leases is not readily determinable, and therefore an incremental borrowing rate is estimated to determine the present value of future payments. The estimated incremental borrowing rate factors in a hypothetical interest rate on a collateralized basis with similar terms, payments, and economic environments. Operating lease right-of-use assets also include any prepaid lease payments and lease incentives.\nCertain of the operating lease agreements contain rent concession, rent escalation, and option to renew provisions. Rent concession and rent escalation provisions are considered in determining the single lease cost to be recorded over the lease term. Single lease cost is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term commencing on the date we have the right to use the leased property. The lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease. We generally use the base, non-cancelable, lease term when recognizing the lease assets and liabilities, unless it is reasonably certain that the option will be exercised. Our lease agreements may contain variable costs such as common area maintenance, operating expenses or other costs. Variable lease costs are expensed as incurred on the consolidated statements of operations. Our lease agreements generally do not contain any residual value guarantees or restrictive covenants.\nWe lease networking equipment from a third party, through equipment finance leases. These leases include a bargain purchase option, resulting in a full transfer of ownership at the completion of the lease term.\nOperating leases are reflected in operating lease right-of-use assets, operating lease liabilities, and operating lease liabilities, non-current on our consolidated balance sheets. Finance leases are included in property and equipment, net, finance lease liabilities, and finance lease liabilities, non-current on our consolidated balance sheets.\nConvertible Preferred Stock Warrant Liabilities\nPrior to our IPO, we recorded our warrants to purchase convertible preferred stock as a liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value upon issuance because the warrants were exercisable for contingently redeemable preferred stock which was classified outside of stockholders' deficit. The liability associated with these warrants was subject to remeasurement at each balance sheet date, with changes in fair value recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Loss as other expense, net. Immediately upon closing of the IPO, our warrants to purchase convertible preferred stock were automatically converted to warrants to purchase an equal number of shares of our Class B common stock. As a result, the warrant was remeasured a final time, immediately prior to the closing of the IPO, and reclassified to additional paid-in capital within stockholders' equity. Changes in the fair value were recorded within other expense, net on the Consolidated Statement of Operations.\nRevenue Recognition\nRefer to Note 3, \"Revenues\" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for our Revenue Recognition policy.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue consists primarily of fees paid to network providers for bandwidth and to third-party network data centers for housing servers, also known as colocation costs. Cost of revenue also includes employee costs for network operation, build-out and support and services delivery, network storage costs, cost of managed services and software-as-a-service, depreciation of network equipment used to deliver our services, and amortization of network-related internal-use software. We enter into contracts for bandwidth with third-party network providers with terms of typically one year. These contracts generally commit us to pay minimum monthly fees plus additional fees for bandwidth usage above the committed level. We enter into contracts for colocation services with third-party providers with terms of typically three years.\nResearch and Development Costs\nResearch and development costs consist of primarily payroll and related personnel costs for the design, development, deployment, testing, and enhancement of our edge cloud platform. Costs incurred in the development of our edge cloud platform are expensed as incurred, excluding those expenses which met the criteria for development of internal-use software.\nAdvertising Expense\nWe recognize advertising expense as incurred. We recognized total advertising expense of approximately $3.8 million, $1.4 million, and $0.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.\nAccounting for Stock-Based Compensation\nWe account for stock-based employee compensation plans under the fair value recognition and measurement provisions, which require all stock-based payments, including grants of stock options, restricted stock units (\"RSUs\"), restricted stock awards (\"RSAs\"), performance stock awards (\"PSUs\") and shares issued under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan (\"ESPP\") to be measured based on the grant-date fair value of the award and recognized as expense over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective award. We account for forfeitures as they occur.\nThe fair value of RSUs and RSAs granted to our employees and directors is based on the grant date fair value. The fair value of PSUs granted to our employees is based on the fair value determined when the performance metrics were set. The fair value of stock options granted to our employees and directors, and of the shares to be issued under our ESPP are based on the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The determination of the fair value of a stock-based award is affected by the deemed fair value of the underlying stock price on the grant date, as well as assumptions regarding a number of other complex and subjective variables. These variables include the fair value of our common stock, the expected stock price volatility over the expected term of the options, stock option exercise and cancellation behaviors, risk-free interest rates, and expected dividends:\nThese assumptions and estimates are as follows:\n\u2022Fair Value of Common Stock. We use the market closing price of our Class A common stock, as reported on the New York Stock Exchange, for the fair value. Prior to our IPO, our board of directors considered numerous objective and subjective factors to determine the fair value of our common stock at each meeting at which awards are approved. These factors included, but were not limited to (i) contemporaneous third-party valuations of Common Stock; (ii) the rights and preferences of Series Preferred relative to Common Stock; (iii) the lack of marketability of Common Stock; (iv) developments in the business; and (v) the likelihood of achieving a liquidity event, such as an IPO or sale of the Company, given prevailing market conditions.\n\u2022Expected Term. The expected term represents the period that our stock-based awards are expected to be outstanding. The expected term assumptions were determined based on the vesting terms, exercise terms, and contractual lives of the options. The expected term was estimated using the simplified method allowed under Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) guidance.\n\u2022Volatility. Since we do not have a long trading history of our common stock, the expected volatility is determined based on the historical stock volatilities of its comparable companies. Comparable companies consist of public companies in our industry, which are similar in size, stage of life cycle, and financial leverage. We intend to continue to apply this process using the same or similar public companies until a sufficient amount of historical information regarding the volatility of its share price becomes available, or unless circumstances change such that the identified companies are no longer similar to us, in which case, more suitable companies whose share prices are publicly available would be used in the calculation.\n\u2022Risk-free Interest Rate. The risk-free interest rate used in the Black-Scholes option pricing model is the implied yield available on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term equivalent to that of the options for each expected term.\n\u2022Dividend Yield. The expected dividend assumption is based on our current expectations of our anticipated dividend policy. We have no history of paying any dividends and therefore used an expected dividend yield of zero.\nForeign Currency Translation\nLocal currencies of foreign subsidiaries are the functional currencies for financial reporting purposes. Our non-U.S. subsidiaries have either the British pound or the Japanese yen as the functional currency. For operations outside the United States that have functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar, the assets and liabilities of our subsidiaries are translated at the applicable exchange rate as of the balance sheet date, and revenue and expenses are translated at an average rate over the period. Resulting currency translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss, a separate component of stockholders\u2019 equity. Gains and losses on intercompany and other non-functional currency transactions are recorded in other income (expense), net.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes under the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements. Under this method, we determine deferred tax assets and liabilities on the basis of the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities by using enacted tax rates for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.\nWe recognize deferred tax assets to the extent that it believes that these assets are more likely than not to be realized. In making such a determination, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent operations. If we determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount, we would make an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance, which would reduce the provision for income taxes.\nWe record uncertain tax positions in accordance with ASC 740 on the basis of a two-step process in which (1) it determines whether it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained on the basis of the technical merits of the position and (2) for those tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, we recognize the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority.\nWe recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits on the income tax expense line in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. Accrued interest and penalties are included in accrued expenses on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nComprehensive Loss\nComprehensive loss consists of two components: net loss and other comprehensive income (loss). Other comprehensive income (loss) refers to gains and losses that are recorded as an element of stockholders' equity (deficit) and are excluded from net loss. Our other comprehensive income (loss) is comprised of foreign currency translation adjustments and gain (loss) on investments in available-for-sale securities.\nNet Loss Per Share Attributable to Common Stockholders\nBasic and diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders is presented in conformity with the two-class method required for multiple classes of common stock and participating securities. Under the two-class method, net income is attributed to common stockholders and participating securities based on their participation rights. Under the two-class method, basic net loss per share attributable to common stockholders is computed by dividing the net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. We do not consider the restricted stock awards, and common stock issued upon early exercise of stock options as participating securities. Prior to the IPO, our participating securities also included convertible preferred stock. The holders of convertible preferred stock did not have a contractual obligation to share in our losses, as a result net losses were not allocated to these participating securities. Diluted earnings per share attributable to common stockholders adjusts basic earnings per share for the potentially dilutive impact of stock options and redeemable convertible preferred stock. As we have reported losses for the all period presented, all potentially dilutive securities are antidilutive and accordingly, basic net loss per share equals diluted net loss per share.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued new guidance, Accounting Standard Update No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (\"ASU 2016-02\"), which establishes the principles to report transparent and economically neutral information about the assets and liabilities that arise from leases. Accordingly, this new standard introduces a lessee model that brings most operating leases on the balance sheet and also aligns certain of the underlying principles of the new lessor model with those in the new revenue recognition standard.\nWe adopted the standard on December 31, 2020, presenting the initial application of ASC 842 beginning on January 1, 2020 (i.e. adoption effective date), using the modified retrospective approach and has elected to use the optional transition method which allows us to apply the guidance of ASC 840, including disclosure requirements, in the comparative periods presented. In addition, we elected the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance within the new standard, which among other things, allowed us to carry forward the historical lease classification related to agreements entered prior to adoption. We have also elected the: (i) short-term lease recognition exemption for all leases that qualify, whereby we will not recognize right-of-use (\"ROU\" assets or lease liabilities for existing short-term leases of those assets in transition; (ii) practical expedient to not separate lease and non-lease components for all of our leases; and (iii) use hindsight in determining the lease term, assessing the likelihood that a lease purchase option will be exercised and in assessing the impairment of right-of-use assets.\nFor operating leases, we recognized $54.7 million of ROU assets and $56.3 million of lease obligations, which represents the present value of the lease payments discounted using our incremental borrowing rate (\"IBR\"). The accounting for finance leases remained unchanged as compared to ASC 840. The cumulative impact of transition to retained earnings, recorded as of the adoption date, was not material. The cumulative effect adjustment recorded to accumulated deficit as of the adoption date was not material. The adoption of ASC 842 did not materially impact our consolidated statements of operations or cash flows.\nIn June 2016, FASB issued new guidance, ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which introduces a new methodology for accounting for credit losses on financial instruments, including available-for-sale debt securities. The guidance establishes a new \u201cexpected loss model\u201d that requires entities to estimate current expected credit losses on financial instruments by using all practical and relevant information. Any expected credit losses are to be reflected as allowances rather than reductions in the amortized cost of available-for-sale debt securities. We adopted the standard on December 31, 2020, presenting the initial application of ASC 842 beginning on January 1, 2020 (i.e. adoption effective date). The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2018-15, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other-Internal-Use Software (ASC 350-40): Customer\u2019s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement (\"ASU 2018-15\"). This guidance provides that implementation costs be evaluated for capitalization using the same criteria as that used for internal-use software development costs, with amortization expense being recorded in the same income statement expense line as the hosted service costs and over the expected term of the hosting arrangement. We adopted the standard on December 31, 2020, presenting the initial application of ASC 842 beginning on January 1, 2020 (i.e. adoption effective date). The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nOn December 18, 2019, the FASB released ASU 2019-12 which affects general principles within Topic 740, Income Taxes. The amendments of ASU 2019-12 are meant to simplify and reduce the cost of accounting for income taxes. The FASB has stated that the ASU is being issued as part of its Simplification Initiative, which is meant to reduce complexity in accounting standards by improving certain areas of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) without compromising information provided to users of financial statements. The standard is effective for public companies on the first interim period within the annual period beginning after December 15, 2020. We expect to adopt this standard on January 1, 2021 for our fiscal year 2021 audited financial statements. We are currently evaluating the potential impact of this guidance on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures and do not expect the adoption to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\n3. Revenue\nRevenue recognition\nRevenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services. The processing and recording of certain revenue requires a manual process, and therefore we use a complex set of procedures to generate complete and accurate data to record its revenue transactions. We enter into contracts that can include various combinations of products and services, each of which are distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations. Revenue is recognized net of any taxes collected from customers, which are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities.\nA performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer and is the unit of account. Our contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. Determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment. For contracts with multiple performance obligations, we allocate the contract transaction price to each performance obligation using our estimate of the standalone selling price (\"SSP\") of each distinct good or service in the contract.\nJudgment is required to determine the SSP for each distinct performance obligation. We analyze separate sales of our products and services as a basis for estimating the SSP of our products and services. We then use that SSP as the basis for allocating the transaction price when our product and services are sold together in a contract with multiple performance obligations. In instances where SSP is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the product or service separately, we determine the SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. We typically have more than one SSP for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by customers and circumstances. In these instances, we may use information, such as geographic region and distribution channel, in determining the SSP.\nThe transaction price in a contract for usage-based services is typically equal to the minimum commit price in the contract less any discounts provided. The transaction price in a contract that does not contain usage-based services is equal to the total contract value. Because our typical contracts represent distinct services delivered over time with the same pattern of transfer to the customer, usage-based consideration primarily related to actual consumption over the minimum commit levels is allocated to the period to which it relates. The amount of consideration recognized for usage above the minimum commit price is limited to the amount we expect to be entitled to receive in exchange for providing services. We have elected to apply the practical expedient for estimating and disclosing the variable consideration when variable consideration is allocated entirely to a wholly unsatisfied performance obligation or to a wholly unsatisfied promise to transfer a distinct good or service that forms part of a single performance obligation from our remaining performance obligations under these contracts.\nPerformance obligations represent stand-ready obligations that are satisfied over time as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by us. These obligations can be content delivery, security, subscription services, professional services, support, edge cloud platform services, and others. Accordingly, our revenue is recognized over time, consistent with the pattern of benefit provided to the customer over the term of the agreement.\nAt times, customers may request changes that either amend, replace, or cancel existing contracts. Judgment is required to determine whether the specific facts and circumstances within the contracts should be accounted for as a separate contract or as a modification.\nIn contracts where there are timing differences between when we transfer a promised good or service to the customer and when the customer pays for that good or service, we have determined our contracts do not include a significant financing component. We have also elected the practical expedient to not measure financing components for any contract where the timing difference is less than one year.\nNature of products and services\nWe primarily derive revenue from the sale of services to customers executing contracts in which the standard contract term is one year, although terms may vary by contract. Most of our contracts are non-cancelable over the contractual term. The majority of our contracts commit the customer to a minimum monthly level of usage and specify the rate at which the customer\nmust pay for actual usage above the monthly minimum. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2020, we also offer subscriptions to access a unified security web application and application programming interface at a fixed rate.\nRevenue by geography is based on the billing address of the customer. Aside from the United States, no other single country accounted for more than 10% of revenue for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.\nThe following table presents our net revenue by geographic region:\nYear ended December 31,\n2020 2019 2018\n(in thousands)\nUnited States $ 196,538 $ 142,842 $ 110,811\nAsia Pacific 44,060 18,806 7,194\nEurope 32,768 27,595 21,529\nAll other countries 17,508 11,219 5,029\nTotal revenue $ 290,874 $ 200,462 $ 144,563\nThe majority of our revenue is derived from enterprise customers, which are defined as customers with revenue in excess of $100,000 over the previous 12-month period. The following table presents our net revenue for enterprise and non-enterprise customers:\nYear ended December 31,\n2020 2019 2018\n(in thousands)\nEnterprise customers $ 256,483 $ 174,926 $ 121,639\nNon-enterprise customers 34,391 25,536 22,924\nTotal revenue $ 290,874 $ 200,462 $ 144,563\nContract balances\nThe timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to customers. We have an unconditional right to consideration when we invoice our customers and record a receivable. We record a contract asset when revenue is recognized prior to invoicing, or a contract liability (deferred revenue) when revenue is recognized subsequent to invoicing.\nDeferred revenue includes amounts collected from customers for which revenue has not been recognized and consists of the unearned portions of security subscriptions, professional services and edge cloud platform usage. Our payment terms and conditions vary by contract type. Payment terms on invoiced amounts are typically 15 to 45 days.\nThe following tables present our contract assets, contract liabilities, and certain information related to these balances as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020:\nAs of December 31, 2020 As of December 31, 2019\n(in thousands)\nContract assets $ 387 $ 271\nContract liabilities $ 18,020 $ 317\nThe contract liabilities balance as of December 31, 2020, includes $14.6 million of deferred revenue assumed on October 1, 2020 related to the Signal Sciences acquisition. Please refer to Note 5 - Business Combinations for further details regarding the acquisition.\nThe following table presents the revenue recognized during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 from amounts included in the contract liability at the beginning of the period:\nYear ended December 31, 2020 Year ended December 31, 2019\n(in thousands)\nRevenue recognized in the period from:\nAmounts included in contract liability at the beginning of the period $ 310 $ 1,539\nRemaining performance obligations\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had $155.3 million of remaining performance obligations, which includes deferred revenue and amounts that will be invoiced and recognized in future periods, respectively. We apply the practical expedient of ASC 606, which gives us the optional exemption from disclosing certain information about our remaining performance obligations for our service contracts for which the original contract duration is one year or less, such as the aggregate transaction price allocated to the performance obligations that are unsatisfied (or partially unsatisfied) as of the end of the reporting period. The typical contract term is one year, although terms may vary by contract. We expect to recognize 71% of this balance over the next 12 months and the remainder within the following year.\nCosts to obtain a contract\nAs of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, our costs to obtain contracts were as follows:\nAs of December 31, 2020 As of December 31, 2019\n(in thousands)\nDeferred contract costs $ 19,332 $ 6,804\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we recognized $3.5 million and $2.3 million of amortization related to deferred contract costs. These costs are recorded within the sales and marketing line item on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n4. Investments and Fair Value Measurements\nOur total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities consisted of the following:\nAs of December 31,\n2020 2019\n(in thousands)\nCash and cash equivalents:\nCash $ 21,273 $ 11,623\nMoney market funds 36,629 2,020\nU.S. Treasury securities - -\nCommercial paper 4,998 2,499\nTotal cash and cash equivalents $ 62,900 $ 16,142\nMarketable securities:\nCorporate notes and bonds $ 14,314 $ 17,470\nCommercial paper 41,445 5,481\nU.S. Treasury securities 75,524 78,160\nAsset-backed securities - 13,856\nTotal short-term marketable securities $ 131,283 $ 114,967\nU.S. Treasury securities 20,448 -\nTotal long-term marketable securities 20,448 $ -\nTotal marketable securities $ 151,731 $ 114,967\nOur long-term marketable securities have remaining maturities that are greater than one year as of the balance sheet date and which we intend to hold for more than one year. These amounts are included within the other assets line on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nAvailable-for-Sale Investments\nThe following table summarizes adjusted cost, gross unrealized gains and losses, and fair value related to available-for-sale securities classified as marketable securities on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019:\nAs of December 31, 2020\nAmortized\nCost Gross\nUnrealized\nGain Gross\nUnrealized\nLoss Fair\nValue\n(in thousands)\nCorporate notes and bonds $ 14,297 $ 17 $ - $ 14,314\nCommercial paper 41,445 - - 41,445\nU.S. Treasury securities 95,884 93 (5) 95,972\nAsset-backed securities - - - -\nTotal available-for-sale investments $ 151,626 $ 110 $ (5) $ 151,731\nAs of December 31, 2019\nAmortized\nCost Gross Unrealized Gain Gross\nUnrealized Loss Fair\nValue\n(in thousands)\nCorporate notes and bonds $ 17,462 $ 9 $ (1) $ 17,470\nCommercial paper 5,481 - - 5,481\nU.S. Treasury securities 78,075 85 - 78,160\nAsset-backed securities 13,852 4 - 13,856\nTotal available-for-sale investments $ 114,870 $ 98 $ (1) $ 114,967\nThe majority of our securities classified as available-for-sale as of December 31, 2020 have contractual maturities of one year or less. Certain securities held and classified as available-for-sale as of December 31, 2020, have contractual maturities that are greater than one year. Where we intend to hold the securities for less than 12 months, we classify them as short-term. Where we intend to hold the securities for more than 12 months, we classify them as long-term. As of December 31, 2019, all securities classified as available-for-sale had contractual maturities of one year or less. There were no securities in a continuous loss position for 12 months or longer as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019. Investments are reviewed periodically to identify possible other-than-temporary impairments. No impairment loss has been recorded on the securities included in the tables above, as we believe that the decrease in fair value of these securities is temporary and we expect to recover at least up to the initial cost of investment for these securities.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nFor certain of our financial instruments, including cash held in banks, accounts receivable, and accounts payable, the carrying amounts approximate fair value due to their short maturities, and are therefore excluded from the fair value tables below.\nFair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. There is a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:\nLevel 1-Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;\nLevel 2-Inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities; and\nLevel 3-Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity, which require management judgment or estimation.\nWe measure our cash equivalents, marketable securities, and convertible preferred stock warrant liabilities at fair value. We classify our cash equivalents and marketable securities within Level 1 or Level 2 because we value these investments using quoted market prices or alternative pricing sources and models utilizing market observable inputs. The fair value of our Level 1 financial assets is based on quoted market prices of the identical underlying security. The fair value of our Level 2 financial assets is based on inputs that are directly or indirectly observable in the market, including the readily available pricing sources for the identical underlying security that may not be actively traded.\nFinancial assets and liabilities measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis consisted of the following types of instruments:\nAs of December 31, 2020\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\n(in thousands)\nCash equivalents:\nMoney market funds $ 36,629 $ - $ - $ 36,629\nCommercial paper 4,998 - 4,998\nTotal cash equivalents 36,629 4,998 - 41,627\nMarketable securities:\nCorporate notes and bonds - 14,314 - 14,314\nCommercial paper - 41,445 - 41,445\nU.S. Treasury securities - 95,972 - 95,972\nTotal marketable securities - 151,731 - 151,731\nRestricted cash:\nMoney market funds 980 - - 980\nTotal restricted cash 980 - - 980\nTotal financial assets $ 37,609 $ 156,729 $ - $ 194,338\nAs of December 31, 2020, our remaining restricted cash balance was $1.0 million, of which $0.9 million consists of letters of credit related to its lease arrangements that is collateralized by restricted cash which is classified under other assets.\nAs of December 31, 2019\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\n(in thousands)\nCash equivalents:\nMoney market funds $ 2,020 $ - $ - $ 2,020\nU.S. Treasury securities - 2,499 - 2,499\nTotal cash equivalents 2,020 2,499 - 4,519\nMarketable securities:\nCorporate notes and bonds - 17,470 - 17,470\nCommercial paper - 5,481 - 5,481\nU.S. Treasury securities - 78,160 - 78,160\nAsset-backed securities - 13,856 - 13,856\nTotal marketable securities - 114,967 - 114,967\nRestricted cash:\nMoney market funds 70,087 - - 70,087\nTotal restricted cash 70,087 - - 70,087\nTotal financial assets $ 72,107 $ 117,466 $ - $ 189,573\nThere were no transfers of assets and liabilities measured at fair value between Level 1 and Level 2, or between Level 2 and Level 3, during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\n5. Business Combinations\nSignal Sciences\nOn October 1, 2020, we completed the acquisition of Signal Sciences where we acquired 100% of the voting rights of Signal Sciences and it is now our wholly-owned subsidiary. The acquisition is expected to expand our security portfolio and bolster our existing security offerings with our web application and API protection solutions.\nUnder the terms of the Merger Agreement, we acquired Signal Sciences for an aggregate purchase price of $759.4 million, consisting of approximately $223.0 million in cash and the balance in Class A Common Stock and equity consideration of $536.4 million. A total of 6,367,709 shares were issued of which the fair value of 5,471,210 shares were attributed to purchase price and 896,499 shares, which are restricted as they are subject to revesting conditions, will be included in stock-based compensation as required service is provided. All of these shares have a par value of $0.00002 per share.\nAs part of the acquisition, we also assumed the Signal Sciences Corp. 2014 Stock Option and Grant Plan, as amended (the \u201cSignal Plan\u201d) and the outstanding unvested options to purchase shares of common stock of Signal Sciences Corp. thereunder, and such options became exercisable to purchase shares of Fastly\u2019s Class A common stock, subject to appropriate adjustments to the number of shares and the exercise price of each such option.\"). In connection with the above, we registered 251,754 shares under the Signal Plan.\nWe assumed the aforementioned unvested options at the completion of the acquisition with an estimated fair value of $21.8 million. Of the total consideration, $1.1 million was allocated to the purchase price and $20.7 million was allocated to future services and will be expensed over the remaining requisite service periods of approximately 2.5 years on a straight-line basis. The estimated fair value of the stock options we assumed was determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The share conversion ratio of 0.1 was applied to convert Signal Sciences\u2019s outstanding stock awards into shares of Fastly's common stock.\nOf the 6,367,709 shares issued in connection with the acquisition, a restriction was placed on 896,499 shares belonging to the three co-founders of Signal Sciences to make them subject to revesting on a quarterly basis over a 2-year period. Since they are subject to service conditions, they will be accounted for as a post-acquisition compensation expense over the requisite service period, which is also the vesting period of the award.\nWe accounted for the transaction as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting. We allocated the purchase price to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective estimated fair values on the acquisition date. The fair values assigned to tangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on management\u2019s estimates and assumptions and may be subject to change as additional information is received. The determination of the fair value of the intangible assets acquired required management to make significant estimates and assumptions related to forecasted future revenues and selection of the royalty rate and discount rate. We expect to finalize the valuation as soon as practicable, but not later than one year from the acquisition date. Excess purchase price consideration was recorded as goodwill which includes value attributable to the assembled workforce.\nThe purchase consideration was preliminarily allocated to the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired as of the acquisition date, with the excess recorded to goodwill as shown below. The fair value of assets and liabilities acquired may change as additional information is received during the measurement period. The measurement period will end no later than one-year from the acquisition date:\nAmount\nAssets acquired\nCash and cash equivalents $ 21,501\nOther current assets 6,419\nIntangible assets, net 124,100\nOther non-current assets 8,094\nTotal assets acquired $ 160,114\nLiabilities assumed\nCurrent liabilities (14,755)\nNon-current liabilities (21,170)\nTotal liabilities assumed $ (35,925)\nNet assets acquired 124,189\nTotal acquisition consideration 759,393\nGoodwill Transferred $ 635,204\nIdentifiable finite-lived intangible assets were comprised of the following (in thousands):\nTotal Estimated useful life (in years)\nCustomer relationships $ 69,100 8.0\nDeveloped Technology $ 49,500 5.0\nTrade name $ 3,300 3.0\nBacklog $ 2,200 2.0\nTotal intangible assets acquired $ 124,100\nThe fair values of the acquired developed technology and trade name intangible assets were determined using the relief from royalty method. The fair values of the acquired customer relationships and backlog intangible assets were determined using the multi-period excess earnings method. The acquired intangible assets have a total weighted average amortization period of 6.6 years.\nAs part of the stock acquisition of Signal Sciences, we allocated a significant value of the acquisition to intangible assets. The deferred tax liability provided an additional source of taxable income to support the realization of the pre-existing deferred tax assets. As a result a portion of our valuation allowance was released and we recorded a $13.0 million tax benefit in the year ended December 31, 2020. Please refer to Note 12 - Income Taxes for further details.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, acquisition-related expenses of $20.8 million were expensed within general and administrative expenses as incurred.\nThe amounts of revenue and net loss of Signal Sciences included in our consolidated statement of operations from the acquisition date of October 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020 are $6.7 million and $23.0 million, respectively.\nPro Forma Financial Information\nThe following unaudited pro forma information presents the combined results of operations as if the acquisition of Signal Sciences had been completed as of the beginning of our fiscal year 2019. The unaudited pro forma results include adjustments primarily related to the amortization of intangible assets, share-based compensation expense for shares which are restricted as they are subject to revesting conditions, and the inclusion of acquisition costs as of the earliest period presented. There were no material transactions between Fastly and Signal Sciences during the periods presented that would need to be eliminated.\nThe unaudited pro forma results do not reflect any cost saving synergies from operating efficiencies, or the effect of the incremental costs incurred from integrating these companies. For pro forma purposes, 2020 earnings were adjusted to exclude acquisition-related costs, and 2019 earnings were adjusted to include these costs.

We also purchased additional internet protocol addresses for a gross carrying value of $1.4 million. Internet protocol addresses and domain name intangible assets are subject to amortization.

Debt Instruments\nLoan and Security Agreement\nIn July 2013, we entered into a Loan and Security Agreement (the \"Facility\") with a bank related to an equipment facility providing us with an equipment line for advances of up to $2.5 million. The Facility was amended in September 2013 to increase the equipment line for advances up to $5.0 million (as amended, the \"Prior Loan Agreement\"), November 2014 to increase the equipment line for advances up to $15.0 million, and August 2016 to increase the equipment line for advances up to $17.5 million and allowed for reborrowing of amounts repaid under the equipment loan (as amended, the \"Senior Loan Agreement\"). The Senior Loan Agreement was additionally amended in February 2017 and March 2017, which extended the draw period to January 2018.\nIn November 2017, we entered into a Second Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement, which amended the Senior Loan Agreement and increased the additional equipment line for advances up to an aggregate of $30.0 million through November 2018. As of December 31, 2018, $29.2 million had been drawn on this Second Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement. The interest rate associated with each advance under the Senior Loan Agreement was 1.75% above the floating prime rate. Beginning November 2018, we were obligated to make equal monthly payments of principal plus interest with repayment no later than November 1, 2021.\nOn November 4, 2019, the outstanding loan of $20.0 million was paid in full, in accordance with the terms of the agreement.\nCredit Facility\nIn December 2018, we entered into a Second Lien Credit Agreement under which were permitted to borrow up to $30.0 million (\"Credit Facility\"). As part of this agreement, the Second Amendment to Amended and Restated Loan was amended to allow for this additional indebtedness. The advances under the Credit Facility were subject to interest at a rate of prime plus 4.25%. As of December 31, 2018, $20.0 million had been drawn on this Credit Facility. On July 8, 2019, the $20.0 million outstanding loan, which was due and payable on December 24, 2021, was paid in full, in accordance with the terms of the Credit Facility. Upon payment, the Credit Facility arrangement was terminated.\nCash Collateralized Revolving Credit Agreement (\"Revolving Credit Agreement\")\nIn November 2019, we entered into a Revolving Credit Agreement with Citibank, N.A (the \"Lender\") for an aggregate commitment amount of $70.0 million with a maturity date of November 3, 2022 (the \"Revolver\"). The amount of borrowings available under the Revolving Credit Agreement at any time was collateralized by our cash, which was classified as restricted cash on our balance sheets.\nThe interest rate associated with each advance under the Revolving Credit Agreement was equal to the sum of LIBOR for the applicable interest period plus 1.50% which is a per annum rate based on outstanding borrowings. As such, for the initial interest period ending in November 2020, the interest rate was set at 3.46%. The commitment fee was 0.20% per annum based on the average daily unused amount of the commitment amount. Interest payments on outstanding borrowings were due on the last day of each interest period and payments for the commitment fee are due at the end of each calendar quarter.\nIn November 2020, we terminated the Revolving Credit Agreement in accordance with its terms. In connection with the termination of the Revolving Credit Agreement, we repaid the then outstanding aggregate principal amount of $20.3 million, as well as any accrued and unpaid interest, as of the termination date. The associated restriction on the collateralized cash of $70.0 million was also released, accordingly. As of December 31, 2019, $20.3 million had been drawn on the Revolving Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 2020, we have no amounts outstanding nor available for borrowing under the Revolving Credit Agreement.\nInterest expense related to the Revolving Credit Agreement, Credit Facility and Loan and Security Agreement for the years ended December 31, 2020 was $0.9 million. Total interest expense related to debt, excluding interest expense related to our finance leases now separately disclosed in Note 7-Leases, for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $5.2 million, $4.7 million of which related to the Revolving Credit Agreement, Credit Facility and Loan and Security Agreement, and $0.5 million of which related to finance lease agreements and other costs. Total interest expense related to debt, prior to the adoption of ASC 842, for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $1.9 million, $1.7 million of which related to the Credit Facility and Loan and Security Agreement, and $0.2 million of which related to finance lease agreements.\nThe following table reflects the carrying values of the debt agreements as of December 31, 2019:\nAs of December 31,\nLiability component:\nPrincipal amount-Cash Collateralized Revolving Credit Agreement $ 20,300\nLess: unamortized debt issuance costs (219)\nLess: current portion of long-term debt -\nLong-term debt, less current portion-Cash Collateralized Revolving Credit Agreement $ 20,081\n10. Commitments and Contingencies\nFinance and Operating Lease Commitments\nOur commitments include commitments under our non-cancelable facilities and colocation operating leases (i.e. data center leases), as well as finance leases for networking equipment. Refer to Note 7-Leases for further details and disclosures around their minimum future purchase commitments as of December 31, 2020.\nPurchase Commitments\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had long-term commitments for cost of revenue related agreements (i.e., bandwidth usage, peering and other managed services with various networks, internet service providers (\"ISPs\") and other third-party vendors). Additionally, as of December 31, 2020, we had entered into purchase orders with various vendors.\nAside from our finance and operating lease commitments, including our colocation operating commitments, which have been disclosed in Note 7-Leases, the minimum future purchase commitments relating to our other cost of revenue arrangements and SaaS commitments as of December 31, 2020 were as follows:\nCost of Revenue Commitments SaaS Agreements Total Purchase Commitments\n(in thousands)\n2021 $ 25,900 $ 9,785 $ 35,685\n2022 5,894 9,009 14,903\n2023 - 9,000 9,000\n2024 - - -\n2025 - - -\nThereafter - - -\nTotal $ 31,794 $ 27,794 $ 59,588\nSales and Use Tax\nWe conduct operations in many tax jurisdictions throughout the United States. In many of these jurisdictions, non-income-based taxes, such as sales and use and telecommunications taxes are assessed on our operations. We are subject to indirect taxes, and may be subject to certain other taxes, in some of these jurisdictions. Historically, we have not billed or collected these taxes and, in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we have recorded a provision for our tax exposure in these jurisdictions when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the exposure can be reasonably estimated. As a result, we have recorded a liability of $6.3 million and $3.9 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. These estimates are based on several key assumptions, including the taxability of our products, the jurisdictions in which we believe we have nexus and the sourcing of revenues to those jurisdictions. In the event these jurisdictions challenge our assumptions and analysis, our actual exposure could differ materially from our current estimates.\nLegal Matters\nWe are currently involved in, and may in the future be involved in, various legal proceedings and claims arising from the normal course of business, and an unfavorable resolution of any of these matters could materially affect our future results of operations, cash flows or financial position. We are also party to various disputes that management considers routine and incidental to its business. Management does not expect the results of any of these routine actions to have a material effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows.\nOn August 27, 2020, a purported securities class action lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, captioned Marcos Betancourt v. Fastly, Inc., et al. (Case No. 4:20-cv-06024-PJH) naming as defendants us and certain of our officers. On September 15, 2020, a substantively identical complaint was filed against the same defendants in the same court, captioned Rami Habib v. Fastly, Inc., et al. (Case No. 4:20-cv-06454-JST). The complaints assert that all defendants violated Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and SEC Rule 10b-5 by making materially false or misleading statements between May 6, 2020 and August 5, 2020 regarding our business and financials, while not disclosing the identity of one of its largest customers. The plaintiffs also allege that certain of our officers violated Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act. On September 27, 2020, the court consolidated the two cases into one putative class action, captioned In re Fastly, Inc. Securities Litigation. Motions for the lead plaintiff were filed on October 26, 2020 and are currently pending before the Court.\nOn December 28, 2020, certain of our officers and directors were named as defendants in a shareholder derivative action filed in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, captioned Wei v. Bixby, et al., Case No. 1:20-cv-01773-MN. On February 2, 2021, a substantially similar shareholder derivative complaint was filed against the same defendants in the same court, captioned Kristen Gorenberg v. Bixby et al., Case No. 1:21-cv-00136. The derivative complaints assert, inter alia, breach of fiduciary duty claims. It is possible that additional lawsuits will be filed, or allegations made by stockholders, regarding these same or other matters and also naming as defendants the Company and our officers and directors.\nThe pending lawsuits and any other related lawsuits are subject to inherent uncertainties, and the actual defense and disposition costs will depend upon many unknown factors. The outcome of the pending lawsuits and any other related lawsuits is necessarily uncertain. We could be forced to expend significant resources in the defense of the pending lawsuits and any additional lawsuits, and we may not prevail. In addition, we may incur substantial legal fees and costs in connection with such lawsuits. We currently are not able to estimate the possible cost to us from these matters, as the pending lawsuits are currently at an early stage, and we cannot be certain how long it may take to resolve the pending lawsuits or the possible amount of any damages that we may be required to pay. Such amounts could be material to our financial statements if we do not prevail in the defense against the pending lawsuits and any other related lawsuits, or even if we do prevail.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we have not accrued for any loss contingencies on the above mentioned lawsuits as we do not believe an outcome resulting in a loss is probable. We will accrue for loss contingencies if it becomes both probable that we will incur a loss and if we can reasonably estimate the amount or range of the loss.\nIndemnification\nWe enter into standard indemnification agreements in the ordinary course of business. Pursuant to these agreements, we agree to indemnify, hold harmless, and reimburse the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party, generally our business partners or customers, in connection with our provision of its services. Generally, these obligations are limited to claims relating to infringement of a patent, copyright, or other intellectual property right, breach of our security or data protection obligations, or our negligence, willful misconduct, or violation of law. Subject to applicable statutes of limitation, the term of these indemnification agreements is generally for the duration of the agreement. The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited; however, we carry insurance that covers certain third-party claims relating to our services and could limit our exposure in that respect.\nWe have agreed to indemnify each of our officers and directors during his or her lifetime for certain events or occurrences that happen by reason of the fact that the officer or director is, was, or has agreed to serve as an officer or director of the Company. We have director and officer insurance policies that may limit our exposure and may enable us to recover a portion of certain future amounts paid.\nTo date, we have not encountered material costs as a result of such indemnification obligations and have not accrued any related liabilities in our financial statements. In assessing whether to establish an accrual, we consider such factors as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss.\n11. Stockholders' Equity\nCommon Stock\nOur Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended and restated in May 2019, authorizes the issuance of 1.0 billion shares of Class A common stock and 94.1 million shares of Class B common stock, each at a par value per share of $0.00002.

Options granted under our 2011 Plan are exercisable for shares of our Class B common stock.\nAs of both December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, there were 23.6 million shares of Class B common stock reserved for issuance pursuant to the outstanding stock options under the 2011 Plan. As of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, there were no shares of Class B common stock available for issuance for future grants under the 2011 Plan. No further awards will be issued under the 2011 Plan.\nIn May 2019, in conjunction with our IPO, our Board and stockholders approved our 2019 Equity Incentive Plan (the \"2019 Plan\") which allows for the issuance of incentive stock options, non-statutory stock options, stock appreciation rights, RSUs, performance-based stock awards, and other forms of equity compensation, which are collectively referred to as stock\nawards. Additionally, the 2019 Plan provides for the grant of performance cash awards. Options are exercisable for shares of our Class A common stock.\nAs of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, there were 19.4 million shares and 14.4 million shares of Class A common stock reserved for issuance under the 2019 Plan, respectively. As of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, there were 12.8 million and 12.4 million Class A common stock available for issuance under the 2019 Plan, respectively.\nIn October, 2020, as part of the acquisition of Signal Sciences, we also assumed the Signal Sciences Corp. 2014 Stock Option and Grant Plan, as amended (the \u201cSignal Plan\u201d) and the outstanding unvested options to purchase shares of common stock of Signal Sciences Corp. thereunder, and such options became exercisable to purchase shares of Fastly\u2019s Class A common stock, subject to appropriate adjustments to the number of shares and the exercise price of each such option. In connection with the above, we registered 251,754 shares under the Signal Plan.\nIn May 2019, in conjunction with our IPO, our Board and stockholders approved the Employee Stock Purchase Plan (\"ESPP\"). The ESPP allows eligible employees to purchase shares of our Class A common stock through payroll deductions of up to 15% of their eligible compensation, subject to a maximum of $25,000 per calendar year.\nAs of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, there were 3.5 million shares and 2.5 million shares of Class A common stock reserved for issuance under the ESPP, respectively. As of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, there were 2.8 million shares and 2.2 million shares of Class A common stock available for future issuance under the ESPP, respectively.\nStock Options\nOptions granted under the 2011 Plan are exercisable for Class B common stock and generally expire within 10 years from the date of grant and generally vest over four years, at the rate of 25% on the first anniversary of the date of grant and ratably on a monthly basis over the remaining 36-month period thereafter based on continued service.\nOptions granted under the 2019 Plan are exercisable for Class A common stock and generally expire within 10 years from the date of grant and generally vest over four years, at the rate of 25% on the first anniversary of the date of grant and ratably on a monthly basis over the remaining 36-month period thereafter based on continued service. Forfeitures are recognized as they occur.\nOptions granted under the Signal Sciences 2014 Equity Stock Options Plan that was assumed through the acquisition are included as part of the option rollforward activity in year ended December 31, 2020. The vesting of these options follow their original grant date terms (\"Original grant date\") prior to the acquisition of Signal Sciences and generally expire within 10 years from the original grant date and generally vest over four years, at the rate of 25% on the first anniversary of the date of grant and ratably on a monthly basis over the remaining 36-month period thereafter. Subsequent to the acquisition, these options are exercisable for Class A common stock and are recognized ratably over the remaining period based on continued service from the grant date. Forfeitures are recognized as they occur.\nThe following table summarizes stock option activity during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018:\nNumber of Shares Weighted-Average\nExercise Price Weighted-Average\nRemaining\nContractual Term Aggregate\nIntrinsic Value\n(in thousands) (in years) (in thousands)\nOutstanding at January 1, 2018 10,370 $ 1.92 8.0 $ 16,901\nGranted 3,984 5.32\nExercised (1,264) 2.1\nCancelled/forfeited (880) 2.64\nOutstanding at December 31, 2018 12,210 2.96 7.8 $ 64,590\nGranted 2,516 10.87\nExercised (2,650) 2.45\nCancelled/forfeited (807) 5.10\nOutstanding at December 31, 2019 11,269 4.68 7.3 $ 173,471\nGranted 252 12.96\nExercised (4,360) 3.46\nCancelled/forfeited (198) 8.79\nOutstanding at December 31, 2020 6,963 $ 5.63 6.7 $ 569,094\nVested and exercisable at December 31, 2020 4,214 $ 3.71 5.8 $ 352,535\nUnvested and exercisable at December 31, 2020 320 $ 6.23 7.7 $ 25,973\nThe total pre-tax intrinsic value of options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 was $200.9 million, $32.6 million, and $3.0 million, respectively.\nThe total grant date fair value of employee options vested for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, 2018 was $10.3 million, $6.1 million, and $3.6 million, respectively.\nThe weighted-average grant date fair value for options granted to employees during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 was $86.77, $5.77, and $1.78, respectively.\nWe estimate the fair value of stock options on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Each of the Black-Scholes inputs is subjective and generally requires significant judgments to determine. We estimated the fair value of stock option awards during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 on the date of the grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions:\nYear ended December 31,\n2020 2019 2018\nFair value of common stock $85.26 - $96.43\n$8.24 - $22.70\n$3.86 - $8.16\nExpected term (in years) 5.38 - 9.75\n6.02 6.02\nRisk-free interest rate 0.31% - 0.67%\n1.55% - 2.5%\n2.62% - 3.0%\nExpected volatility 43.92% - 46.49%\n39.1% - 42.7%\n40.2% - 41.5%\nDividend yield -% -% - %\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, and 2018, we recognized stock-based compensation expense from stock options of approximately $10.1 million, $7.9 million, and $4.1 million, respectively.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we modified the terms options awarded to certain employees to allow for the remaining unvested awards to be fully vested upon their change in employment status. As a result, we recorded incremental stock-based compensation expense in relation to these modifications of $0.9 million and $0.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2018, there were no option award modifications that resulted in incremental expense being recorded.\nAs of December 31, 2020, total unrecognized stock-based compensation cost related to outstanding unvested stock options that are expected to vest was $28.6 million. This unrecognized stock-based compensation cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 2.29 years.\nEarly Exercise of Stock Options\nCertain stock options granted by us are exercisable at the date of grant, with unvested shares subject to repurchase by us in the event of voluntary or involuntary termination of employment of the stockholder. Such exercises are recorded as a liability on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets and reclassified into equity as the options vest. As of December 31, 2020, December 31, 2019, a total of 90,977 and 199,895 shares of Class B Common Stock were subject to repurchase by us at the lower of (i) the fair market value of such shares on the date of repurchase, or (ii) the original exercise price of such shares. The corresponding exercise value of approximately $0.4 million and $0.9 million as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively, is recorded in other current liabilities and other liabilities on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nThe activity of non-vested shares as a result of early exercise of options granted to employees and non-employees, is as follows:\nYear ended December 31,\n2020 2019 2018\n(in thousands)\nBeginning balance 200 245 138\nEarly exercise of options - 117 238\nVested (109) (162) (120)\nRepurchased - - (11)\nEnding balance 91 200 245\nRSUs\nWe began granting RSUs under the 2019 Plan during the year ended December 31, 2019. The fair value of RSUs is based on the grant date fair value and is expensed on a straight-line basis over the applicable vesting period. RSUs grant for new hires typically vest over four years, at the rate of 25% on the first anniversary of the vest commencement date and ratably on a quarterly basis over the remaining 36-month period thereafter, based on continued service. Other RSU awards typically vest quarterly over terms of 36 to 48 months. Forfeitures are recognized as they occur.\nThe following table summarizes RSU activity during the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nNumber of Shares Weighted-Average Grant Date Fair Value Per Share\n(in thousands)\nNonvested RSUs as of December 31, 2018 - $ -\nGranted 1,644 20.07\nCancelled/forfeited (3)\nNonvested RSUs as of December 31, 2019 1,641 $ 20.07\nGranted 4,398 31.22\nVested (1,377) 22.92\nCancelled/forfeited (142) 22.58\nNonvested RSUs as of December 31, 2020 4,520 $ 30.01\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we recognized stock-based compensation expense related to RSUs of $40.5 million and $2.2 million, respectively. There was no stock-based compensation expense recognized related to RSUs during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we modified the terms of RSUs awarded to certain employees to allow for the remaining unvested awards to be fully vested upon their change in employment status. As a result, we recorded incremental stock-based compensation expense in relation to these modifications of $4.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. During the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, there were no RSU award modifications that resulted in incremental expense being recorded.\nAs of December 31, 2020, total unrecognized stock-based compensation cost related to non-vested RSUs was $124.5 million. This unrecognized stock-based compensation cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 3.02 years.\nStock subject to revest (\"Revest shares\")\nIn conjunction with the acquisition of Signal Sciences, a restriction was placed on 896,499 shares belonging to the three co-founders of Signal Sciences to make them subject to revesting on a quarterly basis over a 2 year period. Refer to Note 5-Business Combinations for further details.\nThe activity of revest shares granted to these employees is as follows:\nNumber of Shares Weighted-Average Grant Date Fair Value Per Share\n(in thousands)\nNonvested revest shares as of December 31, 2019 - $ -\nRestricted 896 97.84\nVested (112) 97.84\nCancelled/forfeited - -\nNonvested revest shares as of December 31, 2020 784 $ 97.84\nAs of December 31, 2020, we recognized stock-based compensation expense related to revest shares of $11.1 million.\nAs of December 31, 2020, total unrecognized stock-based compensation cost related to revest shares was $76.6 million. This unrecognized stock-based compensation cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 1.74 years.\nPerformance-Based Restricted Stock Units (\"PSUs\")\nIn March 2020, we granted a maximum total of 87,918 shares of PSUs to certain employees of the company, pursuant to our 2019 Equity Incentive Plan. The PSUs granted reflect a maximum of 200% of target performance and represent the right of the employees to be issued on a future date, one (1) share of Class A common stock for each RSU received that will vest on the applicable vesting date.\nOn November 2, 2020, the Compensation Committee of the Board set the performance conditions related to the previously granted PSUs. The performance conditions are based on the level of achievement of certain Company and individual targets related to Fastly's operating plan for the fiscal year 2020 (\"2020 operating plan\"). The PSUs will vest at 50% of the target if the Company achieves 90% performance under the 2020 operating plan, 100% of the target if the Company achieves 100% performance under the 2020 operating plan and 200% of the target if the Company achieves 110% performance or greater under the 2020 operating plan. These awards will be eligible to vest linearly within those parameters. Subject to employees\u2019 continuous service with the Company through each vesting date, 25% of the number of RSUs credited to them upon certification of achievement will vest on February 15, 2021, May 15, 2021, August 15, 2021, and November 15, 2021, respectively.\nThe activity of PSUs granted to employees is as follows:\nNumber of Shares Weighted-Average Grant Date Fair Value Per Share\n(in thousands)\nNonvested PSUs as of December 31, 2019 - $ -\nGranted 88 65.11\nVested - -\nCancelled/forfeited - -\nNonvested PSUs as of December 31, 2020 88 $ 65.11\nAs of December 31, 2020, the performance condition associated with the PSU was deemed probable of achievement and we recorded $1.6 million in stock-based compensation expense. The amount of stock-based compensation expense recorded is based on the expected attainment of the performance targets.\nAs of December 31, 2020, total unrecognized stock-based compensation cost related to PSUs was $3.4 million. This unrecognized stock-based compensation cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 0.56 years.\nESPP\nThe ESPP allows eligible employees to purchase shares of our common stock through payroll deductions of up to 15% of their eligible compensation. The ESPP provides for six-month offering periods, commencing in May and November of each year. At the end of each offering period employees are able to purchase shares at 85% of the lower of the fair market value of our Class A common stock on the first trading day of the offering period or on the last day of the offering period.\nWe estimate the fair value of shares to be issued under the ESPP on the first day of the offering period using the Black-Scholes valuation model. The inputs to the Black-Scholes option pricing model are our stock price on the first date of the offering period, the risk-free interest rate, the estimated volatility of our stock price over the term of the offering period, the expected term of the offering period and the expected dividend rate. Stock-based compensation expense related to the ESPP is recognized on a straight-line basis over the offering period. Forfeitures are recognized as they occur.\nWe estimated the fair value of shares granted under the ESPP on the first date of the offering period using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions:\nYear ended December 31,\n2020 2019\nFair value of common stock $14.09 - $24.07\n$6.02 - $6.92\nExpected term (in years) 0.49-0.50\n0.47-0.50\nRisk-free interest rate 0.10% - 0.14%\n1.59% - 2.35%\nExpected volatility 50% - 60%\n36% - 43%\nDividend yield -% -%\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we withheld $9.6 million and $5.5 million in contributions from employees, respectively, and recognized $3.2 million and $2.5 million in stock-based compensation expense related to the ESPP, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, total unrecognized stock-based compensation cost related to ESPP was $1.9 million. This unrecognized stock-based compensation cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 0.4 years.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, an aggregate of 0.3 million and 0.3 million shares of our Class A common stock was purchased under the ESPP, respectively. No common stock was issued under the ESPP in the year ended December 31, 2018. No contributions were withheld, and no stock-based compensation expense was recognized related to the ESPP in the year ended December 31, 2018.\nStock-based Compensation Expense\nThe following table summarizes the components of total stock-based compensation expense included in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations:\nYear ended December 31,\n2020 2019 2018\n(in thousands)\nStock-based compensation expense by caption:\nCost of revenue $ 3,889 $ 1,410 $ 265\nResearch and development 17,112 2,920 1,332\nSales and marketing 17,028 3,497 1,023\nGeneral and administrative 26,404 4,318 1,459\nTotal $ 64,433 $ 12,145 $ 4,079\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we capitalized $2.0 million and $0.4 million of stock-based compensation expense, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we did not capitalize any stock-based compensation expense.\nCommon Stock Warrant Liabilities\nPrior to the IPO, we issued convertible preferred stock warrants in conjunction with the issuances of debt. We recorded these warrants to purchase convertible preferred stock as a liability on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value upon issuance as the warrants were exercisable for contingently redeemable preferred stock which was classified outside of stockholders' equity (deficit). The liability associated with these warrants were subject to remeasurement at each balance sheet date, with changes in fair value recorded in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss as other expense, net.\nOn May 17, 2019, immediately upon closing of the IPO, our warrants to purchase convertible preferred stock were automatically converted to warrants to purchase an equal number of shares of our Class B common stock. As a result, the warrant was remeasured a final time, immediately prior to the closing of the IPO, and reclassified to additional paid-in capital within stockholders' equity. Changes in the fair value were recorded within other expense, net on the consolidated statement of operations. As of December 31, 2019, the warrants were classified and recorded as additional paid-in capital on the condensed consolidated balance sheets.\nIn the year ended December 31, 2020, certain Class B common stock warrants related to the previously outstanding subordinated debt and loan agreements were exercised under the cashless exercise method pursuant to the corresponding warrant agreements. As a result of such exercises, we issued 144,635 shares of our Class B common stock. No Class B common stock warrants were exercised under the cashless exercise method pursuant to the corresponding warrant agreements during the three months ended December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2020, there were no outstanding Class B common stock warrants outstanding.\nIn the year ended December 31, 2019, certain Class B common stock warrants related to the Credit Facility, certain class B common stock warrants related to the Facility, certain Class B common stock warrants related to the Prior Loan Agreement, the Class B common stock warrants related to a previously outstanding term loan agreement, certain Class B common stock warrants related to the Mezzanine Loan and Security Agreement were exercised under the cashless exercise method pursuant to the corresponding warrant agreements. As a result of such exercises, we issued 224,102 shares of our Class B common stock in the year ended December 31, 2019.\n12. Net Loss Per Share Attributable to Common Stockholders\nWe compute net loss per share using the two-class method required for multiple classes of common stock and participating securities. The rights of the holders of the Class A common stock and Class B common stock are identical, except with respect to voting and conversion. Accordingly, the Class A common stock and Class B common stock share equally in our net losses. Prior to the IPO, our participating securities also included convertible preferred stock. The holders of convertible preferred stock did not have a contractual obligation to share in our losses, and as a result, net losses were not allocated to these participating securities.\nOn October 12, 2020, the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represented less than 10% of the aggregate number of shares of the then outstanding Class A common stock and Class B common stock. As a result, all outstanding shares of Fastly\u2019s Class B common stock, par value $0.00002 per share, will automatically convert into the same number of shares of Class A common stock, par value $0.00002 per share, under the terms of Fastly\u2019s amended and restated certificate of incorporation, on July 12, 2021, the trading day falling nine months after the Conversion. No additional Class B shares may be issued following such Conversion.\nThe following table sets forth the calculation of basic and diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders during the periods presented. The shares issued in the IPO, the shares issued pursuant to the exercise by the underwriters of an option to purchase additional shares, and the shares of Class A and Class B common stock issued upon conversion of the outstanding shares of convertible preferred stock in the IPO are included in the table below weighted for the period outstanding:\nYear ended December 31,\n2020 2019 2018\nClass A(1), (3)\nClass B(2)\nClass A (1)\nClass B(2)\nClass A Class B(2)\n(in thousands, except per share amounts)\nNet loss attributable to common stockholders $ (78,114) $ (17,818) $ (12,084) $ (39,466) N/A $ (30,935)\nWeighted-average shares used in computing net loss per share attributable to common stockholders, basic and diluted 84,319 19,233 16,022 52,328 N/A 24,376\nNet loss per share attributable to common stockholders, basic and diluted $ (0.93) $ (0.93) $ (0.75) $ (0.75) N/A $ (1.27)\n__________\n(1)Class A common stock includes the issuance of 12.9 million shares of Class A common stock issued by us in connection with our IPO and shares issued upon the exercise of options subsequent to our IPO.\n(2)Class B common stock includes, for all periods presented, the conversion of all of our preferred stock into an aggregate of 53.6 million shares of our Class B common stock upon closing of the IPO.\n(3)Class A common stock includes the issuance of 6.9 million shares of Class A common stock issued by us in connection with our follow-on offering.\nSince we were in a loss position for the periods presented, basic net loss per share is the same as diluted net loss per share, as the inclusion of all potential common shares outstanding would have been anti-dilutive. The potential shares of common stock that were excluded from the computation of diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders for the period presented because including them would have been antidilutive are as follows:\nNumber of Shares\nAs of December 31,\n2020 2019\n(in thousands)\nStock options 6,963 11,269\nRSUs 4,520 1,641\nEarly exercised stock options 91 200\nConvertible common stock warrants - 183\nRSAs 784 -\nShares issuable pursuant to the ESPP 25 247\nPSUs 88\nTotal 12,471 13,540\n13. Income Taxes\nLoss before income taxes includes the following components:\nYear ended December 31,\n2020 2019 2018\n(in thousands)\nUnited States $ (86,842) $ (30,970) $ (20,644)\nForeign (20,570) (20,088) (10,291)\nLoss before income taxes $ (107,412) $ (51,058) $ (30,935)\nThe income tax expense (benefit) consists of the following:\nYear ended December 31,\n2020 2019 2018\n(in thousands)\nCurrent tax provision (benefit):\nFederal\n$ - $ - $ -\nState\n420 106 81\nForeign\n1,050 386 104\nDeferred tax provision (benefit):\nFederal\n(10,631) - -\nState\n(2,319) - -\nForeign\n- - -\nTotal tax expense (benefit) $ (11,480) $ 492 $ 185\nReconciliation between our effective tax rate on income from continuing operations and the U.S. federal statutory rate is as follows:\nYear ended December 31,\n2020 2019 2018\nProvision at federal statutory tax rate 21 % 21 % 21 %\nState taxes, net of federal tax impact 2 - -\nChange in valuation allowance (35) (12) (11)\nForeign tax rate differential (5) (8) (7)\nAcquisition related expenses (2) - -\nStock-based compensation 30 - -\nOther - (2) (4)\nEffective tax rate 11 % (1) % (1) %\nWe recorded tax benefit of $11.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Our income tax benefit is primarily the result of a reduction in the valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets. In connection with the acquisition of Signal Science, we recorded a net deferred tax liability which provides an additional source of taxable income to support the realization of the pre-existing deferred tax assets. As a result a portion of our valuation allowance was released and we recorded a $13.0 million tax benefit in the year ended December 31, 2020. Our income tax benefit is partially offset by income taxes from certain foreign jurisdictions where we conduct business and state minimum income taxes in the United States.\nOur deferred tax assets and liabilities were as follows:\nYear ended December 31,\n2020 2019\n(in thousands)\nReserves and accruals $ 941 $ 1,839\nLease liability 17,481 -\nStock-based compensation 3,969 1,116\nNet operating losses 109,281 30,750\nDepreciation of property, plant and equipment 576 -\nAmortization of intangible assets - 642\nOther - 1,753\nDeferred tax assets 132,248 36,100\nDeferred Revenue (673) -\nRight-of-use Asset (16,160) -\nDepreciation of property, plant and equipment - (285)\nAmortization of intangible assets (31,188) -\nState Taxes (4,319) (2,034)\nOther (133) -\nDeferred tax liabilities $ (52,473) $ (2,319)\nValuation allowance (80,028) (33,781)\nNet deferred tax (liabilities) assets $ (253) $ -\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had net operating loss carryforwards for U.S. federal income tax purposes of approximately $395.9 million and $106.0 million, respectively; and for state income tax purposes of approximately $316.5 million and $100.0 million, respectively. The federal net operating loss carryforwards, if not utilized, will begin to expire in 2031. The state net operating loss carryforward, if not utilized, will begin to expire on various dates starting in 2021. The Company also has federal and California research and development credit carryforwards totaling $3.0 million and $1.0 million at December 31, 2020, respectively. The federal research and development credit carryforwards will begin to expire in 2034, unless previously utilized. The California research credits do not expire.\nBased on all available evidence on a jurisdictional basis we believe that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will not be utilized and have recorded a full valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets. We assess on a periodic basis the likelihood that we will be able to recover its deferred tax assets. We consider all available evidence, both positive and negative, including historical losses, we determined that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will not be fully realizable for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nWe have a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, including net operating loss carryforwards. We expect to maintain this valuation allowance for the foreseeable future. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the valuation allowance related to the Company's deferred tax assets increased by $46.2 million. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we released a total of $13.0 million of our U.S. valuation allowance.\nUtilization of the net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations provided by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \"Code\") and similar state provisions. A detailed analysis was performed through June 30, 2020 for Fastly to determine whether an ownership change under Section 382 of the Code has occurred has been performed and as a result there is no limitation on the use of net operating loss carryforwards attributable to periods before the change. A detailed analysis was performed for the period March 1, 2014 to October 1, 2020 for Signal Sciences to determine whether an ownership change under Section 382 of the Code has occurred has been performed and as a result there is a limitation on the use of net operating loss carryforwards acquired from Signal Sciences.\nNo provision for U.S. income and foreign withholding taxes has been made for these permanently reinvested foreign earnings because it is management\u2019s intention to permanently reinvest such undistributed earnings outside the United States.\nA reconciliation of the Company\u2019s unrecognized tax benefits is as follows (in thousands):\nYear ended December 31,\n2020 2019\nBalance at beginning of year\n$ - $ -\nIncreases related to prior year tax positions\n2,328 -\nIncreases related to current year tax positions\n858 -\nBalance at end of year\n$ 3,186 $ -\nThe Company has considered the amounts and probabilities of the outcomes that can be realized upon ultimate settlement with the tax authorities and determined unrecognized tax benefits primarily related to credits should be established as noted in the summary rollforward above. The unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized and in absence of full valuation allowance, would impact the income tax provision by $3.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. It would not impact the tax provision for year ended December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2020, the Company does not believe that it is reasonably possible that its unrecognized tax benefits would significantly change in the following 12 months. Our policy is to recognize interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax benefits as part of the income tax provision and include accrued interest and penalties with the related income tax liability on its consolidated balance sheet. To date, we have not recognized any interest and penalties in its consolidated statements of operations, nor has it accrued for or made payments for interest and penalties.\nGenerally, in the U.S. federal and state taxing jurisdictions, tax periods in which certain loss and credit carryovers are generated remain open for audit until such time as the limitation period ends for the year in which such losses or credits are utilized.\nOn March 27, 2020, the \u201cCoronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act\u201d was signed into law (the \"CARES Act\"). The CARES Act includes provisions relating to refundable payroll tax credits, deferment of the employer portion of certain payroll taxes, net operating loss carryback periods, alternative minimum tax credit refunds, modifications to the net interest deduction limitations and technical corrections to tax depreciation methods for qualified improvement property.\nSince the second quarter of 2020, we utilized the provision to defer payment of certain of our payroll taxes. Any deferred payments will be accrued for as a liability and included in our condensed consolidated balance sheet for the applicable period. As of December 31, 2020, we have accrued for $3.4 million in payroll tax deferrals related to the CARES Act.\n14. Information About Revenue and Geographic Areas\nWe consider operating segments to be components of the Company in which separate financial information is available and is evaluated regularly by our Chief Operating Decision Maker (\"CODM\") in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. Our CODM is the Chief Executive Officer (\"CEO\"). The CEO reviews financial information presented on a consolidated basis, accompanied by information about revenue, customer size, and industry vertical for purposes of allocating resources and evaluating financial performance.\nWe have determined that we operate our business as one reportable segment, and there are no segment managers who are held accountable for operations, operating results, or plans for levels or components below the consolidated unit level. Accordingly, we have determined that we have a single reporting segment and operating unit structure.\nRevenue\nRevenue by geography is based on the billing address of the customer. Refer to Note 3-Revenue for more information on net revenue by geographic region.\nLong-Lived Assets\nThe following table presents long-lived assets by geographic region:\nAs of December 31, As of December 31,\n2020 2019\n(in thousands)\nUnited States $ 65,054 $ 40,747\nAll other countries 30,925 19,290\nTotal long-lived assets $ 95,979 $ 60,037\n15. Subsequent Events\nOn January 28, 2021, we entered into an additional finance lease agreement with the equipment provider for $2.0 million in network equipment at an annual interest rate of 4.89% over a term of three years. The agreement provides for a bargain purchase price at the end of the term. The amortization of leased assets is included in depreciation and amortization expense.\nOn February 16, 2021, we entered into a Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement (\"Credit Agreement\") with Silicon Valley Bank for an aggregate commitment amount of $100.0 million. The Credit Agreement bears interest at a rate per annum equal to the sum of LIBOR for the applicable interest period plus 1.75% - 2.00%, depending on the average daily outstanding balance of all loans and letters of credit under the Credit Agreement. Interest payments on outstanding borrowings are due on the last day of each interest period. The Credit Agreement has a commitment fee on the unused portion of the borrowing commitment, which is payable on the last day of each calendar quarter at a rate per annum of 0.20% - 0.25% depending on the average daily outstanding balance of all loans and letters of credit under the Credit Agreement. In addition, our Credit Agreement contains a financial covenant that requires us to maintain a consolidated adjusted quick ratio of at least 1:25 to 1:00 tested on a quarterly basis as well as a springing revenue growth covenant for certain periods if our consolidated adjusted quick ratio falls below 1.75 to 1:00 on the last day of any fiscal quarter.",

    "item_9A": "Item 9A. Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nThe Company's management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act\")), as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2020, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of such date, due to the material weakness described below, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2020.\nManagement's Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting and for the assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financing reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer and oversight of the board of directors, our management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on the criteria set forth in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Based on this evaluation, due to the material weakness described below, management concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective.\nOn October 1, 2020, we completed the acquisition of Signal Sciences Corporation (\"Signal Sciences\"). For further discussion of the Signal Sciences acquisition, refer to Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 5-Business Combinations. The Securities and Exchange Commission permits companies to exclude acquisitions from their assessment of internal control over financial reporting during the first year of an acquisition, and our management has elected to exclude Signal Sciences from our assessment as of December 31, 2020, except for goodwill and intangible assets. Signal Sciences contributed 5% of our consolidated total assets (excluding goodwill and intangible assets) and 2% of revenues as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020, respectively.\nThe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020 has been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included in Part II, Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nMaterial Weakness\nWe identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting for the year ended December 31, 2019 which remains partially unremediated for the year ended December 31, 2020. The material weakness related to the lack of sufficient qualified accounting resources, including those with the appropriate level of technical accounting knowledge, to timely identify and assess accounting implications of complex transactions which resulted in the incorrect application of generally accepted accounting principles. This control deficiency, aggregated with the other deficiencies, constitutes a material weakness. These deficiencies if left unremediated, could result in increased deficiencies of misstatements in future years.\nThe process of implementing an effective financial reporting systems is a continuous effort that requires us to anticipate and react to changes in our business and the economic and regulatory environments and to expend significant resources to maintain a financial reporting system that is adequate to satisfy our reporting obligations. We continue to evaluate and take\nactions to improve our internal control over financial reporting, which includes but is not limited to hiring additional resources, to address control deficiencies.\nNotwithstanding the material weakness, management has concluded that the financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report present fairly, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows in the conformity with GAAP.\nChanges in Internal Control\nOn December 31, 2020, we adopted the new lease accounting standard and credit and impairment loss standard. We have identified appropriate changes to our accounting policies, business processes, and related internal controls to support recognition and disclosure requirements as a result of the adoption. For the new leasing standard, these included the development of new policies including the capitalization of right-of-use assets and the recognition of the present value of lease liabilities for identified leases, ongoing contract review requirements, and gathering of information for disclosures.\nOther than as described above, there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting in connection with the evaluation required by Rules 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act that occurred during the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nInherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls\nOur management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Fastly, Inc.\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Fastly, Inc. and subsidiaries (the \u201cCompany\u201d) as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, because of the effect of the material weakness identified below on the achievement of the objectives of the control criteria, the Company has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020, of the Company and our report dated March 1, 2021, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and included an explanatory paragraph regarding the Company\u2019s adoption of a new accounting standard.\nAs described in Managements Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, management excluded from its assessment the internal control over financial reporting at Signal Sciences Corporation (\u201cSignal Sciences\u201d), which was acquired on October 1, 2020, and whose financial statements constitute 5% of consolidated total assets (excluding goodwill and intangibles) and 2% of consolidated revenue as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020. Accordingly, our audit did not include the internal control over financial reporting at Signal Sciences.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company\u2019s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nMaterial Weakness\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company\u2019s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The following material weakness has been identified and included in management's assessment: We and our independent registered public accounting firm identified a material weakness in the internal control over financial reporting for the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 which remains partially unremediated for the year ended December 31, 2020. The material weakness relates to the lack of sufficient qualified accounting resources, including those with the appropriate level of technical accounting knowledge to timely identify and assess accounting implications of complex transactions which resulted in the incorrect application of generally accepted accounting principles. This control deficiency aggregated with other deficiencies constitutes a material weakness. These deficiencies, if left unremediated, could result in increased deficiencies or misstatements in future years. This material weakness was considered in determining the nature, timing, and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020, of the Company, and this report does not affect our report on such financial statements.\n/s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP\nSan Francisco, California\nMarch 1, 2021",
