    "item_1": "Item 1. BUSINESS\nCompany Overview\nEbix, Inc. (\u201cEbix\u201d, the \u201cCompany,\u201d \u201cwe\u201d or \u201cour\u201d), a Delaware corporation, was founded in 1976 as Delphi Systems, Inc. In December 2003, the Company changed its name to Ebix, Inc. The Company is listed on the Nasdaq Global Market (\"Nasdaq\").\nThe Company has its worldwide headquarters in Johns Creek, Georgia, and also has domestic and international operations spread across over 50 offices. The countries in which the Company has operating facilities and offices, include, among others, Australia, Brazil, Canada, India, Indonesia, New Zealand, Philippines, Singapore, the United Kingdom (\"U.K.\"), United Arab of Emirates and the United States of America (\"United States\" or \"U.S.\"). In these locations, Ebix employs skilled technology and business professionals who provide products, services, support and consultancy services to thousands of customers in approximately 70 countries across six continents.\nThe Company\u2019s technology vision is to focus on the convergence of all insurance and financial exchange channels, processes and entities for seamless data flow. The Company's products feature fully customizable and scalable on-demand software designed to streamline the way insurance professionals manage distribution, marketing, sales, customer service, and accounting activities.\nEbix's goal is to be a leading facilitator of insurance and financial transactions in the world. The Company strives to work collaboratively with clients to develop innovative technology strategies and solutions that address specific business challenges and requirements. Ebix combines the newest technologies with its capabilities in consulting, systems design and integration, IT and business process outsourcing, applications software, and web and application hosting to meet the individual needs of organizations. In the Insurance sector, the Company\u2019s main focus is to develop and deploy a wide variety of insurance and reinsurance exchanges on an on-demand basis, while also providing Software-as-a-Service (\"SaaS\") enterprise solutions in the area of customer relationship management (\"CRM\"), front-end & back-end systems, outsourced administrative and risk compliance.\nThe Company\u2019s EbixCash Exchanges (\u201cEbixCash\u201d) division has developed into an integral and leading source of our revenue and profits. With a \"Phygital\u201d strategy that combines over 320,000 physical distribution outlets in India and many Associations of Southeast Asian Nations (\u201cASEAN\u201d) countries, to an Omni-channel online digital platform, the Company\u2019s EbixCash Financial exchange portfolio encompasses leadership in the areas of domestic & international money remittance, foreign exchange (Forex), travel, pre-paid & gift cards, utility payments, software solutions for lending and wealth management, etc. in India and other markets. EbixCash\u2019s Forex operations have emerged as a leader in India\u2019s airport Forex business with operations in 20 international airports, including Delhi, Mumbai, Hyderabad, Chennai and Kolkata, combined conducting over $4.8 billion in gross transaction value per year (pre-COVID-19). EbixCash\u2019s inward remittance business in India processes approximately $5 billion in gross annual remittance volume (pre-COVID-19) and is the clear market leader. EbixCash, through its travel portfolio of Via and Mercury, is one of Southeast Asia\u2019s leading travel exchanges, with over 200,000 agents, 25 branches and over 9,800 corporate clients, combined processing an estimated $2.5 billion in gross merchandise value per annum (pre-COVID-19).\nThe Company\u2019s E-learning solutions are provided to schools across the breadth of India with the goal of educating students in classrooms through high quality 2-D and 3-D animation and multimedia learning.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, approximately 91% of Ebix revenues came from EbixCash and Insurance Exchanges. International revenue accounted for 73.4% and 68.6% of the Company\u2019s total revenue for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nAcquisition & Integration Strategy\nWhile not entirely critical to our future profitability or liquidity, the Company views acquisitions as an integral part of its growth strategy, an efficient way to further expand its reach, and an effective utilization of the operating cash generated from the Company's business. We are strategic and selective when making acquisitions. We look to make complementary accretive acquisitions as and when the Company has sufficient liquidity, stable cash flows, and, if necessary, access to financing at attractive interest rates.\nThe Company seeks to acquire businesses that complement Ebix's existing products and services. Any acquisition made by Ebix typically will fall into one of two different categories: (i) the acquired company has products and/or services that are competitive to our existing products and services; or (ii) the acquired company's products and services are either a complement to or an extension of our existing products and services or our core business competencies.\nIn cases where an acquired company's products and services are competitive to our existing products and services, upon acquisition, the Company immediately strives towards the goal of providing a single product or service in the functional area with a common code base around the world, rather than having multiple products addressing the same need. In each case, the Company immediately works towards assimilating the best of breed functionality on a common architecture. The Company's goal remains to provide easy-to-use solutions for our customer base, while ensuring that any product or service integrates seamlessly with other existing or outside functionalities. Regardless of whether the acquired company's product/service is retired, or the existing Ebix product/service is retired, the Company is focused on maximizing operational efficiency for our business while creating cutting-edge products and services that make future product sales more robust and maintenance more efficient.\nOnce an acquisition is consummated, the infrastructure, human resources, sales, product management, development, and other common functions are integrated with our existing operations to ensure that efficiencies are maximized and redundancies eliminated. We generally do not maintain separate sales, development, product management, implementation or quality control functions following the closing of any acquisition. The Company integrates and, where appropriate, centralizes certain key functions, such as product development, information technology, marketing, sales, finance, administration, and quality assurance, immediately after an acquisition to ensure that the Company can maximize cost efficiencies. Simultaneously with the integration of any acquired company, the Company's resources and infrastructure are leveraged to work across multiple functions, products and services, making it neither practical nor feasible to precisely track and disclose separately the specific earnings impact from the business combinations we have executed after they have been acquired. Consequently, the concept of \u201cacquisitive growth\u201d versus \u201corganic growth\u201d becomes obscured given the dynamics and underlying operating principals of Ebix's acquisition, integration, and growth strategy. This tactic is a key part of our business strategy that facilitates high levels of efficiency, operating income margins and consistent end-to-end vision for our business. Our plan is to make niche acquisitions in the insurance, international financial exchange, e-learning, and healthcare sectors, integrate them seamlessly into the Company and make them efficient by implementing Ebix's standardized processes, with the goal of increasing operating profits and cash flows for the Company.\nIn many of the acquisitions made by the Company there are contingent consideration terms associated with the achievement of certain designated revenue targets for the acquired Company. This structure allows us to follow through with our integration strategy, while enabling the acquired company to be eligible for revenue-based contingent purchase consideration. Accordingly, we are able to maximize operational productivity while allowing the principals of the acquired company to maximize the potential economics from the sale process.\nThe Company's integration strategies are targeted at improving the efficiency of our business, centralizing key functions, exercising better control over our operations, and providing consistent technology and product vision across all functions, entities and products. This is a key part of our business philosophy designed to enable Ebix to operate at a high level of efficiency and facilitate a consistent end-to-end strategic vision for the industries we serve.\nRecent Strategic Business Acquisitions\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020 the Company completed two business acquisitions, as follows:\nTrimax- Effective May 4, 2020, Ebix acquired from bankruptcy India-based Trimax, which provides IT and integration services to state-owned transport corporations, operates data centers, and is an IT infrastructure solution provider, for approximately $9.9 million of upfront consideration. Additionally, Ebix issued preferred shares in Trimax to the selling shareholders that can be sold five years from the closing of the acquisition based on an independent valuation performed by a Big 4 valuation firm. The maximum potential value of the preferred shares is approximately $9.9 million. The valuation and purchase price allocation remains preliminary and will be finalized as soon as practicable but in no event longer than one year from the effective date of this transaction.\nAssureEdge- Effective October 1, 2020 the Company acquired a 70% interest in AssureEdge Global Services (\u201cAssureEdge\u201d) for a total purchase price of approximately $5.0 million, including net working capital acquired. AssureEdge is pan-India based business process outsourcing (\"BPO\") company, with a variety of BPO offerings via six contact centers across India. It serves a number of industries and clients that have cross-selling value for EbixCash services. The valuation and purchase price allocation remains preliminary and will be finalized as soon as practicable but in no event longer than one year from the effective date of this transaction.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019 the Company completed three business acquisitions, as follows:\nWallstreet Canada - Effective August 23, 2019, Ebix acquired Canada-based Wall Street Finance (Canada) Ltd. (\"Wallstreet Canada\"), a foreign exchange and outward remittance service provider, for approximately $2.1 million of upfront consideration inclusive of net acquired working capital.\nEssel Forex - Effective January 1, 2019, Ebix acquired the assets of India-based Essel Forex Limited (\"Essel Forex\"), for approximately $8.7 million, plus possible future contingent earn-out payments of up to $721 thousand based on revenues. Ebix funded the entire transaction in cash using its internal cash reserves. Essel Forex is a large provider of foreign exchange services in India with a wide spectrum of related products, including sales of all major currencies, travelers\u2019 checks, demand drafts, remittances, money transfers and prepaid cards primarily for corporate clients. The earn-out period expired on December 31, 2019 and the acquired business did not meet the requisite revenue target, so no earn out payment was due or paid.\nZillious - Effective January 1, 2019, Ebix acquired an 80% controlling stake in India-based Zillious Solutions Private Limited (\"Zillious\") for $10.1 million plus possible future contingent earn-out payments of up to $2.2 million based on agreed to milestones in the acquisition agreement. Zillious is an on-demand SaaS travel technology solution in the corporate travel segment in India. The Company determined that the fair value of the contingent earn-out consideration was zero as of September 30, 2020 and at December 31, 2020.\nIndustry Overview\nThe insurance and financial industry markets have initiatives to reduce paper-based processes and facilitate efficiencies of both the back-end and the consumer-end (front-end) sides of processes. This evolution has involved all industry constituents and is directly impacting the manner in which various products are distributed. Management believes that both industries will continue to experience significant change and increased efficiencies through online exchanges as reduced paper-based processes are becoming increasingly a norm across world markets.\nProducts and Services\nThe Company reports as a single segment. The Company\u2019s revenues are derived from three product/service groups. Presented in the table below is the breakout of our revenue streams for each of those product/service groups for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018:\nFor the Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n(In thousands) 2020 2019 2018\nEbixCash Exchanges 388,293 319,953 217,457\nInsurance Exchanges 178,111 190,067 192,604\nRisk Compliance Solutions 59,205 70,595 87,765\nTotals $ 625,609 $ 580,615 $ 497,826\nInformation on the geographic dispersion of the Company\u2019s revenues and long-lived assets is furnished in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements, included in Part II Item 8 of this Form 10-K.

    "item_3": "Item 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nOn February 22, 2021, Christine Marie Teifke, a purported purchaser of Ebix, Inc. securities, filed a putative class action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on behalf of herself and others who purchased or acquired Ebix securities between November 9, 2020 and February 19, 2021. The complaint asserts claims against Ebix, Inc., Robin Raina, and Steven M. Hamil, for purported violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, alleging that Ebix, Inc. made false and misleading statements and failed to disclose material adverse facts about an audit of the company's gift card business in India and its internal controls over the gift and prepaid card revenue transaction cycle. The complaint also asserts a claim against Robin Raina and Steven M. Hamil for purported violations of Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act arising out of the same facts. The complaint seeks, among other relief, damages and attorneys' fees and costs.\nOn July 16, 2019, Yatra Online, Inc. (\"Yatra\"), Ebix, Inc. (\"Ebix\"), and EbixCash Travels, Inc. (\"Merger Sub\") entered into a Merger Agreement. On May 14, 2020, Yatra entered into an agreement with Ebix and Merger Sub extending the outside date of the Merger Agreement (the \"Extension Agreement\"). On June 5, 2020, Yatra terminated the Merger Agreement and filed a complaint in the Delaware Court of Chancery against Ebix and Merger Sub (the \"Complaint\"). On September 25, 2020, Yatra amended the Complaint and added as a defendant each financial institution (each, a \u201cDefendant Lender\u201d) party to the Credit Facility, which, prior to the filing of the original Complaint, had been previously amended on May 7, 2020 (the \u201cCredit Facility\u201d). The Complaint, as amended, alleges that Ebix and Merger Sub breached certain representations, warranties, and covenants contained in the Merger Agreement and the Extension Agreement and that Ebix negotiated in bad faith. The amended Complaint also alleges fraudulent actions by Ebix and the Defendant Lenders arising from certain terms of the Credit Facility and tortious interference with the closing of the Merger Agreement by Ebix and the Defendant Lenders. The Complaint seeks, among other relief, damages, pre-judgment and post-judgment interest, and attorneys' fees and costs. Ebix and Merger Sub deny any liability and intend to defend the action vigorously.\nOn May 12, 2017, Ebix Software India Pvt. Ltd. (\u201cEbixcash\u201d) entered into several agreements with the most prominent shareholders of Itz Cash Card Limited (\u201cItz\u201d), the most relevant among these a stock purchase agreement (the \u201cSPA\u201d), to purchase a majority ownership stake in Itz. Further, as part of the overall purchase of Itz, a share purchase agreement between Ebixcash and individual ESOP holders of Itz was entered into on July 7, 2017 (the \u201cESOP SPA\u201d) (with the SPA, the ESOP SPA and the other purchase documents, collectively, the \u201cTransaction Documents\u201d). Part of the consideration for Ebixcash\u2019s purchase of Itz consisted of two individual potential earn-out payments, the first for the period for the year ended March 31, 2019 (the \u201cFirst Earn-Out\u201d) and the second for the following year, ending on March 31, 2020 (the \u201cSecond Earn-Out\u201d). Neither the First Earn-Out nor the Second Earn-Out were achieved pursuant to the terms of the SPA. After correspondence between the parties between September 2019 and May 2020, the former shareholders of Itz (\u201cSellers\u201d) sent Ebixcash notices of arbitration (\u201cNOAs\u201d) under which they were availing themselves of the arbitration dispute provisions set forth in the Transaction Documents. Apart from the amounts claimed owed under the earn-out provisions, the Sellers also alleged in the NOAs other violations of the terms of the Transaction Documents, including, certain non-competition and restricted matter approval violations. The matter is under Arbitration in accordance with the rules of the Singapore International Arbitration Centre. The Company believes that each of the Sellers claims is without merit and continues to defend its position vigorously. The Company believes that Ebixcash has several viable counterclaims related to improper termination of the Transaction Documents and violation of non-compete provisions.\nAs the Company has previously disclosed, in May 2013, twelve putative class action complaints were filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery against the Company and its board of directors challenging a proposed merger between the Company and an affiliate of Goldman Sachs & Co. On June 10, 2013, the Court entered an Order of Consolidation and Appointment of Lead Plaintiffs and a Leadership Structure consolidating the twelve actions and appointing lead plaintiffs (\u201cPlaintiffs\u201d) and lead counsel in the litigation, captioned In re Ebix, Inc. Stockholder Litigation, Consol. C.A. No. 8526-VCS (the \u201cLitigation\u201d). In connection with the Litigation, on January 23, 2019, the parties entered into a Stipulation and Agreement of Settlement (the \u201cSettlement Agreement\u201d) pursuant to which the parties agreed, subject to approval by the Delaware Court of Chancery, to settle and resolve the Litigation pursuant to the terms set forth in the Settlement Agreement (the \u201cLitigation Settlement\u201d). On April 5, 2019, the Delaware Court of Chancery determined that the Litigation Settlement was fair, reasonable, adequate and in the best interest of the plaintiffs, the class and the Company and awarded to plaintiffs\u2019 counsel attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses in the sum of $19.65 million, payable by the Company within 20 days, and entered an Order and Final Judgment (the \u201cOrder\u201d) approving the Litigation Settlement. The Order provides for full settlement, satisfaction, compromise and release of all claims that were asserted or could have been asserted in the Litigation, whether on behalf of the class or the Company. The Order is publicly available for inspection at the Office of the Register in Chancery, and on the Court's online electronic filing system, File & ServeXpress. The Settlement contains no admission of wrongdoing or liability, and may not be deemed to be a presumption as to the validity of any claims, causes of action or other issues. The Settlement was fully paid on May 2, 2019.\nThe Company is involved in various other claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business, which in the opinion of management, the ultimate likely disposition of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity.",

The P&C exchanges operate primarily in Australia, New Zealand and the U.K. With a \"Phygital\u201d strategy that combines over 320,000 physical distribution outlets in India and many (\u201cASEAN\u201d) countries, to an Omni-channel online digital platform, the Company\u2019s EbixCash Financial exchange portfolio encompasses leadership in the areas of domestic and international money remittance, Forex, travel, pre-paid & gift cards, utility payments, software solutions for lending and wealth management etc., in India and other markets.

Combined subscription-based and transaction-based revenues of $552 million comprised 88% of the Company's total revenues in 2020, as compared to 84% of total revenues in 2019. In 2020, subscription-based revenues decreased by approximately $14 million to $164 million, and as a percentage of the Company's total revenues was 26% in 2020 versus 31% in 2019. The Company has modified the classification of certain revenues in 2020, which impacts the presentation of 2019 revenues and percentages above versus the 2019 10-K presentation.\nThe Company\u2019s technology vision is to converge processes in a manner such that data can seamlessly flow between entities after an initial data entry has been made. Our customers include many of the top insurance and financial sector companies in the world.\nThe insurance and financial markets continue to focus on initiatives to reduce paper-based processes and facilitate improvements in efficiency, both on the back end of transactions as well as at the consumer-involved front end of transaction processes. This drive for efficiency involves all entities and directly impacts the manner in which insurance and financial products are distributed. Management believes that both the insurance and financial services industries will continue to\nexperience significant change and increased efficiencies through online exchanges as reduced paper-based processes are becoming increasingly the norm across the world insurance and financial markets.\nTrends and Uncertainties Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic\nIn December 2019, COVID-19 was reported and has spread globally, including to every state in the U.S. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic, and on March 13, 2020 the U.S. government declared a national emergency with respect to COVID-19.\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, many state, local, and foreign governments implemented travel restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders, and similar government orders and restrictions, in an attempt to control the spread of the disease. Such restrictions or orders, or the perception that such restrictions or orders could be implemented, resulted in business closures, work stoppages, slowdowns and delays, work-from-home policies, and the cancellation or postponement of events.\nBeginning in March 2020, in an effort to protect our employees and comply with applicable government orders, we restricted non-essential employee travel and transitioned our employees to a remote work environment. We have not experienced a material impact from shifting our employees to a remote work environment, which we primarily attribute to the professionalism of our workforce and our extensive use of technology throughout our business. However, COVID-19 could negatively impact the productivity of our workforce if the pandemic requires prolonged remote working conditions.\nDuring the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, particularly beginning in March, we experienced a decrease in demand for certain of our solutions and services, particularly those related to the Company's travel, foreign exchange, remittance, e-learning and consulting business areas, after certain government restrictions were implemented. This decreased demand continued throughout 2020 in varying degrees for each business area, and even persists through the date of this filing for all of the above mentioned business areas, but most notably in the travel and foreign exchange businesses. We expect that demand variability for our products and services will continue as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and cannot predict with any certainty when demand for these solutions/services will return to pre-COVID-19 levels.\nWe continue to monitor developments related to COVID-19 and remain flexible in our response to the challenges presented by the pandemic. Along with the measures mentioned above to protect the health and safety of our employees, we have also taken steps to strengthen our financial position to mitigate the adverse impact that COVID-19 has had or may have on our business and operations, including amending our Credit Facility, reducing salaries for certain employees, furloughing employees in the most negatively impacted business areas, eliminating certain employee positions, and eliminating, reducing, or deferring non-essential expenditures. Additionally, we have taken steps to preserve cash balances, including a temporary cessation to our share repurchase program.\nOur reported results for the year ended December 31, 2020 may not be reflective of current market conditions, or of our results for any future periods, which may be negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic to a greater extent than the reported period. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic may also exacerbate other risks discussed in this Annual Report. Refer to Item 1A. \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a complete description of the material risks that the Company currently faces.\nKey Performance Indicators\nManagement focuses on a variety of key indicators to monitor the Company's operating and financial performance. These performance indicators include measurements of revenue growth, operating income, operating margin, income from continuing operations, diluted earnings per share, and cash provided by operating activities. We monitor these indicators, in conjunction with our corporate governance practices, to ensure efficient management of our business and maintenance of effective controls.\nThe MD&A discusses year-to-year comparisons between 2020 and 2019. Discussions of year-to-year comparisons between 2019 and 2018 are not included in this Form 10-K, but can be found in \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in the Company\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 filed with the SEC on March 2, 2020.\nThe key performance indicators for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 were as follows:\nKey Performance Indicators\nTwelve Months Ended December 31,\n(In thousands except per share data) 2020 2019 2018\nRevenue $ 625,609 $ 580,615 $ 497,826\nRevenue growth 8 % 17 % 37 %\nOperating income $ 125,802 $ 155,673 $ 152,979\nNet income attributable to Ebix, Inc. $ 92,377 $ 96,720 $ 93,139\nDiluted earnings per share $ 3.02 $ 3.16 $ 2.95\nCash provided by operating activities $ 100,356 $ 60,793 $ 83,455\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2019 2018\n(In thousands)\nOperating revenue: $ 625,609 $ 580,615 $ 497,826\nOperating expenses:\nCosts of services provided 343,262 205,165 168,415\nProduct development 35,267 45,302 39,078\nSales and marketing 13,835 19,578 17,587\nGeneral and administrative, net 87,537 140,429 108,475\nAmortization and depreciation 13,738 14,468 11,292\nImpairment of intangible asset 6,168 - -\nTotal operating expenses 499,807 424,942 344,847\nOperating income 125,802 155,673 152,979\nInterest expense, net (31,411) (41,703) (26,665)\nOther non-operating income 153 337 60\nNon-operating expense - securities litigation - (21,140) -\nForeign exchange loss, net (387) (2,376) (792)\nIncome before taxes 94,157 90,791 125,582\nIncome tax expense (5,330) (220) (32,501)\nNet income including noncontrolling interest $ 88,827 $ 90,571 $ 93,081\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interest (3,550) $ (6,149) $ (58)\nNet income attributable to Ebix, Inc. $ 92,377 $ 96,720 $ 93,139\nTWELVE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2020 AND 2019\nOperating Revenue\nThe Company derives its revenues primarily from subscription and transaction fees pertaining to products or services delivered over our exchanges or from our ASP, fees for business process outsourcing services, and fees for software development projects, including fees for consulting, implementation, training, and project management provided to customers with installed systems, e-governance solutions to governmental agencies in the health and education sectors, as well as foreign exchange, remittance (both inward and outward) and travel services from our financial exchanges.\nEbix\u2019s revenue streams come from three product/service channels. Presented in the table below is the breakout of our revenues for each of those product/service channels for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nFor the Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n(In thousands) 2020 2019\nEbixCash Exchanges 388,293 319,953\nInsurance Exchanges 178,111 190,067\nRisk Compliance Solutions 59,205 70,595\nTotals $ 625,609 $ 580,615\nIn the table above for the year ending December 31, 2020 and 2019 there are $13.1 million and $17.5 million, respectively, of Insurance Exchange revenues derived in India that are being reported within the EbixCash Exchange channel above.\nDuring the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, our total revenue increased $45.0 million, or 8%, to $625.6 million compared to $580.6 million in 2019. On March 11, 2020, COVID-19 was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization. Across the U.S. and the world, governments and municipalities instituted measures to control the spread of COVID-19, including quarantines, shelter-in-place orders, school closings, travel restrictions and the closure of non-essential businesses. Countries across the world are re-opening economies, but are doing so in phases that differ in each country and, in many cases, within individual countries. While our travel, foreign exchange, remittance and e-learning businesses continue to be materially negatively impacted by COVID-19, the increase in 2020 total revenue year-over-year was due primarily to strong demand for the Company's payment solutions offerings in India (primarily prepaid gift cards), which increased by more than $200 million year-over-year to approximately $256 million, or 590% year-over-year growth. The increased demand for prepaid gift cards in India was primarily due to: (i) changes in regulations by the Reserve Bank of India related to debit cards, which has shifted demand in the market towards prepaid gift cards; (ii) COVID-19, which has facilitated increased online and electronic commerce due to restrictive lockdowns in 2020; and (iii) the Company's increased marketing efforts around the prepaid gift card business. The Company\u2019s travel, foreign exchange, remittance and e-learning businesses had a year-over-year decline in revenues in 2020 in excess of $150 million, an approximately 65% decline year-over-year, which offset the growth in the payments solutions business.\nThe impact from fluctuations of the exchange rates for the foreign currencies in the countries in which we conduct operations also adversely affected reported revenue. During each of the years 2020 and 2019 the change in foreign currency exchange rates decreased reported consolidated operating revenue by $(21.9) million and $(9.3) million, respectively. Thus, on a constant currency basis total revenue for the fiscal year 2020 increased approximately 12% year-over-year.\nThe specific components of our revenue based on our three main business lines and the changes experienced during the past year are discussed immediately below.\nOverall Exchange revenues increased $56.4 million, or 11%, as explained below:\n\u2022Insurance Exchange division revenues decreased by $12.0 million, or 6%, principally due to challenges faced in our health content services channel, and the negative effect of foreign exchange losses associated with the strengthening U.S. dollar\n\u2022EbixCash Exchange division revenues increased $68.3 million, or 21%, due to a mix of organic growth and business acquisitions in the travel, foreign exchange, and software solutions sectors, offset by foreign exchange losses associated with the strengthening of the US Dollar.\n\u2022Risk Compliance Solutions division revenues decreased by $11.4 million, or 16%, primarily due to a decline in our U.S. professional consulting services associated with some major realignments in the sector.\nInternational revenue accounted for 73% and 69% of the Company\u2019s total revenue for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nCosts of Services Provided\nCosts of services provided, which includes costs associated with product sales, customer support, consulting, implementation, and training services increased $138.1 million, or 67%, from $205.2 million in 2019 to $343.3 million in 2020 and the Company's gross margin decreased to 45.1% in 2020 from 64.7% in 2019. The increase in costs of services provided and the decrease in gross margin from fiscal year 2019 to 2020 is directly related to the increase in over $200 million in revenue within the Company\u2019s payment solutions business (primarily gift card revenue) in fiscal years 2020 versus 2019. Payment solutions gross margins are significantly lower than other solutions and services the Company provides its customers. In fiscal years 2020 and 2019, the payment solutions gross margins for the Company were approximately 1% and 9.5%, respectively. Excluding the payment solutions business, gross margins for the Company in fiscal years 2020 and 2019 were approximately 76% and 68%, respectively. The increase in gross margins, excluding the payment solutions business, in fiscal year 2020 versus 2019 was driven by the revenue mix differences for the Company, with the Company\u2019s highest margin solutions/services (e.g. insurance exchange software and services) experiencing less relative negative impact from COVID-19 during 2020 versus other solutions/services (e.g. travel, foreign exchange and remittance businesses).\nProduct Development Expenses\nThe Company\u2019s product development efforts are focused on the development of new technologies for insurance carriers, brokers and agents, and the development of new data exchanges for use in domestic and international insurance markets, as well as the Forex and travel sectors. Product development expenses decreased $10.0 million, or 22%, from $45.3 million in 2019 to $35.3 million in 2020. The decrease is due to reduced personnel costs and is directly related to actions taken by management to reduce overall corporate expenditures in fiscal year 2020 versus 2019 in response to COVID-19.\nSales and Marketing Expenses\nSales and marketing expenses decreased $5.7 million, or 29%, from $19.6 million in 2019 to $13.8 million in 2020. This decrease is primarily due to reduced advertising and marketing costs in response to COVID-19.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative (\"G&A\") expenses decreased $52.9 million, or 38%, from $140.4 million in 2019 to $87.5 million in 2020. This decrease was driven mostly by management\u2019s strategic response to COVID-19 to reduce overall corporate costs, as well as material rent reductions and abatements as a result of COVID-19. Specifically, personnel-related costs decreased approximately $28 million in fiscal year 2020 as compared to 2019, and rent expense in fiscal year 2020 was approximately $23 million less than in fiscal year 2019. Other items impacting the year-to-year comparison of G&A expenses include a reduction in bad debt expense of approximately $12 million in fiscal year 2020 as compared to 2019 due to the $12.1 million accounts receivable reserve that was recognized in the third quarter of 2019 as a precautionary measure in regards to receivables that are due from a public sector entity in India and that were billed during the 2016 through 2019 operating periods. Additionally, in 2019 the Company reduced the acquisition earn out accrual for the ItzCash acquisition by $15.4 million, which served to decrease overall G&A expenses in 2019. The one-time accounts receivable reserve of $12.1 million (increased G&A expense) and the $15.4 million earn out accrual reduction (reduced G&A expense) largely offset the impacts to overall G&A expense in fiscal year 2019.\nAmortization and Depreciation Expenses\nAmortization and depreciation expenses decreased $730 thousand, or 5%, to $13.7 million in 2020 from $14.5 million in 2019 primarily due to lower amortization in 2020 versus 2019 related to definite lived intangibles resulting from prior acquisition activity, primarily in India.\nInterest Income\nInterest income decreased $462 thousand, or 73%, from $629 thousand in 2019 to $167 thousand in 2020 primarily due to decreases in the comparative balances in interest bearing accounts and overall lower interest rates in 2020 compared to 2019.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense decreased $10.8 million, or 25% from $42.3 million in 2019 to $31.6 million in 2020, primarily due to decrease LIBOR interest rates in 2020 versus 2019. Additionally, The Company\u2019s working capital facilities in India had average balances that were approximately $30 million lower in 2020 versus 2019. These working capital facilities generally carry interest rates of between 6.75% and 9.45%. The decrease in working capital facilities was associated with both COVID-19's impact on operations and renegotiated customer agreements that improved the Company\u2019s payment terms in 2020 relative to 2019.\nForeign Exchange Loss\nNet foreign exchange loss of $387 thousand in 2020 which consisted of net losses realized and unrealized upon the settlement of receivables or payables and re-measurement of cash balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the respective operating division recording the instrument. In fiscal year 2019, a net foreign currency exchange loss of $2.4 million was recorded.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company recognized income tax expense of $5.3 million in 2020 compared to $0.2 million of income tax expense in 2019, representing an increase of $5.1 million. Our effective tax rate increased to 5.7% in 2020, compared with 0.2% in 2019. The increase in the effective tax rate in 2020 is due to a decrease in the availability of tax credits in 2020 as compared to 2019, as well as a lower tax holiday benefit available in 2020 compared to 2019 and a lower benefit from state tax deductions.\nThe pre-tax income from and the applicable statutory tax rates in each jurisdiction in which the Company had operations for the year ending December 31, 2020 are as follows:\n(In thousands) Pre-tax income Statutory tax rate\nUnited States (27,528) 21.0 %\nCanada (29) 26.5 %\nBrazil 3,708 34.0 %\nAustralia 2,332 30.0 %\nSingapore 2,654 17.0 %\nNew Zealand 899 28.0 %\nIndia 47,925 34.6 %\nMauritius (3,358) 15.0 %\nUnited Kingdom 5,056 19.0 %\nSweden 1,977 22.0 %\nThailand (19) 20.0 %\nDubai 60,540 ----%\nTotal 94,157\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nOur principal sources of liquidity are the cash flows provided by our operating activities, and cash and cash equivalents on hand.\nWe intend to continue to utilize cash flows generated by our ongoing operating activities, in combination with the possible issuance of additional debt or equity, to fund capital expenditures and organic growth initiatives, to make strategic business acquisitions, to retire outstanding indebtedness, and to repurchase shares of our common stock if and as market and operating conditions warrant.\nWe believe that anticipated cash flows provided by our operating activities, together with current cash balances and access to credit and the capital markets, if required, will be sufficient to meet our projected cash requirements for the next twelve months, although any projections of future cash needs, cash flows, and the general market conditions for credit and equity securities is subject to substantial uncertainty. In the event additional liquidity needs arise, we may raise funds from a combination of sources, including the potential issuance of debt or equity securities. However, there are no assurances that such financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. In addition, the covenants in our Credit Facility could adversely affect our ability to obtain such financing and our ability to make strategic acquisitions, fund investments, repurchase shares of our common stock or engage in other business activities that could be in our interest.\nWe regularly evaluate our liquidity requirements, including the need for additional debt or equity offerings, when considering potential business acquisitions, or the development of new products or services. During fiscal year 2021, the Company intends to utilize its cash and other financing resources to fund organic growth initiatives, strategic business acquisitions, and new product development initiatives and service offerings.\nOur cash and cash equivalents were $105.0 million and $73.2 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The Company holds material cash and cash equivalent balances overseas in foreign jurisdictions. The free flow of cash from certain countries where we hold such balances may be subject to repatriation tax effects and other restrictions. Furthermore, the repatriation of earnings from some of our foreign subsidiaries would result in the application of withholding taxes at source and taxation at the U.S. parent level upon receipt of the repatriation amounts. The approximate cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and short-term investments balances held in our domestic U.S. operations and each of our foreign subsidiaries as of April 19, 2021 is presented in the table below (figures denominated in thousands):\nCash,\nRestricted\nCash and ST\ninvestments\nIndia $ 66,879\nUnited States 15,164\nPhilippines 7,352\nAustralia 7,245\nSingapore 3,980\nCanada 2,079\nUnited Arab Emirates 1,373\nNew Zealand 1,224\nLatin America 1,206\nIndonesia 1,077\nEurope 505\nMauritius 10\nTotal $ 108,094\nOur current ratio increased from 1.55 at December 31, 2019 to 1.89 at December 31, 2020, and our working capital position increased to $170.5 million at December 31, 2020 as compared to $129.0 million at the end of 2019. The increase in our short-term liquidity position is primarily due to the following factors: (a) an approximately $91 million reduction in cash used for acquisitions in 2020 as compared to 2019; (b) a decrease in trade accounts receivable and accounts receivable from service providers at December 31, 2020 versus December 31, 2019 of approximately $24 million; and (c) partially offset by an approximately $44 million decrease in current liabilities during 2020, an increase in short-term investments of approximately $21 million at December 31, 2020 compared to December 31, 2019, and a decrease in the Company's working capital facilities at December 31, 2020 as compared to December 31, 2019 of approximately $12 million. We believe that our ability to generate sustainable robust cash flow from operations will enable the Company to continue to meet its debt obligations and to fund its current liabilities from current assets, including available cash balances.\nBusiness Combinations\nThe Company seeks to execute accretive business acquisitions in combination with organic growth initiatives as part of its comprehensive business growth and expansion strategy. The Company looks to acquire businesses that are complementary to Ebix's existing products and services.\nDuring the twelve months ending December 31, 2020, the Company completed two business acquisition as follows:\nEffective May 4, 2020, Ebix acquired from bankruptcy India-based Trimax, which provides IT and integration services to state-owned transport corporations, operates data centers, and is an IT infrastructure solution provider, for approximately $9.9 million of upfront consideration. Additionally, Ebix issued preferred shares in Trimax to the selling shareholders that can be sold five years from the closing of the acquisition based on an independent valuation performed by a Big 4 valuation firm. The maximum value of the preferred shares upon sale is approximately $9.9 million. The valuation and purchase price allocation remains preliminary and will be finalized as soon as practicable but in no event longer than one year from the effective date of this transaction.\nIn October 1, 2020 the Company acquired a 70% interest in AssureEdge Global Services (\u201cAssureEdge\u201d) for a total purchase price of approximately $5.0 million, including net working capital acquired. AssureEdge is a pan-India based BPO company, with a variety of BPO offerings via six contact centers across the country. It serves a number of industries and clients that have cross-selling value for EbixCash services. The valuation and purchase price allocation remains preliminary and will be finalized as soon as practicable, but in no event longer than one year from the effective date of this transaction.\nDuring the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, the Company completed three business acquisitions, as follows:\nEffective August 23, 2019, Ebix acquired Canada based Wallstreet Canada foreign exchange and outward remittance markets for approximately $2.1 million of upfront consideration plus net working capital.\nEffective January 1, 2019, Ebix acquired the assets of India based Essel Forex, for approximately $8.7 million, plus possible future contingent earn-out payments of up to $721 thousand based on earned revenues. Ebix funded the entire transaction in cash, using its internal cash reserves. Essel Forex is a large provider of foreign exchange services in India with a wide spectrum of related products including sales of all major currencies, travelers\u2019 checks, demand drafts, remittances, money transfers and prepaid cards primarily for corporate clients. The earn-out period expired on December 31, 2019 and the acquired business did not meet the requisite revenue target, so no earnout payment was due or paid.\nEffective January 1, 2019, Ebix acquired an 80% controlling stake in India based Zillious for $10.1 million plus possible future contingent earn-out payments of up to $2.2 million based on agreed milestones in the acquisition agreement. Zillious is an on-demand SaaS travel technology solution in the corporate travel segment in India. Zillious is an on-demand SaaS travel technology solution in the corporate travel segment in India. The Company determined that the fair value of the contingent earn-out consideration was zero as of September 30, 2020 and at December 31, 2020.\nA significant component of the purchase price consideration for many of the Company's business acquisitions is a potential subsequent cash earn-out payment based on reaching certain specified future revenue targets. The terms for the contingent earn-out payments in most of the Company's business acquisitions typically address the GAAP recognizable revenues achieved by the acquired entity over a one-, two-, and/or three-year period subsequent to the effective date of their acquisition by Ebix. These terms typically establish a minimum threshold revenue target to achieve over the agreed upon period post acquisition to earn the specified cash earn-out payment. The Company applies these terms in its calculation and determination of the fair value of contingent earn-out liabilities for purchased businesses as part of the related valuation and purchase price allocation exercise for the corresponding acquired assets and liabilities. The Company recognizes these potential obligations as contingent liabilities and are reported as such on its Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. As discussed in more detail in Note 1 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, these contingent consideration liabilities are recorded at fair value on the acquisition date and are re-measured quarterly based on the then assessed fair value and adjusted if necessary. As of December 31, 2020, the total of these contingent liabilities was $0.0 million. As of December 31, 2019, the total of these contingent liabilities was $10.1 million, of which $1.5 million was reported in long-term liabilities, and $8.6 million was included in current liabilities in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nOperating Activities\nFor the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, the Company generated $100.4 million of net cash flow from operating activities compared to $60.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, representing an increase of $39.6 million, or 65%. The major sources of cash provided by our operating activities during 2020 included net income of $92.4 million, adjusted for $3.6 million of net loss attributable to non-controlling interest, $13.7 million of depreciation and amortization, $6.1 million of amortization of right-of-use assets, $6.2 million related to a non-cash intangible impairment loss, $4.8 million of non-cash share-based compensation, $3.4 million of amortization expense for capitalized software development costs, $(19.9) million of working capital requirements, $(6.5) million of cash used to pay the Miles acquisition earn out, and $(3.1) million of non-cash gains recognized when reducing certain earn-out contingent liabilities. The increase in our operating cash flow in\n2020 as compared to 2019 is primarily due to increased cash flow from reductions in accounts receivable from trade and service providers as COVID-19 reduced revenues and resulted in comparatively more accounts receivable conversion to cash in 2020 versus 2019. Additionally, in 2019 the acquisition earn-out accrual was reduced by $16.5 million (primarily related to the ItzCash acquisition earn out accrual) as compared to a reduction of the same accrual in 2020 of $3.1 million (primarily related to the Miles and Zillious acquisitions), both of which served to reduce operating cash flow given the non-cash nature of the gains from earn-out adjustments.\nFor the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, the Company generated $60.8 million of net cash flow from operating activities compared to $87.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, representing a decrease of $26.5 million, or 30%. The major sources of cash provided by our operating activities during 2019 included net income of $96.7 million, less $6.1 million of net income attributable to a non-controlling interest, and net of $(16.5) million of non-cash gains recognized when reducing certain earn-out contingent liabilities, $(15.5) million of deferred tax benefits, $14.5 million of depreciation and amortization, $7.1 million of amortization of right-of-use assets, $3.4 million of non-cash share-based compensation, $2.7 million of amortization expense for capitalized software development costs, and $(26.5) million of working capital requirements. The primary cause for the decrease in our operating cash flow was the cash required to fund our substantially increased gross merchandise value (\"GMV\") transactions for our travel and foreign exchange business and the $19.7 million paid to settle the derivative litigation matter discussed in Item 3 \"Legal Proceedings\".\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used for investing activities during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 totaled $44.8 million, primarily related to a $21.0 million decrease in investment in marketable securities (specifically bank certificates of deposits), $14.3 million used for the acquisitions during the year (net of cash acquired), $5.3 million of capital expenditures to support our operations, and $4.2 million used and capitalized in connection with the development of software to be sold/marketed or used internally.\nNet cash used for investing activities during the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, totaled $96.7 million and consisted of $105.5 million used for acquisitions during the year (net of cash acquired), $5.3 million to reacquire Paul Merchant's 10% equity interest in Ebix\u2019s combined international remittance business in India, $4.9 million of capital expenditures mainly in India to support our growing operations, and $8.0 million used and capitalized in connection with the development of software to be sold and marketed, or used internally. Partially offsetting these outflows was $27.0 million from the net maturities of marketable securities (specifically bank certificates of deposit).\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash used by financing activities during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, was $42.0 million, and primarily consisted of a $10.9 million decrease in the year-end balances in our working capital facilities in India, $20.7 million used to make scheduled payments against the Company\u2019s outstanding Credit Facility term loan, and $9.2 million used to pay quarterly dividends to the holders of our common stock.\nNet cash provided by financing activities during the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 was $905 thousand, and primarily consisted of $13.0 million used to reacquire 295 thousand shares of the Company's common stock, $9.2 million used to pay quarterly dividends to the holders of our common stock, and $15.1 million used to make scheduled payments against the Credit Facility term loan. Partially offsetting this cash outflow was $13.5 million provided via borrowings under the Company's revolving credit facility, repayment of a $6.5 million short term loan that had been made to a third party, and $19.1 million net funds provided by the EbixCash working capital facilities in India.\nCredit Facility\nThe Company maintains a senior secured syndicated credit facility, dated August 5, 2014, among Ebix, Inc., as borrower, its subsidiaries party thereto from time to time as guarantors, Regions Bank (as administrative agent and collateral agent) and the lenders party thereto from time to time (as amended from time to time, the \u201cCredit Facility\u201d) that provides a $450 million revolving line of credit as well as a term loan, which at December 31, 2020 had a balance of $255.5 million. The Credit Facility matures in February 2023.\nOn May 7, 2020, Ebix entered into Amendment No. 10 to the Credit Facility. Amendment No. 10 provides for, among other things, increased flexibility under financial maintenance covenants, which the Company sought in part due to the unforeseen negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOn March 30, 2020, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries entered into a waiver related to the Credit Facility (the \"Waiver\"). The Waiver provided that so long as the Company\u2019s leverage ratio is below 5.0 to 1.0 for the Company\u2019s fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2020 pursuant to the terms of its compliance certificate required by the Credit Facility, the existing leverage ratio requirement of 3.50 to 1.0 was waived.\nOn September 27, 2019, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries entered into Amendment No. 9 to the Credit Facility, which amended the definition of \u201cConsolidated EBITDA\" and \u201cIndebtedness\u201d, and modified the maximum consolidated debt leverage ratios allowed.\nAt December 31, 2020, the outstanding balance on the revolving line of credit under the Credit Facility was $439.4 million and the facility carried an interest rate of 3.50%. The outstanding balance is included in the long-term liabilities section of the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. During 2020, The company drew $1.4 million on its revolving line of credit. During 2020, the average and maximum outstanding balances on the revolving line of credit were $438.9 million and $439.4 million, respectively, and the weighted average interest rate was 4.04%.\nAt December 31, 2020, the outstanding balance on the term loan was $255.5 million, of which $22.6 million is due within the next twelve months. $20.7 million of scheduled amortization payments were made on the term loan during 2020. This term loan also carried an interest rate of 3.50% at December 31, 2020. The current and long-term portions of the term loan are included in the respective current and long-term liabilities sections of the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, the amounts of which were $22.6 million and $232.9 million, respectively, at December 31, 2020. During 2020, the weighted average interest rate on the term loan was 4.04%\nContractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments\nThe following table summarizes our known contractual debt and lease obligations as of December 31, 2020. The table excludes commitments that are contingent based on events or factors uncertain at this time.\nPayment Due by Period\nTotal Less Than\n1 Year 1 - 3 Years 3 - 5 Years More than\n5 years\n(In thousands)\nRevolving line of credit $ 439,402 $ - $ 439,402 $ - $ -\nShort and long-term debt 258,127 25,260 232,867 - -\nOperating leases 14,248 4,669 6,455 1,605 1,519\nCapital leases 526 190 259 77 -\nNon-Cancellable operating leases 56,279 20,251 36,028 - -\nTotal $ 768,582 $ 50,370 $ 715,011 $ 1,682 $ 1,519\nOff Balance Sheet Transactions\nWe do not engage in off-balance sheet financing activities.\nInflation\nWe do not believe that the rate of inflation has had a material effect on our operating results. However, inflation could adversely affect our future operating results.",
    "item_7A": "Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nThe Company is subject to certain market risks, including foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. The Company\u2019s exposure to foreign currency exchange rates risk is related to our foreign-based operations where transactions are denominated in foreign currencies and are subject to market risk with respect to fluctuations in the relative value of those currencies. A significant portion of the Company\u2019s operations are based in the U.S., and the functional currencies in our Singapore and Dubai product development centers is the U.S. dollar. However, the Company has operations in Australia, India, New Zealand, Great Britain, Canada, Brazil, Philippines, and Indonesia where we conduct transactions in the local currencies of each of these locations. There can be no assurance that fluctuations in the value of those foreign currencies will not have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, operating results, revenues or financial condition. During the years of 2020 and 2019 the net change in the cumulative foreign currency translation account, which is a component of stockholders\u2019 equity, was unrealized losses of $23.1 million and $15.0 million, respectively. The Company considered the historical trends in currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that adverse changes in our respective foreign currency exchange rates of 20% could possibly be experienced in the near term future. Such an adverse change in currency exchange rates would have resulted in a reduction to pre-tax income of approximately $11.7 million and $14.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nThe Company\u2019s exposure to interest rate risk relates to its interest expense on outstanding debt obligations and to its interest income on existing cash balances. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had $697.5 million of outstanding debt obligations, excluding amounts related to deferred financing costs, which consisted of a $255.5 million term loan, a $439.4 million balance on our revolving line of credit under the Credit Facility, a $1.8 million note due to IHC by the EbixHealth JV, and $894 thousand of remaining debt pertaining to the Weizmann acquisition. As of December 31, 2020, the Company\u2019s term loan and outstanding balance on the revolving line of credit under the Credit Facility accrued interest at a rate per annum equal to 3.50%, calculated as LIBOR plus 3.00% with a 0.50% LIBOR floor rate. The Company is exposed to market risk in relation to this secured revolving line of credit and secured term loan in regards to the potential increase to interest expense arising from adverse changes in the LIBOR interest rates. This interest rate risk is estimated as the potential decrease in earnings resulting from a hypothetical 30% increase in the LIBOR rate. Such an adverse change in the LIBOR rate would have resulted in a reduction to pre-tax income of approximately $1.8 million and $5.7 million for the years ending December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The Company\u2019s average cash balances and short term investments during 2020 were $119.8 million and its existing cash balances and short term investments as of December 31, 2020 was $105.0 million and $25.0 million, respectively. The Company is exposed to market risk in relation to these cash balances in regards to the potential loss of interest income arising from adverse changes in interest rates. This interest rate risk is estimated as the potential decrease in earnings resulting from a hypothetical 20% decrease in interest rates earned on deposited funds. Such an adverse change in these interest rates would have resulted in a reduction to pre-tax income of approximately $261 thousand and $359 thousand for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nRECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nSee Part II, Item 8, \"Note 1 Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" for detailed description of Recent Accounting Pronouncements.\nAPPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP, as promulgated in the U.S., requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We believe the most complex and sensitive judgments, because of their significance to the consolidated financial statements, result primarily from the need to make estimates and assumptions about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. The following accounting policies involve the use of \u201ccritical accounting estimates\u201d because they are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by management about matters that are uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made. In addition, while we have used our best estimates based on facts and circumstances available to us at the time, different estimates reasonably could have been used in the current period, or changes in the accounting estimates that we used are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, which may have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations. For additional information about these policies, see Note 1 \"Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K. Although we believe that our estimates, assumptions and judgments are reasonable, they are limited based upon information presently available. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions, judgments or conditions.\nCOVID-19 has created and may continue to create significant uncertainty in global financial markets, which may reduce demand for our services, impact the productivity of our workforce, reduce our access to capital, and harm our business and results of operations. As of the date of our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, we are not aware of any specific event or circumstance that would require us to update our estimates or judgments, or to revise the carrying value of our assets or liabilities. However, these estimates may change as new events occur and additional information is obtained, which may result in changes being recognized in our consolidated financial statements in future periods. While we considered the effects of COVID-19 in our estimates and assumptions, due to the current level of uncertainty over the economic and operational impacts of COVID-19 on our business, there may be other judgments and assumptions that were not currently considered. Such judgments and assumptions could result in a meaningful impact to our financial statements in future periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates and any such differences may have a material impact on our financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition and Contract Liabilities-The Company derives its revenues primarily from software subscription and transaction fees, software license fees, financial transaction fees, risk compliance solution services fees, and professional service fees, including associated fees for consulting, implementation, training, and project management provided to customers with installed systems and applications. Sales and value-added taxes are not included in revenues, but rather are recorded as a liability until the taxes assessed are remitted to the respective taxing authorities.\nThe Company determines revenue recognition by applying the following steps:\n\u2022identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer;\n\u2022identification of the performance obligations in the contract;\n\u2022determination of the transaction price;\n\u2022allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and\n\u2022recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation.\nThe Company analyzes its different services individually to determine the appropriate basis for revenue recognition, as further described below. Additionally, certain services exist in multiple channels. As Ebix derives revenues from three product/service channels-EbixCash Exchanges, Insurance Exchanges, and Risk Compliance Solutions-for policy disclosure purposes, contracts are discussed in conjunction with the channel to which they are most significant.\nThe Company assesses the terms of customer contracts including termination rights, penalties (implied or explicit), and renewal rights.\nEbixCash Exchanges (\"EbixCash\")\nEbixCash revenues are primarily derived from consideration paid by customers for prepaid gift cards, financial transaction (foreign exchange, remittance, other payment solutions) and travel transaction services. The significant majority of EbixCash revenue is for a single performance obligation and is recognized at a point in time. These revenues vary by transaction based upon channel, send and receive locations, the principal amount sent, whether the money transfer involves different send and receive currencies, and speed of service, as applicable.\nEbixCash also offers several other services, including payment services and ticketing and travel services, for which revenue is impacted by varying factors. EbixCash acts as the principal in most transactions and reports revenue on a gross basis, as EbixCash controls the service at all times prior to transfer to the customer, is primarily responsible for fulfilling the customer contracts, has the risk of loss, and has the ability to establish transaction prices.\nThe main services from which EbixCash derives revenue are as follow:\nGift Cards\nEbixCash issues general purpose gift cards to corporate customers and consumers that can be later redeemed at various merchants. The gift cards are co-branded between EbixCash and its card-issuing banking partner(s) and are affiliated with major payment associations such as VISA, Mastercard, and Rupay. The gift cards are branded EbixCash cards, but are affiliated with major payment associations such as VISA, Mastercard, and Rupay. The gift cards are sold to a diversified set of corporate customers from various industries. The gift cards are used by corporate customers to disburse incentives to the end users, which are primarily their employees, agents and business associates. The gift cards sold by EbixCash are not reloadable, cannot be used at ATMs or for any other cash-out or funds transfer transactions, and are subject to maximum limits per card (currently INR10,000 or approximately $140). Gift cards issued by EbixCash are valid for a period of 15 months from the date of issuance for virtual cards and three years for physical cards. EbixCash has entered into arrangements with banks and financial institutions to settle payments to merchants based on utilization of the gift cards.\nThe Company has end-to-end responsibilities related to the gift cards sold, from the activation and ongoing utilization of the gift cards to customer service responsibilities to risk of loss due to fraud on the gift cards sold. EbixCash acts a principal in the sale of gift cards and, thus, gift card revenue is recognized on a gross basis (full purchase value at the time of sale) with the corresponding cost of the gift cards recorded as cost of services provided. Unredeemed gift cards at December 31, 2020 are not significant to the financial results of the Company and are recorded as deferred revenues in the financial results.\nEbixCash Travel Exchanges\nEbixCash Travel revenues are primarily derived from commissions and transaction fees received from various travel providers and international exchanges involved in the sale of travel to the consumer. EbixCash Travel revenue is for a single performance obligation and is recognized at a point in time. Travel revenues include reservation commissions, segment fees from global travel exchange providers, and transaction net revenues (i.e., the amount charged to travelers less the amount owed to travel service providers) in connection with our reservation services; ancillary fees, including travel insurance-related revenues and certain reservation booking fees; and credit card processing rebates and customer processing fees. EbixCash Travel services include the sale of hotel rooms, airline tickets, bus tickets and train tickets. EbixCash\u2019s Travel revenue is also derived from ticket sales, wherein the commissions payable to EbixCash Travel, along with any transaction fees paid by travel providers and travel exchanges, is recognized as revenue after completion of the service. The transaction price on such services is agreed upon at the time of the purchase.\nEbixCash Travel revenue for the corporate meetings, incentives, conferences, and exhibitions (\"MICE\") packages is recognized at full purchase value at the completion of the obligation with the corresponding costs recorded as cost of services provided. For MICE revenues, EbixCash Travel acts as the principal in transactions and, accordingly, reports revenue on a gross basis. EbixCash Travel controls the service at all times prior to transfer to the customer, is responsible for fulfilling the customer contracts, has the risk of loss, and has the ability to establish transaction prices.\nEbixCash Money Transfer\nFor the EbixCash money transfer business, EbixCash has one performance obligation whereupon the customer engages EbixCash to perform one integrated service. This typically occurs instantaneously when the beneficiary entitled to receive the money transferred by the sender visits the EbixCash outlet and collects the money. Accordingly, EbixCash recognizes revenue upon completion of the following: (i) the customer\u2019s acknowledgment of EbixCash\u2019s terms and conditions and the receipt of payment information, (ii) the money transfer has been processed, (iii) the customer has received a unique transaction identification number, and (iv) funds are available to be picked up by the beneficiary. The transaction price is comprised of a transaction fee and the difference between the exchange rate set by EbixCash to the customer and the rate available in the wholesale foreign exchange market, as applicable, both of which are readily determinable at the time the transaction is initiated\nForeign Exchange and Outward Remittance Services\nFor EbixCash\u2019s foreign exchange and payment services, customers agree to terms and conditions for all transactions, either at the time of initiating a transaction or signing a contract with EbixCash to provide payment services on the customer\u2019s behalf. In the majority of EbixCash\u2019s foreign exchange and payment services, EbixCash makes payments to the recipient to satisfy its performance obligation to the customer and, therefore, EbixCash recognizes revenue on foreign exchange and payment when this performance obligation has been fulfilled.\nConsumer Payment Services\nEbixCash offers several different bill payment services that vary by considerations such as: (i) who pays the fee to EbixCash (consumer or biller); (ii) whether the service is offered to all consumers; (iii) whether the service is restricted to existing biller relationships of EbixCash; and (iv) whether the service utilizes a physical agent network offered for consumers\u2019 convenience, among other factors. The determination of which party is EbixCash\u2019s customer for revenue recognition purposes is based on these considerations for each of EbixCash\u2019s bill payment services. For all transactions, EbixCash\u2019s customers agree to EbixCash\u2019s terms and conditions, either at the time of initiating a transaction (where the consumer is determined to be the customer for revenue recognition purposes) or upon signing a contract with EbixCash to provide services on the biller\u2019s behalf (where the biller is determined to be the customer for revenue recognition purposes). As with consumer money transfers, customers engage EbixCash to perform one integrated service, collect money from the consumer and process the bill payment transaction, thereby providing the billers real-time or near real-time information regarding their customers\u2019 payments and, thus, simplifying the billers\u2019 collection efforts. EbixCash\u2019s revenues from bill payment services are generated from contracts to process transactions at any time during the duration of the contract. The transaction price on bill payment services is contractual and determinable. Certain biller agreements may include per-transaction or fixed periodic rebates, which EbixCash records as a reduction to revenue.\nEbixCash Technology Services\nEbixCash also offers on-demand technology to various providers in the area of lending, wealth and asset management, and travel across the world.\nInsurance Exchanges\nInsurance Exchanges revenues are primarily derived from consideration paid by customers related to our SaaS platforms, related services and the licensing of software. A typical contract for our SaaS platform will also include services for setup, customization, transaction processing, maintenance, and/or hosting. Determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately may require significant judgement. Set-up and customization services, related to our SaaS platforms, are not considered to be distinct from the usage fees associated with the SaaS platform and, accordingly, are accounted for as a single performance obligation. These services along with the usage or transaction fees are recognized over the contract duration which considers the significance of the upfront fees in the context of the contract and which may, therefore, exceed the initial contracted term.\nContracts generally do not contain a right of return or refund provisions. Our contracts often do contain overage fees, contingent fees, or service level penalties which are accounted for as variable consideration. Revenue accounted for as variable\nconsideration is immaterial and is recognized using the \u201cright to invoice\u201d practical expedient when the invoiced amount equals the value provided to the customer.\nSoftware-as-a-Service\nThe Company allocates the transaction price to each distinct performance obligation using the relative stand-alone selling price. Determining the stand-alone selling price may require significant judgement. The stand-alone selling price is the price at which the Company has sold or would sell a promised good or service separately to a customer. The Company determines the stand-alone selling price based on observable price of products or services sold separately in comparable circumstances when such observable prices are available. When standalone selling price is not directly observable, the Company estimates the stand-alone selling price using the market assessment approach by considering historical pricing and other market factors.\nSoftware Licenses\nSoftware license revenues attributable to a software license that is a separate performance obligation are recognized at the point in time that the customer obtains control of the license.\nSubscription Services\nSubscription services revenues are associated with performance obligations that are satisfied over specific time periods and primarily consist of post-contract support services. Revenue is generally recognized ratably over the contract term. Our subscription contracts are generally for an initial three-year period with subsequent one-year automatic renewals.\nTransaction Fees\nTransaction revenue is comprised of fees applied to the volume of transactions that are processed through our SaaS platforms. These are typically based on a per-transaction rate and are invoiced for the same period in which the transactions were processed and as the performance obligation is satisfied. The amount invoiced generally equals the value provided to the customer, and revenue is typically recognized when invoiced using the as-invoiced practical expedient.\nProfessional Services\nProfessional service revenue primarily consists of fees for setup, customization, training, or consulting. Professional service fees are generally on a time and materials basis or a fixed fee. Revenues for time and materials are recognized as such services are rendered while fixed fee revenues are recognized based on the input method driven by the expected hours to complete the project measured against the actual hours completed to date. Professional services, particularly related to SaaS platforms, may have significant dependencies on the related licensed software and may not be considered a distinct performance obligation.\nRisk Compliance Services (\"RCS\")\nRCS revenues consist of two revenue streams - Certificates of Insurance (\"COI\") and consulting services. COI revenues are derived from consideration paid by customers for the creation and tracking of certificates of insurance. These are transactional-based revenues. Consulting services revenues are driven by distinct consulting service engagements rendered to customers for which revenues are recognized using the output method on a time and material basis as the services are performed.\nCOI Creation and Tracking\nThe Company provides services to issue and track certificates of insurance in the U.S. and Australian markets. Revenue is derived from transaction fees for each certificate issued or tracked. The Company recognizes revenue at the issuance of each certificate or over the period the certificate is being tracked.\nConsulting Services\nThe Company provides consulting services to clients around the world for project management and development. Consulting services fees are generally on a time and materials basis or a fixed fee. Revenues for time and materials are\nrecognized using an output method as the services are rendered while fixed fee revenues are recognized based on the input method driven by the expected hours to complete the project measured against the actual hours completed to date.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts Receivable\nManagement specifically analyzes the aging of accounts receivable and historical bad debts, write-offs, customer concentrations, customer credit-worthiness, current economic trends, and changes in our customer payment patterns when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable.\nValuation of Goodwill\nGoodwill represents the cost in excess of the fair value of the identifiable net assets from the businesses that we acquire. In accordance with the relevant FASB accounting guidance, goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis or on an interim basis if an event occurred or circumstances change that would indicate that fair value of a reporting unit decreased below its carrying value. Potential impairment indicators include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, customer retention and the sale or disposition of a significant portion of the business. The Company first assesses certain qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances would indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting unit was less than its carrying amount.\nThe aforementioned quantitative testing process involves comparing the reporting unit carrying values to their respective fair values. We determine fair value of our reporting unit by applying the discounted cash flow method using the present value of future estimated net cash flows, as well as applying the market capitalization method. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, then no further testing is required. However, if a reporting unit\u2019s fair value were to be less than its carrying value, we would then determine the amount of the impairment charge, if any, which would be the amount that the carrying value of the reporting unit\u2019s goodwill exceeded its implied value. We perform our annual goodwill impairment evaluation and testing as of October 1st of each year or when events or circumstances dictate more frequently.\nThe Company has considered the guidance within ASC 350 \u201cGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\u201d and ASC 280 \u201cSegment Reporting\u201d in concluding that Ebix effectively operates as one reporting unit. There have been no goodwill impairments at the reporting unit level during the periods presented herein.\nProjections of cash flows are based on our views of revenue growth rates, operating costs, anticipated future economic conditions, the appropriate discount rates relative to risk, and estimates of residual values and terminal values. We believe that our estimates are consistent with assumptions that marketplace participants would use in their estimates of fair value. The use of different estimates or assumptions for our projected discounted cash flows (e.g., revenue growth rates, future economic conditions, discount rates, and estimates of terminal values) when determining the fair value of our reporting unit could result in different values and may result in a goodwill impairment charge.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes in accordance with FASB accounting guidance on the accounting and disclosure of income taxes, which involves estimating the Company\u2019s current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We then assess the likelihood that our net deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled, and, to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, we establish a valuation allowance.\nOn December 22, 2017, the TCJA was enacted, substantially changing the U.S. tax system and affecting the Company in a number of ways. Notably, the TCJA: establishes a flat corporate income tax rate of 21.0% on U.S. earnings; imposes a one-time tax on unremitted cumulative non-U.S. earnings of foreign subsidiaries (\u201cTransition Tax\u201d);imposes a new minimum tax on certain non-U.S. earnings, irrespective of the territorial system of taxation, and generally allows for the repatriation of future earnings of foreign subsidiaries without incurring additional U.S. taxes by transitioning to a territorial system of taxation; subjects certain payments made by a U.S. company to a related foreign company to certain minimum taxes (Base Erosion Anti-Abuse Tax); eliminates certain prior tax incentives for manufacturing in the United States and creates an incentive for U.S. companies to sell, lease or license goods and services abroad by allowing for a reduction in taxes owed on earnings related to such sales; allows the cost of investments in certain depreciable assets acquired and placed in service after September 27, 2017 to be immediately expensed; and reduces deductions with respect to certain compensation paid to specified executive officers.\nIn March 2018, the FASB Issued ASU No. 2018-05, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Amendments to SEC Paragraphs Pursuant to SEC SAB No. 118. ASU 2018-05 was issued to incorporate into Topic 740 recent SEC guidance related to the income tax accounting implications of the TCJA. Due to the complexities involved in accounting for the enactment of the TCJA, the SEC Staff had issued SAB No. 118 which allowed the Company to record provisional amounts in earnings for the year ended December 31, 2017. ASU 2018-05 became effective immediately and permitted companies to use provisional amounts for certain income tax effects of the TCJA during a one-year measurement period. The Transition Tax is based on the Company\u2019s total post-1986 earnings and profits that were previously deferred from U.S. income taxes. The Company completed its tax accounting for the TCJA during Q4 2018 and recorded an adjustment of $24.53 million related to the transition tax after taking into consideration carried forward NOLs and other tax attributes available for set-off.\nThe Company does not recognize a deferred U.S. tax liability and associated income tax expense for the undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries, which are considered indefinitely invested because those foreign earnings will remain permanently reinvested in those subsidiaries to fund ongoing operations and growth.\nThe Company follows the provisions of FASB accounting guidance on accounting for uncertain income tax positions. This guidance clarified the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes by prescribing the minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements. The guidance utilizes a two-step approach for evaluating tax positions. Recognition (\u201cStep 1\u201d) occurs when an enterprise concludes that a tax position, based solely on its technical merits is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination. Measurement (\u201cStep 2\u201d) is only addressed if Step 1 has been satisfied. Under Step 2, the tax benefit is measured at the largest amount of benefit, determined on a cumulative probability basis that is more likely than not to be realized upon final settlement. As used in this context, the term \u201cmore likely than not\u201d is interpreted to mean that the likelihood of occurrence is greater than 50%.\nForeign Currency Translation\nThe functional currency for the Company's main foreign subsidiaries in Dubai and Singapore is the U.S. dollar, because the intellectual property research and development activities provided by its Singapore and Dubai subsidiaries support of Ebix's operating divisions across the world, which are primarily transacted in U.S. dollars.\nThe functional currency of the Company's other foreign subsidiaries is the local currency of the country in which the subsidiary operates. The assets and liabilities of these foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at the rates of exchange at the balance sheet dates. Income and expense accounts are translated at the average exchange rates in effect during the period. Gains and losses resulting from translation adjustments are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nDescription of Business- Ebix, Inc. and its subsidiaries, (\u201cEbix\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d, \"we\", \"us\", and \"our\") is a leading international supplier of on-demand infrastructure exchanges to the insurance, financial, travel, payment remittances and healthcare industries. In the insurance industry, the Company\u2019s main focus is to develop and deploy a wide variety of insurance and reinsurance exchanges on an on-demand basis using SaaS enterprise solutions in the area of customer relationship management (\"CRM\"), front-end and back-end systems, and outsourced administrative and risk compliance. The Company's products feature fully customizable and scalable software solutions designed to streamline the way insurance and financial industry professionals manage distribution, marketing, sales, customer service, and accounting activities. With a \"Phygital\u201d strategy that combines physical distribution outlets in India and many Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries to a Omni-channel online digital platform, the Company\u2019s EbixCash Financial exchange portfolio of software and services encompasses domestic and international money remittance, foreign exchange (\"Forex\"), travel, pre-paid gift cards, utility payments, lending, and wealth management in India and other Southeast Asian markets. The Company has its headquarters in Johns Creek, Georgia and also conducts operating activities in Australia, Canada, India, New Zealand, Singapore, the U.K., Brazil, Philippines, Indonesia, Thailand and United Arab Emirates. International revenue accounted for 73.4%, 68.6%, and 60.4% of the Company\u2019s total revenue in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.\nEbixCash Exchanges (\"EbixCash\")\nEbixCash revenues are primarily derived from consideration paid by customers for financial transaction services, including services like transferring or exchanging money. The significant majority of EbixCash revenue is for a single performance obligation and is recognized at a point in time. These revenues vary by transaction based upon channel, send and receive locations, the principal amount sent, whether the money transfer involves different send and receive currencies, and speed of service, as applicable.\nEbixCash also offers several other services, including payment services and ticketing and travel services for which revenue is impacted by varying factors. EbixCash acts as the principal in most transactions and reports revenue on a gross basis, as EbixCash controls the service at all times prior to transfer to the customer, is primarily responsible for fulfilling the customer contracts, has the risk of loss, and has the ability to establish transaction prices.\nThe main services from which EbixCash derives revenue are as follow:\nGift Cards\nEbixCash sells general purpose prepaid gift cards to corporate customers and consumers that can be later redeemed at various merchants. The gift cards are co-branded between EbixCash and its card-issuing banking partner(s) and are affiliated with major payment associations such as VISA, Mastercard, and Rupay. The gift cards are sold to a diversified set of corporate customers from various industries. The gift cards are used by corporate customers to disburse incentives to the end users, which are primarily their employees, agents and business associates. The gift cards sold by EbixCash are not reloadable, cannot be used at ATMs or for any other cash-out or funds transfer transactions, and are subject to maximum limits per card (currently INR10,000 or approximately $140). Gift cards issued by EbixCash are valid for a period of 15 months from the date of issuance for virtual cards and three years for physical cards. EbixCash has entered into arrangements with banks and financial institutions to settle payments to merchants based on utilization of the gift cards.\nThe Company has end-to-end responsibilities related to the gift cards sold, from the activation and ongoing utilization of the gift cards to customer service responsibilities to risk of loss due to fraud on the gift cards sold. EbixCash acts a principal in the sale of gift cards and, thus, gift card revenue is recognized on a gross basis (full purchase value at the time of sale) with the corresponding cost of the gift cards recorded as cost of services provided. Unredeemed gift cards at December 31, 2020 are not significant to the financial results of the Company and are recorded as deferred revenues in the financial results.\nEbixCash Travel Exchanges\nEbixCash Travel revenues are primarily derived from commissions and transaction fees received from various travel providers and international exchanges involved in the sale of travel to the consumer. EbixCash Travel revenue is for a single performance obligation and is recognized at a point in time. Travel revenues include reservation commissions, segment fees from global travel exchange providers, and transaction net revenues (i.e., the amount charged to travelers less the amount owed to travel service providers) in connection with our reservation services; ancillary fees, including travel insurance-related revenues and certain reservation booking fees; and credit card processing rebates and customer processing fees. EbixCash Travel services include the sale of hotel rooms, airline tickets, bus tickets and train tickets. EbixCash\u2019s Travel revenue is also derived from ticket sales, wherein the commissions payable to EbixCash Travel, along with any transaction fees paid by travel providers and travel exchanges, is recognized as revenue after completion of the service. The transaction price on such services is agreed upon at the time of the purchase.\nEbixCash Travel revenue for the corporate MICE (Meetings, Incentives, Conferences, and Exhibitions) packages is recognized at full purchase value at the completion of the obligation with the corresponding costs recorded under cost of services provided. For MICE revenues, EbixCash Travel acts as the principal in transactions and, accordingly, reports revenue on a gross basis. EbixCash Travel controls the service at all times prior to transfer to the customer, is responsible for fulfilling the customer contracts, has the risk of loss, and has the ability to establish transaction prices.\nEbixCash Money Transfer\nFor the EbixCash money transfer business, EbixCash has one performance obligation whereupon the customer engages EbixCash to perform one integrated service. This typically occurs instantaneously when the beneficiary entitled to receive the money transferred by the sender visits the EbixCash outlet and collects the money. Accordingly, EbixCash recognizes revenue upon completion of the following: 1) the customer\u2019s acknowledgment of EbixCash\u2019s terms and conditions and the receipt of payment information, 2) the money transfer has been processed, 3) the customer has received a unique transaction identification number, and 4) funds are available to be picked up by the beneficiary. The transaction price is comprised of a transaction fee and the difference between the exchange rate set by EbixCash to the customer and the rate available in the wholesale foreign exchange market, as applicable, both of which are readily determinable at the time the transaction is initiated\nForeign Exchange and Outward Remittance Services\nFor EbixCash\u2019s foreign exchange and payment services, customers agree to terms and conditions for all transactions, either at the time of initiating a transaction or signing a contract with EbixCash to provide payment services on the customer\u2019s behalf. In the majority of EbixCash\u2019s foreign exchange and payment services, EbixCash makes payments to the recipient to satisfy its performance obligation to the customer and, therefore, EbixCash recognizes revenue on foreign exchange and payment when this performance obligation has been fulfilled.\nConsumer Payment Services\nEbixCash offers several different bill payment services that vary by considerations such, as: 1) who pays the fee to EbixCash (consumer or biller); 2) whether the service is offered to all potential consumers; 3) whether the service is restricted to existing biller relationships of EbixCash; and 4) whether the service utilizes a physical agent network offered for consumers\u2019 convenience, among other factors. The determination of which party is EbixCash\u2019s customer for revenue recognition purposes is based on these considerations for each of EbixCash\u2019s bill payment services. For all transactions, EbixCash\u2019s customers agree to EbixCash\u2019s terms and conditions, either at the time of initiating a transaction (where the consumer is determined to be the customer for revenue recognition purposes) or upon signing a contract with EbixCash to provide services on the biller\u2019s behalf (where the biller is determined to be the customer for revenue recognition purposes). As with consumer money transfers, customers engage EbixCash to perform one integrated service, collect money from the consumer and process the bill payment transaction, thereby providing the billers real-time or near real-time information regarding their customers\u2019 payments and, thus, simplifying the billers\u2019 collection efforts. EbixCash\u2019s revenues from bill payment services are generated from contracts to process transactions at any time during the duration of the contract. The transaction price on bill payment services is contractual and determinable. Certain biller agreements may include per-transaction or fixed periodic rebates, which EbixCash records as a reduction to revenue.\nEbixCash Technology Services\nEbixCash also offers on-demand technology to various providers in the area of lending, wealth and asset management, and travel across the world.\nInsurance Exchanges\nInsurance Exchanges revenues are primarily derived from consideration paid by customers related to our SaaS platforms, related services and the licensing of software. A typical contract for our SaaS platform will also include services for setup, customization, transaction processing, maintenance, and/or hosting. Determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately may require significant judgement. Set-up and customization services related to our SaaS platforms are not considered to be distinct from the usage fees associated with the SaaS platform and, accordingly, are accounted for as a single performance obligation. These services, along with the usage or transaction fees, are recognized over the contract duration, which considers the significance of the upfront fees in the context of the contract and which may, therefore, exceed the initial contracted term. A customer's transaction volume tends to remain fairly consistent during the contract period without significant fluctuations. The invoiced amount is a reasonable approximation of the revenue that would be allocated to the related period under the variable consideration guidelines in ASC 606-10-32-40. To the extent that a SaaS contract includes subscription services or professional services, apart from the upfront customization, these are considered separate performance obligations. The Company also has separate software licensing (on premise/ perpetual), unrelated to the SaaS platforms, which is recognized at a point in time when the license is transferred to the customer.\nContracts generally do not contain a right of return or refund provisions. Our contracts often do contain overage fees, contingent fees, or service level penalties which are accounted for as variable consideration. Revenue accounted for as variable consideration is immaterial and is recognized using the \u201cright to invoice\u201d practical expedient when the invoiced amount equals the value provided to the customer.\nSoftware-as-a-Service\nThe Company allocates the transaction price to each distinct performance obligation using the relative stand-alone selling price. Determining the stand-alone selling price may require significant judgement. The stand-alone selling price is the price at which an entity has sold or would sell a promised good or service separately to a customer. The Company determines the stand-alone selling price based on observable price of products or services sold separately in comparable circumstances, when such observable prices are available. When standalone selling price is not directly observable, the Company estimates the stand-alone selling price using the market assessment approach by considering historical pricing and other market factors.\nSoftware Licenses\nSoftware license revenues attributable to a software license that is a separate performance obligation are recognized at the point in time that the customer obtains control of the license.\nSubscription Services\nSubscription services revenues are associated with performance obligations that are satisfied over specific time periods and primarily consist of post-contract support services. Revenue is generally recognized ratably over the contract term. Our subscription contracts are generally for an initial three-year period with subsequent one-year automatic renewals.\nTransaction Fees\nTransaction revenue is comprised of fees applied to the volume of transactions that are processed through our SaaS platforms. These are typically based on a per-transaction rate and are invoiced for the same period in which the transactions were processed and as the performance obligation is satisfied. The amount invoiced generally equals the value provided to the customer, and revenue is typically recognized when invoiced using the as-invoiced practical expedient.\nProfessional Services\nProfessional service revenue primarily consists of fees for setup, customization, training, or consulting services. Professional service fees are generally on a time and materials basis or a fixed fee basis. Revenues for time and materials are recognized as such services are rendered, while fixed fee revenues are recognized based on the input method that is driven by the expected hours to complete the project measured against the actual hours completed to date. Professional services,\nparticularly related to SaaS platforms, may have significant dependencies on the related licensed software and may not be considered a distinct performance obligation.\nRisk Compliance Services (\"RCS\")\nRCS revenues consist of two revenue streams - Certificates of Insurance (\"COI\") and Consulting Services. COI revenues are derived from consideration paid by customers for the creation and tracking of certificates of insurance. These are transactional-based revenues. Consulting Services revenues are driven by distinct consulting service engagements rendered to customers for which revenues are recognized using the output method on a time and material basis as the services are performed.\nCOI Creation and Tracking\nThe Company provides services to issue and track certificates of insurance in the U.S. and Australian markets. Revenue is derived from transaction fees for each certificate issued or tracked. The Company recognizes revenue at the issuance of each certificate or over the period the certificate is being tracked.\nConsulting Services\nThe Company provides consulting services to clients around the world for project management and development. Consulting services fees are generally on a time and materials basis or a fixed fee basis. Revenues for time and materials are recognized using an output method as the services are rendered, while fixed fee revenues are recognized based on the input method driven by the expected hours to complete the project measured against the actual hours completed to date.\nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation- The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Ebix and its wholly and majority-owned subsidiaries. Non-controlling interests in net income or losses, and net equity are reported in amounts that reflect the non-controlling party(s) percentage ownership in the respect subsidiaries. The effect of intercompany balances and transactions has been eliminated.\nUse of Estimates-The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"GAAP\") requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenue and expenses during those reporting periods. Management has made material estimates primarily with respect to revenue recognition and contract liabilities, accounts receivable, acquired intangible assets, annual impairment reviews of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, investments, contingent earnout liabilities in connection with business acquisitions, and the provision for income taxes. Actual results may be different from those estimates.\nReclassification-Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to be consistent with current year presentation within our financial statement.\nSegment Reporting-Since the Company, from the perspective of its chief operating decision maker, allocates resources and evaluates business performance as a single entity on a worldwide basis, the Company reports as a single segment. The applicable enterprise-wide disclosures are included in Note 14.\nCash and Cash Equivalents-The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents. Such investments are stated at cost, which approximates fair value. The Company does maintain cash balances in banking institutions in excess of federally insured amounts and therefore is exposed to the related potential credit risk associated with such cash deposits.\nThe Company deposited $30.0 million with a third party bank in a trust account with commingled funds of its outside legal counsel in contemplation of a potential acquisition on December 31, 2020. The funds are included under the heading 'Cash and Cash Equivalent' in the consolidated balance sheet due to the nature of the said account, as the account had neither a restriction on the Company's ability to access the funds at its discretion nor did the account have restrictions associated with the potential acquisition that would limit the Company's control over and access to the cash. The contemplated acquisition did not occur as of December 31, 2020 or through the filing of this Form 10-K, and on February 2, 2021 the Company had the cash returned to its primary U.S. operating bank account.\nShort-term Investments-The Company\u2019s primary short-term investments consist of certificates of deposits with established commercial banking institutions in India that have readily determinable fair values. Ebix accounts for such investments that are reasonably expected to be realized in cash, sold or consumed during the year as short-term investments that are available-for-sale. The carrying amount of investments in marketable securities approximates their fair value. The carrying value of our short-term investments was $25 million and $4.4 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nRestricted Cash- The carrying value of our restricted cash was $8.5 million and $35.1 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The Company holds fixed deposits pledged with banks for issuance of bank guarantees and letters of credit related to its India operations for our working capital facilities.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash reported within the statement of financial position that sum to the total of the same such amounts shown in the statement of cash flows:\nFor the Year Ended December 31,\n2020 2019 2018\n(In thousands)\nCash and cash equivalents $ 105,035 $ 73,228 137,858\nRestricted cash 8,519 35,051 8,317\nRestricted cash included in other long-term assets 6,659 3,090 3,506\nTotal cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash shown in the statement of cash flows $ 120,213 $ 111,369 $ 149,681\nFiduciary Funds - Restricted-Due to the EbixHealth JV being a third party administrator (\u201cTPA\u201d), the Company collects premiums from insureds and, after deducting its fees, remits these premiums to insurance companies. Unremitted insurance premiums and/or claim funds established for the benefit of various carriers are held in a fiduciary capacity until disbursed by the Company. The use of premiums collected from insureds but not yet remitted to insurance companies is restricted by law in certain states. The total assets held on behalf of others, $4.1 million, are recorded as an asset and offsetting fiduciary funds - restricted liability.\nFair Value Measurements-The Company follows the relevant GAAP guidance regarding the determination and measurement of the fair value of assets/liabilities in which fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction valuation hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs when measuring fair value. The guidance describes the following three levels of inputs that may be used in the methodology to measure fair value:\n\u2022Level 1 - Unadjusted quoted prices available in active markets for identical investments to the reporting entity at the measurement date.\n\u2022Level 2 - Other than quoted prices included in Level 1 inputs, which are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.\n\u2022Level 3 - Unobservable inputs, which are used to the extent that observable inputs are not available, and used in situations where there is little or no market activity for the asset or liability and wherein the reporting entity makes estimates and assumptions related to the pricing of the asset or liability including assumptions regarding risk.\nA financial instrument\u2019s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement.\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company has the following financial instruments for which it had to consider fair values and had to make fair value assessments:\n\u2022Short-term investments (commercial bank certificates of deposits and mutual funds), for which the fair values are measured as a Level 1 instrument.\n\u2022Contingent accrued earn-out business acquisition consideration liabilities for which fair values are measured as Level 3 instruments. These contingent consideration liabilities were recorded at fair value on the acquisition date and are remeasured quarterly based on the then assessed fair value and adjusted if necessary.\nThe increases or decreases in the fair value of contingent consideration can result from changes in anticipated revenue levels and changes in assumed discount periods and rates. As the fair value measure is based on significant inputs that are not observable in the market, they are categorized as Level 3.\nOther financial instruments not measured at fair value on the Company's consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2020 and 2019 but which require disclosure of their fair values include: cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses, accrued payroll and related benefits, finance lease obligations, and the revolving line of credit and term loan debt . The Company believes that the estimated fair value of such instruments at December 31, 2020 and 2019 reasonably approximates their carrying value as reported on the consolidated balance sheets.\nAdditional information regarding the Company's assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis is presented in the following tables:\nFair Values at Reporting Date Using*\nDescriptions Balance at December 31, 2020 Quoted Prices in Active Markets for Identical Assets or Liabilities\n(Level 1) Significant Other Observable Inputs\n(Level 2) Significant Unobservable Inputs\n(Level 3)\n(In thousands)\nAssets\nCommercial bank certificates of deposits ($7.4 million is recorded in the long term asset section of the consolidated balance sheets in \"Other Assets\")\n$ 32,072 $ - $ 32,072 $ -\nMutual funds 381 381 - -\nTotal assets measured at fair value $ 32,453 $ 381 $ 32,072 $ -\nLiabilities\nContingent earn-out acquisition consideration - - - -\nTotal liabilities measured at fair value $ - $ - $ - $ -\n* During the year ended December 31, 2020 there were no transfers between fair value Levels 1, 2 or 3.\nFair Values at Reporting Date Using*\nDescriptions Balance at December 31, 2019 Quoted Prices in Active Markets for Identical Assets or Liabilities\n(Level 1) Significant Other Observable Inputs\n(Level 2) Significant Unobservable Inputs\n(Level 3)\n(In thousands)\nAssets\nCommercial bank certificates of deposits ($50 thousand is recorded in the long term asset section of the consolidated balance sheets in \"Other Assets\")\n$ 4,493 - 4,493 -\nMutual Funds 1,058 1,058 - -\nTotal assets measured at fair value $ 5,551 $ 1,058 $ 4,493 $ -\nLiabilities\nContingent earn-out acquisition consideration (a) 10,095 - - 10,095\nTotal liabilities measured at fair value $ 10,095 $ - $ - $ 10,095\n(a) The income valuation approach is applied and the valuation inputs include the contingent payment arrangement terms, projected cash flows, rate of return, and probability assessments.\n* During the year ended December 31, 2019, there were no transfers between fair value Levels 1, 2 or 3.\nFor the Company's assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3), the following table provides a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances for each category therein, and gains or losses recognized during the year:\nFair Value Measurements Using Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3)\nContingent Liability for Accrued Earn-out Acquisition Consideration Balance at December 31, 2020 Balance at December 31, 2019\n(In thousands)\nBeginning balance $ 10,095 24,976\nTotal remeasurement adjustments:\n(Gains) or losses included in earnings ** (3,105) (16,543)\nReductions recorded against goodwill - -\nForeign currency translation adjustments *** (537) (260)\nAcquisitions and settlements\nBusiness acquisitions - 1,922\nSettlements (6,453) -\nEnding balance $ - $ 10,095\nThe amount of total (gains) or losses for the year included in earnings or changes to net assets, attributable to changes in unrealized (gains) or losses relating to assets or liabilities still held at year-end. $ (3,105) $ (16,543)\n** recorded as a component of general and administrative expenses\n*** recorded as a component of other comprehensive income within stockholders' equity\nQuantitative Information about Level 3 Fair Value Measurements\nThe significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the Company's contingent consideration liabilities designated as Level 3 are as follows:\n(In thousands) Fair Value at December 31, 2020 Valuation Technique Significant Unobservable\nInput\nContingent acquisition consideration: $- Discounted cash flow Expected future annual revenue streams and probability of achievement\n(In thousands) Fair Value at December 31, 2019\nValuation Technique Significant\nUnobservable\nInput\nContingent acquisition consideration:\n(Wdev, Miles, Zillious and Essel acquisitions) $10,095 Discounted cash flow Expected future annual revenue streams and probability of achievement\nSensitivity to Changes in Significant Unobservable Inputs\nAs presented in the table above, the significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of contingent consideration related to business acquisitions are forecasts of expected future annual revenues as developed by the Company's management and the probability of achievement of those revenue forecasts. The discount rate used in these calculations is 12.6%. Significant increases (decreases) in these unobservable inputs in isolation would likely result in a significantly (lower) higher fair value measurement.\nRevenue Recognition and Contract Liabilities-The Company derives its revenues primarily from software subscription and transaction fees, software license fees, financial transaction fees, risk compliance solution services fees, and professional service fees including associated fees for consulting, implementation, training, and project management provided to customers with installed systems and applications. Sales and value-added taxes are not included in revenues, but rather are recorded as a liability until the taxes assessed are remitted to the respective taxing authorities.\nThe Company determines revenue recognition by applying the following steps:\n\u2022identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer;\n\u2022identification of the performance obligations in the contract;\n\u2022determination of the transaction price;\n\u2022allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and\n\u2022recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation.\nThe Company analyzes its different services individually to determine the appropriate basis for revenue recognition, as further described below. Additionally, certain services exist in multiple channels. As Ebix derives revenues from three product/service channels, EbixCash Exchanges, Insurance Exchanges, and Risk Compliance Solutions, for policy disclosure purposes, contracts are discussed in conjunction with the channel to which they are most significant.\nThe Company assesses the terms of customer contracts, including termination rights, penalties (implied or explicit), and renewal rights.\nContract Liabilities\nContract liabilities includes payments or billings that have been received or made prior to performance. In certain cases, cash collections pertain to maintenance and support fees, initial setup or registration fees under hosting agreements, software license fees received in advance of delivery and acceptance, and software development fees paid in advance of completion and delivery. Approximately $7.2 million and $6.4 million of contract liabilities were included in billed accounts receivable at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nDisaggregation of Revenue\nThe following tables present revenue disaggregated by primary geographical regions and product channels for the years ended December 31, 2020 , 2019 and 2018:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2019 2018\n(In thousands)\nIndia* $ 378,660 $ 300,678 $ 196,372\nUnited States $ 166,320 182,530 196,984\nAustralia $ 33,846 33,268 35,770\nLatin America $ 14,801 19,755 19,866\nEurope $ 13,145 14,695 15,387\nCanada $ 4,383 4,805 5,611\nSingapore* $ 3,969 6,549 7,674\nIndonesia* $ 3,206 9,706 7,482\nPhilippines* $ 2,140 5,991 6,483\nUnited Arab Emirates* $ 3,335 683 1,042\nNew Zealand $ 1,804 1,955 2,015\nMauritius* $ - - 3,140\n$ 625,609 $ 580,615 $ 497,826\n*Primarily India led businesses for which total revenue was $388.3 million, $320.0 million and $217.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.\nThe Company\u2019s revenues are derived from three product/service groups. Presented in the table below is the breakout of our revenue streams for each of those product/service groups for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018.\nFor the Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n(In thousands) 2020 2019 2018\nEbixCash Exchanges $ 388,293 $ 319,953 $ 217,457\nInsurance Exchanges 178,111 190,067 192,604\nRisk Compliance Solutions 59,205 70,595 87,765\nTotals $ 625,609 $ 580,615 $ 497,826\nCosts to Obtain and Fulfill a Contract\nThe Company\u2019s capitalized costs are primarily derived from the fulfillment of SaaS related setup and customizations from which the customer receives benefit through continued access to and use of the SaaS product platforms. In accordance with the guidance in ASC 340-40-25-5, we capitalize the costs directly related to the setup and development of these customizations, which satisfy the Company\u2019s performance obligation with respect to access to the Company\u2019s underlying product platforms. The capitalized costs primarily consist of the salaries of the developers directly involved in fulfilling the project and are solely based on the time spent on that project. The Company amortizes the capitalized costs ratably over the expected useful life of the related customizations, matching our treatment for the related revenue, and the capitalized costs are recoverable from profit margin included in the contract. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had $646 thousand of contract costs in \u201cOther current assets\u201d and $985 thousand in \u201cOther assets\u201d on the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n(In thousands) December 31, 2020 December 31, 2019\nBalance, beginning of period $ 1,897 $ 2,238\nCosts recognized from beginning balance (743) (708)\nAdditions, net of costs recognized 476 367\nBalance, end of period $ 1,630 $ 1,897\nContract Liabilities\nThe Company records contract liabilities when it receives payments or invoices in advance of the performance of services. A significant portion of this balance relates to contracts where the customer has paid in advance for the use of our SaaS platforms over a specified period of time. This portion is recognized as the related performance obligation is fulfilled (generally less than one year). Part of our performance obligation for these contracts consists of the requirement to provide our customers with continued access to, and use of, our SaaS platforms and associated customizations. Without continued access to the SaaS platform, the customizations have no separate benefit to the customer. Our customers simultaneously receive and consume the benefits as we provide access over time. The remaining portion of the contract liabilities balance consists primarily of customer-specific customizations that are not distinct from related performance obligations that transfer over time. This portion is recognized over the expected useful life of the customizations.\n(In thousands) December 31, 2020 December 31, 2019\nBalance, beginning of period $ 37,253 $ 44,660\nRevenue recognized from beginning balance (32,783) (31,507)\nAdditions from business acquisitions - 769\nAdditions, net of revenue recognized and currency translation 36,460 23,331\nBalance, end of period $ 40,930 $ 37,253\nRevenue Allocated to Remaining Performance Obligations\nThe following table presents our estimated revenue allocated to remaining performance obligations for contracted revenue that has not yet been recognized, representing our \u201ccontractually committed\u201d revenue as of December 31, 2020 that we will transfer from contract liabilities and recognize in future periods:\nEstimated Revenue (In thousands):\nFor the year ending December 31, 2021 $ 3,996\nFor the year ending December 31, 2022 2,791\nFor the year ending December 31, 2023 2,188\nFor the year ending December 31, 2024 1,123\nFor the year ending December 31, 2025 208\n$ 10,306\nOur contractually committed revenue, for purposes of the tabular presentation above, is generally limited to service customer contracts with significant programming, setup, and implementation activities related to our SaaS offerings. Our contractually committed revenue amounts generally exclude, based on the following practical expedients that we elected to apply, remaining performance obligations for: (i) contracts with an original expected duration of one year or less; and (ii) contracts for which we recognize revenue at the amount for which we have the right to invoice for services performed.\nAccounts Receivable and the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Receivable-Reported accounts receivable as of December 31, 2020 include $97.6 million of trade receivables stated at invoice billed amounts and $45.2 million of unbilled receivables (net of a $22.7 million estimated allowance for doubtful accounts receivable). Reported accounts receivable at December 31, 2019 include $118.3 million of trade receivables stated at invoice billed amounts and $35.3 million of unbilled\nreceivables (net of a $21.7 million estimated allowance for doubtful accounts receivable). The Company records a contract asset when revenue recognized on a contract exceeds the billings. The contract asset is transferred to receivables when the entitlement to payment becomes unconditional. These contract assets are primarily related to project-based revenue where we recognize revenue using the input method calculated using expected hours to complete the project measured against the actual hours completed to date. Management specifically analyzes accounts receivable and historical bad debts, write-offs, customer concentrations, customer credit-worthiness, current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts. Bad debt expense was $1.7 million, $12.3 million, and $3.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.\nCosts of Services Provided-Costs of services provided consist of data processing costs, customer support costs, including personnel costs to maintain our proprietary databases, costs to provide customer call center support, hardware and software expense associated with transaction processing systems and exchanges, telecommunication and computer network expense, and occupancy costs associated with facilities where these functions are performed. Cost of services provided also include the direct expenses associated with our services businesses, including the cost of prepaid gift cards, the cost of travel services provided and the cost of foreign exchange and remittance transactions. Depreciation expense is not included in costs of services provided.\nCapitalized Software Development Costs-In accordance with ASC 350-40 \u201cInternal-Use Software\u201d and ASC 350-985 \u201cSoftware\u201d the Company expenses costs as they are incurred until technological feasibility has been established, at and after which time those costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. Costs incurred to enhance our software products, after general market release of the services using the products, is expensed in the period they are incurred. The periodic expense for the amortization of previously capitalized software development costs is included in costs of services provided.\nGoodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets-Goodwill represents the cost in excess of the fair value of the identifiable net assets from the businesses that we acquire. In accordance with ASC 350, \u201cGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\" and ASU No. 2011-08, \u201cTesting Goodwill for Impairment\u201d, goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis or on an interim basis if an event occurred or circumstances change that would indicate that fair value of our reporting unit decreased below its carrying value. Potential impairment indicators include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, customer retention and the sale or disposition of a significant portion of the business. The Company applies the accounting guidance concerning goodwill impairment evaluation, whereby the Company first assesses certain qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances would indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit was less than its carrying amount. If after assessing the totality of events and circumstances, we were to determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then we would perform quantitative impairment testing.\nWe perform our annual goodwill impairment evaluation and testing as of October 1st of each year or, when events or circumstances dictate, more frequently. No goodwill impairments have occurred nor recognized in 2019 or 2020.\nThe Company has considered the guidance within ASC 350 \u201cGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\u201d and ASC 280 \u201cSegment Reporting\u201d in concluding that Ebix effectively operates as one operating and reportable segment and one reporting unit.\nChanges in the carrying amount of goodwill for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 are as follows:\nDecember 31, 2020 December 31, 2019\n(In thousands)\nBeginning Balance $ 952,404 $ 946,685\nAdditions for current year acquisitions 11,241 17,931\nAdjustments for final purchase accounting 725 741\nForeign currency translation adjustments (15,333) (12,953)\nEnding Balance $ 949,037 $ 952,404\nThe Company\u2019s indefinite-lived assets are primarily associated with the estimated fair value of the contractual customer relationships existing with the property and casualty insurance carriers in Australia using the Company's property and casualty (\"P&C\") data exchange. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized, but rather are tested for impairment annually and tested on an interim basis if a triggering event has occurred.\nWe perform our annual impairment testing of indefinite-lived intangible assets as of October 1st of each year. The annual impairment testing of indefinite-lived intangible assets is perform by comparing the asset's fair value to its carrying value. An impairment charge is recognized if the asset's estimated fair value is less than its carrying value.\nTo estimate the fair value, we utilize cash flow projections. Projections of cash flows are based on our views of revenue growth rates, operating costs, anticipated future economic conditions, the appropriate discount rates relative to risk, and estimates of residual values and terminal values. We believe that our estimates are consistent with assumptions that marketplace participants would use in their estimates of fair value. The use of different estimates or assumptions for our projected discounted cash flows (e.g., revenue growth rates, future economic conditions, discount rates, and estimates of terminal values) when determining the fair value of our reporting unit could result in different values and may result in a goodwill impairment charge.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, as a result of the analysis performed the Company concluded that the IHC customer relationship indefinite-lived intangible asset associated with the Company's EbixHealth JV has been impaired, the Company recorded a $6.2 million impairment charge within the asset impairment line on the consolidated statement of operations. In addition, the Company has concluded that they IHC customer relationship intangible is no longer considered indefinite-lived. The Company will amortize this intangible over the remaining estimated life of ten years. During the years ended December 2019, and 2018, we had no impairments to the recorded balances of our indefinite-lived intangible assets.\nFinite-lived Intangible Assets-Finite-lived intangible assets represent the estimated acquisition date fair value of customer relationships, developed technology, trademarks, non-compete agreements and other intangibles described below obtained in connection with the businesses we acquire. We amortize these intangible assets on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, as follows:\nLife\nCategory (years)\nCustomer relationships 7-20\nDeveloped technology 3-12\nAirport contract 9\nStore networks 5\nDealer networks 15-20\nBrand 15\nTrademarks 3-15\nNon-compete agreements 5\nDatabase 10\nIntangible assets as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, are as follows:\nDecember 31,\n2020 2019\n(In thousands)\nFinite-lived intangible assets:\nCustomer relationships $ 96,616 $ 83,012\nDeveloped technology 19,867 19,979\nDealer networks 6,653 6,726\nAirport Contract 4,523 4,635\nStore Networks 2,440 2,500\nTrademarks 2,700 2,689\nBrand 896 918\nNon-compete agreements 759 764\nBacklog 140 140\nDatabase 212 212\nTotal intangibles 134,806 121,575\nAccumulated amortization (83,926) (74,620)\nFinite-lived intangibles, net $ 50,880 $ 46,955\nIndefinite-lived intangibles:\nCustomer/territorial relationships $ 21,647 $ 42,055\nAs a part of the 2009 acquisition of E-Z Data Ebix recognized a $14.2 million indefinite-lived intangible asset associated with acquired corporate customer relationships. During the third quarter 2020, the Company identified a potential indicator of impairment and performed a quantitative analysis to test for impairment. The Company determined the fair value of the intangible assets exceeded its carrying value, however the Company determined that the intangible asset no longer had an indefinite life. The Company has reclassified the $14.2 million to finite-lived and will amortize the value of this intangible over an estimated remaining useful life of 15 years. In the third quarter of 2020 and each quarter subsequent, Ebix will recognize approximately $237 thousand of amortization related to the E-Z Data corporate customer relationships acquired.\nIncome Taxes- The Company follows the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes pursuant to the pertinent guidance issued by the FASB. Deferred income taxes are recorded to reflect the estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets, liabilities, operating losses, and tax credit carry forwards using the tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences reverse. Valuation allowances, if any, are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount management considers more likely than not to be realized. Such valuation allowances are recorded for the portion of the deferred tax assets that are not expected to be realized based on the levels of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the temporary differences will be deductible.\nThe Company applies the relevant FASB accounting guidance on accounting for uncertainty in income taxes positions. This guidance clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes by prescribing the minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements. In this regard we recognize the tax benefit from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position.\nForeign Currency Translation-The functional currency is the U.S. dollar for the Company's foreign subsidiaries in Dubai and Singapore, and its product development and information technology enabled services activities for the insurance industry provided by its India subsidiary. For Dubai and Singapore, because both the intellectual property research and development activities provided by its Dubai and Singapore subsidiaries, and the product development and information\ntechnology enabled services activities for the insurance industry provided by its India subsidiary are in support of the Company's operating divisions across the world, which are primarily transacted in U.S. dollars.\nThe functional currency of the Company's other foreign subsidiaries is the local currency of the country in which the subsidiary operates. The assets and liabilities of these foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at the rates of exchange at the balance sheet dates. Income and expense accounts are translated at the average exchange rates in effect during the period. Gains and losses resulting from translation adjustments are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, and are included in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. Foreign exchange transaction gains and losses that are derived from transactions denominated in a currency other than the subsidiary's functional currency are included in the determination of net income.\nAdvertising-With the exception of certain direct-response costs in connection with our business services of providing medical continuing education to physicians, dentists and healthcare professionals, advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising costs amounted to $4.8 million, $9.7 million, and 7.5 million in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively, and are included in sales and marketing expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income.\nEffective January 1, 2018 Subtopic 340-40 replaced that guidance to require the costs of direct-response advertising to be expensed as they are incurred or the first time the advertising takes place. The Company was required to recognize a cumulative effective change to opening retained earnings in the year of adoption of the standard. The Company recorded a one-time $1.9 million adjustment to retained earnings on January 1, 2018 and is expensing all future costs from this date forward. Under the new guidance Subtopic 340-40, the Company's expense decreased by $522 thousand during 2018 from what would have been recorded under legacy US GAAP 340-20.\nSales Commissions -Certain sales commission paid with respect to subscription-based revenues are deferred and subsequently amortized into operating expenses ratably over the term of the related customer subscription contracts. As of December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 $650 thousand, $652 thousand, and $661 thousand, respectively, of sales commissions were deferred and included in other current assets on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company amortized $763 thousand and $1.0 million, respectively, of previously deferred sales commissions and included this expense in operating expenses on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income.\nProperty and Equipment-Property and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization are computed using the straight-line method over the assets' estimated useful lives. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the expected life of the improvements or the remaining lease term. Repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred and major improvements that extend the life of the asset are capitalized and depreciated over the expected remaining life of the related asset. Gains and losses resulting from sales or retirements are recorded as incurred, at which time related costs and accumulated depreciation are removed from the Company\u2019s accounts. Fixed assets acquired in acquisitions are recorded at fair value. The estimated useful lives applied by the Company for property and equipment are as follows:\nLife\nAsset Category (years)\nBuildings 39\nBuilding Improvements 15\nComputer equipment 5\nFurniture, fixtures and other 7\nSoftware 3\nLand Improvements 20\nLand Unlimited life\nLeasehold improvements Shorter of asset life or life of the lease\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements-The following is a brief discussion of recently released accounting pronouncements that are pertinent to the Company's business:\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): \"Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes\". ASU 2019-12 is expected to reduce the cost and complexity related to the accounting for income taxes by eliminating the need for an entity to analyze whether the following apply to a given reporting period:\n\u2022 Exception to the incremental approach for intra period tax allocation;\n\u2022 Exceptions to accounting for basis differences when there are ownership changes in foreign investments; and\n\u2022 Exception in interim period income tax accounting for year-to-date losses that exceed anticipated losses.\nFor public business entities, the amendments in this Update are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2020. The Company not yet assessed the impact that the adoption of this guidance will have on its statement of financial position or its statement of income.\nIn March 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting, which provides optional expedients and exceptions to the current guidance on contract modifications and hedging relationships to ease the financial reporting burdens of the expected market transition from the London Interbank Offered Rate (\"LIBOR\") and other interbank offered rates to alternative reference rates, such as the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\"SOFR\"). The guidance was effective upon issuance and may be applied prospectively to contract modifications made and hedging relationships entered into or evaluated on or before December 31, 2022. The adoption of this guidance has had no impact on the consolidated financial statements as the Company has not yet modified any of the existing contracts in response to the reference rate reform. The impact of this ASU will ultimately depend on the terms of any future contract modification related to a change in reference rate, including potential future modifications to the Company's Credit Facility.\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): \"Disclosure Framework-Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement\". ASU 2018-13 is intended to improve the effectiveness of ASC 820\u2019s disclosure requirements. The amendments in this ASU are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within that fiscal year.\nIn February 2018, the FASB issued 2018-02, Income Statement-Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): \"Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income\". The ASU provides that the stranded tax effects from the Tax Act in accumulated other comprehensive loss may be reclassified to retained earnings. The amendments in this ASU are effective for all entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those fiscal years.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): \"Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment\". To simplify the subsequent measurement of goodwill, the FASB eliminated Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. In computing the implied fair value of goodwill under Step 2, an entity had to perform procedures to determine the fair value at the impairment testing date of its assets and liabilities (including unrecognized assets and liabilities). Instead, under the amendments in this ASU, an entity should perform its annual, or interim, goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. A public business entity filer should adopt the amendments in this ASU for its annual or any interim goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-01, Business Combinations (Topic 805): \"Clarifying the Definition of a Business\" which amended the existing FASB ASC. The standard provides additional guidance to assist entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions (or disposals) of assets or businesses. The definition of a business affects many areas of accounting, including acquisitions, disposals, goodwill, and consolidation. ASU 2017-01 is effective for fiscal 2019 with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted this guidance in 2019 and it had an effect classification certain of its recent acquisitions.\nIn October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16, Taxes (Topic 740): \"Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory\". Current GAAP prohibits the recognition of current and deferred income taxes for an intra-entity asset transfer until the asset has been sold to an outside party. This prohibition on recognition is an exception to the principle of comprehensive recognition of current and deferred income taxes in GAAP. The amendments specified by ASU 2016-16 require an entity to recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs. The amendments eliminate the exception for an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory. Two common examples of assets included in the scope of the amendments are intellectual property, and property, plant and equipment. The amendments do not include new disclosure requirements; however, existing disclosure requirements might be applicable when accounting for the current and deferred income taxes for an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory. The amendments align the recognition of income tax consequences for intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory with International Financial Reporting Standards. IAS 12, Income Taxes, requires recognition of current and deferred income taxes resulting from an intra-entity transfer of any asset (including inventory) when the transfer occurs. The amendments are effective for public business\nentities for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within those annual reporting periods. Early adoption is permitted for all entities in the first interim period if an entity issues interim financial statements. The amendments should be applied on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative-effect adjustment directly to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption. The Company adopted this new standard and it did not have a material effect on its consolidated statement of financial position or statement of income.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13. Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326). The main objective of this ASU is to provide financial statement users with more decision-useful information about the expected credit losses on financial instruments and other commitments to extend credit held by a reporting entity at each reporting date. The measurement of expected credit losses is based on relevant information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. An entity must use judgment in determining the relevant information and estimation methods that are appropriate in its circumstances. For public business entities that are U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filers, the amendments in this Update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company adopted this new standard and it did not have a material effect on its consolidated statement of financial position or statement of income.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). This new accounting guidance is intended to improve financial reporting about leasing transactions. The ASU affects all companies and other organizations that lease assets such as real estate, airplanes, and manufacturing equipment. The ASU will require organizations that lease assets referred to as \u201cLessees\u201d to recognize on the balance sheet the assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by those leases. An organization is to provide disclosures designed to enable users of financial statements to understand the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. These disclosures include qualitative and quantitative requirements concerning additional information about the amounts recorded in the financial statements. Under the new guidance, a lessee is required to recognize assets and liabilities for leases with lease terms of more than twelve months. Consistent with current GAAP, the recognition, measurement, and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease by a lessee primarily will depend on its classification as a finance or operating lease. However, unlike current GAAP which requires only capital leases to be recognized on the balance sheet, the new ASU requires both types of leases (i.e., operating and capital) to be recognized on the balance sheet. The capital lease is accounted for in substantially the same manner as capital leases are accounted for under existing GAAP. For operating leases, there now is the recognition of a lease liability and a lease asset for all such leases greater than one year in term. Public companies are required to adopt the new leasing standard for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018. We adopted Topic 842 effective January 1, 2019 using a modified retrospective method and will not restate comparative periods. As permitted under the transition guidance, we carried forward the assessment of whether our contracts contain or are leases, classification of our leases and remaining lease terms. See Note 19.\nNote 2. Earnings per Share\nThe basic and diluted earnings per share (\u201cEPS\u201d), and the basic and diluted weighted average shares outstanding for all periods as presented in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income are shown below:\nFor the year ended\nDecember 31,\n(In thousands, except per share amounts)\nEarnings per share: 2020 2019 2018\nBasic earnings per common share $ 3.03 $ 3.17 $ 2.97\nDiluted earnings per common share $ 3.02 $ 3.16 $ 2.95\nBasic weighted average shares outstanding 30,510 30,511 31,393\nDiluted weighted average shares outstanding 30,571 30,594 31,534\nBasic EPS is equal to net income attributable to Ebix, Inc. divided by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS takes into consideration common stock equivalents which for the Company consist of stock options and restricted stock. With respect to stock options, diluted EPS is calculated as if the Company had additional common stock outstanding from the beginning of the year or the date of grant or issuance, net of assumed repurchased shares using the treasury stock method. With respect to restricted stock, diluted EPS is calculated as if the Company had additional common stock outstanding from the beginning of the year or the date of grant or issuance. Diluted\nEPS is equal to net income attributable to Ebix, Inc divided by the combined sum of the weighted average number of shares outstanding and common stock equivalents. At December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 there were 181,875, 181,875, and 42,000 respectively of potentially issuable shares with respect to stock options which could dilute EPS in the future but which were excluded from the diluted EPS calculation because presently their effect is anti-dilutive. Diluted shares outstanding are determined as follows for each year ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018:\nFor the year ended\nDecember 31,\n(In thousands)\n2020 2019 2018\nBasic weighted average shares outstanding 30,510 30,511 31,393\nIncremental shares for common stock equivalents 61 83 141\nDiluted shares outstanding 30,571 30,594 31,534\nNote 3. Business Acquisitions\nThe Company\u2019s business acquisitions are accounted for under the purchase method of accounting in accordance with ASC 805 (\"Business Combinations\"). Accordingly, the consideration paid by the Company for the businesses it purchases is allocated to the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired based upon their estimated fair values as of the date of the acquisition. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. Recognized goodwill pertains in part to the value of the expected synergies to be derived from combining the operations of the businesses we acquire including the value of the acquired workforce. While we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date as well as contingent consideration, where applicable, our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we may record significant adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recognized in our consolidated statements of income.\nThe Company's practice is to immediately integrate all functions including infrastructure, sales and marketing, administration, product development after a business acquisition is consummated, so as to ensure that synergistic efficiencies are maximized, redundancies eliminated, and to leverage cross-selling opportunities. Furthermore, the Company centralizes certain key functions such as information technology, marketing, sales, human resources, finance, and other general administrative functions after an acquisition, in order to realize cost efficiencies. By executing this integration strategy, it becomes neither practical nor feasible to accurately and separately track and disclose the earnings from the business combinations we have executed after they have been acquired.\nA significant component of the purchase price consideration for many of the Company's business acquisitions is a potential future cash earnout based on reaching certain specified future revenue targets. The terms for the contingent earn-out payments in most of the Company's business acquisitions typically address revenues achieved by the acquired entity over a one, two, and/or three year period subsequent to the effective date of their acquisition by Ebix. These terms typically establish a minimum threshold revenue target with achievement of revenues recognized over that target being awarded in the form of a specified cash earn-out payment. The Company applies these terms in its calculation and determination of the fair value of contingent earn-out liabilities for purchased businesses as part of the related valuation and purchase price allocation exercise for the corresponding acquired assets and liabilities. The Company recognizes these potential obligations as contingent liabilities as reported on its Consolidated Balance Sheets. As discussed in more detail in Note 1, these contingent consideration liabilities are recorded at fair value on the acquisition date and are remeasured quarterly based on the then assessed fair value and adjusted if necessary. During each of the years ending December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, these aggregate contingent accrued earn-out business acquisition consideration liabilities, were reduced by $3.1 million, $16.5 million, and $1.4 million, respectively, due to remeasurements as based on the then assessed fair value and changes in the amount and timing of anticipated future revenue levels. These reductions to the contingent accrued earn-out liabilities resulted in corresponding reduction to general and administrative expenses as reported on the Consolidated Statements of Income. As of December 31, 2020, there were no outstanding contingent earn-out liability in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet. As of December 31, 2019, the total of these contingent liabilities was $10.1 million, of which $1.5 million was reported in long-term liabilities and $8.6 million was included in current liabilities in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n2020 Acquisitions\nTrimax- Effective May 4, 2020, Ebix acquired from bankruptcy India-based Trimax, which provides IT and integration services to state-owned transport corporations, operates data centers, and is an IT infrastructure solution provider, for approximately $9.9 million of upfront consideration. Additionally, Ebix issued preferred shares in Trimax to the selling shareholders that can be sold five years from the closing of the acquisition based on an independent valuation performed by a Big 4 valuation firm. The maximum potential value of the preferred shares is approximately $9.9 million. The valuation and purchase price allocation remains preliminary and will be finalized as soon as practicable but in no event longer than one year from the effective date of this transaction.\nAssureEdge- Effective October 1, 2020 the Company acquired a 70% interest in AssureEdge Global Services (\u201cAssureEdge\u201d) for a total purchase price of approximately $5.0 million, including net working capital acquired. AssureEdge is a pan-India based business process outsourcing (\"BPO\") company, with a variety of BPO offerings via six contact centers across the country. It serves a number of industries and clients that have cross-selling value for EbixCash services. The valuation and purchase price allocation remains preliminary and will be finalized as soon as practicable but in no event longer than one year from the effective date of this transaction.\n2019 Acquisitions\nWallstreet Canada- Effective August 23, 2019, Ebix acquired Canada based Wallstreet Canada, a foreign exchange and outward remittance service provider for approximately $2.1 million inclusive of net acquired working capital.\nEssel Forex- Effective January 1, 2019, Ebix acquired the assets of India based Essel Forex, for approximately $8.7 million, plus possible future contingent earn-out payments of up to $721 thousand based on earned revenues. Ebix funded the entire transaction in cash using its internal cash reserves. Essel Forex is a provider of foreign exchange services in India, with a wide spectrum of related products including sales of all major currencies, travelers\u2019 checks, demand drafts, remittances, money transfers and prepaid cards primarily for corporate clients.\nZillious- Effective January 1, 2019, Ebix acquired an 80% controlling stake in India based Zillious for $10.1 million plus possible future contingent earn-out payments of up to $2.2 million based on agreed milestones in the acquisition agreement. Zillious is an on-demand SaaS travel technology solution in the corporate travel segment in India.\nThe following table summarizes the recognized intangible assets, goodwill and earn-out provisions, as a result of the cumulative valuation and purchase price allocations on effective date of acquisition, for the 2020 and 2019 acquisitions:\nCompany acquired Date acquired Goodwill Intangibles Assets Contingent Earn-Out Provision\n(In thousands)\nEssel Forex Jan-19 8,372 1,163 407\nZillious Jan-19 9,489 1,875 1,515\nWallstreet Canada Aug-19 71 - -\nTotal for 2019 acquisitions $ 17,932 $ 3,038 $ 1,922\nTrimax* May-20 8,243 - -\nAssureEdge* Oct-20 3,678 - -\nTotal for 2020 acquisitions $ 11,921 $ - $ -\n*The valuation and purchase price allocation remains preliminary and will be finalized as soon as practicable but in no event longer than one year from the effective date of this transaction.\nThe following table summarizes the fair value of the consideration transferred, net assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as of the acquisition date, for acquisitions closed during 2020 and 2019:\n(In thousands) 2020 2019\nFair value of total consideration transferred\nCash $ 13,774 $ 105,391\nConsideration payable 1,827 -\nContingent earn-out consideration arrangement (net) - 1,922\nTotal consideration transferred 15,601 107,313\nFair value of equity components recorded (not part of consideration)\nRecognition of noncontrolling interest of joint ventures 1,350 (10,258)\nTotal equity components recorded 1,350 (10,258)\nTotal consideration transferred and equity components recorded $ 16,951 $ 97,055\nFair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed\nCash, net of adjustment $ 1,358 $ (75)\nOther current assets 2,812 5,175\nProperty, plant, and equipment 4,021 231\nOther long term assets 103 3,023\nIntangible assets, definite lived - 6,296\nCapitalized software development costs - -\nDeferred tax liability - 12\nCurrent and other liabilities, net of consideration transferred (3,264) 63,721\nNet assets acquired, excludes goodwill 5,030 78,383\nGoodwill 11,921 18,672\nTotal net assets acquired $ 16,951 $ 97,055\nThe following table summarizes the separately identified intangible assets acquired as a result of the acquisitions that occurred during 2020 and 2019:\nDecember 31,\n2020 2019\nWeighted\nAverage Weighted\nAverage\nIntangible asset category Fair Value Useful Life Fair Value Useful Life\n(In thousands) (In years) (In thousands) (In years)\nCustomer relationships $ - 0.0 $ 3,042 7.5\nDeveloped technology - 0.0 851 7.0\nAgent network - 0.0 582 10.2\nAirport contracts - 0.0 - 0.0\nStore networks - 0.0 - 0.0\nBrand - 0.0 78 5.0\nBranch network - 0.0 1,743 10.0\nPurchase accounting adjustments for prior year acquisitions - 0.0 - 0.0\nTotal acquired intangible assets $ - 0.0 $ 6,296 8.0\nEstimated aggregate future amortization expense for the intangible assets recorded as part of the business acquisitions described above and all other prior acquisitions is as follows:\nFuture Amortization Expenses (In thousands):\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021 $ 9,359\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022 8,967\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023 6,942\nFor the year ended December 31, 2024 5,155\nFor the year ended December 31, 2025 3,835\nThereafter 16,622\n$ 50,880\nThe Company recorded $9.5 million, $10.2 million, and $7.5 million of amortization expense related to acquired intangible assets for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.\nNote 4.

Commitments and Contingencies\nContingencies- On February 22, 2021, Christine Marie Teifke, a purported purchaser of Ebix, Inc. securities, filed a putative class action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on behalf of herself and others who purchased or acquired Ebix securities between November 9, 2020 and February 19, 2021. The complaint asserts claims against Ebix, Inc., Robin Raina, and Steven M. Hamil, for purported violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, alleging that Ebix, Inc. made false and misleading statements and failed to disclose material adverse facts about an audit of the company's gift card business in India and its internal controls over the gift and prepaid card revenue transaction cycle. The complaint alleges that Ebix's stock price fell as a result of the revelation that Ebix's independent auditor, RSM US LLP, had resigned, citing concerns with the company's internal controls and disagreements over other accounting issues. The complaint also asserts a claim against Robin Raina and Steven M. Hamil for purported violations of Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act arising out of the same facts. The complaint seeks, among other relief, damages and attorneys' fees and costs.\nOn July 16, 2019, Yatra Online, Inc. (\"Yatra\"), Ebix, Inc. (\"Ebix\"), and EbixCash Travels, Inc. (\"Merger Sub\") entered into a Merger Agreement. On May 14, 2020, Yatra entered into an agreement with Ebix and Merger Sub extending the outside date of the Merger Agreement (the \"Extension Agreement\"). On June 5, 2020, Yatra terminated the Merger Agreement and filed a complaint in the Delaware Court of Chancery against Ebix and Merger Sub (the \"Complaint\"). On September 25, 2020, Yatra amended the Complaint and added as a defendant each financial institution (each, a \u201cDefendant Lender\u201d) party our Credit Facility, which prior to the filing of the original Complaint, had been previously amended on May 7, 2020. The Complaint, as amended, alleges that Ebix and Merger Sub breached certain representations, warranties, and covenants contained in the Merger Agreement and the Extension Agreement and that Ebix negotiated in bad faith. The amended Complaint also alleges fraudulent actions by Ebix and the Defendant Lenders arising from certain terms of the Credit Facility and tortious interference with the closing of the Merger Agreement by Ebix and the Defendant Lenders. The Complaint seeks, among other relief, damages, pre-judgment and post-judgment interest, and attorneys' fees and costs. Ebix and Merger Sub deny any liability and intend to defend the action vigorously.\nOn May 12, 2017, Ebix Software India Pvt. Ltd. (\u201cEbixcash\u201d) entered into several agreements with the most prominent shareholders of Itz Cash Card Limited (\u201cItz\u201d), the most relevant among these a stock purchase agreement (the \u201cSPA\u201d), to purchase a majority ownership stake in Itz. Further, as part of the overall purchase of Itz, a share purchase agreement between Ebixcash and individual ESOP holders of Itz was entered into on July 7, 2017 (the \u201cESOP SPA\u201d) (with the SPA, the ESOP SPA and the other purchase documents, collectively, the \u201cTransaction Documents\u201d). Part of the consideration for Ebixcash\u2019s purchase of Itz consisted of two individual potential earn-out payments, the first for the period for the year ended March 31, 2019 (the \u201cFirst Earn-Out\u201d) and the second for the following year, ending on March 31, 2020 (the \u201cSecond Earn-Out\u201d). Neither the First Earn-Out nor the Second Earn-Out were achieved pursuant to the terms of the SPA. After correspondence between the parties between September 2019 and May 2020, the former shareholders of Itz (\u201cSellers\u201d) sent Ebixcash notices of arbitration (\u201cNOAs\u201d) under which they were availing themselves of the arbitration dispute provisions set forth in the Transaction Documents. Apart from the amounts claimed owed under the earn-out provisions, the Sellers also alleged in the NOAs other violations of the terms of the Transaction Documents, including, certain non-competition and restricted matter approval violations. The matter is under Arbitration in accordance with the rules of the Singapore International Arbitration Centre. The Company believes that each of the Sellers claims is without merit and continues to defend its position vigorously. The Company believes that Ebixcash has several viable counterclaims related to improper termination of the Transaction Documents and violation non-compete provisions.\nAs the Company previously disclosed, in May 2013, twelve putative class action complaints were filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery against the Company and its board of directors challenging a proposed merger between the\nCompany and an affiliate of Goldman Sachs & Co. On June 10, 2013, the Court entered an Order of Consolidation and Appointment of Lead Plaintiffs and a Leadership Structure consolidating the twelve actions and appointing lead plaintiffs (\u201cPlaintiffs\u201d) and lead counsel in the litigation, captioned In re Ebix, Inc. Stockholder Litigation, Consol. C.A. No. 8526-VCS (the \u201cLitigation\u201d). In connection with the Litigation, on January 23, 2019, the parties entered into a Stipulation and Agreement of Settlement (the \u201cSettlement Agreement\u201d) pursuant to which the parties agreed, subject to approval by the Delaware Court of Chancery, to settle and resolve the Litigation pursuant to the terms set forth in the Settlement Agreement (the \u201cLitigation Settlement\u201d). On April 5, 2019, the Delaware Court of Chancery determined that the Litigation Settlement was fair, reasonable, adequate and in the best interest of the plaintiffs, the class and the Company and awarded to plaintiffs\u2019 counsel attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses in the sum of $19.65 million, which was paid on May 2, 2019, and entered an Order and Final Judgment (the \u201cOrder\u201d) approving the Litigation Settlement. The Order provided for full settlement, satisfaction, compromise and release of all claims that were asserted or could have been asserted in the Litigation, whether on behalf of the class or the Company. The Settlement contains no admission of wrongdoing or liability, and may not be deemed to be a presumption as to the validity of any claims, causes of action or other issues.\nThe Company is involved in various other claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business, which in the opinion of management, the ultimate likely disposition of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity.\nLease Commitments- See Note 19.\nBusiness Acquisition Earn-out Contingencies-A significant component of the purchase price consideration for many of the Company's business acquisitions is a potential future cash earn out based on reaching certain specified future revenue targets. The terms for the contingent earn-out payments in most of the Company's business acquisitions typically address the GAAP recognizable revenues achieved by the acquired entity over a one, two, and/or three year period subsequent to the effective date of their acquisition by Ebix. These terms typically establish a minimum threshold revenue target with achievement of revenues recognized over that target being awarded in the form of a specified cash earn-out payment. The Company applies these terms in its calculation and determination of the fair value of contingent earn-out liabilities for purchased businesses as part of the related valuation and purchase price allocation exercise for the corresponding acquired assets and liabilities. As of December 31, 2020, here were no outstanding contingent liability in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet. As of December 31, 2019, the total of these contingent liabilities was $10.1 million of which $1.5 million was reported in long-term liabilities, and $8.6 million was included in current liabilities in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nSelf-Insurance-For some of the Company\u2019s U.S. employees the Company has a self-insured plan for its health insurance program and has a stop loss policy that limits the individual liability to $120 thousand per person and the aggregate liability to 125% of the expected claims based upon the number of participants and historical claims. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the amount accrued on the Company\u2019s consolidated balance sheet for the self-insured component of the Company\u2019s employee health insurance was $345 thousand and $362 thousand, respectively. The maximum potential estimated cumulative liability for the annual contract period, which ends in September 2021, is $4.1 million. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company recognized $1.8 million, and $2.6 million of expense, respectively, associated with claims from its self-insured health insurance program.\nGratuity Leave-In accordance with Indian law, we pay gratuity to our eligible employees in India. Under our gratuity plan, an employee is entitled to receive a gratuity payment on the termination of his or her employment if the employee has rendered continuous service to our company for not less than five years, or if the termination of employment is due to death or disability. The amount of gratuity payable to an eligible employee is based on number of years of employment and is limited to a maximum of $28 thousand per employee. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the amount accrued on the Company\u2019s consolidated balance sheet for gratuity leave was $4.3 million and $3.2 million, respectively.\nNote 6. Share-Based Compensation\nStock Options-The Company accounts for compensation expense associated with stock options issued to employees, Directors, and non-employees based on their fair value, which is calculated using an option pricing model, and is recognized over the service period, which is usually the vesting period. At December 31, 2020, the Company had two equity based compensation plans. No stock options were granted to employees or non-employees during 2020, 2019, and 2018; however, options were granted to Directors in 2020, 2019, and 2018. Stock compensation expense of $517 thousand, $537 thousand and\n$449 thousand was recognized during the years ending December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively, on outstanding and unvested options.\nThe fair value of options granted during 2020 is estimated on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model.

The CARES Act provides numerous tax provisions and other stimulus measures, including temporary changes regarding the prior and future utilization of net operating losses, temporary suspension of certain payment requirements for the employer portion of Social Security taxes, technical corrections from prior tax legislation for tax depreciation of certain qualified improvement property, and the creation of certain refundable employee retention credits. The Company evaluated the provisions of the CARES Act and does not anticipate the associated impacts, if any, will have a material effect on the Company\u2019s provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nThe Company has not recognized a deferred U.S. tax liability and associated income tax expense for the undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries which we consider indefinitely invested because those foreign earnings will remain permanently reinvested in those subsidiaries to fund ongoing operations and growth. Upon distribution of those earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise, we may be subject to income taxes and withholding taxes payable in various jurisdictions, which could potentially be partially offset by foreign tax credits. At December 31, 2020 the cumulative amount of the Company\u2019s undistributed foreign earnings was approximately $767.4 million, inclusive of income previously taxed in the United States.\nThe following table summarizes the activity related to provision made by the Company in the books for uncertain tax positions:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2019 2018\n(In thousands)\nBeginning Balance $ 9,199 $ 9,294 $ 9,144\nAdditions for tax positions related to current year - - 150\nAdditions for tax positions of prior years 966 195 -\nReductions for tax position of prior years (1,874) (290) -\nEnding Balance $ 8,291 $ 9,199 $ 9,294\nThe Company recognizes estimated interest accrued and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as part of the income tax expense provided for such positions. The Company accrued as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 approximately $3.0 million and $1.0 million, respectively, of estimated interest and penalties. These amounts are included in the December 31, 2020 and 2019 balances in the preceding table of $8.3 million and $9.2 million, respectively, which is included in other long term liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nWe file income tax returns in the US federal, many US state and local jurisdictions, and certain foreign jurisdictions. We have substantially resolved all US federal income tax matters for tax years prior to 2015. Our state and foreign tax matters may remain open from 2008 forward.\nNote 8. Stock Repurchases\nEffective February 6, 2017, the Company's Board of Directors unanimously approved and authorized a share repurchase plan of $150.0 million. The Board directed that the repurchases be funded with available cash balances and cash generated by the Company's operating activities. The aggregate amount of repurchases of the Company's equity shares is limited by restrictive covenants contained in our Credit Facility.\nThe Company's share repurchase plan\u2019s terms have been structured to comply with the SEC\u2019s Rule 10b-18, and are subject to market conditions and applicable legal requirements. The program does not obligate the Company to acquire any specific number of shares and may be suspended or terminated at any time. All purchases are made in the open market.

This accounting guidance is intended to improve financial reporting about leasing transactions. The ASU requires organizations that lease assets referred to as \u201cLessees\u201d to recognize on the balance sheet the assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by those leases. An organization\nis to provide disclosures designed to enable users of financial statements to understand the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. These disclosures include qualitative and quantitative requirements concerning additional information about the amounts recorded in the financial statements. Under the new guidance, a lessee is required to recognize assets and liabilities for leases with lease terms of more than twelve months. Consistent with current GAAP, the recognition, measurement, and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease by a lessee primarily will depend on its classification as a finance or operating lease. However, unlike former GAAP, which requires only financing leases to be recognized on the balance sheet, the new ASU requires both types of leases (i.e., operating and financing) to be recognized on the balance sheet. The financing lease will be accounted for in substantially the same manner as capital leases were accounted for under the previous guidance. For operating leases, there is now the recognition of a lease liability and a lease asset for all such leases greater than one year in term.\nThe Company adopted Topic 842 effective January 1, 2019, using a modified retrospective method and did not restate comparative periods. The Company elected to adopt the package of practical expedients; accordingly, the Company retained the lease classification and initial direct costs for any leases that existed prior to adoption and we did not revisit whether any existing or expired contracts contain leases. The Company has operating and finance leases for office space, retail, data centers and certain office equipment with expiration dates ranging through 2029, with various renewal options. Only renewal options that were reasonably assured to be exercised are included in the lease liability. As of December 31, 2020, the maturity of lease liabilities under Topic 842 are as follows:\nYear Operating Leases Financing Leases Total\n(In thousands)\n2021 $ 4,667 $ 190 $ 4,857\n2022 3,462 160 3,622\n2023 2,993 99 3,092\n2024 1,605 77 1,682\n2025 1,001 - 1,001\nThereafter 519 - 519\nTotal 14,247 526 14,773\nLess: present value discount* (1,802) (49) (1,851)\nPresent value of lease liabilities 12,445 477 12,922\nLess: current portion of lease liabilities (3,905) (164) (4,069)\nTotal long-term lease liabilities $ 8,540 $ 313 $ 8,853\n* The discount rate used was the relevant incremental borrowing rate in each of the jurisdictions\nwherein the leased properties are located\nThe company's net assets recorded under operating and finance leases were $12.9 million as of December 31, 2020. The lease cost recognized in our Condensed Consolidated Statement of Income in the category of General and Administrative, is summarized as follows:\nDecember 31\n(In thousands) 2020 2019\nOperating Lease Cost $ 7,051 $ 8,613\nFinance Lease Cost:\nAmortization of Lease Assets 161 121\nInterest on Lease liabilities 39 36\nFinance Lease Cost 200 157\nSublease Income (476) (654)\nTotal Net Lease Cost $ 6,775 $ 8,116\nOther information about lease amounts recognized in our Condensed Consolidated Statement of Income is summarized as follows:\nDecember 31, 2020\nWeighted Average Lease Term - Operating Leases 3.63 years\nWeighted Average Lease Term - Finance Leases 3.18 years\nWeighted Average Discount Rate - Operating Leases 8.09 %\nWeighted Average Discount Rate - Finance Leases 7.13 %\nCommitments for minimum rentals under non-cancellable leases, under the legacy guidance in ASC 840 as of December 31, 2020 were as follows:\nYear Operating Leases Financing Leases\n(In thousands)\n2021 $ 4,667 $ 190\n2022 3,462 160\n2023 2,993 99\n2024 1,605 77\n2025 1,001 -\nThereafter 519 -\nTotal $ 14,247 $ 526\nLess: sublease income (476)\nNet lease payments $ 13,771\nLess: amount representing interest (39)\nPresent value of obligations under financing leases $ 487\nLess: current portion (164)\nLong-term obligations $ 323\nAs of December 31, 2020, our lease liability of $12.9 million does not include certain arrangements, which are primarily airport leases that do not meet the definition of a lease under Topic 842. Such arrangements represent further commitments of approximately $56.3 million as follows:\nYear Commitments\n(In thousands)\n2021 $ 20,251\n2022 18,271\n2023 17,756\nThereafter -\nTotal $ 56,278\nFinance leases range from three to five years and are primarily for office equipment. Rental expense for office and airport facilities and certain equipment subject to operating leases for the period ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $4.5 million and $37.8 million, respectively. The year over year decline in this rent expense is a result of COVID-19, in which airport leases were subject to force majeure provisions and the cessation of the Company's airport operations during 2020. Monthly rent payments were temporarily waived until the Company restarted its airport operations.\nNote 20: Working Capital Facilities\nThe Company maintains working capital debt facilities with banks in India for working capital funding requirements to support our foreign exchange, travel and remittance businesses. We are required to extend short term credits to franchisee networks (B2B) and corporate customers. Additionally, we are required to maintain minimum levels of foreign currency inventory across branches and airport operations. Typically, these facilities carry interest rates 6.75% to 9.45% and are rupee denominated working capital lines and are collateralized against the receivables of these businesses and existing foreign currency inventory on hand.\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the total of these working capital facilities was $16.6 million and $28.4 million, respectively, and is included in current liabilities in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nNote 21. Concentrations of Credit Risk\nCredit Risk\nThe Company is potentially subject to concentrations of credit risk in its accounts receivable. Credit risk is the risk of an unexpected loss if a customer fails to meet its contractual obligations. Although the Company is directly affected by the financial condition of its customers and the loss of or a substantial reduction in orders or the ability to pay from the customer could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements, management does not believe significant credit risks exist at December 31, 2020. The Company had one customer whose accounts receivable balances individually represented 10% or more of the Company\u2019s total accounts receivable.\nMajor Customer\nAs previously disclosed in Note 18, effective February 7, 2016, Ebix and Vayam Technologies Ltd (\"Vayam\") formed a joint venture named Ebix Vayam Limited JV.

See",
    "item_9": "Item 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE\nAs previously disclosed, by letter dated February 15, 2021, RSM notified the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors ( the \"Board\") of the Company of its resignation as the Company\u2019s independent registered public accounting firm.\nRSM was engaged by the Audit Committee on December 21, 2018 to serve as the Company\u2019s independent auditor for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019 and was engaged again on June 12, 2020 to serve as the Company\u2019s independent auditor for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2020. RSM\u2019s previously issued reports on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements and the Company\u2019s internal controls over financial reporting for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 did not contain an adverse opinion or a disclaimer of opinion; nor were they qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope, or accounting principles. As of February 15, 2021, RSM had not completed its audit procedures or issued any reports on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements and internal controls over financial reporting for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020.\nFrom December 21, 2018 when RSM was initially engaged, through RSM\u2019s resignation, other than as provided below, there were no (i) \u201cdisagreements\u201d (as that term is defined in Item 304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K) between the Company and RSM on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedures, which disagreements, if not resolved to the satisfaction of RSM, would have caused RSM to make reference to the subject matter thereof in its reports for such fiscal years and interim period, or (ii), \u201creportable events\u201d as that term is described in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K.\nRSM informed the Company that there was a disagreement under Item 304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K with respect to the classification of $30 million. In connection with a pending acquisition, in December 2020 the Company transferred $30 million to a commingled trust account of its outside legal counsel that was not under the direct control of the Company, and classified the funds as a cash or cash equivalent on its balance sheet. RSM discussed with the Company RSM\u2019s view that these funds could not be classified as a cash or cash equivalent but could be classified as other current assets. There was no dispute that the $30 million was owned by the Company and would be classified as part of current assets included in the financial statements.\nThe Company considered this issue to be an initial difference of opinion based on incomplete facts or preliminary information rather than a \u201cdisagreement\u201d pursuant to Item 304(a)(1)(iv).\nOn February 15, 2021, RSM told the Chairman of the Company\u2019s Audit Committee during a telephone call that RSM was resigning as the Company\u2019s independent registered public accounting firm, effective immediately. RSM then advised the Chairman on the call that it was resigning as a result of being unable, despite repeated inquiries, to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence that would allow it to evaluate the business purpose of significant unusual transactions that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2020, including whether such transactions have been properly accounted for and disclosed in the financial statements subject to the Audit. RSM informed the Chairman that the unusual transactions concerned the Company\u2019s gift card business in India. RSM asserts that on that call it further advised the Chairman that if this requested information was further investigated it might materially impact the fairness or reliability of the financial statements subject to the audit or affect RSMs willingness to be associated with the Company\u2019s financial statements, but that since RSM had resigned, no further investigation would occur. The Chairman discussed with RSM the reasons for its resignation.\nPromptly following the call between RSM and the Chairman of the Audit Committee, RSM sent the resignation letter dated February 15, 2021. RSM stated in its resignation letter that it was \u201cresigning as a result of being unable, despite repeated inquiries, to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence that would allow it to evaluate the business purpose of significant unusual transactions that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2020, including whether such transactions have been properly accounted for and disclosed in the financial statements subject to the Audit.\u201d RSM informed the Company that the unusual transactions concerned the Company\u2019s gift card business in India. RSM also stated in its letter that it believed that the Company\u2019s \u201cinternal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2020 due to the identification of a material weakness. Specifically, management did not design or implement the necessary procedures and controls over the gift or prepaid card revenue transaction cycle sufficient to prevent or detect a material misstatement.\u201d RSM further stated in the letter that, \u201cbecause we have not completed the Audit, we cannot conclude on other control deficiencies that may rise to the level of a material weakness.\u201d\nEffective March 5, 2021, the Company engaged KG Somani & Co. (\u201cKGS\u201d), as our independent accountants for the year ending December 31, 2020. The Audit Committee made the decision to engage KGS. The Company has not consulted\nwith the KGS during our two most recent fiscal years or during any subsequent interim period prior to its appointment as our new independent accountants regarding either:\n(i) the application of accounting principles to a specified transaction, either completed or proposed; or the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on our financial statements, and neither a written report was provided to us nor oral advice was provided that KGS concluded was an important factor considered by the Company in reaching a decision as to the accounting, auditing or financial reporting issue; or\n(ii) any matter that was either the subject of disagreement (as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K and the related instructions) or a reportable event (within the meaning of Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K).As a result of the resignation of RSM on February 15, 2021, the Company was unable to timely file its Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Company has engaged KGS and is now filing its Form 10-K and expects to file it quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2021 on time.\nAs referenced in the Company's February 20, 2021 press release following RSM's resignation, the Board engaged counsel, Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP to, along with accounting experts from the consulting firm, AlixPartners LLP, assist the Company with respect to matters raised by the former auditor's resignation. Having reviewed the work performed by AlixPartners and considered their observations, the Board is satisfied that no steps are necessary with respect to any gift card business issues raised by the former auditor in its resignation.\nThe audit committee of the Company decided to retain KPMG for valuation work and Ernst & Young for tax advice, tax provisioning and SOX internal control evaluation work for the year 2020.",
    "item_9A": "Item 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures: We maintain a system of disclosure controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that we file and submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported accurately within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms. Disclosure controls also are designed to reasonably assure that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Disclosure controls include components of internal control over financial reporting, which consists of control processes designated to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe monitor and evaluate on an ongoing basis our disclosure controls and procedures in order to improve their overall effectiveness. In the course of these evaluations, we modify and refine our internal processes and controls as conditions warrant.\nOur management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our \u201cdisclosure controls and procedures\u201d (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act) as of December 31, 2020. Based on that evaluation, management has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accurately recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and to ensure that information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nManagement\u2019s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Our internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles.\nThe term \u201cinternal control over financial reporting\u201d is defined as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by our board of directors, audit committee, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that:\n(1) Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions and dispositions of assets;\n(2) Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and\n(3) Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance. It is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures. Internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper management override of controls. Because of such limitations, there is a risk that material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting. However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process and, therefore, it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nIn making its assessment of the effectiveness of the Company controls over financial reporting, management used the criteria set forth by the 2013 Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, or 2013 COSO Internal\nControl-Integrated Framework. Based on our assessment and those criteria, management believes that we maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020.\nK G Somani & Co, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, audited the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020. K G Somani & Co has issued their report which is included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in management's evaluation during the year ended December 31, 2020 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Ebix, Inc.\nOpinion on the Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Ebix, Inc. and subsidiaries\u2019 (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of December 31, 2020, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders\u2019 equity, and cash flows of the Company for the year then ended, and the related notes to the consolidated financial statements and our report dated April 24, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company\u2019s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting in the accompanying Management\u2019s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ K G Somani & Co\nNew Delhi, India\nApril 27, 2021",

During 2020, the Company's full Board of Directors met four times, all of the meetings being conducted over telephonic conference calls due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

To be timely, a director nomination by a stockholder for an annual meeting must be submitted not less than 90 nor more than 120 days before the anniversary date of the immediately preceding annual meeting. In the case of a nomination at a special meeting, notice of such nomination must be given within 10 days that notice of such meeting was provided or made public.\nIn addition, Section 3.10 of the Amended and Restated Bylaws requires disclosures relating to the nominees and their relationships with stockholders proposing their nomination. Among other things, Section 3.10 of the Amended and Restated Bylaws requires a proposed nominee to: (1) represent and promise that the nominee is not, nor will become, party to any understanding with another person (a) to vote or act as a Director in a certain manner or (b) concerning compensation, reimbursement or indemnification without disclosure to the Company; and (2) represent that, if elected to the Board, such nominee would comply with Regulation FD and Company governance, trading, ethics, stock ownership and other policies.\nSection 3.10 of the Amended and Restated Bylaws also requires disclosures similar to a stockholder proposing business for an annual meeting. In addition, a proposing stockholder, including its affiliates, must disclose all agreements or other understandings with a director nominee it has proposed, as well as any other material interest involved in such nomination.\nCode of Conduct and Ethics\nThe Board has adopted the Code of Conduct and Ethics (the \u201cCode of Ethics\u201d), which applies to the senior financial officers (the \u201cSenior Financial Officers\u201d) of the Company and its subsidiaries, including its principal executive officer, principal financial officer and principal accounting officer. Our Board also has adopted a Code of Conduct, articulating standards of business and professional ethics, which is applicable to all of our directors, officers and employees. The Company is committed to the highest standards of professional and ethical conduct, and the Code of Ethics and Code of Conduct provide guidance as to upholding these standards.\nThe Code of Ethics consists of basic standards of business practice, as well as professional and personal conduct, including prohibitions against any conduct or transactions that might constitute a conflict of interest between the Senior Financial Officers and the Company. Any action that might constitute a conflict of interest is reviewed by Company management, and potential conflicts of executive officers or members of the Board are reviewed by the Board.\nThis Code of Ethics is posted on the Company\u2019s website at www.ebix.com, where it may be found by navigating to \u201cEbix Inc. Code of Ethics\u201d under Corporate Governance within the Investor section of the website.

The Company intends to satisfy the disclosure requirement under Form 8-K regarding an amendment to, or waiver from, a provision of the Code of Ethics by posting such information on the Company\u2019s website, at the address and location specified above. These codes are reviewed annually and amended as necessary or appropriate in response to changing regulatory requirements and evolving best practices.\nAudit Committee and Audit Committee Financial Expert\nThe Company has a standing Audit Committee. The Audit Committee\u2019s principal responsibility is to assist the Board in its general oversight of the Company\u2019s financial reporting, internal controls, ethics compliance and audit functions. This committee is directly responsible for the appointment, compensation and oversight of the work of the Company\u2019s independent public accounting firm, reviews the annual financial results and the annual audit of the Company\u2019s financial statements and approves the inclusion of the audited financial statements in the Company\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe Audit Committee assists the Board in monitoring: (a) the integrity of our financial statements, (b) the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, (c) the effectiveness of our disclosure controls, (d) the qualifications and independence of our independent registered public accounting firm, (e) the performance of our independent registered public accounting firm, and (f) our compliance with legal and regulatory requirements. The Audit Committee is also responsible for oversight of the Company\u2019s major financial risk exposures and the steps management has taken to monitor and control such exposures, including the Company\u2019s risk assessment and risk management policies. The Audit Committee\u2019s\ncharter provides that the Audit Committee review and approve related party transactions and conflicts of interest questions between Board members or senior management, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand (as defined and required by applicable securities laws, rules and regulations and the rules of the Nasdaq). The Audit Committee is also responsible for reviewing and monitoring compliance with the Company\u2019s Code of Ethics for Senior Financial Officers. In addition, the Audit Committee has established procedures for the receipt, retention and treatment of complaints received by the Company regarding accounting, financial reporting, internal accounting controls or auditing matters and the confidential and anonymous submission by Company employees of concerns regarding accounting and auditing matters.\nThe Audit Committee exercises oversight responsibility regarding the quality and integrity of our auditing and financial reporting practices. In discharging this responsibility, the Audit Committee, among other things, holds the authority to approve or remove the independent registered public accounting firm and to pre-approve the audit and any non-audit service to be provided by the auditors and reviews the results and scope of the annual audit performed by the auditors. The Audit Committee has three members, who currently are Messrs. Bhalla (Chairman), Benz and Keller. After reviewing the qualifications of the current members of the Audit Committee, and any relationships they may have with the Company that might affect their independence from the Company, our Board has determined that: (1) all current members of the Audit Committee are \u201cindependent\u201d as that concept is defined in Section 10A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, (2) all current members of the Audit Committee are \u201cindependent\u201d as that concept is defined in the Nasdaq listing standards, (3) all current members of the Audit Committee are financially literate, and (4) Mr. Bhalla qualifies as an \u201caudit committee financial expert\u201d as defined under SEC rules promulgated under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The Audit Committee met five times during 2019. The Audit Committee exercises its authority pursuant to a written charter that was adopted in October 2004.\nDelinquent Section 16(a) Reports\nSection 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires the Company's officers and directors and persons who beneficially own more than ten percent of a registered class of our equity securities to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission reports of securities ownership on Form 3 and changes in such ownership on Forms 4 and 5. Officers, directors and more than ten percent beneficial owners also are required by rules promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission to furnish the Company with copies of all such Section 16(a) reports that they file. Based solely upon a review of the copies of Forms 3, 4, and 5 furnished to the Company or representations by certain executive officers and directors that no such reports were required for them, the Company believes that during 2020 all of the Company's directors, officers and more than ten-percent beneficial owners filed all such reports on a timely basis except that, while Mr. Hamil believed his Form 3 and Form 4 were filed in April 2020, due to a clerical error such filings were not received by the SEC and when this was discovered in April 2021 the filings were made promptly.",
    "item_11": "Item 11. EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION\nCompensation Disclosure and Analysis\nObjectives and Goals\nThe objectives of the Compensation Committee have been to adopt a compensation approach that is simple, internally equitable, and externally competitive, and that attracts, motivates, and retains qualified people capable of contributing to the growth, success and profitability of the Company, thereby contributing to long-term stockholder value.\nSimplicity. The Compensation Committee believes that a compensation package with three major elements of compensation is the simplest approach, consistent with the Company\u2019s goals. The Company generally does not utilize special personal perquisites such as private jets, payment of country club dues, Company-furnished motor vehicles, permanent lodging, or defrayment of the cost of personal entertainment.\nInternal Equity. Internal equity has generally been evaluated based on an assessment of the relative contributions of the members of the management team. In 2020, the Compensation Committee did not undertake any formal audit or similar analysis of compensation equity with respect to either the CEO relative to the other members of the management team or with respect to the management team relative to the Company\u2019s employees generally. However, the Compensation Committee believes that the relative difference between CEO compensation and the compensation of the Company\u2019s other executives is consistent with such differences found in the Company\u2019s insurance services peer group and the market for executive-level personnel for public companies of similar size.\nExternal Competitiveness. The Compensation Committee believes it is important to management retention and morale that compensation be competitive with our competitors. In setting annual compensation, the Compensation Committee\ngenerally reviews market data and compares total annual compensation opportunities for our executive officers with compensation opportunities for similar positions at comparable companies. Based on this review, the Compensation Committee approves compensation levels and opportunities for our CEO and our other executive officers that the Compensation Committee believes are competitive with the marketplace and provide appropriate retention and incentive value.\nMajor Compensation Components\nThe principal components of compensation for our executive officers are: (i) base salary, (ii) short-term incentives, generally in the form of cash bonus programs, and (iii) long-term incentives, generally in the form of equity-based awards such as stock awards. We believe the Company\u2019s goals are best met by utilizing an approach to compensation with these three distinct elements.\nBase Salary:\nBase salaries for our executive officers are established based on the scope of their responsibilities, prior relevant background, professional experience, and technical training. Also in this regard, the Compensation Committee takes into account competitive market compensation paid by the companies represented in the compensation data it reviews for similar positions, and the overall market demand for such executives. Although the Company considered the same factors in establishing the base salaries of each of its executive officers, due to the different levels of roles played by each executive, the base salaries are justifiably substantially different.\nOn April 10, 2019, the Company\u2019s Board of Directors, upon recommendation from the Compensation Committee, announced that Mr. Raina's salary for 2019 and going forward is to be paid in shares of common stock of the Company. As a result, on January 2, 2020 the Company granted Mr. Raina 107,655 shares of restricted common stock, which represents his annual salary of $3,600,000 divided by $33.44, the closing price of the Company\u2019s common stock on January 2, 2020. One third of these shares will vest on January 1, 2021 with the remaining stock vesting in quarterly installments over the next eight quarters.\nIncentive Bonus Plan\nThe stockholders approved a Bonus Plan for Mr. Raina at the 2016 Annual Meeting. The Bonus Plan provides for the payment of annual cash incentive awards to the Company\u2019s Chief Executive Officer based upon the achievement by the Company of specified performance goals. The Bonus Plan was intended to preserve the Company\u2019s federal income tax deduction for annual incentive payments to the CEO by meeting the requirements for \u201cqualified performance-based compensation\u201d under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d) (or any successor provision). However, Section 162(m) of the Code was amended in December 2017 as discussed below. Participation in the Bonus Plan is limited to the CEO of the Company. The Company does not anticipate that compensation paid to any of its other executive officers will be subject to the compensation deduction limits of Section 162(m). The Bonus Plan provides that Mr. Raina is eligible to receive cash incentives in connection with a particular fiscal year during the term of the Bonus Plan if the Company meets or exceeds certain performance goals (\u201cPerformance Goals\u201d) set each year by the Compensation Committee. Not later than ninety (90) days after the commencement of any fiscal year during the term of the Bonus Plan (or such other date as may be permitted or required by Section 162(m)), and at a time when the outcome is uncertain, the Compensation Committee will set in writing Performance Goals based on one or more of the following business criteria:\n\u2022Revenue\n\u2022Sales\n\u2022Profit (net profit, gross profit, operating profit or other corporate profit measures)\n\u2022Earnings (EBIT, EBITDA, earnings per share, or other corporate earnings measures)\n\u2022Net income (before or after taxes, operating income or other income measures)\n\u2022Cash (cash flow, cash generation or other cash measures)\n\u2022Stock price or performance\n\u2022Total stockholder return (stock price appreciation plus reinvested dividends divided by beginning share price)\n\u2022Return measures (return on assets, capital, equity, investments or sales, and cash flow return on assets, capital, equity, or sales)\n\u2022Market share\n\u2022Improvements in capital structure\n\u2022Expenses (expense management, expense ratio, expense efficiency ratios or other expense measures)\n\u2022Business expansion or consolidation (acquisitions and divestitures)\n\u2022Strategic plan development and implementation\nAt the time the Compensation Committee sets the Performance Goals for a particular fiscal year, it will also set in writing the CEO\u2019s incentive bonus opportunity, expressed as a dollar amount or a percentage of the CEO\u2019s base salary, which will be earned if the established Performance Goals are achieved.\nPerformance Goals may be specified in absolute terms, on an adjusted basis, in percentages, or in terms of growth from period to period or growth rates over time, as well as measured relative to the performance of a group of comparator companies, or a published or special index, or a stock market index. Performance Goals need not be based upon an increase or positive result under a business criterion and could include, for example, the maintenance of the status quo or the limitation of economic losses (measured, in each case, by reference to a specific business criterion). Performance measures may but need not be determinable in conformance with generally accepted accounting principles.\nPayment of annual incentives under the Bonus Plan will be made promptly following the Compensation Committee\u2019s written certification that the Performance Goals and any other material conditions were satisfied. The Compensation Committee has the right to exercise negative discretion to pay out an annual incentive to the CEO under the Bonus Plan that is less than the amount that would have been payable based solely upon application of the applicable Performance Goals. The Compensation Committee may, in its discretion, pay annual incentives to the other named executive officers.\nLong-Term Incentives:\nWhile salary and short-term incentives are primarily designed to compensate current and past performance, the primary goal of the long-term incentives, such as stock options and restricted stock awards, is to link executive officer compensation with the long-term interests of the stockholders.\nOn July 20, 2020, the Compensation Committee, in consultation with the entire Board, granted 200,000 shares of restricted stock to Mr. Raina under the 2010 Plan as incentive compensation to recognize Mr. Raina's leadership in guiding the Company, especially related to the actions taken in the face of COVID-19. The shares vest over a three-year period. The first one-third of these awards vest on July 20, 2021 and the remaining two-thirds vest in quarterly installments over the next eight quarters.\nUse of Compensation Consultants and Benchmarking\nIn June 2019, after much analysis of potential consulting firms, the Compensation Committee recommended, and the Board of Directors subsequently approved retaining Ernst & Young LLP (EY) as a compensation consultant to assist with executive compensation matters. The EY study, completed in 2020, carried out a benchmarking study and assessed the overall trends in remuneration of positions comparable to that of a CEO and Independent Directors of the Company. The study looked at the key trends in terms of compensation components and structure, while covering organizations comparable in terms of sector, size and global spread of operations. The Compensation Committee accordingly finalized the compensation levels and opportunities that the Compensation Committee believed are competitive with the marketplace and provide appropriate retention and incentive value.\nOther Compensation Components\nCompany executives are eligible to participate in the Company\u2019s health care, insurance and other welfare and employee benefit programs, which are the same for all eligible employees, including Ebix\u2019s executive officers.\nUse of Employment and Severance Agreements\nIn the past, the Compensation Committee has determined that competitive considerations merit the use of employment contracts or severance agreements for certain members of senior management. Presently, however, no member of senior management is employed under an employment contract.\nRecapture and Forfeiture Policies\nHistorically the Company has not had formal policies with respect to the adjustment or recapture of performance based awards where the financial measures on which such awards are based or to be based are adjusted for changes in reported results such as, but not limited to, instances where the Company\u2019s financial statements are restated. The Compensation Committee does not believe that repayment should be required where the Plan participant has acted in good faith and the errors are not attributable to the participant\u2019s gross negligence or willful misconduct. In such later situations, the Compensation Committee believes the Company has or will have available negotiated or legal remedies. However, the Compensation Committee may elect to take into account factors, such as the timing and amount of any financial restatement or adjustment, the amounts of benefits received, and the clarity of accounting requirements leading to any restatement in fixing of future compensation.\nDeductibility of Compensation and Related Tax Considerations\nAs one of the factors in its review of compensation matters, the Compensation Committee considers the anticipated tax treatment to the Company and to the executives of various payments and benefits.\nSection 162(m). For 2017 and earlier, Section 162(m) imposed a $1.0 million limit on the amount that a publicly traded company may deduct for compensation paid to its chief executive officer and its next three most highly compensated executives, excluding the chief financial officer. This limitation did not apply to pay that qualifies as \u201cperformance-based compensation.\u201d In order to qualify as performance-based, compensation must, among other things, be based solely on the attainment of pre-established, objective goals under a stockholder approved plan with no discretion permitted in determining award payouts. However, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act adopted in December 2017 made significant changes to Section 162(m) of the Code that impacted public companies, including our company. Starting with the 2018 fiscal year, only performance-based compensation that is paid pursuant to a binding contract in effect on November 2, 2017 is exempt from the $1,000,000 deduction limit. Accordingly, any compensation that we paid pursuant to new compensation arrangements entered into after November 2, 2017, even if performance-based, will count towards the $1,000,000 deduction limit. In addition, the $1,000,000 deduction limit applies to a broader group of executives, including the chief financial officer and any individual who serves as our chief executive officer or chief financial officer at any time after January 1, 2018, plus any executive who is among our three most highly compensated executive officers for any fiscal year beginning with 2018. While the Bonus Plan described above was intended to preserve the Company\u2019s federal income tax deduction for annual incentive payments to the CEO by meeting the requirements for \u201cqualified performance-based compensation\u201d under Section 162(m), as a result of these changes made to Section 162(m) the Bonus Plan, to the extent changed after November 2, 2017 will no longer be excluded from the $1.0 million limitation. In order to maintain flexibility in compensating executive officers in a manner designed to promote varying corporate goals, some of the compensation that we provide to our executive officers may not be deductible.\nSection 280G. Code Section 280G generally denies a deduction for a significant portion of certain compensatory payments made to corporate officers, certain stockholders and certain highly-compensated employees if the payments are contingent on a change of control of the employer and the aggregate amounts of the payments to the relevant individual exceed a specified relationship to that individual\u2019s average compensation from the employer over the preceding five years. In addition, Code Section 4999 imposes on that individual a 20% excise tax on the same portion of the payments received for which the employer is denied a deduction under Section 280G. In determining whether to approve an obligation to make payments for which Section 280G would deny the Company a deduction or whether to approve an obligation to indemnify (or \u201cgross-up\u201d) an executive against the effects of the Section 4999 excise tax, the Compensation Committee has adopted an approach similar to that described above with respect to payments which may be subject to the deduction limitations of Section 162(m).\nCompensation Committee Conclusion\nAttracting and retaining talented and motivated management and employees is essential to create long-term stockholder value. Offering a competitive, performance-based compensation program with a large equity component helps to achieve this objective by aligning the interests of the Company\u2019s CEO and other executive officers with those of stockholders. The Compensation Committee believes that Ebix\u2019s 2020 compensation program met these objectives. Likewise, based on our review, the Compensation Committee finds the total compensation (and, in the case of the severance and change-in-control scenarios, the potential payouts) to the Company\u2019s CEO and other named executive officers in the aggregate to be reasonable and not excessive.\nAmended SAR Agreement\nOn April 10, 2018, the Company entered into a Stock Appreciation Right Award Agreement with Robin Raina, the Company\u2019s Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, which was amended effective May 7, 2019.\nUpon the effective date of the original SAR Agreement, Mr. Raina received 5,953,975 stock appreciation rights with respect to the Company\u2019s common shares (the \u201cSARs\u201d). Upon an Acquisition Event, as defined in the Amended SAR Agreements, each of the SARs entitled Mr. Raina to receive a cash payment from the Company equal to the excess, if any, of the net proceeds per share received in connection with the Acquisition Event over the base price of $7.95 per share. Although the SARs were not granted under the Company\u2019s 2010 Stock Incentive Plan (the \u201cPlan\u201d), the Amended SAR Agreement incorporated certain provisions of the Plan, including the provisions requiring equitable adjustment of the number of SARs and the base price in connection with certain corporate events (including stock splits). Under the terms of the Amended SAR Agreement, Mr. Raina will be entitled to receive full payment with respect to the SARs if either he (i) were employed by the Company on the closing date of an Acquisition Event or (ii) had been involuntarily terminated by the Company without cause (as defined in the Amended SAR Agreement) within the 180-day period immediately preceding an Acquisition Event. All of the SARs would have been forfeited if Mr. Raina\u2019s employment had been terminated for any other reason prior to the closing date of an Acquisition Event. The Amended SAR agreement further provides that if an Acquisition Event occurs more than 180 days after, but not later than the tenth anniversary of, the date that Mr. Raina\u2019s employment is involuntarily terminated by the Company without Cause (as defined in the Amended SAR Agreement), 1,000,000 SARs will be deemed accrued and will be eligible to vest on the closing date of the Acquisition Event, which number will be increased by 750,000 SARs beginning on the first anniversary of the effective date of the Amended SAR Agreement and each anniversary thereafter (subject in each case to Mr. Raina\u2019s continued employment on each anniversary date), until 100% of the SARs (including any Shortfall Grants) have accrued and are eligible to vest on the closing date of an Acquisition Event that occurs more than 180 days after, but not later than the tenth anniversary of, the date that Mr. Raina\u2019s employment is involuntarily terminated by the Company without Cause; provided, however, that, (i) no additional SARs will accrue following the date that Mr. Raina\u2019s employment is involuntarily terminated by the Company without Cause, (ii) any accrued SARs will be forfeited if an Acquisition Event does not occur prior to the tenth anniversary of the date that Mr. Raina\u2019s employment is involuntarily terminated by the Company without Cause, and (iii) all of the SARs will be forfeited if Mr. Raina\u2019s employment terminates for any other reason prior to the closing date of an Acquisition Event\nIn addition, while Mr. Raina is employed by the Company and prior to an Acquisition Event, the Amended SAR Agreement provides that the Company\u2019s Board would determine annually whether a \u201cshortfall\u201d (as described below) exists as of the end of the immediately preceding fiscal year. In the event the Board determined that a shortfall existed, Mr. Raina will be granted additional SARs (or, in the Board\u2019s sole discretion, additional restricted shares or restricted stock units (each a \u201cShare Grant\u201d)) in an amount sufficient to eliminate such shortfall (each a \u201cShortfall Grant\u201d). Under the terms of the Amended SAR Agreement, a shortfall exists if the number of Mr. Raina\u2019s Shares is less than 20% of the total of (a) the number of SARs, plus (b) the number of outstanding shares reported by the Company in its audited financial statements as of the end of the immediately preceding fiscal year, minus (c) the number of shares paid, awarded or otherwise received by Mr. Raina from the Company as compensation after April 10, 2018, including any shares received as a result of Mr. Raina exercising stock options granted after April 10, 2018 or the grant or vesting of restricted stock or settlement of RSUs granted to Mr. Raina after April 10, 2018, but excluding any shares received as a result of the grant, vesting or settlement of any Share Grants. Under the terms of the Amended SAR Agreement, if the Board elects to make a Shortfall Grant in respect of such shortfall, such SARs would have been subject to the same terms and conditions as the SARs initially granted under the Amended SAR Agreement. If the Board elects to make a Share Grant in respect of such shortfall, such restricted shares or restricted stock units will have such terms and conditions as determined by the Board, but generally will follow the terms of the restricted shares or restricted stock units granted to other executives of the Company at or about the time of such Share Grant, but no Share Grant would have vested more rapidly than one-third of such Share Grant prior to the first anniversary of the grant date, with the remainder vesting in eight equal quarterly installments following the first anniversary of the grant date.\nIn connection with the Amended SAR Agreement, Mr. Raina will commit to continue to serve and not resign as the Company\u2019s Chief Executive Officer until at least May 2, 2021.\nStockholder Advisory Vote\nAt the last Annual Meeting of Stockholders, approximately 54% of the votes cast by the Ebix stockholders present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting and on the proposal were cast in support of the compensation of the Company\u2019s named executive officers, as discussed and disclosed in the proxy statement. The Board and the Compensation Committee appreciate and value the views of our stockholders.\nFuture advisory votes on executive compensation will continue to serve as an additional tool to guide the Board and the Compensation Committee in evaluating the alignment of the Company\u2019s executive compensation program with the interests of the Company and its stockholders.\nRisk Considerations\nOur Compensation Committee has reviewed risks arising from our compensation policies and practices for both our executives and non-executive employees and has determined that they are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company.\nCompensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation\nThe Company's Compensation Committee currently consists of Mr. Keller, Mr. Benz and Mr. Eckert. None of the members of the Compensation Committee have ever been officers or employees of the Company. No interlocking relationship exists between the members of the Company's Board of Directors or Compensation Committee and the Board of Directors or Compensation Committee of any other company.\n.\nCompensation Committee Report\nThe Compensation Committee has reviewed and discussed with the Company\u2019s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer the above Compensation Disclosure and Analysis. Based on such review and discussion, the Compensation Committee recommended to the Board that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in this Form 10-K.\nThis report has been submitted by the Compensation Committee:\nHans U.

As mentioned previously, no member of senior management other than Mr. Raina has an employment or severance agreement. Except as described below for Mr. Raina, upon a termination or change of control, each of the executive officers will receive only the unpaid portion of their salary and benefits through the date of termination. No severance payments, acceleration of equity vesting, or other special payments will be due to such executive officers, regardless of the circumstances of the termination.\nPursuant to the Amended SAR Agreement, Mr. Raina received 5,953,975 stock appreciation rights with respect to the Company\u2019s common shares (the \u201cSARs\u201d). Upon an Acquisition Event, each of the SARs entitles Mr. Raina to receive a cash payment from the Company equal to the excess, if any, of the net proceeds per share received in connection with an Acquisition Event over the base price of $7.95. Mr. Raina will only be entitled to receive a payment with respect to the SARs if he is employed by the Company at the time of an Acquisition Event or was terminated by the Company without cause within the 180-day period immediately preceding an Acquisition Event.\nAnnually, while Mr. Raina is employed by the Company and prior to an Acquisition Event, the Board shall determine whether a \u201cshortfall\u201d (as defined in the April SAR Agreement) existed as of the end of the immediately preceding fiscal year. In the event the Board determines that a shortfall existed, Mr. Raina will be granted additional SARs (or, in the Board\u2019s sole discretion, restricted shares or restricted stock units (each a \u201cShare Grant\u201d)) in an amount sufficient to eliminate such shortfall (each a \u201cShortfall Grant\u201d). A \u201cshortfall\u201d will exist if the number of Mr. Raina\u2019s shares is less than 20% of the total of (a) the number of SARs, plus (b) the number of outstanding shares reported by the Company in its audited financial statements as of the end of the immediately preceding fiscal year, minus (c) the number of shares paid, awarded or otherwise received by Mr. Raina from the Company as compensation after April 10, 2018, including any shares received as a result of Mr. Raina exercising stock options granted after April 10, 2018 or the grant or vesting of restricted stock or settlement of RSUs granted to Mr. Raina after April 10, 2018, but excluding any shares received as a result of the grant, vesting or settlement of any Share Grants.\nNo Shortfall Grant was made for 2020. As a result, in the event that an Acquisition Event had occurred on December 31, 2020, and assuming that the Company received Net Proceeds of $37.97 per share (the closing price of the Company\u2019s common stock on December 31, 2020), Mr. Raina would have received a $178.7 million payment upon the Acquisition Event.\nPay Ratio Disclosure\nOn August 5, 2015, the SEC adopted new rules implementing the pay ratio disclosure requirement of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (Dodd-Frank Act). These rules require reporting companies to disclose the ratio of the annual compensation of the company's median employee to the annual compensation of its principal executive officer.\nThe 2020 annual total compensation of our CEO Mr. Raina was $7,960,000, which includes the total value of restricted stock grants issued in 2020. The 2020 annual total compensation of our median compensated employee for all global locations was $4,398, and the ratio of those amounts is 1810 to 1. The 2020 annual total compensation of our median compensated U.S. employee was $84,886 and the ratio of those amounts is 94 to 1. For purposes of identifying the median compensated employee, we took into account salary, bonus, and fair market value of the restricted stock grants on the grant date during the year for all our employees as of December 31, 2020. We annualized this compensation for employees who did not work the entire year, except for employees designated as seasonal or temporary.\nThere is a lot of flexibility in how the median employees are identified. Companies are using different approaches that are appropriate for their employee population and compensation programs and are using estimates and assumptions. As a result, the ratio that other companies have calculated may not be comparable to the ratio that we have presented not only because of different businesses or different compensation programs, but because of using different methodologies and assumptions.\nDirector Compensation\nOn December 17, 2020, the Board granted the six non-employee directors options to purchase 6,000 shares of common stock of which one-fourth will vest on December 17, 2021, and the remaining options will vest ratably each quarter in the years 2022, 2023 and 2024. In addition each non-employee director received an annual cash retainer of $25,000 during 2020. Mr. Keller received an additional cash retainer of $16,000 for serving as the Compensation Committee Chairman and $8,000 for serving on the Audit Committee. Mr. Benz received an additional cash retainer of $8,000 for serving on the Audit Committee and $8,000 for serving on the Compensation Committee.

Under such\nrules, a director is independent if he or she does not have a material relationship with the Company. Our Board annually evaluates each member\u2019s independent status.\nThe Board has determined that, as of January 1 2020, the following seven of the Company\u2019s directors are independent under the Nasdaq Marketplace Rules: Messrs. Benz, Bhalla, Eckert, Hebard, Herter, and Keller. Mr. Raina, as a management director, participates in the Board\u2019s activities and provides valuable insight and advice.\nNon-management directors have access to individual members of management or to other employees of the Company on a confidential basis.
