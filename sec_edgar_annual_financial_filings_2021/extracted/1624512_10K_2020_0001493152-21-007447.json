In the United States, which represents approximately 40% of our business, we are benefitting from the substantial government investments from the CAREs Act and anticipate the level of demand for our products to increase substantially further with the passing of President Biden\u2019s $2.2 trillion stimulus package. To a lesser extent we are seeing similar government stimulus funds drive demand in other parts of Europe.\nThe K-12 education sector represents one of the largest industry segments. In the US sector is comprised of approximately 15,600 public school districts across the 50 states and 132,000 public and private elementary and secondary schools. In addition to its size, the U.S. K-12 education market is highly decentralized and is characterized by complex content adoption processes. We believe this market structure underscores the importance of scale and industry relationships and the need for broad, diverse coverage across states, districts and schools. Even while we believe certain initiatives in the education sector, such as the Common Core State Standards, a set of shared math and literacy standards benchmarked to international standards, have increased standardization in K-12 education content, we believe significant state standard specific customization still exists, and we believe the need to address customization provides an ongoing need for companies in the sector to maintain relationships with individual state and district policymakers and expertise in state-varying academic standards.\nAccording to \u201cAll Global Market Education & Learning\u201d, an industry publication, the market for hardware products is growing due to increases in the use of interactive whiteboards and simulation-based learning hardware. Educational institutions have become more receptive to the implementation of high-tech learning tools. The advent of technology in the classroom has enabled multi-modal training and varying curricula. In general, technology-based tools help develop student performance when integrated with the curriculum. The constant progression of technology in education has helped educators to create classroom experiences that are interactive, developed and collaborative.\nOur Opportunity\nWe believe that our Connected Classroom\u2122 solution uniquely positions Boxlight to be the leading provider of EdTech products within our categories in the global education technology market. Our holistic solution of hardware, software, content and professional development improves learning progression by increasing student engagement and timely interventions. Coupled with our innovations: we have a strong brand, operations and supply-chain; our channel into the US and EMEA is very strong and the global market is growing year-on-year; and a global 24/7 technical and customer services team retains a very high satisfaction rating.\nGlobally it is widely acknowledged that long-term economic growth is closely correlated to investment in education and educational technology, thus sustaining long-term growth in the market, even during periods of economic downturn. Further details of our solution and favorable macro-economic analysis are set forth below:\nGrowth in U.S. K-12 Market Expenditures\nSignificant resources are being devoted to primary and secondary education, both in the United States and abroad. As set forth in the Executive Office of the President, Council of Economic Advisers report, U.S. education expenditure has been estimated at approximately $1.3 trillion (~6% of U.S. GDP), with K-12 education accounting for close to half ($625 billion) of this spending. Global spending is roughly triple U.S. spending for K-12 education.\nThe market for K-12 services and technology has historically grown above the pace of inflation, averaging 7.2% growth annually since 1969. Deviations around this mean occur during periods of economic growth and recession causing peaks and troughs in the K-12 market, albeit below other sectors.\nJustifying HolonIQ market analysis states that Global EdTech Venture Capital has been $32 billion in the last decade (approximately 33% within the US) and predicts nearly triple that investment through to 2030. Following that the global \u201cexpenditure on education and training from governments, parents, individuals and corporates continues to grow to historic levels and is expected to reach USD$10T by 2030\u201d.\nFuturesource, in 2019, stated: \u201cForecast [for US Interactive Display Market] for the next four years is expected to be strong, averaging 13% growth per year. The transition to IFPDs will contribute to the market almost doubling in value over five years to $1.6B in 2023.\u201d\nIncreasing Focus on Accountability and the Quality of Student Education\nU.S. K-12 education has come under significant political scrutiny in recent years, with findings that American students rank far behind other global leaders in international tests of literacy, math and science, with the resulting conclusion that the current state of U.S. education severely impairs the United States\u2019 economic, military and diplomatic security as well as broader components of America\u2019s global leadership.\nTrends in Tech-Savvy Education\nWhile industries from manufacturing to health care have adopted technology to improve their results, according to Stanford Business School, in its Trends in Tech-Savvy Education, the education field remains heavily reliant on \u201cchalk and talk\u201d instruction conducted in traditional settings; however, that is changing as schools and colleges adopt virtual classrooms, data analysis, online games, highly customized coursework, and other cutting-edge tools to help students learn.\nNew Technologies\nThe delivery of digital education content is also driving a substantial shift in the education market. In addition to whiteboards, interactive projectors and interactive flat panels, other technologies are being adapted for educational uses on the Internet, mobile devices and through cloud-computing, which permits the sharing of digital files and programs among multiple computers or other devices at the same time through a virtual network. We intend to be a leader in the development and implementation of these additional technologies to create effective digital learning environments.\nGrowth in the E-learning Market\nAccording to the \u201cE-learning Market - Global Outlook and Forecast 2020-2025\u201d The e-learning market is expected to display significant growth opportunities in the next five years. While the growth curve is uniform in terms of the number of users, the same is not the case by revenues; the average cost of content creation and delivery with the same is undergoing a consistent decline. However, the advent of cloud infrastructure, peer-to-peer problem solving, open content creation, and rapid expansion of the target audience has enabled e-learning providers to rein in economies of choice and offer course content at a competitive price. While the growth prospects of the e-learning market remain stable, the rise of efficient sub-segments is changing the learning and training landscape gradually.\nVendors are also focusing on offering choices on the course content at competitive prices to gain the share in the global e-learning market. The exponential growth in the number of smartphone users and internet connectivity across emerging markets is driving the e-learning market in these regions. The introduction of cloud-based learning and AR/VR mobile-based learning is likely to revolutionize the e-learning market during the forecast period.\nMajor vendors are introducing technology-enabled tools that can facilitate user engagement, motivate learners, and help in collaborations, thereby increasing the market share and attracting new consumers to the market. The growing popularity of blended learning that enhances the efficiency of learners will drive the growth of the e-learning market. The e-learning market is expected to generate revenue of $65.41 billion by 2023, growing at a CAGR of 7.07% during the forecast period.\nNatural User Interfaces (NUIs)\nTablets and the new class of \u201csmart TVs\u201d are part of a growing list of other devices built with natural user interfaces that accept input in the form of taps, swipes, and other ways of touching; hand and arm motions; body movement; and increasingly, natural language. Natural user interfaces allow users to engage in virtual activities with movements similar to what they would use in the real world, manipulating content intuitively. The idea of being able to have a completely natural interaction with a device is not new, but neither has its full potential been realized. For example, medical students increasingly rely on simulators employing natural user interfaces to practice precise manipulations, such as catheter insertions, that would be far less productive if they had to try to simulate sensitive movements with a mouse and keyboard. NUIs make devices seem easier to use and more accessible, and interactions are far more intuitive, which promotes exploration and engagement. (NMC Horizon Project Technology Outlook STEM+ Education 2012-2017).\nOur Portfolio\nWe currently offer products within the following categories:\n\u25cf Front-of-Class Display (Mimio and Clevertouch Brands)\n\u25cf Classroom Audio\n\u25cf STEM\n\u25cf Educational Software & Content (Mimio Connect, Lynx Whiteboard, Oktopus, Mimio Studio)\n\u25cf Peripherals and Accessories\n\u25cf Professional Development\nBoxlight Connected Classroom are permutations of these products coming together to create a holistic integrated solution centered around the teacher and learners within and outside the confines of the physical room.\nFront-of-Class Display Category\nBoxlight offers a choice of Interactive Front Panel Displays (IFPD), Interactive Whiteboards (IWB), Interactive Projectors and Non-Interactive Projectors.

Unlike many competitive products, Boxlight\u2019s touch boards are suited for use with dry erase markers. Many competitive products advise against using dry erase markers because their boards stain. Boxlight\u2019s touch boards use a porcelain-on-steel surface for durability and dry erase compatibility. The Boxlight Touch Boards are also much lighter weight than most competitive products which results in faster, easier and a lower cost installation process.\nNon-Interactive Projectors\nWe distribute a full line of standard, non-interactive projectors. The Cambridge Series features embedded wireless display functions and is available in short and standard throw options. Offering brightness from 2,700 to 4,000 lumens, we furnish projectors for small classrooms to large classrooms with the Cambridge platform. This series is available in both XGA and WXGA resolutions to replace projectors on existing interactive whiteboards in classrooms operating on limited budgets. The Company has designed this platform to provide easy user maintenance with side-changing lamps and filters and developed HEPA filtration systems for harsh environments.\nOver the past several years, working together with strategic allies, we have provided customized products that fit specific needs of customers, such as the Israeli Ministry of Defense. Working with Nextel Systems, the Company delivered approximately 4,000 projectors, with special kitting performance, asset tagging, custom start up screens, operating defaults appropriate for harsh environments, and other unique product specifications. The Company also met requirements that each projector contain at least 51% U.S. content and be assembled in the United States. A service center was appointed in Israel to provide warranty service and support. The US Army in connection with the Israeli Defense Forces found the Company to be the only manufacturer able to meet the stringent requirements, leading not only to the original multi-year contract, but to extensions for favorable execution and performance.\nClassroom Audio Category\nNot every classroom is acoustically efficient and not every child has normal hearing. However, learning is noticeably enhanced when each child receives clear, intelligible instruction throughout the day, regardless of class size, background noise, seat location, or if the child has a mild hearing loss. Audio systems are becoming standard for new construction and refurbishment projects, and the federal government passed the Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA) and provides funding support for such solutions. For this reason, Boxlight has launched this new category and the debut product is MimioClarity.\nMimioClarity\u2122\nMimioClarity is a premium offering that distributes audio around the classroom and integrates with the front-of-class display. The system is designed to improve learning outcomes by reducing noise, increasing word recognition and improving student engagement. It has a combined 60W amplifier and microphone receiver, comes both a teacher and student microphone, with an option of a two or four speaker-system. Consistent with other Boxlight offerings the focus has been to keep the user experience as simple as possible and the costs of implementation and ownership as low as possible.\nSTEM Category\nThrough the acquisitions of Modern Robotics, Robo3D and MyStemKits, Boxlight has added to its portfolio a growing category of STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) products.\nMimio MyBot\nThe Mimio MyBot system bridges the gap between learning about robotics in the classroom and the application of robotics in the real world. Our intuitive and accessible system helps students develop core skills in programming, engineering, and robotics. We provide a system to facilitate learning and ignite a passion in students with the freedom and flexibility to build, code, and test new and unique models. Mimio MyBot allows students to explore and learn freely while removing common obstacles such as requiring network infrastructure changes or expensive workstations.\nRobo3D\nRobo E3, Robo E3 Pro (Coming Soon) and Robo C2 are smart, safe, and simple 3D printers that come with access to over 300+ lessons of 3D printable STEM curriculum, replacement materials and accessories.\nMyStemKits\nMyStemKits offers hundreds of standards-driven lesson plans for grades K-12 math and science teachers. High-quality lessons plans are developed and studied by The Florida Center for Research in Science. Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (FCR-STEM), which is part of one of the nation\u2019s oldest and most productive university-based education research organizations.\nMimioView document camera\nBoxlight\u2019s MimioView 350Uis a 4K document camera that is integrated with MimioStudio to make the combination easy to use with a single cable connection that carries power, video, and control. MimioView 350U is fully integrated into our MimioStudio software solution and is controlled through MimioStudio\u2019s applications menu. With two clicks, the teacher or user can turn on, auto-focus, and illuminate the included LED lights for smooth high-definition images.\nEducational Software Category\nBoxlight\u2019s suite of software is a combination of titles from acquisitions of Mimio and Qwizdom, both were leading brands in the IWB and Formative Assessment Software Categories, and since then capabilities have been built upon that IP since. The premise of our software is to:\n\u25cf Provide the \u201cglue\u201d that integrates the hardware to provide a Connected Classroom.\n\u25cf Help educators inform their decisions in the classroom, through more systematic data about their students\u2019 performance and behaviors.\n\u25cf Help make learning be more engaging, interactive, accessible and innovative.\n\u25cf Help teachers be more efficient in planning, preparation, reporting and analysis, and effective in instruction and assessment.\nMimioStudio Interactive Instructional Software\nMimioStudio Interactive Instructional Software enables the creation, editing, and presentation of interactive instructional lessons and activities. These lessons and activities can be presented and managed from the front of the classroom using any of Boxlight\u2019s front of classroom display systems including MimioTeach + our non-interactive projectors, ProColor Interactive LED panels, MimioBoard Touch + our non-interactive projectors, MimioFrame + our non-interactive projectors or ProjectoWrite \u201cP\u201d Series interactive projectors in either pen or touch controlled versions. MimioStudio can also be operated using MimioPad as a full-featured remote control or a mobile device such as an iPad or tablet which includes a display screen that fully replicates the front-of-classroom display generated by MimioStudio. Operation with a mobile device is enabled via the three-user license for MimioMobile, provided with the MimioStudio license that accompanies all front-of-classroom devices from Mimio.\nMimioMobile Collaboration and Assessment Application\nThe introduction of MimioMobile, a software accessory for MimioStudio, in 2014 introduced a new era of fully interactive student activities that are directly and immediately able to be displayed on the front-of-classroom interactive displays through MimioStudio.\nMimioMobile allows fully interactive activities to be pushed to student classroom devices. The students can manipulate objects within the activities, annotate \u201con top\u201d of them, and even create completely new content on their own handheld devices. MimioMobile also enables assessment using the mobile devices. The teacher can create multiple choice, true\\false, yes\\no, and text entry assessment questions. The students can respond at their own speed and their answers are stored within MimioStudio from which the teacher can display graphs showing student results. This \u201ccontinuous assessment\u201d allows formative assessment that can help guide the teacher as to whether to re-teach the material if understanding is low or move forward in the lesson. We believe that this interactive and student dependent instructional model can dramatically enhance student outcomes.\nOktopus Instructional and Whiteboarding Software\nDesigned specifically for touch-enabled devices, Oktopus Interactive Instructional Software enables the creation, editing, and presentation of interactive instructional lessons and activities. More than 70 interactive widgets, tools, and classroom game modes make it simple and fun to run ad-hoc or pre-planned sessions. Similar to MimioStudio, these lessons and activities can be presented and managed from the front of the classroom using any of Boxlight\u2019s front of classroom display systems.\nNotes+ Collaboration and Assessment Application\nNotes+ is a software accessory for use with Oktopus Software or a PPT plugin that allows students to view and interact with the teacher presentation during a live class session. Students can answer questions, annotate, request help, and share content with the main display from nearly any mobile device or laptop. Question types supported include multiple choice, multiple-mark, yes/no, true/false, sequencing, numeric, and text response.\nGameZones Multi-student Interactive Gaming Software\nGameZones allows up to four students to work simultaneously on a touch screen or tablet to complete interactive \u2018game style\u2019 activities. The solution is extremely simple and easy to use and includes over 150 educational activities.\nMimioInteract Multi-student Interactive Gaming Software\nMimioInteract allows up to four students to work simultaneously on a touch screen or tablet to complete interactive \u2018game style\u2019 activities. The solution includes over 200 educational activities and allows teachers to create or modify activities through the software.\nPeripherals and Accessories\nWe offer a line of peripherals and accessories, including amplified speaker systems, mobile carts, installation accessories and adjustable wall-mount accessories that complement our entire line of interactive projectors, interactive LED flat panels and standard projectors.\nMimioVote Student Assessment System\nBoxlight\u2019s MimioVote is a handheld \u201cclicker\u201d that enables student assessment with essentially zero training. MimioVote is so simple it genuinely qualifies as intuitive, an elusive and often proclaimed attribute that is actually merited by MimioVote. MimioVote fully integrates into the MimioMobile environment and offers everything from attendance to fully immersive and on-the-fly student assessment. The MimioVote was specifically designed to survive the rigors of even kindergarten and elementary classrooms where being dropped, stepped on, and kicked are all part of a normal day. The handset\u2019s non-slip coating helps keep it from sliding off desktops or out of little hands. Should they take \u201cflight\u201d, Mimio Vote\u2019s rugged construction keeps each handset working.\nMimioPad wireless pen tablet\nMimioPad is a lightweight, rechargeable, wireless tablet used as a remote control for the MimioStudio running on a teacher\u2019s Windows, Mac, or Linux computer. MimioPad enables the teacher to roam the classroom which significantly aids classroom management. MimioPad is a classroom management tool which can be handed off to enable a student to be part of the interactive experience - all without leaving their seat to go to the front of the room.\nBoxlight-EOS Professional Development\nBoxlight strives to provide the best tools to help teachers improve student outcomes. Through our subsidiary, EOS Education, we can extend our commitment to schools and districts by providing a rich portfolio of classroom training, professional development, and educator certification.\nWe provide engaging, differentiated professional development for teachers to ensure that every student does benefit from the technology tools available in their classrooms and schools. Programs can be customized, building comfort and confidence using the specific hardware and software platforms available to each teacher.\nEOS is unique because:\n\u25cf Teacher-centric: We help teachers use the technology they have access to for their specific instructional purposes-we go beyond just point and click.\n\u25cf Hands-on: Teachers have an opportunity to practice new technical skills during sessions.\n\u25cf Differentiated: Adjusted to current skills, knowledge, and teachers\u2019 in-classroom practices.\n\u25cf Job-embedded: Grounded in day-to-day teaching to be relevant, engaging, and practical to implement.\n\u25cf Student context: Introducing technology tools to students and how to engage them with purpose.\nIntegration Strategy\nWe have centralized our business management for all acquisitions through an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system which offers streamlined subsidiary integration utilizing a multi-currency platform. We have strengthened and refined the process to drive front-line sales forecasting to factory production. Through the ERP system, we have synchronized five separate accounting and customer relationship management systems through a cloud-based interface to improve inter-company information sharing and allow management of the Company to have immediate access to snapshots of the performance of each of our subsidiaries in a common currency. As we grow, organically or through acquisition, we plan to quickly integrate each subsidiary or division into the Company to allow for clearer and earlier visibility of performance to enable for timely and effective business decisions.\nLogistics; Suppliers\nLogistics is currently provided in the US by our Lawrenceville, Georgia facility and internationally by the Sahara team in London. Together these teams manage and multiple third-party logistics partners throughout the world (3PL\u2019s). These 3PL partners allow Boxlight to provide affordable freight routes and shorter delivery times to our customers by providing on-hand inventory in localized markets. Contract manufacturing for Boxlight products is through original design manufacturer (ODM) and original equipment manufacturer (OEM) partners according to Boxlight\u2019s specific engineering specifications and utilizing IP developed and owned by Boxlight. Boxlight\u2019s factories for ODM and OEM are located in the USA, Taiwan, China, and Germany.\nTechnical Support and Service\nThe Company currently has its core technical support and service centers located near Seattle, WA, Boston, MA, Atlanta, GA, London, England, and Belfast, Northern Ireland. Additionally, the Company\u2019s technical support division is responsible for the repair and management of customer service cases, resulting in more than 60% of the Company\u2019s customer service calls ending in immediate closure of the applicable service case. We accomplish this as a result of the familiarity between our products and having specialized customer service technicians hired internally and with key partners in certain international markets.\nSales and Marketing\nOur sales force consists of 45 account managers in EMEA including a head of sales, 18 regional account managers in the US including a head of sales, one in Latin America, and a new role for head of corporate sales in the US. Our marketing team consists of one Vice President of Marketing Communications, one Marketing Coordinators, one Education Specialist, and one Graphic Designer). Our sales force and marketing teams primarily drive sales of all Boxlight products throughout North, Central and South America, Europe, the Middle East and Asia. In addition, we go to market through an indirect channel distribution model and utilize traditional value-added resellers and support them with training to become knowledgeable about the products we sell. We currently have approximately 800 resellers.\nWe believe Boxlight offers the most comprehensive product portfolio in today\u2019s education technology industry, along with best-in-class service and technical support. Boxlight\u2019s award-winning, interactive classroom technology and easy to use line of classroom hardware and software solutions provide schools and districts with the most complete line of progressive, integrated classroom technologies available worldwide.\nCompetition\nThe interactive education industry is highly competitive and characterized by frequent product introductions and rapid technological advances that have substantially increased the capabilities and use of interactive projectors and interactive whiteboards. Interactive whiteboards, since first introduced, have evolved from a high-cost technology that involves multiple components, requiring professional installers, to a one-piece technology that is available at increasingly reduced-price points and affords simple installations. With lowered technology entry barriers, we face heated competition from other interactive whiteboard developers, manufacturers and distributors. We compete with other developers, manufacturers and distributors of interactive projectors and personal computer technologies, tablets, television screens, smart phones, such as Smart Technologies, Promethean, ViewSonic, Dell Computers, Samsung, Panasonic and ClearTouch.\nEven with these competitors, the market presents new opportunities in responding to demands to replace outdated and failing interactive whiteboards with more affordable and simpler solution interactive whiteboards. Our ability to integrate our technologies and remain innovative and develop new technologies desired by our current and potential new contract manufacturing customers will determine our ability to grow our contract manufacturing divisions. In addition, we have begun to see expansion in the market to sales of complementary products that work in conjunction with the interactive technology, including software, audio solutions, data capture and tablets.\nEmployees\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had the following distribution of employees:\nOperations\nSales & Marketing\nAdministration\nTotal\nNone of our employees are represented by labor organizations. We consider our relationship with our employees to be excellent. A majority of our employees have entered into non-disclosure and non-competition agreements with us or our operating subsidiaries.",
    "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nAn investment in our securities involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider all of the risks described below, together with the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our financial statements and related notes, before making a decision to invest in our securities. If any of the following events occur, our business, financial condition and operating results may be materially adversely affected. In that event, the trading price of our securities could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nSummary Risk Factors\nSome of the factors that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u25cf our inability to predict or anticipate the duration or adapt to the long-term economic and business consequences of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u25cf our ability to continue to attract and retain customers;\n\u25cf our ability to sell additional products and services to customers;\n\u25cf our ability to raise funds in a timely fashion and successfully manage cash flow needs and financing plans;\n\u25cf our ability to successfully maintain a competitive position in our industry and market;\n\u25cf our ability to manage our business and sell our products within a changing and evolving industry environment;\n\u25cf our ability to locate and leverage potential growth opportunities;\n\u25cf our ability to achieve expected technological advances by us or by third parties and our ability to leverage them;\n\u25cf our ability to fully and successfully integrate our business acquisitions into the Boxlight\u2019s existing business and platform;\n\u25cf the effects of future regulation; and\n\u25cf our ability to protect and monetize our intellectual property.\nCOVID-19 Risks\nCircumstances related to the ongoing COVID-19 Pandemic are increasingly unpredictable and could adversely affect our business operations and the market for our products.\nWar, terrorism, other acts of violence or natural or man-made disasters, including a global pandemic, may affect the markets in which the Company operates, the Company\u2019s customers, the Company\u2019s delivery of products and customer service, and could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, or financial conditions.\nThe Company\u2019s business may be adversely affected by instability, disruption or destruction in a geographic region in which it operates, regardless of cause, including war, terrorism, riot, civil insurrection or social unrest, and natural or man-made disasters, including famine, food, fire, earthquake, storm or pandemic events and spread of disease (including the recent outbreak of the coronavirus commonly referred to as \u201cCOVID-19\u201d). Such events may cause customers to suspend their decisions on using the Company\u2019s products and services, make it impossible to attend or sponsor trade shows or other conferences in which our products and services are presented to customers and potential customers, cause restrictions, postponements and cancellations of events that attract large crowds and public gatherings such as trade shows at which we have historically presented our products, and give rise to sudden significant changes in regional and global economic conditions and cycles that could interfere with purchases of goods or services, commitments to develop new products. These events also pose significant risks to the Company\u2019s personnel and to physical facilities, transportation and operations, which could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial results.\nAs a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, there is a risk related to modification of the traditional classroom setting that may result in reduced demand for our classroom solutions, including reduced demand for our interactive displays due to extended or indefinite distance and digital learning.\nThere is also a risk of reduced borrowing with our factoring and purchase order financing facilities, as well as risk of inability to raise additional capital.\nEducation markets in the U.S., and around the world, are being negatively affected by COVID-19, as state and local governments are finding themselves increasingly short on funding, which could result in a significantly depressed market for our products.\nThe U.S. has experienced a substantial economic downturn, with unemployment reaching numbers not seen since the Great Depression. While this present economic downturn occurred as a direct result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and the resulting shelter-in-place guidelines set in place by state and local governments, we do not yet know how severe or long lasting the present economic downturn will be. At present, the budgets of many state and local governments, including budgets for local schools and school districts to whom we market our products, are likely to be severely impacted as funds that may have been earmarked for educational resources are moved to cover budget shortfalls to meet the increased healthcare costs and those of first responders. Governmental authorities have taken significant measures to provide economic assistance to individual households and businesses, stabilize the markets, and support economic growth. The success of these measures is unknown, and they may not be sufficient to fully mitigate the negative impact of the pandemic or its effect on the market for our goods and services.\nRisks Related to Our Business, Operations and Financial Condition\nWe generate a substantial portion of our revenue from the sale of our display products, and any significant reduction in sales of these products would materially harm our business.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, we generated approximately 88.1% of our revenue from sales of our interactive display products, consisting of projectors, interactive projectors and interactive flat panels. A decrease in demand for our interactive displays would significantly reduce our revenue. If any of our competitors introduces attractive alternatives to our interactive displays, we could experience a significant decrease in sales as customers migrate to those alternative products.\nOur business is subject to seasonal fluctuations, which may cause our operating results to fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter and adversely affect our working capital and liquidity throughout the year.\nOur revenues and operating results normally fluctuate as a result of seasonal variations in our business, driven largely by the purchasing cycles of the educational market. Traditionally, the bulk of expenditures by school districts occur in the second and third calendar quarters after receipt of budget allocations. We expect quarterly fluctuations in our revenues and operating results to continue. These fluctuations could result in volatility and adversely affect our cash flow. As our business grows, these seasonal fluctuations may become more pronounced. As a result, we believe that sequential quarterly comparisons of our financial results may not provide an accurate assessment of our financial position.\nOur working capital requirements and cash flows are subject to fluctuation, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition.\nOur working capital requirements and cash flows have historically been, and are expected to continue to be, subject to quarterly and yearly fluctuations, depending on a number of factors. Factors which could result in cash flow fluctuations include:\n\u25cf the level of sales and the related margins on those sales;\n\u25cf the collection of receivables;\n\u25cf the timing and size of purchases of inventory and related components; and\n\u25cf the timing of payment on payables and accrued liabilities.\nIf we are unable to manage fluctuations in cash flow, our business, operating results and financial condition may be materially adversely affected. For example, we may be unable to make required interest payments on our indebtedness.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry.\nWe are engaged in the interactive education industry. We face substantial competition from developers, manufacturers and distributors of interactive learning products and solutions, including interactive projectors, interactive whiteboards and micro-computer data logging products and any new product we may offer in the future. The industry is highly competitive and characterized by frequent product introductions and rapid technological advances that have substantially increased the capabilities and use of interactive projectors, interactive whiteboards, and micro-computer-based logging technologies and combinations of them. We face increased competition from companies with strong positions in certain markets we serve, and in new markets and regions we may enter. These companies manufacture and/or distribute new, disruptive or substitute products that compete for the pool of available funds that previously could have been spent on interactive displays and associated products.\nMany of these competitors have, and our potential competitors may have, significantly greater financial and other resources than we do and have spent, and may continue to spend, significant amounts of resources to try to enter or expand their presence in the market. In addition, low-cost competitors have appeared in China and other countries. We may not be able to compete effectively against these current and future competitors. Increased competition or other competitive pressures have and may continue to result in price reductions, reduced margins or loss of market share, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nSome of our customers are required to purchase equipment by soliciting proposals from several sources and, in some cases, are required to purchase from the lowest bidder. While we attempt to price our products competitively, based upon the relative features they offer, our competitors\u2019 prices and other factors, we are often not the lowest bidder and, in such cases, may lose sales.\nCompetitors may be able to respond to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements more effectively and faster than we can or devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of products than we can. Current and potential competitors may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties, including through mergers or acquisitions, to increase the ability of their products to address the needs of customers. If these interactive display competitors or other substitute or alternative technology competitors acquire significantly increased market share, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIf we are unable to continually enhance our products and to develop, introduce and sell new technologies and products at competitive prices and in a timely manner, our business will be harmed.\nThe market for interactive learning and collaboration solutions is still emerging and evolving. It is characterized by rapid technological change and frequent new product introductions, many of which may compete with, be considered as alternatives to or replace our interactive displays. For example, we have recently observed significant sales of tablet computers by competitors to school districts in the U.S. whose technology budgets could otherwise have been used to purchase interactive displays. Accordingly, our future success will depend upon our ability to enhance our products and to develop, introduce and sell new technologies and products offering enhanced performance and functionality at competitive prices and in a timely manner.\nThe development of new technologies and products involves time, substantial costs and risks. Our ability to successfully develop new technologies will depend in large measure on our ability to maintain a technically skilled research and development staff and to adapt to technological changes and advances in the industry. The success of new product introductions depends on a number of factors, including timely and successful product development, market acceptance, the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, the availability of components in appropriate quantities and costs to meet anticipated demand, the risk that new products may have quality or other defects and our ability to manage distribution and production issues related to new product introductions. If we are unsuccessful in selling the new products that we develop and introduce, or any future products that we may develop, we may carry obsolete inventory and have reduced available working capital for the development of other new technologies and products.\nIf we are unable, for any reason, to enhance, develop, introduce and sell new products in a timely manner, or at all, in response to changing market conditions or customer requirements or otherwise, our business will be harmed.\nWe may not be successful in our strategy to increase sales in the business and government market.\nThe majority of our revenue has been derived from sales to the education market. Our business strategy contemplates expanding our sales in both the education market, as well as to the business and government training sectors. However, to date, there has not been widespread adoption of interactive displays and collaboration solutions in the business and government market, and these solutions may fail to achieve wide acceptance in this market. Successful expansion into the business and government markets will require us to augment and develop new distribution and reseller relationships, and we may not be successful in developing those relationships. In addition, widespread acceptance of our interactive solutions may not occur due to lack of familiarity with how our products work, the perception that our products are difficult to use and a lack of appreciation of the contribution they can make in the business and government markets. In addition, the Boxlight brands are less recognized in these markets as compared to the education market. A key part of our strategy to grow in the business and government market is to develop strategic alliances with companies in the unified communications and collaboration sector, and there can be no assurance that these alliances will help us to successfully grow our sales in this market.\nFurthermore, our ability to successfully grow in the business and government market depends upon revenue and cash flows derived from sales to the education market. As the education market represents a significant portion of our revenue and cash flow, we utilize cash from sales in the education market for our operating expenses. If we cannot continue to augment and develop new distributor and reseller relationships, market our brand, develop strategic alliances and innovate new technologies, we may not be successful in our strategy to grow in the business and government market.\nAs a result of market saturation, our future sales of interactive displays in developed markets may slow or decrease.\nAs a result of the high levels of penetration in developed markets, the education market for interactive displays in the U.S., U.K. and Australia may have reached saturation levels. Future sales growth in those markets and other developed markets with similar penetration levels may, as a result, be difficult to achieve, and our sales of interactive displays may decline in those countries. If we are unable to replace the revenue and earnings, we have historically derived from sales of interactive displays to the education market in these developed markets, whether through sales of additional products, sales in other underserved markets, such as Africa, Latin America and Asia, sales in the business and government market or otherwise, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nWe face significant challenges growing our sales in foreign markets.\nFor our products to gain broad acceptance in all markets, we may need to develop customized solutions specifically designed for each country in which we seek to grow our sales and to sell those solutions at prices that are competitive in that country. For example, while our hardware requires only minimal modification to be usable in other countries, our software and content require significant customization and modification to adapt to the needs of foreign customers. Specifically, our software will need to be adapted to work in a user-friendly way in several languages and alphabets, and content that fits the specific needs of foreign customers (such as, for example, classroom lessons adapted to specific foreign curricula) will need to be developed. If we are not able to develop, or choose not to support, customized products and solutions for use in a particular country, we may be unable to compete successfully in that country and our sales growth in that country will be adversely affected. We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully develop or choose to support customized solutions for each foreign country in which we seek to grow our sales or that our solutions, if developed, will be competitive in the relevant country.\nGrowth in many foreign countries will require us to price our products competitively in those countries. In certain developing countries, we have been and may continue to be required to sell our products at prices significantly below those that we are currently charging in developed countries. Such pricing pressures could reduce our gross margins and adversely affect our revenue.\nOur customers\u2019 experience with our products will be directly affected by the availability and quality of our customers\u2019 Internet access. We are unable to control broadband penetration rates, and, to the extent that broadband growth in emerging markets slows, our growth in international markets could be hindered.\nIn addition, we will face lengthy and unpredictable sales cycles in foreign markets, particularly in countries with centralized decision making. In these countries, particularly in connection with significant technology product purchases, we have experienced recurrent requests for proposals, significant delays in the decision-making process and, in some cases, indefinite deferrals of purchases or cancellations of requests for proposals. If we are unable to overcome these challenges, the growth of our sales in these markets would be adversely affected, and we may incur unrecovered marketing costs, impairing our profitability.\nOur suppliers may not be able to always supply components or products to us on a timely basis and on favorable terms, and as a result, our dependency on third party suppliers has adversely affected our revenue and may continue to do so.\nWe do not manufacture any of the products we sell and distribute and, therefore, rely on our suppliers for all products and components and depend on obtaining adequate supplies of quality components on a timely basis with favorable terms. Some of those components, as well as certain complete products that we sell are provided to us by only one key supplier or contract manufacturer. We are subject to disruptions in our operations if our sole or limited supply contract manufacturers decrease or stop production of components and products, or if such suppliers and contract manufacturers do not produce components and products of sufficient quantity. Alternative sources for our components are not always available. Many of our products and components are manufactured overseas, so they have long lead times, and events such as local disruptions, natural disasters or political conflict may cause unexpected interruptions to the supply of our products or components. In addition, we do not have written supply agreements with our suppliers. Although we are endeavoring to enter into written agreements with certain of all of our suppliers, we cannot assure that our efforts will be successful. Furthermore, due to the impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic the company may experience material adverse impacts on its supply chain.\nWe rely on highly skilled personnel, and, if we are unable to attract, retain or motivate qualified personnel, we may not be able to operate our business effectively.\nOur success depends in large part on continued employment of senior management and key personnel who can effectively operate our business, as well as our ability to attract and retain skilled employees. Competition for highly skilled management, technical, research and development and other employees is intense in the high-technology industry and we may not be able to attract or retain highly qualified personnel in the future. In making employment decisions, particularly in the high-technology industry, job candidates often consider the value of the equity awards they would receive in connection with their employment. Our long-term incentive programs may not be attractive enough or perform sufficiently to attract or retain qualified personnel.\nIf any of our employees leaves us, and we fail to effectively manage a transition to new personnel, or if we fail to attract and retain qualified and experienced professionals on acceptable terms, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur success also depends on our having highly trained financial, technical, recruiting, sales and marketing personnel. We will need to continue to hire additional personnel as our business grows. A shortage in the number of people with these skills or our failure to attract them to our company could impede our ability to increase revenues from our existing products and services, ensure full compliance with federal and state regulations, or launch new product offerings and would have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nWe may have difficulty in entering into and maintaining strategic alliances with third parties.\nWe have entered into and we may continue to enter into strategic alliances with third parties to gain access to new and innovative technologies and markets. These parties are often large, established companies. Negotiating and performing under these arrangements involves significant time and expense, and we may not have sufficient resources to devote to our strategic alliances, particularly those with companies that have significantly greater financial and other resources than we do. The anticipated benefits of these arrangements may never materialize and performing under these arrangements may adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe use resellers and distributors to promote and sell our products.\nSubstantially all our sales are made through resellers and distributors. Industry and economic conditions have the potential to weaken the financial position of our resellers and distributors. Such resellers and distributors may no longer sell our products, or may reduce efforts to sell our products, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, if our resellers and distributors\u2019 abilities to repay their credit obligations were to deteriorate and result in the write-down or write-off of such receivables, it would negatively affect our operating results and, if significant, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, our resellers and most of our distributors are not contractually required to sell our products exclusively and may offer competing interactive display products, and therefore we depend on our ability to establish and develop new relationships and to build on existing relationships with resellers and distributors. We cannot assure that our resellers and distributors will act in a manner that will promote the success of our products. Factors that are largely within the control of those resellers and distributors but are important to the success of our products include:\n\u25cf the degree to which our resellers and distributors actively promote our products;\n\u25cf the extent to which our resellers and distributors offer and promote competitive products; and\n\u25cf the quality of installation, training and other support services offered by our resellers and distributors.\nIn addition, if some of our competitors offer their products to resellers and distributors on more favorable terms or have more products available to meet their needs, there may be pressure on us to reduce the price of our products, or those resellers and distributors may stop carrying our products or de-emphasize the sale of our products in favor of the products of these competitors. If we do not maintain and continue to build relationships with resellers and distributors our business will be harmed.\nRisks Related to our Industry and Regulations.\nDecreases in, or stagnation of, spending or changes in the spending policies or budget priorities for government funding of schools, colleges, universities, other education providers or government agencies may have a material adverse effect on our revenue.\nOur customers include primary and secondary schools, colleges, universities, other education providers and, to a lesser extent, government agencies, each of which depends heavily on government funding. The effects and duration of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, which has resulted in worldwide disruptions in supply chains and economic recession, are as yet unknown. We anticipate that the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting economic recession could cause a substantial disruption in, decrease or stagnation of, spending and budget priorities for government funding of schools, colleges, universities and other education providers and government agencies. The economy had only recently experienced a similar disruption from the worldwide recession of 2008 and subsequent sovereign debt and global financial crisis, which resulted in substantial declines in the revenues and fiscal capacity of many national, federal, state, provincial and local governments. Like in the 2008 financial crisis, where many of those governments have reacted to the decreases in revenues by cutting funding to educational institutions, we anticipate that governments and governmental entities will react similarly to the economic crisis and resulting decreases in revenue caused by the COVID-19 pandemic by cutting funding to educational institutions. If our products are not a high priority expenditure for such institutions, or if such institutions allocate expenditures to substitute alternative technologies, we could lose revenue.\nAny additional decrease in, stagnation of or adverse change in national, federal, state, provincial or local funding for primary and secondary schools, colleges, universities, or other education providers or for government agencies that use our products could cause our current and prospective customers to further reduce their purchases of our products, which could cause us to lose additional revenue. In addition, a specific reduction in governmental funding support for products such as ours could also cause us to lose revenue.\nIf our products fail to comply with consumer product or environmental laws, it could materially affect our financial performance.\nBecause we sell products used by children in classrooms and because our products are subject to environmental regulations in some jurisdictions in which we conduct business and sell our products, we are and will be required to comply with a variety of product safety, product testing and environmental regulations, including compliance with applicable laws and standards with respect to lead content and other child safety and environmental issues. If our products do not meet applicable safety or regulatory standards, we could experience lost sales, diverted resources and increased costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Events that give rise to actual, potential or perceived product safety or environmental concerns could expose us to government enforcement action or private litigation and result in product recalls and other liabilities. In addition, negative consumer perceptions regarding the safety of our products could cause negative publicity and harm our reputation.\nRisks Related to our Foreign Operations.\nWe are subject to risks inherent in foreign operations.\nSales outside the US represented 64% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020. We have committed, and may continue to commit, significant resources to our international operations and sales and marketing activities.\nWe are subject to several risks associated with international business activities that may increase costs, lengthen sales cycles and require significant management attention. International operations carry certain risks and associated costs, such as the complexities and expense of administering a business abroad, complications in compliance with, and unexpected changes in regulatory requirements, foreign laws, international import and export legislation, trading and investment policies, exchange controls, tariffs and other trade barriers, difficulties in collecting accounts receivable, potential adverse tax consequences, uncertainties of laws, difficulties in protecting, maintaining or enforcing intellectual property rights, difficulty in managing a geographically dispersed workforce in compliance with diverse local laws and customs, and other factors, depending upon the country involved. Moreover, local laws and customs in many countries differ significantly and compliance with the laws of multiple jurisdictions can be complex, difficult and costly. We cannot assure that risks inherent in our foreign operations will not have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe must comply with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.\nWe are required to comply with the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which prohibits U.S. companies from engaging in bribery of or other prohibited payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business and requires that we maintain adequate financial records and internal controls to prevent such prohibited payments. Our international operations are managed by the Sahara team who are required to comply with the UK Bribery Act 2010 which goes further than current US legislation where the Bribery Act is not limited to foreign officials but also includes customers and includes all form of inducement and incentives; the same standard is expected of all our Sahara employees of other European countries where similar legislation is in force under EU-Law Corruption, extortion, bribery, pay-offs, theft and other fraudulent practices may occur in countries where we do business. If our competitors engage in these practices, they may receive preferential treatment from personnel of some companies, giving our competitors an advantage in securing business or from government officials who might give them priority in obtaining new business, which would put us at a disadvantage. If our employees or other agents are found to have engaged in such practices, we could suffer severe penalties.\nOur worldwide operations will subject us to income taxation in many jurisdictions, and we must exercise significant judgment to determine our worldwide financial provision for income taxes. That determination ultimately is an estimate, and, accordingly, we cannot assure that our historical income tax provisions and accruals will be adequate.\nWe are subject to income taxation in the United States and numerous other jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, we cannot assure you that the final determination of any tax audits and litigation will not be materially different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. Should additional taxes be assessed against us as a result of an audit or litigation, there could be a material adverse effect on our current and future results and financial condition.\nCertain of our subsidiaries provide products to and may from time to time undertake certain significant transactions with, us and our other subsidiaries in different jurisdictions. In general, cross border transactions between related parties and, in particular, related party financing transactions, are subject to close review by tax authorities. Moreover, several jurisdictions in which we operate have tax laws with detailed transfer pricing rules that require all transactions with nonresident related parties to be priced using arm\u2019s-length pricing principles and require the existence of contemporaneous documentation to support such pricing. A tax authority in one or more jurisdictions could challenge the validity of our related party transfer pricing policies. If in the future any taxation authorities are successful in challenging our financing or transfer pricing policies, our income tax expense may be adversely affected and we could become subject to interest and penalty charges, which may harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\nIf we are unable to ship and transport components and final products efficiently and economically across long distances and borders our business would be harmed.\nWe transport significant volumes of components and finished products across long distances and international borders. Any increases in our transportation costs, as a result of increases in the price of oil or otherwise, would increase our costs and the final prices of our products to our customers. In addition, any increases in customs or tariffs, as a result of changes to existing trade agreements between countries or otherwise, could increase our costs or the final cost of our products to our customers or decrease our margins. Such increases could harm our competitive position and could have a material adverse effect on our business. The laws governing customs and tariffs in many countries are complex and often include substantial penalties for non-compliance. Disputes may arise and could subject us to material liabilities and have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIf our procedures to ensure compliance with export control laws are ineffective, our business could be harmed.\nOur extensive foreign operations and sales are subject to far reaching and complex export control laws and regulations in the United States and elsewhere. Violations of those laws and regulations could have material negative consequences for us including large fines, criminal sanctions, prohibitions on participating in certain transactions and government contracts, sanctions on other companies if they continue to do business with us and adverse publicity.\nWe will be exposed to fluctuations in foreign currencies that may materially adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. Sahara Holdings Ltd. consolidates results using the British pound (with principal functional currencies in British pound, Euro and U.S. dollar) and Boxlight Latin America uses the Mexican Peso as functional currency to report revenue and expenses. As a result, we will be exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations when we translate the financial statements of the of our group companies into U.S. dollars in consolidation. If there is a change in foreign currency exchange rates, the translation of the of any of the group companies financial statements into U.S. dollars will lead to a translation gain or loss which is recorded as a component of other comprehensive income. In addition, we may have certain monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the relevant entity\u2019s functional currency. To the extent the U.S. dollar strengthens or weakens against the certain foreign currencies then the translation of foreign currency denominated transactions will result in a change to reported revenue, operating expenses and net income for subsidiary operations. We have not entered into agreements or purchased instruments to hedge our exchange rate risks, although we may do so in the future. The availability and effectiveness of any hedging transaction may be limited, and we may not be able to successfully hedge fully our exchange rate risks.\nWe monitor our foreign exchange exposures, and these activities mitigate, but do not eliminate, our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations. As a result, exchange rate fluctuations may materially adversely affect our operating results in future periods.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property and Technology\nDefects in our products can be difficult to detect before shipment. If defects occur, they could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur products are highly complex and sophisticated and, from time to time, have contained and may continue to contain design defects or software \u201cbugs\u201d or failures that are difficult to detect and correct in advance of shipping.\nThe occurrence of errors and defects in our products could result in loss of, or delay in, market acceptance of our products, including harm to our brand. Correcting such errors and failures in our products could require significant expenditure of capital by us. In addition, we are rapidly developing and introducing new products, and new products may have higher rates of errors and defects than our established products. The Boxlight Group has historically provided product warranties between one and five years, and the failure of our products to operate as described could give rise to warranty claims. The consequences of such errors, failures and other defects and claims could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and our reputation.\nWe may not be able to obtain patents or other intellectual property rights necessary to protect our proprietary technology and business.\nOur commercial success depends to a significant degree upon our ability to develop new or improved technologies and products, and to obtain patents or other intellectual property rights or statutory protection for these technologies and products in the United States and other countries. We will seek to patent concepts, components, processes, designs and methods, and other inventions and technologies that we consider have commercial value or that will likely give us a technological advantage. Boxlight own rights in patents and patent applications for technologies relating to interactive displays and other complementary products in the United States and other countries such as Germany, Mexico, Israel, Japan, Taiwan and China. Despite devoting resources to the research and development of proprietary technology, we may not be able to develop technology that is patentable or protectable. Patents may not be issued in connection with pending patent applications, and claims allowed may not be sufficient to allow them to use the inventions that they create exclusively. Furthermore, any patents issued could be challenged, re-examined, held invalid or unenforceable or circumvented and may not provide sufficient protection or a competitive advantage. In addition, despite efforts to protect and maintain patents, competitors and other third parties may be able to design around their patents or develop products similar to our products that are not within the scope of their patents. Finally, patents provide certain statutory protection only for a limited period of time that varies depending on the jurisdiction and type of patent. The statutory protection term of certain of our material patents may expire soon and, thereafter, the underlying technology of such patents can be used by any third-party including competitors.\nProsecution and protection of the rights sought in patent applications and patents can be costly and uncertain, often involve complex legal and factual issues and consume significant time and resources. In addition, the breadth of claims allowed in our patents, their enforceability and our ability to protect and maintain them cannot be predicted with any certainty. The laws of certain countries may not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Even if our patents are held to be valid and enforceable in a certain jurisdiction, any legal proceedings that we may initiate against third parties to enforce such patents will likely be expensive, take significant time and divert management\u2019s attention from other business matters. We cannot assure that any of the issued patents or pending patent applications will provide any protectable, maintainable or enforceable rights or competitive advantages to us.\nIn addition to patents, we will rely on a combination of copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets and other related laws and confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect, maintain and enforce our proprietary technology and intellectual property rights in the United States, the United Kingdom, Mexico, Australia, Malaysia, Canada, Turkey Sweden, Finland, Germany, Holland, and China. However, our ability to protect our brands by registering certain trademarks may be limited. In addition, while we will generally enter into confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements with our employees, consultants, contract manufacturers, distributors and resellers and with others to attempt to limit access to and distribution of our proprietary and confidential information, it is possible that:\n\u25cf misappropriation of our proprietary and confidential information, including technology, will nevertheless occur;\n\u25cf our confidentiality agreements will not be honored or may be rendered unenforceable;\n\u25cf third parties will independently develop equivalent, superior or competitive technology or products;\n\u25cf disputes will arise with our current or future strategic licensees, customers or others concerning the ownership, validity, enforceability, use, patentability or registrability of intellectual property; or\n\u25cf unauthorized disclosure of our know-how, trade secrets or other proprietary or confidential information will occur.\nWe cannot assure that we will be successful in protecting, maintaining or enforcing our intellectual property rights. If we are unsuccessful in protecting, maintaining or enforcing our intellectual property rights, then our business, operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected, which could:\n\u25cf adversely affect our relationships with current or future distributors and resellers of our products;\n\u25cf adversely affect our reputation with customers;\n\u25cf be time-consuming and expensive to evaluate and defend;\n\u25cf cause product shipment delays or stoppages;\n\u25cf divert management\u2019s attention and resources;\n\u25cf subject us to significant liabilities and damages;\n\u25cf require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements; or\n\u25cf require us to cease certain activities, including the sale of products.\nIf it is determined that we have infringed, violated or are infringing or violating a patent or other intellectual property right of any other person or if we are found liable in respect of any other related claim, then, in addition to being liable for potentially substantial damages, we may be prohibited from developing, using, distributing, selling or commercializing certain of our technologies and products unless we obtain a license from the holder of the patent or other intellectual property right. We cannot assure that we will be able to obtain any such license on a timely basis or on commercially favorable terms, or that any such licenses will be available, or that workarounds will be feasible and cost-efficient. If we do not obtain such a license or find a cost-efficient workaround, our business, operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected, and we could be required to cease related business operations in some markets and restructure our business to focus on our continuing operations in other markets.\nOur business may suffer if it is alleged or determined that our technology or another aspect of our business infringes the intellectual property of others.\nThe markets in which we will compete are characterized by the existence of many patents and trade secrets and also by litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. Moreover, in recent years, individuals and groups have purchased patents and other intellectual property assets for the purpose of making claims of infringement to extract settlements from companies like ours. Also, third parties may make infringement claims against us that relate to technology developed and owned by one of our suppliers for which our suppliers may or may not indemnify us. Even if we are indemnified against such costs, the indemnifying party may be unable to uphold its contractual obligations and determining the extent such of such obligations could require additional litigation. Claims of intellectual property infringement against us or our suppliers might require us to redesign our products, enter into costly settlements or license agreements, pay costly damage awards or face a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting us from marketing or selling our products or services. If we cannot or do not license the infringed intellectual property on reasonable terms or at all, or substitute similar intellectual property from another source, our revenue and operating results could be adversely impacted. Additionally, our customers and distributors may not purchase our offerings if they are concerned that they may infringe third party intellectual property rights. Responding to such claims, regardless of their merit, can be time consuming, costly to defend in litigation, divert management\u2019s attention and resources, damage our reputation and cause us to incur significant expenses. The occurrence of any of these events may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nIf we are unable to anticipate consumer preferences and successfully develop attractive products, we might not be able to maintain or increase our revenue or achieve profitability.\nOur success depends on our ability to identify and originate product trends as well as to anticipate and react to changing demands and preferences of customers in a timely manner. If we are unable to introduce new products or technologies in a timely manner or our new products or technologies are not accepted by our customers, our competitors may introduce more attractive products which would adversely impact our competitive position. Failure to respond in a timely manner to changing consumer preferences could lead to, among other things, lower revenues and excess inventory positions of outdated products.\nWe may be unable to keep pace with changes in technology as our business and market strategy evolves.\nWe will need to respond to technological advances and emerging industry standards in a cost-effective and timely manner in order to remain competitive. The need to respond to technological changes may require us to make substantial, unanticipated expenditures. There can be no assurance that we will be able to respond successfully to technological change.\nRisks Related to Our Class A Common Stock\nFuture sales of our Class A common stock could adversely affect our share price, and any additional capital raised by us through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities may dilute your ownership in us and may adversely affect the market price of our Class A common stock.\nWe believe that our existing working capital, expected cash flow from operations and other available cash resources will enable us to meet our working capital requirements for at least the next 12 months. However, the development and marketing of new products and the expansion of distribution channels require a significant commitment of resources. From time to time, we may seek additional equity or debt financing to finance working capital requirements, continue our expansion, develop new products or make acquisitions or other investments. In addition, if our business plans change, general economic, financial or political conditions in our industry change, or other circumstances arise that have a material effect on our cash flow, the anticipated cash needs of our business, as well as our conclusions as to the adequacy of our available sources of capital, could change significantly. Any of these events or circumstances could result in significant additional funding needs, requiring us to raise additional capital. If additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity shares, preferred shares or debt securities, the terms of such securities could impose restrictions on our operations and would reduce the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders. If financing is not available on satisfactory terms, or at all, we may be unable to expand our business or to develop new business at the rate desired and our results of operations may suffer.\nThe market price of our Class A common stock may be volatile, which could cause the value of our common stock to fluctuate and possibly decline significantly.\nThe market price of our Class A common stock may be highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations. Our financial performance, government regulatory action, tax laws and market conditions in general, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and its resulting impact on the economy at large, could have a significant impact on the future market price of our Class A common stock. Some of the factors that could negatively affect our share price or result in fluctuations in the price of our common stock include:\n\u25cf our operating and financial performance and prospects;\n\u25cf our quarterly or annual earnings or those of other companies in our industry;\n\u25cf the public\u2019s reaction to our press releases, our other public announcements and our filings with the SEC;\n\u25cf changes in, or failure to meet, earnings estimates or recommendations by research analysts who track our Class A common stock or the stock of other companies in our industry;\n\u25cf the failure of analysts to cover our Class A common stock;\n\u25cf strategic actions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions or restructurings;\n\u25cf announcements by us, our competitors or our vendors of significant contracts, acquisitions, joint marketing relationships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n\u25cf new laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business;\n\u25cf changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles;\n\u25cf announcements by third parties or governmental entities of significant claims or proceedings against us;\n\u25cf new laws and governmental regulations, or other regulatory developments, applicable to our industry;\n\u25cf changes in general conditions in the United States and global economies or financial markets, including both social and economic conditions resulting from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, war, incidents of terrorism or responses to such events;\n\u25cf changes in government spending levels on education;\n\u25cf changes in key personnel;\n\u25cf sales of common stock by us, members of our management team or our stockholders;\n\u25cf the granting or exercise of employee stock options or other equity awards;\n\u25cf the volume of trading in our Class A common stock; and\n\u25cf the realization of any risks described in this section under the caption \u201cRisk Factors.\u201d\nFurthermore, the stock market has recently experienced extreme volatility that, in some cases, has been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our Class A common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance.\nIn the past, following periods of market volatility, stockholders have instituted securities class action litigation. If we were involved in securities litigation, it could have a substantial cost and divert resources and the attention of executive management from our business regardless of the outcome of such litigation.\nOur Articles of Incorporation, Bylaws and Nevada law may have anti-takeover effects.\nOur Articles of Incorporation authorizes the issuance of common stock and preferred stock. Each share of Class A common stock entitles the holder to one vote on all matters to be voted upon by stockholders, and the Class B common stock has no vote, except as required by law. In addition, our board of directors (\u201cBoard\u201d) has the authority to issue additional shares of preferred stock and to determine the price, rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of those shares without any further vote or action by the stockholders. The rights of the holders of common stock will be subject to, and may be adversely affected by, the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future. The ability of our Board to issue additional shares of preferred stock could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our voting stock. Other provisions of our Bylaws also may have the effect of discouraging, delaying or preventing a merger, tender offer or proxy contest, which could have an adverse effect on the market price of our Class A common stock.\nIn addition, certain provisions of Nevada law applicable to our company could also delay or make more difficult a merger, tender offer or proxy contest involving our company, including Sections 78.411 through 78.444 of the Nevada Revised Statutes, which prohibit a Nevada corporation from engaging in any business combination with any \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d (as defined in the statute) for a period of two years unless certain conditions are met. In addition, our senior management is entitled to certain payments upon a change in control and certain of the stock options and restricted shares we have granted provide for the acceleration of vesting in the event of a change in control of our company.\nAffiliates of Everest Display, Inc. hold a significant percentage of our Class A common stock, and their interests may not align with the interests of our other stockholders.\nK Laser and other stockholders and affiliates of Everest Display, Inc., a Taiwan corporation (\u201cEDI\u201d) owned approximately 10.0% of our issued and outstanding Class A common stock as of December 31, 2020. The sale of all or any meaningful portion of the shares owned by such stockholders could have a material adverse effect on the future market price of our Class A common stock.\nThis significant concentration of share ownership may adversely affect the trading price of our Class A common stock because investors often perceive a disadvantage in owning shares in a company with one or several controlling stockholders. This concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our company which could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their shares as part of a sale of our company and might reduce the price of our Class A common stock. Furthermore, our directors and officers, as a group, have the ability to significantly influence or control the outcome of all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions, such as mergers, consolidations or the sale of substantially all of our assets. Although our directors owe fiduciary duties to us and our shareholders, including the duties of loyalty, our directors that serve as directors, officers, partners or employees of companies that we do business with also owe fiduciary duties or other obligations to such other companies or to the investors in their funds. The duties owed to us could conflict with the duties such directors owe to these other companies or investors.\nWe have no intention of declaring dividends in the foreseeable future.\nThe decision to pay cash dividends on our Class A common stock rests with our Board and will depend on our earnings, unencumbered cash, capital requirements and financial condition. We do not anticipate declaring any dividends in the foreseeable future, as we intend to use any excess cash to fund our operations. Investors in our Class A common stock should not expect to receive dividend income on their investment, and investors will be dependent on the appreciation of our Class A common stock to earn a return on their investment.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about us, or if they adversely change their recommendations regarding our Class A common stock, then our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our Class A common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us, our industry and our market. If no analyst elects to cover us and publish research or reports about us, the market for our Class A common stock could be severely limited and our stock price could be adversely affected. In addition, if one or more analysts ceases coverage of us or fails to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline. If one or more analysts who elect to cover us adversely change their recommendations regarding our Class A common stock, our stock price could decline.\nWe may be exposed to risks relating to evaluations of controls required by Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.\nPursuant to Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, our management is required to report on, and our independent registered public accounting firm is required to attest to, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Although we prepare our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, our internal accounting controls may not meet all standards applicable to companies with publicly traded securities. If we fail to implement any required improvements to our disclosure controls and procedures, we may be obligated to report control deficiencies and our independent registered public accounting firm may not be able to certify the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting. In either case, we could become subject to regulatory sanction or investigation. Further, these outcomes could damage investor confidence in the accuracy and reliability of our financial statements.\nIf our internal controls and accounting processes are insufficient, we may not detect in a timely manner misstatements that could occur in our financial statements in amounts that could be material.\nAs a public company, we have to devote substantial efforts to the reporting obligations and internal controls required of a public company, which result in substantial costs. A failure to properly meet these obligations could cause investors to lose confidence in us and have a negative impact on the market price of our shares. We devote significant resources to the documentation, testing and continued improvement of our operational and financial systems for the foreseeable future. These improvements and efforts with respect to our accounting processes that we continue to make may not be sufficient to ensure that we maintain adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future. Any failure to implement required, new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation, could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations in the United States or result in misstatements in our financial statements in amounts that could be material. Insufficient internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our shares and may expose us to litigation risk.\nAs a public company, we are required to document and test our internal control procedures to satisfy the requirements of Section 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley, which requires annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. During the course of our testing, we may identify deficiencies which we may not be able to remediate in time to meet our deadline for compliance with Section 404. We may not be able to conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404. If we are unable to conclude that we have effective internal control over financial reporting, then investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our shares.\nFor as long as we are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d we will not be required to comply with certain reporting requirements, including those relating to accounting standards and disclosure about our executive compensation, that apply to some other public companies.\nAs an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d under the JOBS Act, we are permitted to, and intend to, rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements. We are an emerging growth company until the earliest of:\n\u25cf the last day of the fiscal year during which we have total annual gross revenues of $1 billion or more;\n\u25cf the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of following our initial public offering in 2017;\n\u25cf the date on which we have, during the previous 3-year period, issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt; or\n\u25cf the date on which we are deemed a \u201clarge accelerated filer\u201d as defined under the federal securities laws.\nFor so long as we remain an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d we will not be required to:\n\u25cf have an auditor report on our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002;\n\u25cf comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor\u2019s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements (auditor discussion and analysis);\n\u25cf submit certain executive compensation matters to shareholders advisory votes pursuant to the \u201csay on frequency\u201d and \u201csay on pay\u201d provisions (requiring a non-binding shareholder vote to approve compensation of certain executive officers) and the \u201csay on golden parachute\u201d provisions (requiring a non-binding shareholder vote to approve golden parachute arrangements for certain executive officers in connection with mergers and certain other business combinations) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010; and\n\u25cf include detailed compensation discussion and analysis in our filings under the Exchange Act and instead may provide a reduced level of disclosure concerning executive compensation.\nIn addition, the JOBS Act provides that an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d can take advantage of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. We have elected to take advantage of the extended transition period, which allows us to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards until those standards apply to private companies. As a result of this election, our financial statements may not be comparable to public companies that comply with new or revised accounting standards.\nBecause of these exemptions, some investors may find our Class A common stock less attractive, which may result in a less active trading market for our Class A common stock, and our stock price may be more volatile.\nWe may not be able to maintain a listing of our Class A common stock on Nasdaq.\nBecause our Class A common stock is listed on Nasdaq, we must meet certain financial and liquidity criteria to maintain such listing. If we violate or fail to meet any Nasdaq listing requirements, our Class A common stock may be delisted. In addition, our Board may determine that the cost of maintaining our listing on a national securities exchange outweighs the benefits of such listing. A delisting of our Class A common stock from Nasdaq may materially impair our stockholders\u2019 ability to buy and sell our Class A common stock and could have an adverse effect on the market price of, and the efficiency of the trading market for, our Class A common stock. In the event our stock is delisted from Nasdaq, whether by choice or otherwise, the delisting of our Class A common stock could significantly impair our ability to raise capital and stockholder value.",

We currently design, produce and distribute interactive projectors and distribute interactive technologies, including flat panels, projectors, whiteboards and peripherals to the education market. We also distribute science, technology, engineering and math (or \u201cSTEM\u201d) products, including a portable science lab. All of our products are integrated into our classroom software suite that provides tools for whole class learning, assessment and collaboration.\nTo date, we have generated substantially all of our revenue from the sale of our software and interactive displays to the K-12 U.S. educational market.\nWe have also implemented a comprehensive plan to reach profitability both from our core business operations and as a result of making strategic business acquisitions. We have already started to implement this strategy as set forth below. Highlights of our plan include:\n\u25cf Integrating products of the acquired companies and cross training our sales reps to increase their offerings. The combination of products and cross training has already resulted in increased sales. The synergy we have found between the products of Boxlight and Mimio are adding opportunities to resellers for both companies to increase their sales.\n\u25cf Hiring new sales representatives with significant education technology sales experience in their respective territories and our current pipeline has reached a record high level.\n\u25cf Seeking to increase demand in the US market for technology sales and have the products and infrastructure in place to handle our expected growth.\nRecent Acquisitions\nEffective September 24, 2020, the Company acquired Sahara Presentation Systems PLC, a leader in distributed and manufactured AV solutions. Headquartered in the United Kingdom, Sahara is a leader in distributed AV products and a manufacturer of multi-award-winning touchscreens and digital signage products, including the globally renowned Clevertouch and Sedao brands. In consideration for the acquisition, the Company paid to the shareholders of Sahara a total purchase price of GBP 74.0 million (approximately USD $94.9 million) in the form of GBP 52.0 million (approximately USD $66.7 million) in cash and GBP 22.0 million (approximately USD $28.2 million) in our Series B convertible preferred stock and our Series C convertible preferred stock.\nOn March 24, 2021 we entered into a share redemption and conversion agreement with the former Sahara shareholders who own approximately 96% of our Series B and Series C preferred stock. Under the agreement, we agreed to redeem and purchase from such preferred stockholders on or before June 30, 2021 all of the shares of Series B preferred stock for \u00a311.5 million being the stated or liquidation value of the Series B preferred stock plus (b) accrued dividends from January 1, 2021 to the date of purchase. In addition, the holders of 96% of the Series C preferred stock agreed to convert those shares into 7.6 million shares of our Class A Common Stock at a conversion price of $1.66 per share. In the event for any reason, we do not complete the conversion and redemption by June 30, 2021, and the Sahara shareholders do not agree to an extension, the agreement will terminate without liability by any party.\nEffective April 17, 2020, the Company acquired the assets, and assumed certain liabilities of MyStemKits and STEM Education Holdings, Pty, an Australian corporation (\u201cSTEM\u201d), the largest online collection of K-12 STEM curriculum for 3D printing.\nEffective March 12, 2019, the Company entered into an asset purchase agreement with Modern Robotics Inc. (MRI), based in Miami, Florida. MRI is engaged in the business of developing, selling and distributing science, technology, engineering and math (STEM), robotics and programming solutions to the global education market.\nOn August 31, 2018, we purchased 100% of the membership interest equity of EOS, an Arizona limited liability company owned by Daniel and Aleksandra Leis. EOS is in the business of providing technology consulting, training, and professional development services to create sustainable programs that integrate technology with curriculum in K-12 schools and districts.\nEffective June 22, 2018, and pursuant to a stock purchase agreement, the Company Parent acquired 100% of the capital stock of the Qwizdom Companies. The Qwizdom Companies develop software and hardware solutions that are quick to implement and designed to increase participation, provide immediate data feedback, and, most importantly, accelerate and improve comprehension and learning. The Qwizdom Companies have offices outside Seattle, WA and Belfast, Northern Ireland and deliver products in 44 languages to customers around the world through a network of partners. Over the last three years, over 80,000 licenses have been distributed for the Qwizdom Companies\u2019 interactive whiteboard software and online solutions.\nEffective May 9, 2018, and pursuant to a stock purchase agreement, the Company acquired 100% of the capital stock of Cohuba based in Lancashire, England. Cohuba produces, sells and distributes interactive display panels designed to provide new learning and working experiences through high-quality technologies and solutions through in-room and room-to-room multi-devices multi-user collaboration.\nOur Acquisition Strategy and Challenges\nOur growth strategy includes acquiring assets and technologies of companies that have products, technologies, industry specializations or geographic coverage that extend or complement our existing business. The process to undertake a potential acquisition is time-consuming and costly. We expect to expend significant resources to undertake business, financial and legal due diligence on our potential acquisition targets, and there is no guarantee that we will complete any acquisition that we pursue.\nWe believe we can achieve significant cost-savings by merging the operations of the companies we acquire and after their acquisition leverage the opportunity to reduce costs through the following methods:\n\u25cf Staff reductions - consolidating resources, such as accounting, marketing and human resources.\n\u25cf Economies of scale - improved purchasing power with a greater ability to negotiate prices with suppliers.\n\u25cf Improved market reach and industry visibility - increase in customer base and entry into new markets.\nAs a result, we believe that an analysis of the historical costs and expenses of our Target Sellers (a company that is the subject of an attempted acquisition) prior to their acquisition will not provide guidance as to the anticipated results after acquisition. We anticipate that we will be able to achieve significant reductions in our costs of revenue and selling, general and administrative expenses from the levels currently incurred by the Target Sellers operating independently, thereby increasing our EBITDA and cash flows.\nComponents of our Results of Operations and Financial Condition\nRevenue\nOur revenue is comprised of product revenue, software revenue, installation revenue and professional development revenue.\n\u25cf Product and Software revenues. Product and software revenues are derived from the sale of our interactive projectors, flat panels, peripherals and accessories, along with other third-party products, directly to our customers, as well as through our network of domestic and international distributors.\n\u25cf Installation revenue. We receive revenue from installation services that we outsource to third parties.\n\u25cf Professional development revenue. We receive revenue from providing professional development services through third parties and our network of distributors.\nCost of revenue\nOur cost of revenue is comprised of the following:\n\u25cf third-party logistics costs;\n\u25cf costs to purchase components and finished goods directly;\n\u25cf inbound and outbound freight costs and duties;\n\u25cf costs associated with the repair of products under warranty;\n\u25cf write-downs of inventory carrying value to adjust for excess and obsolete inventory and periodic physical inventory counts;\n\u25cf cost of professionals to deliver the professional development training; and\n\u25cf customs expense.\nWe outsource some of our warehouse operations and order fulfillment and we purchase products from related entities and third parties. Our product costs vary directly with volume and based on the costs of underlying product components as well as the prices we negotiate with our contract manufacturers. Shipping costs fluctuate with volume as well as with the method of shipping chosen in order to meet customer demand. As a global company with suppliers centered in Asia and customers located worldwide, we have used, and may in the future use, air shipping to deliver our products directly to our customers. Air shipping is more costly than sea or ground shipping or other delivery options. We primarily use air shipping to meet the demand of our products during peak seasons and new product launches. The Company did not experience material delays in shipping during 2020 that materially negatively impacted our revenues.\nGross profit and gross profit margin\nOur gross profit and gross profit margin have been, and may in the future be, influenced by several factors including: product, channel and geographical revenue mix; changes in product costs related to the release of projector models; component, contract manufacturing and supplier pricing and foreign currency exchange. As we primarily procure our product components and manufacture our products in Asia, our suppliers incur many costs, including labor costs, in other currencies. To the extent that exchange rates move unfavorably for our suppliers, they may seek to pass these additional costs on to us, which could have a material impact on our future average selling prices and unit costs. Gross profit and gross profit margin may fluctuate over time based on the factors described above.\nOperating expenses\nWe classify our operating expenses into two categories: research and development and general and administrative.\nResearch and development. Research and development expense consists primarily of personnel related costs, prototype and sample costs, design costs and global product certifications mostly for wireless certifications.\nGeneral and administrative. General and administrative expense consists of personnel related costs, which include salaries, as well as the costs of professional services, such as accounting and legal, facilities, information technology, depreciation and amortization and other administrative expenses. General and administrative expense may fluctuate as a percentage of revenue, notably in the second and third quarters of our fiscal year when we have historically experienced our highest levels of revenue.\nOther income (expense), net\nOther income (expense), net primarily consists of interest expense associated with our debt financing arrangements, gains (losses) on the settlements of debt and trade payable obligations exchanged for common shares, and the effects of changes in the fair value of derivative liabilities.\nIncome tax expense\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States, United Kingdom, Mexico, Sweden, Finland, Holland, and Germany where we do business. The United Kingdom, Mexico, Sweden, Finland, Holland, and Germany have a statutory tax rate different from that in the United States. Additionally, certain of our international earnings are also taxable in the United States. Accordingly, our effective tax rates will vary depending on the relative proportion of foreign to U.S. income, the absorption of foreign tax credits, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities and changes in tax laws. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from the examination of our tax returns by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, and other tax authorities to determine the adequacy of our income tax reserves and expense. Should actual events or results differ from our current expectations, charges or credits to our income tax expense may become necessary. Any such adjustments could have a significant impact on our results of operations.\nOperating Results - Boxlight Corporation\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nRevenues. Total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $54.9 million as compared to $33.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, resulting in a 66% increase. Revenues consist of product revenue, software revenue, product installation and professional development. The increase in revenues was primarily a result of the acquisition of Sahara Presentation Systems in September 2020 and increased demand for our solutions in both the U.S. and Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (together \u201cEMEA\u201d).\nCost of Revenues. Cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $45.0 million as compared to $24.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, resulting in an 87% increase. Cost of revenues consists primarily of product cost, freight expenses, customs expense and inventory adjustments. The decrease in cost of revenues decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in cost of goods related to hardware sales of $5 million directly related to the decrease in sales volume. The decrease was partially offset by an increase of $0.5 million in customs expense.\nGross Profit. Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $9.9 million as compared to $8.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The Gross Profit Margin decreased from 27% in 2019 to 18% in 2020. The gross margin decrease was driven by the effects of certain Sahara purchase accounting adjustments of $5.1 million. The resulting normalized gross profit rate for the for the year ended December 31, 2020, was 27%.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense. General and administrative expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $21.0 million and 39% of revenue as compared to $15.8 million and 48% of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase resulted from additional personnel costs associated with the acquired Sahara operations. As noted in the Adjusted EBITDA reconciliation table below, there were $0.4 million and $0.1 million of acquisition and restructuring expenses that are backed out of general and administration expenses because of their non-recurring nature.\nResearch and Development Expense. Research and development expense was $1.4 million and 3% of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to $1.2 million and 4% of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019. Research and development expense primarily consists of costs associated with development of proprietary technology. The increase in research and development expense was primarily driven by an increase in contract services related to software development.\nOther income (expense), net. Other expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $(4.3) million as compared to $(1.3) million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Other expense increased primarily due to an increase in interest expense of $1.0 million associated with increased borrowings, and $3.1 million of losses incurred on the settlement of certain debt obligations in exchange for issuance of common shares.\nNet loss. Net losses were $16.2 million and $9.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The increase in the net loss was primarily due to lower sales volume, increased salaries and bonus expense, and increased interest expense.\nTo provide investors with additional insight and allow for a more comprehensive understanding of the information used by management in its financial and decision-making surrounding operations, we supplement our consolidated financial statements presented on a basis consistent with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d) with EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, both non-GAAP financial measures of earnings.\nEBITDA represents net income (loss) before income tax expense, interest income, interest expense, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA, plus stock compensation expense and non-recurring expenses and minus changes in fair value of derivative liabilities. Our management uses EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as financial measures to evaluate the profitability and efficiency of our business model. We use these non-GAAP financial measures to assess the strength of the underlying operations of our business. These adjustments, and the non-GAAP financial measure that is derived from them, provide supplemental information to analyze our operations between periods and over time. We find this especially useful when reviewing results of operations, which include large non-cash amortizations of intangibles assets from acquisitions. Investors should consider our non-GAAP financial measures in addition to, and not as a substitute for, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nThe following table contains reconciliations of net losses to EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA for the periods presented.\nReconciliation of net loss for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2020 and 2019 to EBITDA\n(in thousands)\nNet loss\n$ (16,153 )\n$ (9,402 )\nDepreciation and amortization\n2,555\nInterest expense\n2,815\n1,794\nIncome tax benefit\n(821 )\n-\nEBITDA\n$ (11,604 )\n$ (6,699 )\nStock-based compensation expense\n1,628\n1,137\nChange in fair value of derivative liabilities\n(245 )\nAcquisition costs\n-\nRestructuring costs\n-\nPurchase accounting impact of fair valuing deferred revenue\n-\nPurchase accounting impact of fair valuing inventory\n4,248\nNet loss on settlement of Lind debt in stock\n3,124\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$ (1,024 )\n$ (5,718 )\nDiscussion of Effect of Seasonality on Financial Condition\nCertain accounts on our balance sheets are subject to seasonal fluctuations. As our business and revenues grow, we expect these seasonal trends to be reduced. The bulk of our products are shipped to our educational customers prior to the beginning of the school year, usually in July, August or September. To prepare for the upcoming school year, we generally build up inventories during the second quarter of the year. Therefore, inventories tend to be at the highest levels at that point in time. In the first quarter of the year, inventories tend to decline significantly as products are delivered to customers and we do not need the same inventory levels during the first quarter. Accounts receivable balances tend to be at the highest levels in the third quarter, in which we record the highest level of sales.\nDue to travel restrictions and concerns for the safety for our employees during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we have temporarily eliminated all face-to-face meetings with customers and attendance at tradeshow events. In addition, we have limitations related to school access as a result of school closures. We are currently assessing the impact these changes will have on our peak season sales. Our initial assessment is that funding priority will be given to initiatives that provide for continuity of learning which may result in lower priority on total learning solution sales including hardware, software and teacher training.\nWe have been very proactive, and will continue to be proactive, in obtaining contracts during the fourth and first quarters that will help offset the seasonality of our business.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had cash and cash equivalents of $13.5 million, a working capital position of $21.0 million, and a current ratio of 1.53. This financial position represents a significant improvement from a year ago at December 31, 2019 when we had a working capital deficit of $(7.3) million and $1.2 million of cash and cash equivalents.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had net cash used in operating activities of $4.7 million and $4.3 million, respectively. We had net cash used in investing activities of $45.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2020, and net cash provided by investing activities of $6 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2019. In addition, we had net cash provided by financing activities of $65.6 million and $4.5 million during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nIn addition to the cash flows generated by our ongoing operating activities we financed our operations during 2020 with a new $20.0 million tranche of debt funded by our primary lender, and from a pre-existing accounts receivable financing arrangement with another lender who purchases 85% of the eligible accounts receivable of the Company, up to $6.0 million, with the right of recourse. Our accounts receivable and our ability to borrow against accounts receivable provides an additional source of liquidity as cash payments are collected from customers in the normal course of business. Our accounts receivable balance fluctuates throughout the year based on the seasonality of the business.\nIn the current COVID-19 pandemic environment, the availability of capital has been significantly reduced and the cost of capital has increased. Increasing our capital through equity issuance at this time could cause significant dilution to our existing stockholders as a result of diminished stock value due to market volatility and uncertainty arising from the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the Company is confident that it will be able to manage through the current challenges in the equity and debt finance markets by managing payment terms with customers and vendors.\nOur cash requirements consist primarily of day-to-day operating expenses, capital expenditures and contractual obligations with respect to facility leases and other operating leases. We lease all of our office facilities. We expect to make future payments on existing leases from cash generated from operations. We have limited credit available from our major vendors and are required to prepay for the majority of our inventory purchases, which further constrains our cash liquidity.\nWe believe that the combination of our cash and cash equivalents on hand, cash provided by our operating activities, funds available from our accounts receivable financing facility, and access to the equity markets if and when needed, will be sufficient for the Company to meet its operating obligations and debt service requirements at least for the next year.\nThe Company had an accumulated deficit of $47.5 million as of December 31,2020 and net cash used in operations of $4.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nRecent Financing\nOn September 21, 2020, we and Lind Global Asset Management (\u201cLind Global\u201d) entered into a securities purchase agreement (the \u201cLind Global SPA\u201d), pursuant to which Lind Global purchased from the Company a $22,000,000 secured convertible note (the \u201cConvertible Note\u201d) in exchange for payment of $20,000,000 (the \u201cFunding\u201d). Under the terms of the Lind Global SPA, in addition to the issuance of the Convertible Note, the Company paid to Lind (i) a commitment fee of $400,000 and (ii) a bonus fee (the \u201cBonus Payment\u201d) of $500,000 payable in shares of Class A common stock of the Company (the \u201cCommon Stock\u201d), with the per share price of the Bonus Payment shares calculated based on the 20-day VWAP of the Common Stock prior to closing. The Convertible Note has a term of 24-months, bears a 4% interest rate (0% interest so long as the Common Stock trades at $3.50 or more per share), is repayable in 22 equal instalments commencing 60 days after the Funding and, at the option of the Company, may be repaid in either cash or Class A common stock. Class A common stock issuable to Lind Global in conjunction with the Bonus Payment and the Convertible Note was registered pursuant to a shelf takedown on the Company\u2019s existing shelf registration statement on Form S-3.\nIn conjunction with our entry into the Lind Global SPA and the issuance of the Convertible Note, on September 21, 2020, the Company and Lind Global Macro Fund, LP, an affiliate of Lind Global(\u201cLind\u201d), entered into a third amended and restated security agreement (the \u201cThird A&R Security Agreement\u201d) for purposes of amending and restating a prior security agreement, dated as of February 4, 2020, between the Company and Lind in order to incorporate the Lind Global SPA and the Convertible Note therein. In addition, on September 21, 2020, the Company, Sallyport Commercial Finance, LLC (\u201cSallyport\u201d), as first lien creditor, and Lind and Lind Global, as second lien creditors, entered into a third amended and restated intercreditor agreement (the \u201cThird A&R Intercreditor Agreement\u201d) for purposes of amending and restating the second amended and restated intercreditor agreement, dated as of February 4, 2020, between the Company, Sallyport and Lind, in order to (i) incorporate Lind Global as a second lien creditor and (ii) reaffirm and confirm the relative priority of each creditor\u2019s respective security interests in the Company\u2019s assets, among other matters.\nOn July 28, 2020, the Company entered into an underwriting agreement (the \u201cUnderwriting Agreement\u201d) with Maxim Group, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (\u201cMaxim\u201d), pursuant to which Maxim, as representative of the underwriters, agreed to underwrite the public offering (the \u201cOffering\u201d) of up to 15,000,00 shares of the Company\u2019s Class A common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the \u201cCommon Stock\u201d), at a public offering price of $2.00 per share, in addition to an overallotment option (the \u201cOverallotment Option\u201d) of 2,250,000 shares of Common Stock. The Offering closed on July 31, 2020, with the sale of all 17,250,000 shares of the Company\u2019s Common Stock, including the Overallotment Option, for gross proceeds of $34,500,000. Maxim acted as sole book-running manager, National Securities Corporation acted as a co-manager for the Offering, and A.G.P./Alliance Global Partners (\u201cA.G.P.\u201d) acted as financial advisor. As compensation for underwriting the Offering, the underwriters received an underwriting discount of 7%, equaling approximately $2,415,000, in addition to $60,000 in expenses. A.G.P.\u2019s compensation was paid out of the underwriting discount. The Offering was made pursuant to the Company\u2019s effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (SEC File No. 333-239939) (the \u201cRegistration Statement\u201d) and the related base prospectus included therein, as supplemented by the prospectus supplement dated July 28, 2020 (the \u201cPreliminary Prospectus\u201d) and the final prospectus supplement, filed July 29, 2020 (the \u201cFinal Prospectus\u201d and collectively with the Preliminary Prospectus, the \u201cProspectus\u201d)\nAs approved by the Company\u2019s board of directors on June 22, 2020, the Company entered into an agreement with Everest Display, Inc., a Taiwan corporation (\u201cEDI\u201d), and EDI\u2019s subsidiary, AMAGIC Holographics, Inc., a California corporation (\u201cAMAGIC\u201d), effective June 11, 2020, pursuant to which EDI will forgive $1,000,000 in accounts payable owed by the Company to EDI in exchange for the Company\u2019s issuance of 869,565 shares (the \u201cShares\u201d) of its Class A common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, to AMAGIC at a $1.15 per share purchase price. The Shares were issued to AMAGIC pursuant to an exemption from registration provided by Rule 506 of Regulation D under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.\nOn June 8, 2020, the Company entered into an underwriting agreement (the \u201cJune Underwriting Agreement\u201d) with Maxim pursuant to which Maxim agreed to underwrite the public offering (the \u201cJune Offering\u201d) of 13,333,333 shares (the \u201cShares\u201d) of the Company\u2019s Class A common stock at a public offering price of $0.75 per share. National acted as co-manager of the June Offering. The June Offering closed on June 11, 2020, with the Company\u2019s sale of the Shares for gross proceeds of $10,000,000. In addition, the Company granted the underwriters a 45-day option to purchase up to an additional 2,000,000 shares of Class A common stock at the public offering price less discounts and commissions (the \u201cJune Over-Allotment Option\u201d). The June Over-Allotment Option was exercised in full on June 24, 2020, for additional proceeds of $1,500,000, through the sale of an additional 1,999,667 shares of Class A common stock. Maxim acted as sole-bookrunner and National acted as co-manager for the Offering. Gross proceeds, before underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses, totaled $11.5 million. As compensation for underwriting the Offering, Maxim and National together received an underwriting discount of 7% of the Offering and the Over-Allotment Option and were reimbursed for up to $85,000 in underwriting expenses. The June Offering was conducted pursuant to the Company\u2019s registration statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-238634) previously filed with and subsequently declared effective by the SEC.\nOn February 4, 2020, we and Lind Global Marco Fund, LP (the \u201cInvestor\u201d or \u201cLind\u201d) entered into a purchase agreement (the \u201c2020 SPA\u201d) pursuant to which we received $750,000 in exchange for the issuance to Lind of (1) an $825,000 convertible promissory note, payable at an 8% interest rate, compounded monthly (the \u201c2020 Note\u201d), (2) certain shares of restricted Company Class A common stock valued at $60,000, calculated based on the 20-day volume average weighted price of the Class A common stock for the period ended February 4, 2020, and (3) a commitment fee of $26,250. The Note matures over 24 months, with repayment to commence August 4, 2020, after which time the Company will be obligated to make monthly payments of $45,833 (the \u201cMonthly Payments\u201d), plus interest. Interest payments owed under the 2020 Note (the \u201cInterest Payments\u201d) accrue beginning on the one-month anniversary of the issuance of the Note, however such Interest Payments accrued during the first six months of the Note, after which time the Interest Payments, including such accrued Interest Payments, shall be payable on a monthly basis in either conversion shares or in cash. We may make the Monthly Payments and any Interest Payments in shares of the Company\u2019s Class A common stock so long as such shares are either registered for resale under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or may be sold without restriction pursuant to Rule 144 thereunder. As such, the Monthly Payments may be subject to reduction in any month by any amounts converted into the Company\u2019s Class A common stock. In connection with this transaction the Company and Lind amended and restated the $4,400,000 note and the $1,375,000 note referred to below that we issued to Lind in March and December 2019, respectively, to provide that we would not make any payments under the Lind notes in the form of Class A Common Stock if such payments could cause the Company to violate any rules of the Nasdaq Capital Market.\nIn addition, on February 4, 2020, we and Lind entered into a second amended and restated security agreement for purposes of amending and restating a prior security agreement, dated as of December 13, 2019. Also, Sallyport Commercial Finance, LLC, as first lien creditor, and Lind, as second lien creditor, entered into a second amended and restated intercreditor agreement for purposes of amending and restating the intercreditor agreement between the parties, dated as of December 13, 2019, in order to reaffirm and confirm the relative priority of each creditor\u2019s respective security interests in our assets,\nOn December 13, 2019, we entered into a securities purchase agreement with Lind for $1,250,000 of working financing in exchange for the issuance of a $1,375,000 principal amount convertible secured Boxlight note with a maturity date of 24 months. The note is convertible at the option of the Investor into our Class A voting common stock at a fixed conversion price of $2.50 per share. We have the right to force the Investor to convert up to 50% of the outstanding amount of the note if the volume weighted average closing price of our Class A common stock trades above $5.00 for 30 consecutive days; and 100% of the outstanding amount of the note if the volume weighted average closing price of our Class A common stock trades above $6.25 for 30 consecutive days. At closing a total of $1,250,000 was funded under the note. We are required to make monthly interest payments on the note at the rate of 8% per annum and principal payments in 18 equal monthly instalments of $76,388 each. So long as shares of our Class A common stock are registered for resale under the Securities Act or may be sold without restriction on the number of shares or manner of sale, we have the right to make interest payments in the form of additional shares of Class A common stock. We have the right to prepay the convertible note at any time with no penalty (the \u201cBuy-Back Right\u201d). Should we exercise our Buy-Back Right, Lind will have the option of converting 25% of the outstanding $1.4 million principal amount of the note into shares of our Class A common stock.\nOn March 22, 2019, we entered into a securities purchase agreement with Lind for a $4,000,000 of working capital financing for Boxlight and its subsidiaries. The investment was in the form of a $4,400,000 principal amount convertible secured Boxlight note with a maturity date of 24 months. The note is convertible at the option of the Investor into our Class A voting common stock at a fixed conversion price of $4.00 per share. We have the right to force the Investor to convert up to 50% of the outstanding amount of the note if the volume weighted average closing price of our Class A common stock trades above $8.00 for 30 consecutive days; and 100% of the outstanding amount of the note if the volume weighted average closing price of our Class A common stock trades above $12.00 for 30 consecutive days. At closing a total of $4,000,000 was funded under the note. We are required to make monthly interest payments on the note at the rate of 8% per annum and principal payments in 18 equal monthly installments of $244,444. So long as shares of our Class A common stock are registered for resale under the Securities Act or may be sold without restriction on the number of shares or manner of sale, we have the right to make interest payments in the form of additional shares of Class A common stock. We have the right to prepay the convertible note at any time with no penalty (the \u201cBuy-Back Right\u201d). Should we exercise our Buy-Back Right, the Investor will have the option of converting 25% of the outstanding $4.4 million principal amount of the note into shares of our Class A common stock. As of December 31, 2019, the Company converted $977,778 of principal and $106,643 of interest into 735,662 shares of Class A common stock.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have no significant off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity and capital resources.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles accepted in the United States. In connection with the preparation of our financial statements, we are required to make assumptions and estimates about future events and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and the related disclosures. We base our assumptions, estimates and judgments on historical experience, current trends and other factors that management believes to be relevant at the time our consolidated financial statements are prepared. On a regular basis, we review the accounting policies, assumptions, estimates and judgments to ensure that our financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with GAAP. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material.\nOur significant accounting policies are discussed in in detail Note 1 to the enclosed consolidated financial statements, and briefly summarized below. We believe that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results, and they require our most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain:\n1. Revenue recognition\n2. Business Acquisitions\n3. Goodwill and Intangible assets\n4. Share-based Compensation\nREVENUE RECOGNITION\nIn accordance with the FASB\u2019s Accounting Standards Codification (\u201cASC\u201d) Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers), the Company recognizes revenue at the amount to which it expects to be entitled when control of the products or services is transferred to its customers. Control is generally transferred when the Company has a present right to payment and the significant risks and rewards of ownership of products or services are transferred to its customers. Product revenue is derived from the sale of projectors, interactive panels and related software and accessories to distributors, resellers, and end users. Service revenue is derived from hardware maintenance services, product installation, training, software maintenance, and subscription services.\nThe Company\u2019s sales of interactive devices, including panels, projectors, and other interactive devices generally include hardware maintenance services, a license to software, and the provision of related software maintenance. In most cases, interactive devices are sold with hardware maintenance services with terms ranging from 36 - 60 months. Software maintenance includes technical support, product updates on a when and if available basis, and error correction services. At times, non-interactive projectors are also sold with hardware maintenance services with terms ranging from 36-60 months. The Company also licenses software independently of its interactive devices, in which case it is bundled with software maintenance, and in some cases, subscription services that include access to on-line content, access to replacement parts, and cloud-based applications. The Company\u2019s software subscription services provide access to content and software applications on an as needed basis over the Internet, but do not provide the right to take delivery of the software applications.\nThe Company\u2019s product sales, including those with software and related services, generally include a single payment up front for the products and services, and revenue is recorded net of estimated sales returns and rebates based on the Company\u2019s expectations and historical experience. For most of the Company\u2019s product sales, control transfers, and therefore, revenue is recognized when products are shipped at the point of origin. When the Company transfers control of its products to the customer prior to the related shipping and handling activities, the Company has adopted a policy of accounting for shipping and handling activities as a fulfillment cost rather than a performance obligation. For software product sales, control is transferred when the customer receives the related interactive hardware since the customer\u2019s connection to the interactive hardware activates the software license at which time the software is made available to the customer. For the Company\u2019s software maintenance, hardware maintenance, and subscription services, revenue is recognized ratably over time as the services are provided since time is the best output measure of how those services are transferred to the customer.\nThe Company\u2019s installation, training and professional development services are generally sold separately from the Company\u2019s products. Control of these services is transferred to our customers over time with hours/time incurred in providing the service being the best depiction of the transfer of services since the customer is receiving the benefit of the services as the work is performed.\nFor contracts with multiple performance obligations, each of which represent promises within a contract that are distinct, the Company allocates revenue to all distinct performance obligations based on their relative stand-alone selling prices (\u201cSSPs\u201d).\nBUSINESS ACQUISITIONS\nThe Company\u2019s business acquisitions are accounted for as a business combination, in accordance with Topic 350 \u201cBusiness Combinations\u201d, which requires, among other things, that assets acquired, and liabilities assumed be recognized at their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date on the consolidated balance sheet. Transaction costs are expensed as incurred. Any excess of the consideration transferred over the assigned values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Income taxes, where applicable, are recognized and measured in accordance with Topic 740, Accounting for Income Taxes. Determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management to use significant judgement and estimates, including the selection of valuation methodologies, estimates of future revenue, costs and cash flows, and discount rates.\nGOODWILL and INTANGIBLE ASSETS\nGoodwill represents the cost in excess of the fair value of the net assets of acquired businesses. Goodwill is not amortized and is not deductible for tax purposes. Under ASC Topic 350 \u201cBusiness Combinations\u201d, we have an option to perform a \u201cqualitative\u201d assessment of the Company to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary. If an entity believes, as a result of its qualitative assessment, that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of the business is less than carrying amount, the quantitative impairment test is required. Otherwise, no further testing is required. If we determine that the Company meets these criteria, we perform a qualitative assessment. In this qualitative assessment, we consider the following items: macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, overall financial performance and other entity specific events. In addition, we assess whether the most recent fair value determination results in an amount that exceeds the carrying amount of the Company. Based on these assessments, we determine whether the likelihood that a current fair value determination would be less than the current carrying amount is not more likely than not.\nBecause the qualitative assessment is an option, we may bypass it for any reporting unit in any period as begin our analysis with the quantitative impairment test. We may elect to perform a quantitative impairment test based on the period of time that has passed since the most recent determination of fair value, even when the we do not believe that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of the business is less than carrying amount.\nIn analyzing goodwill for potential impairment in the quantitative impairment test, we use a combination of the income and market approaches to estimate the fair value. Under the income approach, we calculate the fair value based on estimated future discounted cash flows. The assumptions we use are based on what we believe a hypothetical marketplace participant would use in estimating fair value. Under the market approach, we estimate the fair value based on market multiples of revenue or earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization for benchmark companies. If the fair value exceeds carrying value, then no further testing is required. However, if the fair value were to be less than carrying value, we would then determine the amount of the impairment charge, if any, which would be the amount that the carrying value of the goodwill exceeded its implied value.\nIntangible assets are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated period of benefit. We evaluate the recoverability of intangible assets periodically and take into account events or circumstances that warrant revised estimates of useful lives or that indicate that impairment exists. No material impairments of intangible assets have been identified during any of the periods presented. Intangible assets are tested for impairment on an annual basis, and between annual tests if indicators of potential impairment exist, using a fair-value-based approach.\nSHARE-BASED COMPENSATION\nThe Company estimates the fair value of each stock compensation award at the grant date by using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The fair value determined represents the cost for the award and is recognized over the vesting period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award. Accordingly, stock compensation expense is recognized based on the estimated fair value of the awards which is amortized as compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. Total expense related to the award is reduced by the fair value of the options that are forfeited by the employees that leave the Company prior to vesting.\nINCOME TAXES\nThe Company follows the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes pursuant to the pertinent guidance issued by the FASB. Deferred income taxes are recorded to reflect the estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets, liabilities, operating losses, and tax credit carry forwards using the tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences reverse. Valuation allowances, if any, are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount management considers more likely than not to be realized. Such valuation allowances are recorded for the portion of the deferred tax assets that are not expected to be realized based on the levels of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the temporary differences will be deductible.\nEmerging Growth Company\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. Accordingly, certain specified reporting and other regulatory requirements for public companies are reduced for businesses that meet the qualifications for emerging growth companies.\nThese provisions include:\n(1) an exemption from the auditor attestation requirement in the assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002;\n(2) an exemption from the adoption of new or revised financial accounting standards until they would apply to private companies;\n(3) an exemption from compliance with any new requirements adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, or the PCAOB, requiring mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor\u2019s report in which the auditor would be required to provide additional information about our audit and our financial statements; and\n(4) reduced disclosure about our executive compensation arrangements.",

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2020, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nChange in Accounting Principle\nAs discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company changed its method of accounting for revenue recognition in 2019 with the adoption of Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company\u2019s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (\u201cPCAOB\u201d) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n/S/ DIXON HUGHES GOODMAN LLP\nWe have served as the Company\u2019s auditor since 2018.\nAtlanta, Georgia\nMarch 31, 2021\nBoxlight Corporation\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\nAs of December 31, 2020, and 2019\n($ in thousands)\nDecember 31,\nDecember 31,\nASSETS\nCurrent asset:\nCash and cash equivalents\n$ 13,460\n$ 1,17\nAccounts receivable -

ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nCOMPANY HISTORY AND RECENT ACQUISITIVE GROWTH\nBoxlight Corporation (the \u201cCompany\u201d) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on September 18, 2014 with its headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia for the purpose of becoming a technology company that sells interactive educational products. The Company designs, produces and distributes interactive technology solutions to the education market.\nOn September 24, 2020, the Company acquired Sahara Presentation Systems PLC, a leader in distributed and manufactured AV solutions. Headquartered in the United Kingdom, Sahara is a leader in distributed AV products and a manufacturer of multi-award-winning touchscreens and digital signage products, including the globally renowned Clevertouch and Sedao brands.\nOn April 17, 2020, the Company acquired the assets, and assumed certain liabilities of MyStemKits and STEM Education Holdings, Pty, an Australian corporation (\u201cSTEM\u201d), the largest online collection of K-12 STEM curriculum for 3D printing.\nOn March 12, 2019, the Company entered into an asset purchase agreement with Modern Robotics Inc. (MRI), based in Miami, Florida. MRI is engaged in the business of developing, selling and distributing science, technology, engineering and math (STEM), robotics and programming solutions to the global education market.\nOn August 31, 2018, the Company acquired 100% of the membership interest equity of EOS, an Arizona limited liability company. EOS is in the business of providing technology consulting, training, and professional development services to create sustainable programs that integrate technology with curriculum in K-12 schools and districts.\nOn June 22, 2018, the Company 100% of the capital stock of the Qwizdom Companies. The Qwizdom Companies develop interactive whiteboard software and online solutions that are quick to implement and designed to increase participation, provide immediate data feedback, and, most importantly, accelerate and improve comprehension and learning. The Qwizdom Companies have offices outside Seattle, WA and Belfast, Northern Ireland and deliver products in 44 languages to customers around the world through a network of partners.\nOn May 9, 2018, the Company acquired 100% of the capital stock of Cohuba based in Lancashire, England. Cohuba produces, sells and distributes interactive display panels designed to provide new learning and working experiences through high-quality technologies and solutions through in-room and room-to-room multi-devices multi-user collaboration.\nBASIS OF PRESENTATION AND PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Boxlight Corporation and its wholly owned subsidiaries. Intercompany transactions and account balances among all of affiliated entities have been eliminated.\nIn the opinion of management, the consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, which are normal and recurring in nature and necessary for fair financial statement presentation.\nESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of certain assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual amounts could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates include estimates of allowances for bad debts, and inventory obsolescence; the recoverability deferred tax assets; the fair value and the recoverability of warrants; the initial fair value of preferred stock, intangible assets and goodwill; stock compensation, fair values of assets acquired and estimates for contingent liabilities.\nCOMPREHENSIVE INCOME\nComprehensive income (loss) reflects the change in equity during the year and is comprised of all components of net income (loss and foreign currency translation adjustments.\nFOREIGN CURRENCIES\nThe Company\u2019s reporting currency is the U.S. dollar.\nThe U.S. dollar is the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates and is generally the currency in which the Company business generates and expends cash. Subsidiaries with different functional currencies, translates their assets and liabilities into U.S. dollars at the exchange rates in effect as of the balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated into U.S. dollars at the average exchange rates for the year. The resulting translation adjustments are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), a separate component of equity (deficit). Foreign exchange gains and losses arise from transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency. Gains and losses on those foreign currency transactions are included in determining net income for the period in the exchange rates change.\nCASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS\nThe Company considers all highly liquid short-term investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. These investments are carried at cost, which approximates fair value. The Company maintains cash balances at financial institutions which, from time to time, may exceed Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insured limits of $250,000 for banks located in the U.S. The Company has not experienced any losses with regard to its bank accounts and believes it is not exposed to any risk of loss on its cash bank accounts.\nACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS\nAccounts receivable are stated at contractual amounts, net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. The allowance for doubtful accounts represents management\u2019s estimate of the amounts that ultimately will not be realized in cash. The Company reviews the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts on an ongoing basis, using historical payment trends, the age of receivables and knowledge of the individual customers. When the analysis indicates, management increases or decreases the allowance accordingly. However, if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, additional allowances might be required.\nINVENTORIES\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value and include spare parts and finished goods. Inventories are primarily determined using specific identification and the first-in, first-out (\u201cFIFO\u201d) cost methods. Cost includes direct cost from the Current Manufacturer (\u201cCM\u201d) or Original Equipment Manufacturer (\u201cOEM\u201d), plus material overhead related to the purchase, inbound freight and import duty costs.\nThe Company continuously reviews its inventory levels to identify slow-moving merchandise and markdowns necessary to clear slow-moving merchandise, which reduces the cost of inventories to its estimated net realizable value. Consideration is given to several quantitative and qualitative factors, including current pricing levels and the anticipated need for subsequent markdowns, aging of inventories, historical sales trends, and the impact of market trends and economic conditions. Estimates of markdown requirements may differ from actual results due to changes in quantity, quality and mix of products in inventory, as well as changes in consumer preferences, market and economic conditions.\nPROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT\nProperty and equipment is stated at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated life of the asset. Repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred.\nLONG-LIVED ASSETS\nLong-lived assets to be held and used or disposed of other than by sale are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. When required, impairment losses on assets to be held and used or disposed of other than by sale are recognized based on the fair value of the asset. Long-lived assets to be disposed of by sale are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell.\nBUSINESS COMBINATIONS\nTransactions in which the Company acquires or obtains control of one or more businesses are accounted for as business combinations in accordance with Topic 350, Business Combinations, which requires, among other things, that assets acquired, and liabilities assumed be recognized at their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date on the balance sheet. Income taxes, where applicable, are recognized and measured in accordance with Topic 740, Accounting for Income Taxes. Determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management to use significant judgement and estimates, including the selection of valuation methodologies, estimates of future revenue, costs and cash flows, and discount rates. Transaction costs are expenses as incurred. Any excess consideration transferred over he assigned values of net assets acquired would be recorded as goodwill.\nGOODWILL\nGoodwill represents the cost in excess of the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets of acquired businesses, and represents implied synergies expected of the completed business combinations. Goodwill is not amortized and is not deductible for tax purposes.\nUnder ASC 350, Business Combinations, we have an option to perform a \u201cqualitative\u201d assessment to determine whether quantitative impairment testing is necessary. If, as a result of a qualitative assessment, it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of the business is less than carrying amount, quantitative impairment testing is required. Otherwise, no further testing is necessary. If we perform a qualitative assessment, we consider the following criteria: macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, overall financial performance and other entity specific events. In addition, we assess whether the most recent fair value determination resulted in an amount that significantly exceeded the carrying amount of the Company. Based on these assessments, we determine whether the likelihood that a current fair value determination would be less than the current carrying amount is not more likely than not.\nBecause the qualitative assessment is an option, we may bypass it for any reporting unit in any period and begin the analysis using a quantitative impairment test. We may also elect to perform a quantitative impairment test based on the period of time that has passed since the most recent determination of fair value, even when we do not believe that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of the business is less than carrying amount.\nIn analyzing goodwill for potential impairment in the quantitative impairment test, we use a combination of the income and market approaches to estimate the fair value. Under the income approach, we calculate the fair value based on estimated future discounted cash flows. The assumptions we use are based on what we believe a hypothetical marketplace participant would use in estimating fair value. Under the market approach, we estimate the fair value based on market multiples of revenue or earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization for benchmark companies. If the fair value exceeds carrying value, then no further testing is required. However, if the fair value were to be less than carrying value, we would then determine the amount of the impairment charge, if any, which would be the amount that the carrying value of the goodwill exceeded its implied value. No goodwill impairments have been identified and recognized during any of the periods presented.\nBeing that the acquisition of Sahara September 24, 2020, the business has performed at or better than expected, and there are no indicators of possible impairment, the Company believes that the carrying amount does not exceed the fair value for the reporting unit. Goodwill arising from the Sahara acquisition was not included in the goodwill impairment testing for 2020 but will be included in the impairment testing in 2021.\nIntangible assets\nIntangible assets are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated period of benefit. We evaluate the recoverability of intangible assets periodically and consider events or circumstances that warrant revised estimates of useful lives or that indicate that impairment exists. No material impairments of intangible assets have been identified during any of the periods presented. Intangible assets are tested for impairment on an annual basis, and between annual tests if indicators of potential impairment exist, using a fair-value-based approach.\nDERIVATIVE TREATMENT OF STOCK PURCHASE WARRANTS\nThe Company classifies common stock purchase warrants as equity if the contracts (i) require physical settlement or net-share settlement or (ii) give the Company a choice of net-cash settlement or settlement in its own shares (physical settlement or net-share settlement). The Company classifies any contracts that (i) require net-cash settlement (including a requirement to net cash settle the contract if an event occurs and if that event is outside the control of the Company), (ii) give the counterparty a choice of net-cash settlement or settlement in shares (physical settlement or net-share settlement), or (iii) contain reset provisions as either an asset or a liability. The Company assesses classification of its freestanding derivatives at each reporting date to determine whether a change in classification between equity and liabilities is required.\nThe Company determined that certain warrants to purchase common stock do not satisfy the criteria for classification as equity instruments due to the existence of certain net cash and non-fixed settlement provisions that are not within the sole control of the Company. Such warrants are measured at fair value at each reporting date, and the changes in fair value are included in determining net income for the period.\nFAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\nThe Company\u2019s financial instruments primarily include cash, accounts receivable, derivative liabilities, accounts payable and debt. Due to the short-term nature of cash, accounts receivables and accounts payable, the carrying amounts of these assets and liabilities approximate their fair value. Debt approximates fair value due to either the short-term nature or recent execution of the debt agreement. The amount of consideration received is deemed to be the fair value of long-term debt net of any debt discount and issuance cost.\nDerivatives liabilities are recorded at fair value at each period end.\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset, or paid to transfer a liability, in an orderly transaction between market participants. A fair value hierarchy has been established for valuation inputs that gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. The fair value hierarchy is as follows:\nLevel 1 Inputs - Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date.\nLevel 2 Inputs - Inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. These might include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability (such as interest rates, volatilities, prepayment speeds, credit risks, etc.) or inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by market data by correlation or other means.\nLevel 3 Inputs - Prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable (supported by little or no market activity).\nFinancial assets and liabilities are classified based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The Company\u2019s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and may affect the valuation of the fair value of assets and liabilities and their placement within the fair value hierarchy levels.\nThe following tables set forth, by level within the fair value hierarchy, the Company\u2019s financial liabilities that were accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 (in thousands):\nMarkets for\nIdentical\nAssets Other\nObservable\nInputs Significant\nUnobservable\nInputs Fair\nValue as of\nDecember 31,\nDescription (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3)\nDerivative liabilities - stock purchase warrants $ - $ - $ 363\nEarn-out payable\n$ 482 $ 482\nMarkets for\nIdentical\nAssets Other\nObservable\nInputs Significant\nUnobservable\nInputs Fair\nValue as of\nDecember 31,\nDescription (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3)\nDerivative liabilities - stock warrant purchase warrants $ - $ - $ 147 $ 147\nEarn-out payable\n$ 534 $ 534\nAmount\nBalance, December 31, 2018\nAmount paid (23 )\nBalance, December 31, 2019\nAmount paid (268 )\nBalance, December 31, 2020 $ 119\nREVENUE RECOGNITION\nIn accordance with the FASB\u2019s Accounting Standards Update (\u201cASU\u201d) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), the Company recognizes revenue at the amount to which it expects to be entitled when control of the products or services is transferred to its customers. Control is generally transferred when the Company has a present right to payment and the title and the significant risks and rewards of ownership of products or services are transferred to its customers. Product revenue is derived from the sale of projectors, interactive panels and related software and accessories to distributors, resellers, and end users. Service revenue is derived from hardware maintenance services, product installation, training, software maintenance, and subscription services.\nNature of Products and Services and Related Contractual Provisions\nThe Company\u2019s sales of interactive devices, including panels, projectors, and other interactive devices generally include hardware maintenance services, a license to software, and the provision of related software maintenance. In most cases, interactive devices are sold with hardware maintenance services with terms of approximately 60 months. Software maintenance includes technical support, product updates on a when and if available basis, and error correction services. At times, non-interactive projectors are also sold with hardware maintenance services with terms of approximately 60 months. The Company also licenses software independently of its interactive devices, in which case it is bundled with software maintenance, and in some cases, subscription services that include access to on-line content, and cloud-based applications. The Company\u2019s software subscription services provide access to content and software applications on an as needed basis over the Internet, but do not provide the right to take delivery of the software applications.\nThe Company\u2019s product sales, including those with software and related services, generally include a single payment up front for the products and services, and revenue is recorded net of estimated sales returns and rebates based on the Company\u2019s expectations and historical experience. For most of the Company\u2019s product sales, control transfers, and therefore, revenue is recognized when products are shipped at the point of origin. When the Company transfers control of its products to the customer prior to the related shipping and handling activities, the Company has adopted a policy of accounting for shipping and handling activities as a fulfillment cost rather than a performance obligation. For many of the Company\u2019s software product sales, control is transferred when shipped at the point of origin since the software is installed on the interactive hardware device in advance of shipping. For software product sales, control is transferred when the customer receives the related interactive hardware since the customer\u2019s connection to the interactive hardware activates the software license at which time the software is made available to the customer. For the Company\u2019s software maintenance, hardware maintenance, and subscription services, revenue is recognized ratably over time as the services are provided since time is the best output measure of how those services are transferred to the customer.\nThe Company\u2019s installation, training and professional development services are generally sold separately from the Company\u2019s products. Control of these services is transferred to our customers over time with hours/time incurred in providing the service being the best depiction of the transfer of services since the customer is receiving the benefit of the services as the work is performed.\nFor the sale of third-party products and services where the Company obtains control of the products and services before transferring it to the customer, the Company recognizes revenue based on the gross amount billed to customers. The Company considers multiple factors when determining whether it obtains control of the third-party products and services including, but not limited to, evaluating if it can establish the price of the product, retains inventory risk for tangible products or has the responsibility for ensuring acceptability of the product or service. The Company has not historically entered into transactions where it does not take control of the product or service prior to transfer to the customer.\nThe Company excludes all taxes assessed by a governmental agency that are both imposed on and concurrent with the specific revenue-producing transaction from revenue (for example, sales and use taxes). In essence, the Company is reporting these amounts collected on behalf of the applicable government agency on a net basis as though they are acting as an agent. The taxes collected and not yet remitted to the governmental agency are included in accounts payable and accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\nSignificant Judgments\nFor contracts with multiple performance obligations, each of which represent promises within a contract that are distinct, the Company allocates revenue to all distinct performance obligations based on their relative stand-alone selling prices (\u201cSSPs\u201d). The Company\u2019s products and services included in its contracts with multiple performance obligations generally are not sold separately and there are no observable prices available to determine the SSP for those products and services. Since observable prices are not available, SSPs are established that reflect the Company\u2019s best estimates of what the selling prices of the performance obligations would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. The Company\u2019s process for estimating SSPs without observable prices considers multiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each performance obligation including, when applicable, the estimated cost to provide the performance obligation, market trends in the pricing for similar offerings, product-specific business objectives, and competitor or other relevant market pricing and margins. Because observable prices are generally not available for the Company\u2019s performance obligations that are sold in bundled arrangements, the Company does not apply the residual approach to determining SSP. However, the Company does have certain performance obligations for which pricing is highly variable or uncertain, and contracts with those performance obligations generally contain multiple performance obligations with highly variable or uncertain pricing. For these contracts the Company allocates the transaction price to those performance obligations using an alternative method of allocation that is consistent with the allocation objective and the guidance on determining SSPs in Topic 606 considering, when applicable, the estimated cost to provide the performance obligation, market pricing for competing product or service offerings, residual values based on the estimated SSP for certain goods, product-specific business objectives, incremental values for bundled transactions that include a service relative to similar transactions that exclude the service, and competitor pricing and margins. A separate price has not been established by the Company for its hardware maintenance services and software maintenance services. In addition, hardware maintenance services, software solutions, and the related maintenance services are never sold separately and are proprietary in nature, and the related selling price of these products and services is highly variable or uncertain. Therefore, the SSP of these products and services is estimated using the alternative method described above, which includes residual value techniques.\nThe Company has applied the portfolio approach to its allocation of the transaction price for certain portfolios of contracts that are executed in the same manner, contain the same performance obligations, and are priced in a consistent manner. The Company believes that the application of the portfolio approach produces the same result as if they were applied at the contract level.\nContract Balances\nThe timing of invoicing to customers often differs from the timing of revenue recognition and these timing differences can result in receivables, contract assets, or contract liabilities (deferred revenue) on the Company\u2019s consolidated balance sheets. Fees for the Company\u2019s product and most service contracts are fixed, except as adjusted for rebate programs when applicable, and are generally due within 30-60 days of contract execution. Fees for installation, training, and professional development services are fixed and generally become due as the services are performed. The Company has an established history of collecting under the terms of its contracts without providing refunds or concessions to its customers. The Company\u2019s contractual payment terms do not vary when products are bundled with services that are provided over multiple years. In these contracts where services are expected to be transferred on an ongoing basis for several years after the related payment, the Company has determined that the contracts generally do not include a significant financing component. The upfront invoicing terms are designed 1) to provide customers with a predictable way to purchase products and services where the payment is due in the same timeframe as when the products, which constitute the predominant portion of the contractual value, are transferred, and 2) to ensure that the customer continues to use the related services, so that the customer will receive the optimal benefit from the products over their lives. Additionally, the Company has elected the practical expedient to exclude any financing component from consideration for contracts where, at contract inception, the period between the transfer of services and the timing of the related payment is not expected to exceed one year.\nThe Company has an unconditional right to consideration for all products and services transferred to the customer. That unconditional right to consideration is reflected in accounts receivable in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets in accordance with Topic 606. Contract liabilities are reflected in deferred revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and reflect amounts allocated to performance obligations that have not yet been transferred to the customer related to software maintenance, hardware maintenance, and subscription services. The Company has no material contract assets on December 31, 2020 or 2019. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company recognized $2.0 million and $2.0 million, respectively of revenue that was included in the deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2019 and January 1, 2019, respectively, as adjusted for Topic 606, at the beginning of the period.\nVariable Consideration\nThe Company\u2019s otherwise fixed consideration in its customer contracts may vary when refunds or credits are provided for sales returns, stock rotation rights, price protection provisions, or in connection with certain other rebate provisions. The Company generally does not allow product returns other than under assurance warranties or hardware maintenance contracts. However, the Company, on a case-by-case basis, will grant exceptions, mostly \u201cbuyer\u2019s remorse\u201d where the distributor or reseller\u2019s end customer either did not understand what they were ordering, or determined that the product did not meet their needs. An allowance for sales returns is estimated based on an analysis of historical trends. In very limited situations, a customer may return previous purchases held in inventory for a specified period of time in exchange for credits toward additional purchases. The Company includes variable consideration in its transaction price when there is a basis to reasonably estimate the amount of the fee and it is probable there will not be a significant reversal. These estimates are generally made using the expected value method based on historical experience and are measured at each reporting date. There was no material revenue recognized in 2020 related to changes in estimated variable consideration that existed at December 31, 2019.\nRemaining Performance Obligations\nA performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer and is the unit of accounting within the contract. The transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied by transferring the promised good or service to the customer. The Company identifies performance obligations at contract inception so that it can monitor and account for the obligations over the life of the contract. Remaining performance obligations represent the portion of the transaction price in a contract allocated to products and services not yet transferred to the customer. As of December 31, 2020, and 2019, the aggregate amount of the contractual transaction prices allocated to remaining performance obligations was $16.1 million and $4.6 million, respectively. The Company expects to recognize revenue on approximately 43% of the remaining performance obligations in 2021, 45% in 2022 and 2023, with the remainder recognized thereafter.\nIn accordance with Topic 606, the Company has elected not to disclose the value of remaining performance obligations for contracts for which the Company recognizes revenue at the amount to which it has the right to invoice for services performed (for example, a time-and-materials professional services contracts). In addition, the Company has elected not to disclose the value of remaining performance obligations for contracts with performance obligations that are expected, at contract inception, to be satisfied over a period that does not exceed one year.\nDisaggregated Revenue\nThe Company disaggregates revenue based upon the nature of its products and services and the timing and in the manner which it is transferred to the customer. Although all products are transferred to the customer at a point in time, hardware and some software is pre-installed on the interactive device are transferred at the point of shipment, while some software is transferred to the customer at the time the hardware is received by the customer or when software product keys are delivered electronically to the customer. All service revenue is transferred over time to the customer; however, professional services are generally transferred to the customer within a year from the contract date as measured based upon hours or time incurred while software maintenance, hardware maintenance, and subscription services are generally transferred over 5 years from the contract execution date as measured based upon the passage of time.\nYear Ended\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n(in thousands)\nDecember 31,\n(in thousands)\nProduct Revenues:\nHardware\n$ 48,460\n$ 28,840\nSoftware\n2,450\n1,460\nService Revenues:\nProfessional Services\n1,300\n1,210\nMaintenance and Subscription Services\n2,680\n1,520\n$ 54,890\n$ 33,030\nContract Costs\nThe Company capitalizes incremental costs to obtain a contract with a customer if the Company expects to recover those costs. The incremental costs to obtain a contract are those that the Company incurs to obtain a contract with a customer that it would not have otherwise incurred if the contract were not obtained (e.g., a sales commission). The Company capitalizes the costs incurred to fulfil a contract only if those costs meet all the following criteria:\n\u25cf The costs relate directly to a contract or to an anticipated contract that the Company can specifically identify.\n\u25cf The costs generate or enhance resources of the Company that will be used in satisfying (or in continuing to satisfy) performance obligations in the future.\n\u25cf The costs are expected to be recovered.\nCertain sales commissions incurred by the Company were determined to be incremental costs to obtain the related contracts, which are deferred and amortized ratably over the estimated economic benefit period. For these sales commissions that are incremental costs to obtain where the period of amortization would have been recognized over a period that is one year or less, the Company elected the practical expedient to expense those costs as incurred. Commission costs that are deferred are classified as current or non-current assets based on the timing of when the Company expects to recognize the expense and are included in prepaid and other assets and other assets, respectively, in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Total deferred commissions at December 31, 2020 and 2019 and the related amortization for 2019 were less than $0.1 million.\nThe Company has not historically incurred any material fulfilment costs that meet the criteria for capitalization.\nWARRANTY RESERVE\nFor customers that do not purchase hardware maintenance services, the Company generally provides warranty coverage on projectors and accessories, batteries and computers. This warranty coverage does not exceed 24 months, and the Company establishes a liability for estimated product warranty costs, included in other short-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets, at the time the related product revenue is recognized. The warranty obligation is affected by historical product failure rates and the related use of materials, labor costs and freight incurred in correcting any product failure. Should actual product failure rates, use of materials, or other costs differ from the Company\u2019s estimates, additional warranty liabilities could be required, which would reduce its gross profit.\nRESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES\nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred and consists primarily of personnel related costs, prototype and sample costs, design costs, and global product certifications mostly for wireless certifications.\nINCOME TAXES\nAn asset and liability approach is used for financial accounting and reporting for income taxes. Deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between income tax and financial reporting and principally relate to recognition of revenue and expenses in different periods for financial and tax accounting purposes and are measured using currently enacted tax rates and laws. In addition, a deferred tax asset can be generated by net operating loss carryforwards. If it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized, a valuation allowance is recognized.\nSTOCK-BASED COMPENSATION\nThe Company estimates the fair value of each stock-based compensation award at the grant date by using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The fair value determined represents the cost for the award and is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award. Total expense is reduced by the fair value of the options that are forfeited prior to vesting when the forfeiture occurs.\nSUBSEQUENT EVENTS\nWe reviewed all material events through the date of these consolidated financial statements were issued for subsequent event disclosure consideration as described in Note 16.\nNEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued Topic 606, which replaced the previous revenue recognition guidance. The Company adopted Topic 606 effective January 1, 2019 using the modified retrospective transition method. Under this method, the Company elected to apply the cumulative effect method to all customer contracts as of the adoption date. The impact to revenue in 2019 as a result of the adoption of Topic 606 was approximately $0.6 million, which is the result of the identification of additional units of accounting or performance obligations upon adoption of Topic 606. Specifically, the Company identified software (previously combined with hardware for accounting purposes), the related software maintenance, and hardware maintenance (previously accounted for under guidance applicable to extended warranties) as units of accounting. Under prior GAAP, no portion of the transaction price was allocated to, and therefore, no revenue was recognized upon the transfer of these products and services. While revenue related to software may only be deferred for up to a few days relative to the timing of revenue recognition under prior GAAP, software maintenance and hardware maintenance revenue will now be recognized over a period of 3-5 years based on the specified term in the contract or the estimated service term, if not specified. As a result, the cumulative impact due to the adoption of Topic 606 on the opening consolidated balance sheet was a decrease in opening retained earnings, with an increase in deferred commissions, an increase in deferred revenue, and a decrease in accrued warranty costs.\nWe adopted ASU 2017-04, \u201cIntangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350: Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment\u201d effective January 1, 2020. ASU 2017-04 simplifies the assessment of goodwill for impairment by eliminating step two from the goodwill impairment test. As amended, the goodwill impairment test now consists of one step comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value. An entity should recognize a goodwill impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit\u2019s fair value. The new pronouncement had no impact to the Company, as the results from step one did not indicate any impairment the needed to be recognized.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issues ASC 842 \u201cLeases\u201d that creates new accounting and reporting guidelines for leasing arrangements. The new guidance requires organizations that lease assets to recognize assets and liabilities on the balance sheet related to the rights and obligations created by those leases, regardless of whether they are classified as finance or operating leases. Under the previous guidance, the recognition, measurement, and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease primarily depended on its classification as a finance or operating lease. The new guidance also requires disclosures to help financial statement users better understand the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. For Small Emerging Growth Companies, the new standard is not effective until annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2020, including interim periods within that reporting period. Earlier application is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this new pronouncement on its financial statements and will adopt the new standard in 2021.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, \u201cFinancial Instruments Credit Losses\u201d (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. The new guidance replaces the incurred loss methodology with the current expected credit loss (CECL) methodology. The measurement of expected credit losses under the CECL methodology is applicable to financial assets measured at amortized cost, including trade accounts receivable. It also applies to off-balance sheet credit exposures not accounted for as insurance (loan commitments, standby letters of credit, financial guarantees, and other similar instruments) and net investments in leases recognized by a lessor in accordance with Topic 842. This new guidance changes the impairment model for most financial assets and certain other instruments. Since the Company is a Small Emerging Growth Company, the ASU is not effective until fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, and interim periods within that fiscal year. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that this standard will have, if any, on its financial statements.\nIn August 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-06, \u201cAccounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity\u2019s Own Equity.\u201d The new guidance simplifies the accounting for certain convertible instruments and for contracts in an entity\u2019s own equity. Key provisions include the elimination of the \u201ccash conversion\u201d guidance and the \u201cbeneficial conversion feature\u201d guidance in ASC 470-20 as well as a simplification of the settlement assessment that entities are required to perform to determine whether a contract qualifies for equity classification by removing certain conditions in ASC 815-40-25. Since the Company is a Small Emerging Growth Company, the ASU is not effective until annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2023. Earlier application is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that this standard will have on its financial statements.\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-12, \u201cIncome Taxes\u201d (Topic 740). The new guidance modifies the requirements for the timing of adoption of enacted change in tax law. The effects of changes on taxes currently payable or refundable for the current year must be reflected in the computation of annual effective tax rate. Since the Company is an Emerging Growth Company, the ASU is not effective until fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that this standard will have, if any, on its financial statements.\nThere were various other accounting standards and interpretations issued recently, some of which may be applicable to the Company but none of which are expected to a have a material impact on our financial position, operations or cash flows.\nNOTE 2 - RECENT BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS\nThe acquisitions described below were accounted for as business combinations which require, among other things, that assets acquired, and liabilities assumed be recognized at their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. Deferred income taxes are recognized and measured in accordance with Topic 740 \u201cAccounting for Income Taxes\u201d. Transaction costs are expensed as incurred. Any excess of the consideration transferred over the assigned values of the net assets acquired would be recorded as goodwill.\nSahara Presentation Systems PLC\nOn September 24, 2020, the Company acquired 100% of the outstanding shares of Sahara Holdings Limited, a private limited company operating under the laws of the UK and all of its subsidiaries, including Sahara Presentation Systems PLC (collectively, \u201cSahara\u201d). Sahara is a distributor of audio and video software and equipment including the Clevertouch branded product line of interactive touch screens. This strategic acquisition expanded the Company\u2019s geographic footprint, industry verticals served, and enhanced the Company\u2019s technology and product offerings.\nAs consideration for the purchase of Sahara, the Company transferred $73.7 million to the Sellers, including $44.9 million in cash (net of $6.0 million in cash acquired) and $28.9 million in convertible preferred stock. The convertible preferred stock was comprised of 1,586,620 shares of Series B convertible redeemable preferred stock (the \u201cSeries B Preferred Stock\u201d) and 1,320,850 shares of Series C convertible redeemable preferred stock (the \u201cSeries C Preferred Stock\u201d). The fair value of the preferred shares issued was $16.5 million and $12.4 million for the Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock, respectively. See further discussion of the features of the preferred shares in Note 11.\nThe consideration transferred to the selling shareholders along with the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. Determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, and the issued shares of Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock requires management to use significant judgment and estimates, including the selection of valuation methodologies, estimates of future revenue, costs and cash flows, discount rates, and selection of comparable companies. The Company engaged the assistance of an independent third-party valuation specialist to determine certain fair value measurements related to acquired assets, and the Series B Preferred Stock, and the Series C Preferred Stock. The excess consideration over the net fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed was recognized as goodwill.\nThe fair value of the deferred revenue at the date of acquisition was determined based on the estimated direct and incremental costs to fulfill the remaining performance obligations associated with the deferred revenue, plus a reasonable profit margin. Accordingly, the carrying amount of deferred revenue at the acquisition date was reduced to its estimated fair value based on the assumptions above which has resulted in and will result in a reduction in revenue that otherwise would have been recognized in periods subsequent to the acquisition date.\nThe fair value or net realizable value of inventories at the date of acquisition was determined using a \u201ctop-down\u201d approach based upon the estimated sales value, less a reasonable profit margin and less the estimated costs to dispose of the inventory, including selling costs and other disposal costs such as freight. Accordingly, the carrying amount of inventories at the acquisition date was increased to its estimated fair value based on these assumptions which resulted in an increase in cost of revenues subsequent to the acquisition date in 2020.\nThe following table summarizes the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed, and the estimate of the fair value of consideration paid:\n(in thousands)\nAssets acquired:\nCash $ 6,049\nAccounts receivable 16,066\nInventories 17,257\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets 2,277\nProperty and equipment\nTotal assets acquired 41,832\nAccounts payable and accrued expenses (8,624 )\nDeferred revenue (9,435 )\nDeferred tax liability (8,794 )\nOther liabilities (293 )\nTotal liabilities assumed (27,146 )\nNet tangible assets acquired 14,686\nIdentifiable intangible assets:\nCustomer relationships 39,629\nTrademarks 5,319\nTechnology 3,372\nTotal intangible assets subject to amortization 48,320\nGoodwill 16,774\nTotal net assets acquired $ 79,780\nConsideration paid:\nCash $ 50,903\nPreferred shares issued 28,877\nTotal consideration paid $ 79,780\nThe following table presents the useful lives over which the acquired intangible assets will be amortized on a straight-line basis, which approximates the pattern by which the related economic benefits of the assets are consumed:\nEstimated\nWeighted Average\nLife (years)\nCustomer relationships\nTrademarks\nTechnology\nGoodwill is primarily attributable to synergies expected from the acquisition and the assembled workforce. The Company incurred a total of $0.2 million in acquisition-related costs and expensed all such costs incurred during the period in which the service was received. Acquisition related costs are included in general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. The results of operations of Sahara since the acquisition are included in the Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Loss for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. Revenue and net loss attributable to Sahara in the period from the acquisition date of September 24, 2020 through December 31, 2020 were $24.7 million and $5.3 million, respectively.\nAs disclosed in the third quarter unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, the Company had not yet finalized its evaluation and determination of the fair value of certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed and recorded provisional amounts based on initial measurements using currently available information. The Company was still gathering information about certain items including income taxes and deferred income tax assets and liabilities. During the fourth quarter, the Company recorded a measurement period adjustment to the initial provisional amounts for deferred income tax assets and liabilities and an immaterial out-of-period correction to the estimated fair value of preferred shares issued which resulting in an increase in goodwill.\nThe following unaudited pro forma information reflects our consolidated results of operations as if the acquisition of Sahara had taken place on January 1, 2019. The unaudited pro forma information is not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that the Company would have reported had the acquisition actually occurred at the beginning of these periods nor is it necessarily indicative of future results. The unaudited pro forma financial information does not reflect the impact of future events that may occur after the acquisition, including, but not limited to, anticipated costs savings from synergies or other operational improvements. The nature and amount of any material, nonrecurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to the business combination are included in the pro forma revenue and net earnings reflected below.\nYear ended December 31,\n(in thousands) (Unaudited)\n(in thousands)\n(in thousands) (Unaudited)\n(in thousands)\nAs Reported Pro Forma As Reported Pro Forma\nRevenues, net $ 54,891 $ 119,207 $ 33,030 $ 129,393\nNet loss attributable common shareholders $ (16,490 ) $ (17,406 ) $ (9,334 ) $ (13,931 )\nMyStemKits and STEM Education Holdings, Pty\nOn April 17, 2020, the Company acquired the assets, and assumed certain liabilities of MyStemKits and STEM Education Holdings, Pty, an Australian corporation (\u201cSTEM\u201d) which is the sole shareholder of MyStemKits, for consideration of $450,000, after working capital adjustments of $150,000. Consideration included $100,000 paid in cash at closing with the balance payable in the form of a $350,000 purchase note payable in four equal installments of $87,500 (the \u201cInstallment Payments\u201d) on July 31, 2020, October 31, 2020, January 31, 2021 and April 30, 2021. Acknowledging the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, on April 17, 2020, the Company and STEM entered into a letter agreement pursuant to which the parties agreed that potential adjustments may be made to the installment payments due on July 31, 2020 and October 31, 2020 in the event the actual gross revenue of MyStemKits is materially below budget. Accordingly, and as agreed between Boxlight and the STEM sellers the note payable has since been adjusted to $175,000.\nThe following table summarizes the fair values of the net assets acquired and the fair value of consideration paid:\n(in thousands)\nAssets acquired:\nCash $ 1\nInventories\nTotal assets acquired\nTotal liabilities assumed (29 )\nNet assets acquired\nIdentifiable intangible assets:\nCustomer relationships\nTrademarks\nTechnology\nTotal identifiable intangible assets subject to amortization\nGoodwill\nConsideration paid:\nCash $ 100\nNote payable\nTotal consideration paid $ 275\nMRI\nOn March 12, 2019, the Company entered into an asset purchase agreement with MRI, based in Miami, Florida.

The Note matures over 24 months, with repayment to commence on November 22, 2020, after which time the Company will be obligated to make monthly payments of $1.0 million, plus interest. Interest accrued during the first two months of the note, after which time the interest payments, including accrued interest is payable monthly in either conversion shares or in cash.

The Company concluded that the warrants should be accounted for as derivative liabilities. In determining the fair value of the derivative liabilities, the Company used the Black-Scholes option pricing model on December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nDecember 31, 2020\nCommon stock issuable upon exercise of warrants 295,000\nMarket value of common stock on measurement date $ 1.53\nExercise price $ 0.42\nRisk free interest rate (1) 0.13 %\nExpected life in years year\nExpected volatility (2) 160.03 %\nExpected dividend yields (3) 0 %\nDecember 31, 2019\nCommon stock issuable upon exercise of warrants 295,000\nMarket value of common stock on measurement date $ 1.11\nExercise price $ 1.20\nRisk free interest rate (1) 1.58 %\nExpected life in years years\nExpected volatility (2) 86.66 %\nExpected dividend yields (3) 0 %\n(1)\nThe risk-free interest rate was determined by management using the applicable Treasury Bill as of the measurement date.\n(2)\nThe historical trading volatility was determined by calculating the volatility of the Company\u2019s peers\u2019 common stock.\n(3)\nThe Company does not expect to pay a dividend in the foreseeable future.\nThe following table shows the change in the Company\u2019s derivative liabilities rollforward for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 (in thousands):\nAmount\nBalance, December 31, 2018 $ 326\nInitial valuation of derivative liabilities upon issuance of warrants\nChange in fair value of derivative liabilities (245 )\nBalance, December 31, 2019 $ 147\nAmount\nBalance, December 31, 2019 $ 147\nChange in fair value of derivative liabilities\nBalance, December 31, 2020 $ 363\nThe change in fair value of derivative liabilities includes losses from exercise price modifications.\nNOTE 10 - INCOME TAXES\nPretax income (loss) resulting from domestic and foreign operations is as follows (in thousands):\nUnited States $ (12,269 ) $ (9,502 )\nUnited Kingdom (4,683 )\nOther Foreign Jurisdictions (21 ) -\nTotal Pretax book income $ (16,973 ) $ (9,402 )\nThe components of income tax benefit at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, are as follows (in thousands):\nCurrent:\nFederal $ - $ -\nState - -\nForeign\nTotal Current $ 645 $ -\nDeferred:\nFederal $ - $ -\nState - -\nForeign (1,466 )\nTotal Deferred $ (1,466 ) $ -\nTotal $ (821 ) $ -\nThe reconciliation of the provision for income taxes at the United States Federal statutory rate compared to the Company\u2019s income tax expense as reported is as follows (in thousands)\nIncome (Loss) before income taxes\nIncome tax benefit computed at the statutory rate $ (3,565 ) $ (1,975 )\nForeign tax rate differential -\nLoss on debt settlement -\nNon-deductible expenses\nOther book-tax differences - (1 )\nPrior period true ups - temporary differences -\nRate changes and differentials (23 )\nChange in valuation allowance 1,197 1,613\n$ (821 ) $ -\nTax effects of temporary differences at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 are as follows (in thousands):\nDeferred tax assets:\nFixed assets $ 62 $ 14\nAllowance for bad debts\nInventory\nAccrued expenses -\nDeferred revenue 2,190 -\nStock compensation -\nOthers\nInterest Expense Limitation\nNet operating loss carry-forwards 7,361 5,646\nDeferred tax assets (liabilities) $ 11,358 $ 6,627\nValuation allowance (7,959 ) (6,627 )\nDeferred tax assets $ 3,399 $ -\nNet deferred tax assets $ 3,399 $ -\nDeferred tax liabilities:\nIntangible assets $ (10,759 ) $ -\nAccrued expenses (404 ) -\nPrepaid expenses (139 ) -\nDeferred tax liabilities $ (11,302 ) $ -\nNet deferred tax liabilities $ (7,903 ) $ -\nThe Company operates in the United States, United Kingdom and other jurisdictions. Income taxes have been provided based upon the tax laws and rates of the countries in which operations are conducted and income is earned. The cumulative U.S. Federal net operating losses carryforward on tax basis income was approximately $26.5 million and $19.6 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, of which $10.6 million will expire between 2029 and 2037 and $15.8 million will carryforward indefinitely. The cumulative U.S. state net operating losses carryforward was approximately $23.0 million and $19.8 million on December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The cumulative foreign net operating losses carryforward was $2.9 million and $2.7 million on December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nPrior to the Sahara acquisition, the Company had a net deferred tax asset position in the United States, the United Kingdom, and other jurisdictions, primarily driven by the aforementioned net operating losses. The recoverability of these deferred tax assets depends on the Company\u2019s ability to generate taxable income in the jurisdiction to which the carryforward applies. It also depends on specific tax provisions in each jurisdiction that could impact utilization. For example, in the United States, a change in ownership, as defined by federal income tax regulations, could significantly limit the Company\u2019s ability to utilize our U.S. net operating loss carryforwards. Additionally, because U.S. tax laws limit the time during which the net operating losses generated prior to 2018 may be applied against future taxes, if the Company fails to generate U.S. taxable income prior to the expiration dates, the Company may not be able to fully utilize the net operating loss carryforwards to reduce future income taxes. The Company has evaluated both positive and negative evidence as to the ability of its legacy entities in each jurisdiction to generate future taxable income. Based on its long history of cumulative losses in those jurisdictions, it believes it is appropriate to maintain a full valuation allowance on its net deferred tax asset at December 31, 2020 and 2019. The change in its valuation allowance during 2020 is approximately $1.2 million.\nDue to the Sahara acquisition, the Company has recognized a net deferred tax liability for the acquired entities, primarily driven by acquired intangible assets for which it does not have tax basis in the jurisdictions in which operates (primarily the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and the United States). The Company does not expect to qualify for any consolidated filing positions in any of these countries, so there is no ability to net the deferred tax liabilities of the Sahara companies against the deferred tax assets of the legacy Boxlight companies. Therefore, the net deferred tax liability of $7.9 million at December 31, 2020 is entirely based on the Sahara acquired entities.\nThe tax years from 2016 to 2020 remain open to examination by the major taxing jurisdictions to which the Company is subject. The Company has not identified any uncertain tax positions at this time.\nOn March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (the \u201cCARES Act\u201d) was enacted. The CARES Act includes provisions, among others, addressing the carryback of net operating losses for specific periods, refunds of alternative minimum tax credits, temporary modifications to the limitations placed on the tax deductibility of net interest expenses, and technical amendments for qualified improvement property. Additionally, the CARES Act provides for various payroll incentives, including Payroll Protection Program (\u201cPPP\u201d) loans, refundable employee retention tax credits, and the deferral of the employer-paid portion of social security payroll taxes. The Company received a $1.1M loan under the PPP, of which over $0.8M is expected to be forgiven under the requirements of the program. Any unforgiven portion will be paid back under the terms of the loan. No other provisions of the CARES Act had a material impact on the Company\u2019s tax provision.\nOn December 27, 2020, the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021 - including the COVID-related Tax Relief Act of 2020 - was enacted. It included a provision that any expenses paid using forgiven PPP loan proceeds would be fully deductible. This has been reflected in the Company\u2019s tax provision.\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-12, Income Taxes (ASC 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes. The standard eliminates the need for an organization to analyze whether the following apply in a given period: (1) the exception to the incremental approach for intraperiod tax allocation; (2) the exceptions to accounting for basis differences when there are ownership changes in foreign investments; and (3) the exception in interim periods income tax accounting for year-to-date losses that exceed anticipated losses. The ASU also is designed to improve financial statement preparers\u2019 application of income tax-related guidance and simplify GAAP for (1) franchise taxes that are partially based on income, (2) transactions with a government that result in a step-up in the tax basis of goodwill, (3) separate financial statements of legal entities that are not subject to tax, (4) enacted changes in tax laws in interim periods and (5) certain income tax accounting for employee stock ownership plans and affordable housing projects. The standard became effective for the Company on January 1, 2021. The Company does not expect adoption to have a material impact on its financial statements.\nOn December 27, 2020, the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021 - including the COVID-related Tax Relief Act of 2020 - was enacted. It included a provision that any expenses paid using forgiven PPP loan proceeds would be fully deductible. This has been reflected in the Company\u2019s tax provision.\nNOTE 11 - EQUITY\nPreferred Shares\nThe Company\u2019s articles of incorporation, as amended on September 18, 2020, provide that the Company is authorized to issue 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock consisting of: 1) 250,000 shares of non-voting Series A preferred stock, with a par value of $0.0001 per share; 2) 1,586,620 shares of voting Series B preferred stock, with a par value of $0.0001 per share; 3) 1,320,850 shares of voting Series C preferred stock, with a par value of $0.0001 per share; and 4) 46,842,530 shares of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock to be designated by the Company\u2019s Board of Directors.\nIssuance of preferred shares\nSeries A Preferred Stock\nAt the time of the Company\u2019s initial public offering, 250,000 shares of the Company\u2019s non-voting convertible Series A preferred stock were issued to Vert Capital for the acquisition of Genesis.

Accordingly, total expense related to the award is reduced by the fair value of options that are forfeited by employees that leave the Company prior to vesting.\nFollowing is a summary of the option activities during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nNumber of Units Weighted\nAverage\nExercise Price Weighted Average\nRemaining Contractual\nTerm (in years)\nOutstanding, December 31, 2018 1,718,024 $ 4.18 4.64\nGranted 802,882 $ 1.84\nExercised - $ -\nCancelled (136,218 ) $ 4.86\nOutstanding, December 31, 2019 2,384,688 $ 3.35 4.15\nGranted 2,956,000 $ 0.76\nExercised (3,751 ) $ 0.70\nCancelled (486,153 ) $ 3.58\nOutstanding, December 31, 2020 4,850,784 $ 1.76\n3.51\nExercisable, December 31, 2020 2,712,087 $ 2.29 2.90\nThe Company estimates the fair value of each stock option award on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model.

In addition, the holders of 96% of the Series C preferred stock agreed to convert those shares into 7,.6 million shares of our Class A Common Stock at a conversion price of $1.66 per share. In the event for any reason, we do not complete the conversion and redemption by June 30, 2021, and the Sahara shareholders do not agree to an extension, the agreement will terminate without liability by any party.\nOn March 23, 2021 the Company acquired 100% of the shares of Interactive Concepts, a Belgium company and a leading distributor of interactive technologies, total consideration of approximately $3.3 million in cash, common stock and deferred consideration.\nOn March 20, 2021, in accordance with the terms of his employment agreement, Michael Pope, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, received 875 thousand restricted common shares, an amount equal to 1.0% of the outstanding Class A Common Stock on a fully diluted basis.

    "item_9A": "ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nAs required by Rule 13a-15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (\u201cExchange Act\u201d), under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company\u2019s disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report.\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nWe maintain disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted to the SEC under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC\u2019s rules and forms, and that information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the principal executive and financial officer as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Our principal executive officer and principal financial officer evaluated the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report (\u201cEvaluation Date\u201d), pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act. Based on that evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of the Evaluation Date, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to material weaknesses described in our report on internal control over financial reporting below.\nNotwithstanding the existence of the material weaknesses, we believe that the consolidated financial statements included in this report fairly present in accordance with U.S. GAAP, in all material respects, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented in this Annual Report.\nLimitations on the Effectiveness of Controls\nA control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Because of the inherent limitations in all controls systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving its objectives.\nManagement\u2019s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nOur principal executive officer and our principal accounting and financial officer are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f). Management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018. In making this assessment, management used the criteria described in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based upon such assessment and due to the existence of the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting described below, our principal executive officer and our principal accounting and financial officer have concluded that, as of December 31, 2020, our internal control over financial reporting was not effective.\n\u25cf Our written policies and procedures over accounting transaction processing and period end financial close and reporting are limited which has resulted in ineffective oversight in the establishment of proper monitoring controls over accounting and financial reporting.\n\u25cf During the fourth quarter we failed to identify and record deferred revenue based on contractual arrangements with a new customer for which terms differ from those customary in contracts with other customers. The error was corrected, and the overall magnitude was not deemed significant once quantified, however, it is reasonably expected that had the magnitude of the error been of a greater materiality, it still may not have been detected on a timely basis.\nIt should be noted that any system of controls, however well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance that the objectives of the system are met. In addition, the design of any control system is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of certain events. Because of these and other inherent limitations of control systems, there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions, regardless of how remote.\nWe acquired Sahara on September 25, 2020. Since the date of the acquisition, we have been assessing Sahara\u2019s internal control over financial reporting to determine their effectiveness and to make controls and procedures consistent across all consolidated entities. We have made changes to procedures and controls and expect to make additional changes in the future. Prior to acquisition, Sahara was not required to document and assess internal control over financial reporting as required under the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. As permitted by guidance issued by the staff of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Sahara has been excluded from the scope of our report on internal control over financial reporting. Sahara was included in our results of operations subsequent to our acquisition on September 24, 2020 and constituted 45% of our consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 78% of consolidated assets as of December 31, 2020.\nIn light of the material weaknesses described above, we performed additional analysis and other post-closing procedures to ensure our financial statements were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Accordingly, we believe that the consolidated financial statements included in this report fairly present in accordance with U.S. GAAP, in all material respects, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented in this Annual Report.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nDuring fourth quarter of 2020, management engaged professional services firms to assist with the preparation of the review of the income tax provision. Management also automated stock-based expense reporting reducing opportunities for errors. There were no additional changes made in the internal controls over financial reporting for the year ended December 31, 2020, that have materially affected, our internal control over financial reporting.",
