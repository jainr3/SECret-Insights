    "item_1": "Item 1. Business\nOverview\nLivePerson, Inc. (\u201cLivePerson\u201d, the \u201cCompany\u201d, \u201cwe\u201d or \u201cour\u201d) makes life easier for people and brands everywhere through trusted Conversational AI. Conversational AI allows humans and machines to interact using natural language, including speech or text. During the past decade, consumers have made mobile devices the center of their digital lives, and they have made mobile messaging the center of communication with friends, family and peers. This trend has been significantly accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic and can now be viewed as a permanent, structural shift in consumer behavior. Our technology enables consumers to connect with businesses through these same preferred conversational interfaces, including Facebook Messenger, SMS, WhatsApp, Apple Business Chat, Google Rich Business Messenger and Alexa. These messaging conversations harness human agents, bots and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to power convenient, personalized and content-rich journeys across the entire consumer lifecycle, from discovery and research, to sales, service and support, and increasingly marketing, social, and brick and mortar engagements. For example, consumers can look up product info like ratings, images and pricing, search for stores, see product inventory, schedule appointments, apply for credit, approve repairs, and make purchases or payments - all without ever leaving the messaging channel. These AI and human-assisted conversational experiences constitute the Conversational Space, within which LivePerson has strategically developed one of the industry's largest ecosystems of messaging endpoints and use cases.\nThe Conversational Cloud, our enterprise-class cloud-based platform, enables businesses to become conversational by securely deploying AI-powered messaging at scale for brands with tens of millions of customers and many thousands of agents. The Conversational Cloud powers conversations across each of a brand\u2019s primary digital channels, including mobile apps, mobile and desktop web browsers, short message service (SMS), social media and third-party consumer messaging platforms. Brands can also use the Conversational Cloud to message consumers when they dial a 1-800 number instead of forcing them to navigate interactive voice response systems (IVRs) and wait on hold. Similarly, the Conversational Cloud can ingest traditional emails and convert them into messaging conversations, or embed messaging conversations directly into web advertisements, rather than redirect consumers to static website landing pages. Agents can manage all conversations with consumers through a single console interface, regardless of where the conversations originated.\nLivePerson's robust, cloud-based suite of rich messaging, real-time chat, AI and automation offerings features consumer and agent facing bots, intelligent routing and capacity mapping, real-time intent detection and analysis, queue prioritization, customer sentiment, analytics and reporting, content delivery, Payment Card Industry (PCI) compliance, cobrowsing and a sophisticated proactive targeting engine. An extensible application programming interface (API) stack facilitates a lower cost of ownership by facilitating robust integration into back-end systems, as well as enabling developers to build their own programs and services on top of the platform. More than 40 APIs and software development kits are available on the Conversational Cloud.\nFor your reference:\n\u2022Conversational AI: Conversational AI allows humans and machines to interact using natural language, including speech or text.\n\u2022Conversational Space: In the Conversational Space, consumers message with brands on their own schedule, using natural language, to resolve their intents - all on their preferred messaging service. The core capabilities of the Conversational Space are voice and text-based interfaces, powered by AI and humans working together. Conversational Space is the simplest, most intuitive interface of all.\n\u2022Conversational Cloud: LivePerson's enterprise-class, AI-powered Conversational Cloud platform empowers consumers to message their favorite brands, just as they do with friends and family.\nLivePerson\u2019s Conversational AI offerings put the power of bot development, training, management and analysis into the hands of the contact center and its agents, the teams most familiar with how to structure sales and service conversations to drive successful outcomes. The platform enables what we call \u201cthe tango\u201d of humans, AI and bots, whereby human agents act as bot managers, overseeing AI-powered conversations and seamlessly stepping into the flow when a personal touch is needed. Agents become ultra-efficient, leveraging the AI engine to serve up relevant content, define next-best actions and take over repetitive transactional work, so that the agent can focus on relationship building. By seamlessly integrating messaging with our proprietary Conversational AI, as well as third-party bots, the Conversational Cloud offers brands a comprehensive approach to scaling automations across their millions of customer conversations.\nComplementing our proprietary messaging and Conversational AI offerings are teams of technical, solutions and consulting professionals that have developed deep domain expertise in the implementation and optimization of conversational services across industries and messaging endpoints. We are a leading authority in the Conversational Space. LivePerson\u2019s\nproducts, coupled with our domain knowledge, industry expertise and professional services, have been proven to maximize the effectiveness of the Conversational Space and deliver measurable return on investment. Certain of our customers have achieved the following advantages from our offerings:\n\u2022the ability for each agent to manage as many as 40 messaging conversations at a time, as compared to one at a time for a voice agent and two to four at a time for a good chat agent. Adding AI and bots provides even greater scale to the number of conversations managed;\n\u2022labor efficiency gains of at least two times that of voice agents, effectively cutting labor costs by at least 50%;\n\u2022improving the overall customer experience, thereby fueling customer satisfaction increases of up to 20 percentage points, and enhancing retention and loyalty;\n\u2022more convenient, personalized and content-rich conversations that increase sales conversion by up to 20%, increase average order value and reduce abandonment;\n\u2022more satisfied contact center agents, thereby reducing agent churn by up to 50%;\n\u2022maintain a valued connection with consumers via mobile devices, either through native applications, websites, text messages, or third-party messaging platforms;\n\u2022leverage spending that drives visitor traffic by increasing visitor conversions;\n\u2022refine and improve performance by understanding which initiatives deliver the highest rate of return; and\n\u2022increase lead generation by providing a single platform that engages consumers through advertisements and listings on branded and third-party websites.\nAs a \u201ccloud computing\u201d or software-as-a-service (SaaS) provider, LivePerson provides solutions on a hosted basis. This model offers significant benefits over premise-based software, including lower up-front costs, faster implementation, lower total cost of ownership, scalability, cost predictability, and simplified upgrades. Organizations that adopt a fully-hosted, multi-tenant architecture that is maintained by LivePerson eliminate the majority of the time, server infrastructure costs, and IT resources required to implement, maintain, and support traditional on-premise software.\nTo further enhance our platform, in September 2020 we signed a partnership with Infosys, a leader in next-generation digital services and consulting. We will work with Infosys to transform our technology infrastructure on the public cloud, to build integrated solutions and a global practice around our Conversational Cloud to sell into their channels and global enterprise\ncustomer base, and to redefine how the world\u2019s top brands communicate.\nMore than 18,000 businesses, including HSBC, Orange, The Home Depot, and GM Financial use our conversational solutions to orchestrate humans and AI, at scale, and create a convenient, deeply personal relationship with their customers.\nLivePerson's consumer services offering is an online marketplace that connects independent service providers (Experts) who provide information and knowledge for a fee via mobile and online messaging with individual consumers (Users). Users seek assistance and advice in various categories including personal counseling and coaching, computers and programming, education and tutoring, spirituality and religion, and other topics.\nLivePerson was incorporated in the State of Delaware in November 1995 and the LivePerson service was introduced in November 1998. In April 2000, the company completed an initial public offering and is currently traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market and the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange. LivePerson is headquartered in New York City. In light of the COVID-19 pandemic and the company\u2019s strong performance working remotely, LivePerson has adopted an \u201cemployee-centric\u201d workforce model that does not rely on traditional offices.\nMarket Opportunity\nLivePerson's proprietary messaging and Conversational AI enable consumers and businesses to use natural language over conversational interfaces such as SMS, Messenger, Apple Business Chat, Google\u2019s Rich Business Messenger, and in-home personal assistants like Alexa, in order to get answers to questions, make purchases and resolve customer care inquiries. These conversational messaging capabilities target lower costs and increased customer satisfaction, retention and revenue by utilizing human agents, AI and bots to provide convenient, personalized and content-rich communication as alternatives to calling a 1-800 number, navigating a website or downloading an app.\nOur view is that once a consumer has established their favorite brands as contacts in their preferred messaging app, they will no longer see a need to call that brand\u2019s 1-800 number, visit their website or download their app. Instead, they will simply select the contact, open up the thread with their entire history with the brand, and then renew the conversation. As a result, the billions of dollars previously invested by brands across these legacy channels will be increasingly allocated to experiences powered by our platform.\nHistorically, brands have predominantly promoted calling the 1-800 number or using email as the primary means of contact with consumers. According to a 2018 IBM report, approximately 270 billion customer service calls are made to contact centers each year. With a median cost per call of approximately $5.60, according to US Contact Center Decision-Makers' Guide, we estimate that businesses spend approximately $1.5 trillion annually to support their 1-800 number call centers. We believe that moving these calls to messaging represents the largest portion of what we estimate is a $60 billion go-to-market opportunity. We estimate that nearly half of this market opportunity is tied to service, and the other half tied to sales, marketing, social and brick and mortar use cases.\nLivePerson is already capitalizing on this Conversational Space transformation. We cite the following considerations:\n\u2022Consumer preference has already shifted away from calling to messaging in our personal lives. Gartner, a technology research firm, estimates that the proportion of voice-based communication will drop from 41% in 2017 to 12% in 2022. In contrast, WhatsApp and Facebook users combined send more than 65 billion messages a day, and, according to Portio Research, people worldwide were estimated to send an estimated 23 billion text messages a day in 2015. According to Gartner, by the end of 2020, more than 500 million consumers have used voice-enabled conversational AI to purchase on digital commerce platforms, growing from 160 million in 2017. The International Smartphone Mobility Report by mobile data tracking firm Infomate found that Americans spend about 26 minutes a day texting, as compared to six minutes a day on voice calls. A survey by transportation booking app, Hailo, found that making phone calls has dropped to the sixth most popular use of a mobile device, behind sending messages, receiving messages, checking email, surfing the Web, and using the alarm clock. The adoption of messaging has not been constrained to younger generations. According to Experian Marketing Services, adults 55 and older send and receive an average of nearly 500 text messages a month.\n\u2022Calling a 1-800 number typically leads to a poor customer experience. Roughly 50% of calls to 1-800 numbers go unresolved, according to IBM, and a 2014 Harris Interactive survey found that \u201c81% of all consumers agree that it is frustrating to be tied to a phone or computer to wait for customer service help.\u201d Research by enterprise analytics firm Mattersight, reinforces this view, with 74% of consumers feeling that call centers are getting worse or at best staying the same. The risk of poor customer service is material, according to Harris Interactive, which found that 89% of consumers will leave and go to a competitor due to bad customer experiences.\n\u2022Conversational experiences, which harness the power of human agents, bots and AI over messaging have been demonstrated to provide a superior alternative to voice calls. LivePerson customers typically see contact center agent efficiency increase by at least two times for messaging on our platform versus voice, while fueling higher customer satisfaction and increased sales conversions. According to a RingCentral survey, \u201cat least 78% of consumers who text wish they could have a text conversation with a business.\u201d An Amdocs global consumer survey had a similar finding, with 76% of consumers stating they would rather use a mobile app than call the contact center. According to Forrester Research's Customer Experience Survey, 73% of US online adults say that valuing their time is the most important thing a company can do to provide them with good service.\n\u2022We believe the combination of strong alignment to consumer communication preferences, high returns on investment and a growing list of proven referenceable customers have positioned the Conversational Space at an inflection point. Approximately 66% of our enterprise customers have adopted messaging by the end of 2020, up from nearly 55% at the end of 2019 and approximately 40% at the end of 2018. In addition, nearly 70% of messaging conversations had automation attached at the end of 2020, up from nearly 60% at the end of 2019 and up from approximately 25% at the end of 2017. In the first year of its launch, our Conversation Bot Builder was deployed by nearly 300 brands. The Conversational Space is growing very rapidly; according to Gartner, by 2022, 70% of customer interactions will involve emerging technologies such as machine learning applications, chatbots and mobile messaging, up from 15% in 2018.\nIn addition to market share opportunities in the legacy 1-800 number call center, we believe that consumer traffic and digital spending will increasingly shift away from websites and mobile apps to conversational engagements. We think that websites and e-commerce have not lived up to the expectations of businesses and that consumers are likewise frustrated with the navigational experience and the challenges of getting questions answered on websites. In fact, after more than 20 years and a global pandemic, e-commerce still only accounts for approximately 18% of total retail sales and, in the United States, Amazon.com accounts for approximately 40% of this share.\nThe low penetration rates of online and mobile e-commerce reflect disappointing website conversion rates, which average less than 5%. Low conversion rates are likely a factor of the trend for websites to be designed for content, as opposed to commerce, so that they can be indexed to show up in web searches. According to Forrester Research, 53% of customers are likely to abandon their online purchases if they can't find quick answers to their questions. This conflict between content and\ncommerce not only impacts revenue, but also drives higher costs, as we estimate that 60%-80% of all calls to 1-800 numbers originate from consumers first visiting a website and then getting confused or not obtaining the answers they seek.\nWe believe that LivePerson's proprietary messaging and Conversational AI offerings provide a superior alternative. Certain LivePerson customers have demonstrated increases in website sales of up to 20%, while lowering the cost of engagement relative to voice or email. No longer are consumers navigating through clicks and searches to find answers across multiple static web pages. Instead they use natural language to engage conversationally with a brand. These conversations can be personalized to each brand\u2019s unique identity and to each consumer\u2019s unique history and preferences. The engagements are content rich, featuring images, reviews, ratings, and videos, and they are convenient, letting the consumer drive the conversation when it meets their needs, and offering the ability to integrate to credit cards, pay wallets and calendars.\nWe also believe that the Conversational Space will steadily eliminate the need for investment in branded apps. We conclude that consumers will increasingly opt to connect with brands through their preferred messaging channels, such as Apple Business Chat, WhatsApp, SMS, Messenger, or Twitter, rather than clutter their mobile devices, waste storage, and potentially impact performance by downloading a multitude of individual apps.\nAnother emerging market opportunity for LivePerson is the leveraging of brick and mortar operations as an extension of the contact center. Retailers, telecommunications companies, and financial services companies, among others, all operate brick and mortar storefronts, where thousands of employees often sit idle during off peak hours. The Conversational Cloud enables our customers to set up campaigns where these employees can connect through messaging to customers in their community, with check-ins, follow ups, and special offers, reinforcing relationships at the local level. For example, a telecommunications company targeted consumers that were local to its storefronts with a trade-in offer. Additionally, our platform can arm employees in the field with the ability to rapidly obtain answers to questions as they engage with customers in the stores. For example, a consumer may have a specific question about a new appliance in a home improvement store, and the employee can engage through our platform with a specialist bot or human agent to obtain detailed information on that appliance. The COVID-19 pandemic has only accelerated adoption of these experiences. While in-store traffic on Black Friday fell by 52% in 2020 compared with 2019, according to Sensormatic Solutions, peak conversation volume on the Conversational Cloud during the 2020 Black Friday to Cyber Monday period grew 200% year over year.\nStrategy\nThe key elements of LivePerson\u2019s business solutions strategy include:\nBuild awareness and drive adoption of the Conversational Space. LivePerson brought our first customer live on messaging in June 2016. Since that time, we have been focused on building awareness for conversational experiences and driving adoption. We have educated businesses on the financial and operational transformation that occurs when a contact center shifts to an asynchronous messaging environment, where the consumer controls the pace of the conversation, which can last minutes, hours or days, from a synchronous call or chat center, where conversations occur in real-time and have a distinct start and end.\nA key component of our industry awareness marketing strategy has been to hold multiple global customer summits each year (events in 2020 were held virtually in light of the COVID-19 pandemic) that target executives from enterprise customers and prospects, and feature a key theme within the Conversational Space, such as Apple Business Chat, Google Rich Business Messenger, IVR deflection or AI. LivePerson customers are the center point of these summits, presenting why they chose LivePerson for conversational experiences, how they achieved success, and what type of ROI they have realized. Each attendee then receives a blueprint for how they can achieve similar outcomes. We have found this strategy to drive strong results for LivePerson, as we have seen a greater than 40% conversion rate on opportunities that were created or advanced as part of the customer summits. By year-end 2020, we had brought approximately 400 customers live on messaging and increased adoption within our enterprise customers to 66%. In addition, nearly 70% of messaging conversations had automation attached. We will continue to focus on building awareness for the Conversational Space and driving adoption of messaging and AI across\nour customer base.\nIncrease messaging volumes by developing a broad ecosystem, expanding customer use cases, and focusing on AI and automation. Our strategy is to drive higher messaging volumes by going both wide across messaging endpoints, deep across consumer use cases, and focusing on AI and automation as the means to deliver powerful scale. LivePerson offers a platform usage pricing model, where customers are offered access to our entire suite of messaging technologies across their entire agent pool for a pre-negotiated cost per interaction. We believe that over time this model will drive higher revenue for LivePerson by reducing barriers to adoption of new messaging endpoints and use cases.\nIn order to drive broad messaging adoption, it is imperative that the Conversational Cloud integrates to all of the messaging apps that consumers prefer to use for communication and addresses all key use cases. For example, if a consumer is an avid WhatsApp user, and a brand only offers SMS as a messaging option, that consumer may be reluctant to try messaging the brand. Therefore, a key strategy of ours has been to build one of the industry\u2019s broadest ecosystems of messaging endpoints and use cases. In June 2016, we launched with In-App messaging. In 2017, we introduced Facebook Messenger, SMS, Web messaging and IVR deflection integrations. In 2018, we added Apple Business Chat, Google Rich Business Messenger, Line, WhatsApp, Alexa, Google Home, Google Ad Lingo and Twitter. In 2019, we added email, allowing brands to manage emails through the same console they use for messaging, and to convert legacy emails into messaging conversations. We also added social monitoring and conversational tools for Twitter and Facebook, and introduced proactive messaging, allowing brands to transform traditional one-way notifications such as flight cancellations or phone plan overage alerts into two-way conversations. Finally, we connected to Facebook and WhatsApp digital advertisements, enabling consumers to initiate messaging conversations for marketing and customer care directly within the advertisement. In 2020, we added Instagram and Google\u2019s Business Messages, allowing brands to bring customer-initiated conversations into the Conversational Cloud directly from Instagram, Google Search, and Google Maps.\nEach channel and use case added opens the door to hundreds of millions of new consumers, providing brands a greater opportunity to shift share away from their legacy contact center channels into messaging. For example, in 2019, leading airlines launched on WhatsApp and Apple Business Chat with the ability to make secure payments; a baseball stadium launched an automated conversational concierge providing answers to a wide range of questions from restroom locations to player stats; and a multinational telecommunications company used proactive two-way messaging for outbound campaigns. In 2020, one of the largest telcos in Australia fully virtualized their contact centers, a leading U.S. quick-serve restaurant launched on Facebook Messenger to help customers order meals, one of the biggest banks in the world launched an Apple Business Chat channel to provide a secure way to perform day-to-day banking, and one of the world\u2019s largest jewelry retailers used the Conversational Cloud and QR codes to sell millions of dollars of product.\nLivePerson makes the management of all these disparate channels seamless to the brand. AI-based intelligent routing, queuing and prioritization software orchestrates these conversations at scale, regardless of which messaging endpoint they originated from, so that human and bot agents can engage with all customers through just one console.\nWe believe LivePerson is leading the structural shift to Conversational AI. In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, leading brands are turning to LivePerson's AI-powered messaging to overcome a capacity gap created by voice call agent work-from-home measures and increased demand for digital engagement as consumers practice social distancing. LivePerson is powering Conversational AI, automation and messaging strategies across a growing number of use cases from care and sales, to marketing, social, conversational advertising and brick and mortar. Our Conversational AI leadership and the increase in adoption have influenced LivePerson\u2019s enterprise and mid-market revenue retention rate, (the trailing-twelve-month change in total revenue from existing customers after upsells, downsells and attrition) which exceeded the high end of our target range of 105% to 115% for 2020. The benefit can also be seen in LivePerson\u2019s average revenue per user (ARPU) for our enterprise and mid-market customers, which increased approximately 35% in 2020 to $465,000 from approximately $345,000 in 2019.\nAttract the industry\u2019s best AI, machine learning and conversational talent. We believe that AI and machine learning are critical to successfully scaling in the Conversational Space, and that in order to develop the industry\u2019s leading technology, we need to attract the industry's best talent. In 2018, LivePerson recruited Alex Spinelli, key architect of the Alexa Operating System at Amazon.com, as our Global CTO. Under Mr. Spinelli\u2019s leadership, LivePerson hired more than 280 of the industry\u2019s brightest data scientists, machine learning engineers and automation engineers, many from firms such as Nike, Amazon.com, Microsoft and Target, who are working exclusively on applying AI to the Conversational Space. LivePerson also expanded its development talent base in Germany, and added key development talent through the acquisitions of BotCentral in Mountain View, California and Conversable in Austin, Texas.\nBring to market best-in-class AI and machine learning technologies designed for the Conversational Space. We believe that in the last decade many vendors introduced AI and bot offerings that created frustrating experiences for consumers and businesses alike, which in turn has eroded trust in automation. Many of these solutions have proven difficult to build and scale, and have been limited by stand-alone implementations that lacked the measurement, reporting and human oversight of conversational platforms such as the Conversational Cloud. In December 2018, LivePerson announced its patent pending AI engine that is designed to overcome these shortcomings and help brands rapidly bring to market conversational AI that can scale to millions of interactions, while increasing customer satisfaction and conversion rates.\nUnlike alternative solutions designed solely for IT departments, LivePerson\u2019s Conversational AI was built to be used by developers and contact center agents. By putting the power of conversational design and bot management in the hands of contact center agents, LivePerson\u2019s Conversational AI gives brands the ability to leverage the employees closest to the customer, those who are most versed in the voice of the brand, and with the most expertise in how to craft successful outcomes for customer service and sales journeys.\nSome of the key innovations behind LivePerson\u2019s Conversational AI include:\n\u2022a holistic approach to scaling AI by combining consumer facing bots, agent facing bots, intelligent routing and real-time intent understanding, with an analytics dashboard that helps users focus on the intents that are impacting their business and prioritize which intents to automate next;\n\u2022bot building software that is based on dialogue instead of workflow or code, so non-technical employees like contact center agents can design automations;\n\u2022leveraging data moat from hundreds of millions of conversations to feed the machine learning that rapidly and accurately detects consumer sentiment and intents in real-time. Customers of LivePerson can use intent understanding for advanced routing, next-best actions, and to fully contain conversations with automation;\n\u2022the establishing of contact center agents as bot managers, ensuring that every conversation is safeguarded by a human and that agents are continuously training the AI to be smarter and drive more successful outcomes;\n\u2022powerful Assist technology that multiplies the efficiency of agents by analyzing intents in real time and then suggesting next best actions, predefined content, and bots that can take over transactional work;\n\u2022pre-built templates for target verticals that provide out of the box support for the top intents and back-end integrations;\n\u2022the ability to bootstrap conversations with existing transcripts, reducing design effort and speeding time to market;\n\u2022third-party AI natural language understanding (NLU) integration, so customers aren't boxed into one vendor; and\n\u2022AI analytics and reporting tailored to the Conversational Space, providing brands with immediate, actionable insights about their businesses and contact center operations.\nOur strategy is to continue to enhance the Conversational AI engine and related products, by leveraging our global R&D footprint and substantial library of mobile and online conversational data, with the aim of increasing agent efficiency, decreasing customer care costs, improving the customer experience and increasing customer lifetime value.\nSustain our leadership position by aligning brands to a vision that transforms how they communicate with consumers and delivers a superior return on investment. We believe that most contact center technology vendors incorrectly view messaging as a feature. They are content with building integrations to a messaging endpoint and offering messaging as just another product in their suite. LivePerson holds the perspective that messaging and AI are the foundation for transforming conversational experiences, disrupting how agents operate and how brands engage with consumers. Brands must adapt their contact centers to an asynchronous messaging environment and leverage a combination of human agents, bots and AI to achieve scale and efficiencies. When done correctly, the entire consumer lifecycle with a brand will be maintained within the Conversational Space, and traffic will steadily shift away from lower returning voice calls, websites, emails and apps to higher returning messaging endpoints.\nWe believe that LivePerson is uniquely positioned to deliver this transformation due to our technology and expertise:\n\u2022The Conversational Cloud, LivePerson's enterprise-class, automation-first, cloud-based platform, was designed for AI-assisted and human-powered messaging in mobile and online channels. The platform offers best-in-class security and scalability, offers the broadest ecosystem of messaging endpoints, is designed for ease of use, and features an AI engine custom built for the Conversational Space, intent recognition, robust real-time reporting, role-based real-time analytics, predictive intelligence, and innovations in customer satisfaction and connection measurement. Additionally, the Conversational Cloud is an open platform with pre-built, enterprise-grade integrations into back-end systems as well as the ability to work across NLU providers.\n\u2022The Company has a data moat built on hundreds of millions of conversations across industries, geographies and use cases that is feeding the machine learning engines that power intent understanding.\n\u2022The platform has expanded to power conversations across a broad spectrum of channels and use cases, from traditional sales and customer service, to marketing, social, email, advertising, and brick and mortar.\n\u2022LivePerson has deep domain expertise across verticals and messaging endpoints, a global footprint, referenceable enterprise brands and a team of technical, solutions and consulting professionals to assist customers along their transformational journeys. We are positioned as an authority in the Conversational Space. We have developed a Transformation Model that is introduced to existing and prospective customers to help guide them on their journeys from legacy and often times inefficient legacy voice, email and chat solutions to modern conversational ones powered by messaging and AI.\nWe believe that LivePerson\u2019s differentiated approach to the Conversational Space, combined with our unique technology and expertise has established us as a market leader, with an ability to deliver superior returns on investment. LivePerson customers manage as many as 40 messaging conversations at a time, as compared to one at a time for a voice agent and two to four at a time for a good chat agent. Adding AI and bots provides even greater scale to the number of conversations managed.\nStrengthen our position in both existing and new industries. We plan to continue to develop our market position by increasing our customer base, and expanding within our installed base. We will continue to focus primarily on key target markets: consumer/retail, telecommunications, financial services, travel/hospitality, technology and automotive within both our enterprise and mid-market sectors, as well as the small business (SMB) sector. In 2019, we made strong inroads into new verticals with key wins in the airline, food service and healthcare industries. In 2020, we strengthened our presence in key markets including travel/hospitality and retail, and opened new verticals like healthcare and government. We are experimenting with new conversational businesses, including some that are in regulated industries, like online banking. We are increasingly structuring our field organization to emphasize our domain expertise and strengthen customer relationships across target industries.\nContinue to build our international presence. We are focused on building our international presence and expanding our international revenue contribution, which accounted for 38% and 41% of total revenue in 2020 and 2019, respectively. We are generating positive results from our recent investments in the Asia Pacific, Europe and Latin America regions.\nLeverage our open architecture to support partners and developers. In addition to developing our own applications, we continue to cultivate a partner eco-system capable of offering additional applications and services to our customers. We integrate into third-party messaging endpoints including SMS, Facebook Messenger, Apple Business Chat, Google Rich Business Messenger, Line, WhatsApp, Alexa, Google Home, WeChat, Google Ad Lingo, Google Search, Google Maps, Instagram and Twitter, multiple IVR vendors and dozens of branded apps. The Conversational Cloud integrates our proprietary messaging and Conversational AI with third-party bot offerings, empowering our customers to manage a mix of different bots, human agents and technologies from one control panel, thereby optimizing contact center efficiency. LivePerson\u2019s proprietary and third-party AI/bots enable brands to partially or fully automate communications with their customers.\nIn addition, we have opened up access to our platform and our products with more than 40 APIs and software development kits that allow customers and third parties to develop on top of our platform. Customers and partners can utilize these APIs to build our capabilities into their own applications and to enhance our applications with their services. In 2019, we launched LivePerson Functions, a serverless Function as a Service (FaaS) integration which enables brands to develop custom behaviors within LivePerson's conversational platform to easily and rapidly tailor conversation flows to their specific needs.\nExpand sales partnerships to broaden our presence and accelerate sales cycles. We are focused on broadening our market reach and accelerating sales cycles by partnering with systems integrators, technology providers, business process outsourcers, value added resellers and other sales partners. We formalized a relationship with IBM Global Business Services in 2017 and Accenture in 2018. In 2019, we announced strategic partnerships with TTEC, a leading BPO focused on customer experience, and DMI, a digital transformation company, to redefine the customer experience with digital engagement, messaging, and AI-driven automation. In 2020, Infosys joined LivePerson's network with a first-of-its-kind 360 degree partnership focusing not only on capturing the global rising demand for conversational commerce and building a personalized experience for customers, but also driving the transformation for internal corporate messaging and the employee experience through Conversational AI. LivePerson increased the number of partners focused on SMBs to more than 300 at year-end 2020 and 2019, from over 150 at year-end 2018, and approximately 40 at the end of 2017. Approximately one quarter of all opportunities were influenced by partners in 2020 and we are focused on driving that contribution toward 50% longer term.\nMaintain market leadership in technology and security expertise. As described above, we are devoting significant resources to creating new products and enabling technologies designed to accelerate innovation. We evaluate emerging technologies and industry standards and continually update our technology in order to retain our leadership position in each market we serve. We monitor legal and technological developments in the area of information security and confidentiality to ensure our policies and procedures meet or exceed the demands of the world\u2019s largest and most demanding corporations. We believe that these efforts will allow us to effectively anticipate changing customer and consumer requirements in our rapidly evolving industry.\nEvaluate strategic alliances and acquisitions when appropriate. We have successfully integrated several acquisitions over the past decade. While we have in the past, and may from time to time in the future, engage in discussions regarding acquisitions or strategic transactions or to acquire other companies that can accelerate our growth or broaden our product offerings, we currently have no binding commitments with respect to any future acquisitions or strategic transactions.\nProducts and Services\nBusiness solutions offerings\nLivePerson\u2019s hosted platforms harness human, AI and bot-powered messaging on mobile apps, mobile and desktop web browsers, SMS, social media and third-party consumer messaging platforms. Our business-to-business services are all managed from a single user interface. By supplying a complete, unified consumer view, our solutions enable businesses to deliver a relevant, timely, personalized, and seamless consumer experience for heads of digital and customer care, as well as e-commerce, marketing, and contact center executives. In addition to product offerings, LivePerson provides professional services and value-added business consulting to support complete deployment and optimization of our enterprise solutions. Revenue attributable to our monthly hosted Business services accounted for 79% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020, 77% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 and 79% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018. Our strategy is to increase the percentage of our total revenue attributable to Business services by leveraging the partner network for a portion of professional services work and the adoption of our self-service tools.\nThe Conversational Cloud. The Conversational Cloud, LivePerson\u2019s enterprise-class, cloud-based platform, enables businesses and consumers to connect through conversational interfaces, such as in-app and mobile messaging, while leveraging bots and AI to increase efficiency. The platform, which is targeted at heads of digital and customer care, as well as e-commerce, marketing, and contact center executives, combines sophisticated mobile and online engagement technology with robust business intelligence and big data to produce compelling, measurable results by intelligently engaging consumers based on a real-time understanding of consumer needs. Rich, contextually aware targeting, actionable insights and personalized experiences, empower businesses to get the most out of their existing online, mobile and social platforms. Potential benefits of the Conversational Cloud include increased agent efficiency, decreased customer care costs, improved customer experiences, higher conversion rates and increased customer lifetime value.\nThe Conversational Cloud was designed for conversational experiences, enabling businesses to securely deploy messaging, coupled with bots and AI, at scale for brands with tens of millions of customers and many thousands of customer care agents. The platform powers conversations across each of a brand\u2019s primary digital channels, including mobile apps, mobile and desktop web browsers, SMS, social media and third-party consumer messaging platforms. Brands can also use the Conversational Cloud to message consumers when they dial a 1-800 number instead of forcing them to navigate interactive voice response systems (IVRs) and wait on hold. Similarly, the Conversational Cloud can ingest traditional emails and convert them into messaging conversations, or embed messaging conversations directly into web advertisements, rather than redirect consumers to static website landing pages. The platform seamlessly integrates LivePerson\u2019s Conversational AI engine as well as third-party bots, enabling brands to manage both AI-based agents and human agents from a single console.\nOur robust, cloud-based suite of rich messaging, real-time chat, AI and automation offerings features consumer and agent facing bots, intelligent routing and capacity mapping, real-time intent detection and analysis, queue prioritization, customer sentiment, analytics and reporting, content delivery, Payment Card Industry (PCI) compliance, cobrowsing and a sophisticated proactive targeting engine. With the Conversational Cloud, agents can manage all conversations with consumers through a single console interface, regardless of which disparate messaging endpoints the consumers originate from; i.e., WhatsApp, Line, Apple Business Chat, IVR, social, email, Amazon Alexa, or WeChat. An extensible application programming interface (API) stack facilitates a lower cost of ownership by facilitating robust integration into back-end systems, as well as enabling developers to build their own programs and services on top of the platform. More than 40 APIs and software development kits are available on the Conversational Cloud.\nThe Conversational Cloud enables the combination of real time on-site data and off-site behavioral data, with a broad set of historical and operational data. Proprietary analytics utilize this data to target end users with compelling engagement options at any step in the conversion funnel and throughout the customer lifecycle. The platform enables customers to maximize online revenue opportunities, improve conversion rates and reduce shopping cart abandonment by proactively engaging the right visitor, using the right channel, at the right time. Our solution identifies segments of website visitors who demonstrate the highest propensity to convert, and engages them in real-time with relevant content and offers, helping to generate incremental sales. The platform also reduces costs in the contact center relative to voice, by identifying consumers who may be struggling with their self-serve experience, and proactively connecting them to a live consumer care specialist via messaging, who can manage several conversations at once. This comprehensive solution blends a proven value-based methodology with an active rules-based engagement engine and deep domain expertise to increase first contact resolution, improve consumer satisfaction, and reduce attrition rates.\nLivePerson\u2019s Conversational AI. LivePerson\u2019s Conversational AI, announced in December 2018, operates as the brains behind new LivePerson AI-based products, and was developed using our conversational data set of millions of brand-to-consumer interactions. LivePerson\u2019s Conversational AI was custom designed for the Conversational Space, putting the power of bot development, training and management into the hands of the contact center and its agents, the teams most familiar with how to structure sales and service conversations to drive successful outcomes. The platform enables what we call \u201cthe tango\u201d of\nhumans, AI and bots, whereby human agents act as bot managers, overseeing AI-powered conversations and seamlessly stepping into the flow when a personal touch is needed. Through the Conversational Cloud, agents become ultra-efficient, leveraging the AI engine to serve up relevant content, define next-best actions and take over repetitive transactional work, so that the agent can focus on relationship building. By seamlessly integrating the Conversational Cloud with our proprietary AI, as well as third-party bots, the platform provides businesses with a comprehensive view of all AI-based and human-based conversations from a single console. Some of the first products developed on LivePerson\u2019s Conversational AI engine include:\n\u2022Conversation Builder, which non-technical staff such as contact center agents use to design high-quality automated conversations. The conversations are not built from scratch. Conversation Builder creates the initial versions by mining a brand's existing conversation transcripts. Prebuilt industry templates are also available, providing the dialogue and integrations necessary for common use cases such as billing.\n\u2022Conversation Manager, a console that suggests automated responses and next best actions to contact center agents, who edit and select from them. Edits and selections dynamically improve the responses and next best actions. When the content reaches a brand-set accuracy threshold, it can be offered to consumers without human intervention. Conversation Manager also includes sentiment monitoring to alert contact center agents to conversations that require their attention. Designed for use in large contact centers, Conversation Manager sends these requests to agents who have the capacity and appropriate skills to respond. A major retail brand that adopted this approach in its sales operation increased agent productivity up to 220% within 12 weeks of launch.\n\u2022Conversation Analytics, dashboards and reporting which take the true voice of the customer - their direct discussions with a brand, spoken in their natural language - and turn it into actionable sales and service intelligence. A major wireless provider using early versions of Conversation Analytics reported the product identifies the root cause of service issues faster than monitoring software, enabling the provider to accelerate the fix and reduce inbound customer inquiries. A leading hospitality firm used Conversation Analytics to identify and add new, top-selling items to its menu selection.\n\u2022Intent Manager, a real-time intent recognition and classification engine that analyzes consumer intentions at every turn of the conversation. Intent Manager is powered by LivePerson\u2019s proprietary natural language understanding capabilities and machine learning algorithms, which are grounded in 20+ years of conversational data and more than one billion messaging transcripts across a variety of industries. Intent Manager is currently being used by top brands to gain real-time insights and take action to improve customer service, marketing, and sales automation\n\u2022Performance Optimizer, a measurement tool to help brands to measure and manage the health of their conversational operations in a single self-service dashboard. Performance Optimizer measures critical metrics for conversational experiences and uses AI to automatically assess performance, provide actionable insights, and deliver executive reporting.\nProfessional Services\nThe mission of our Professional Services team is to help customers optimize the performance of our products in order to drive incremental value through their mobile and online sales and/or service channel(s). This talented group utilizes their deep domain expertise and years of hands-on experience to provide customers with detailed analyses and measurements of their LivePerson deployment that drive strategies and decisions on how to optimize mobile and online messaging, real-time chat, and bot and AI integration. Deliverables of the team include scorecards that measure and chart performance trends, analyses and recommendations for conversational design, web design and process improvement, transcript reviews to discover both voice of the consumer insight and agent improvement opportunities, custom training of call center agents and management, and ongoing management of messaging programs to ensure alignment with current business practices and objectives. The team\u2019s value-added methodology and approach to guiding customers towards messaging channels and human/bot agent optimization is an important component of the LivePerson offering, and gives our customers a competitive advantage in the digital world. Revenue attributable to professional services accounted for 13%, 14% and 13% of total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nConsumer offering\nOur consumer services offering is an online marketplace that connects independent service providers (Experts) who provide information and knowledge for a fee via mobile and online messaging with individual consumers (Users). Users seek assistance and advice in various categories including personal counseling and coaching, computers and programming, education and tutoring, spirituality and religion, and other topics. Revenue from our Consumer segment accounted for approximately 8% of total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nCustomers\nMore than 18,000 customers have deployed our business solutions, including Fortune 500 companies, dedicated Internet businesses, a broad range of online merchants, as well as numerous SMBs, automotive dealers, universities, libraries, government agencies and not-for-profit organizations. Our solutions benefit organizations of all sizes conducting business or communicating with consumers through mobile and online messaging and chat. We plan to continue to focus on key target markets: consumer/retail, telecommunications, financial services, travel/hospitality, technology, healthcare and automotive, within the United States and Canada, Latin America, Europe and the Asia-Pacific region.\nNo single customer accounted for or exceeded 10% of our total revenue in 2020, 2019 or 2018.\nSales and Marketing\nSales. We sell our business products and services by leveraging a common methodology through both direct and indirect sales channels.\nOur sales process focuses on the perspective that the Conversational Space requires an operational transformation that changes how brands engage with consumers across service, sales, marketing, social and brick and mortar. Brands must adapt their contact centers to an asynchronous messaging environment and leverage a combination of human agents, bots and AI to achieve scale and efficiencies. When done right, the entire consumer lifecycle with a brand will be maintained within the Conversational Space, and traffic will steadily shift away from lower returning voice calls, websites, emails and apps to higher returning messaging endpoints.\nOur mobile and online messaging solutions are targeted at business executives whose primary responsibility is optimization of customer care, sales and marketing, or optimizing a consumer\u2019s journey across the brand\u2019s digital properties. Our solutions enable organizations to provide effective customer service, sales and marketing by deflecting costly phone calls and emails to the more cost efficient mobile and online messaging channel. We focus on the value that our solutions deliver in the form of increased agent efficiency, reduced contact center costs, increased customer satisfaction, improved customer lifetime value, maximized digital consumer acquisition, and optimized website and mobile business outcomes. LivePerson supports any organization with a company-wide strategic initiative to improve the overall mobile and online consumer experience.\nWithin the business solutions segment we have aligned our field organization to address the different sales strategies of our target markets:\nEnterprise and large mid-market. We target large mid-market and enterprise businesses with a combination of direct sales and customer success teams, and partners. Across the globe, we are targeting a select group of brands, many of them already customers, that hold the power to transform customer care. These enterprises have thousands of agents in their contact centers and collectively connect with billions of consumers each year. We leverage thought leadership and related events to showcase our strength in messaging and AI, and highlight existing reference customers who share their successes on our platform and how they achieved positive ROIs. Increasingly, we are working with large third-party system integrators, technology providers and business process outsourcers to supplement our direct sales effort.\nFor our large and more complex customers, our sales methodology often begins with research and discovery meetings that enable us to develop a deep understanding of the value drivers and key performance metrics of a prospective customer. We then present an analytical review detailing how our solutions and industry expertise can affect these value drivers and metrics. Once we validate solution capabilities and prove financial return on investment, we transition to a program management model wherein we work hand-in-hand with the customer, providing detailed analysis, measurements and recommendations that help optimize their performance and ensure ongoing program success.\nIn 2018, we introduced a pilot accelerator program, where we offer customers the option to test our entire platform, across all messaging endpoints and customer use cases, at an entry level price point for a period of three to nine months. This pilot program is intended to accelerate sales cycles and enable customers to rapidly assess the potential ROI and differentiation of our solutions before committing to a more substantial and extended deployment.\nSmall business and small mid-market. We target small business and small mid-market customers with a mix of direct, online self-service and third-party partner channels. Our customer acquisition strategy centers on leveraging customer word-of-mouth, our leading brand name, online marketing and partnerships. We also leverage marketing programs and partner resources to promote increased usage and product adoption within these customers.\nIndirect Sales. Resources within our organization are focused on developing partnerships to generate revenues via referral partnerships and indirect sales through channel partners. By maximizing market coverage via partners who provide lead\nreferrals and complementary products and services, we believe this channel supports revenue opportunities without incurring the costs associated with traditional direct sales.\nCustomer Support. Our Professional Services group provides deployment support and ongoing business consulting to enterprise and mid-market customers and maintains involvement throughout the engagement lifecycle. All LivePerson customers have access to 24/7 help desk services through messaging, chat, and technical support ticketing.\nMarketing. Our marketing efforts in support of our business operations are organized around the needs, trends and characteristics of our existing and prospective customer base. Our deep relationship with existing customers fosters continuous feedback and critical data analysis, thereby allowing us to develop and refine marketing programs that drive adoption across multiple customer segments. We have a global team, spread across key geographies that is focused on marketing our brand, products and services to executives responsible for the digital channel, the consumer experience, marketing, sales, IT, and consumer service operations of their organization.\nOur main focus is on the consumer/retail, telecommunications, financial services, travel/hospitality, technology, healthcare and automotive industries. Our integrated marketing strategy is focused on driving demand, building customer and consumer advocacy, driving adoption of our platform, and supporting key areas of business, especially large enterprise, but also including mid-sized and small business, partners and international entities. We aim to achieve this by delivering high-touch, small group events for senior executives, to educate them on messaging and the transformational ways that digital communication can help their business. We also market our software via high-level thought leadership campaigns, industry event participation, personalized lead generation campaigns to reach potential and existing customers using mediums such as paid and organic search, direct email and mail, industry- and category-specific trade shows and events, and telemarketing.\nOur marketing strategy also encompasses a strategic communications approach that integrates public relations, social media, and analyst/influencer relations. We are focused on using those channels to communicate our brand value, to those key stakeholders, to increase overall brand and technology awareness. Communications seek to highlight key customer success stories, and promote executive thought leadership via contributed content, speaking opportunities and press interviews, to raise LivePerson\u2019s profile and reinforce our position as an industry leader.\nCompetition\nThe markets for mobile and online business messaging, and digital engagement technology are intensely competitive, rapidly changing and characterized by aggressive marketing, pricing pressure, evolving industry standards, rapid technology developments and frequent new product introductions. We believe that competition will continue to increase as our current competitors increase the sophistication of their offerings and as new participants enter the market, which may cause additional pricing pressure. If we are unable to accurately anticipate technology developments and continue to innovate in the markets in which we compete, or our competitors are more successful than us at developing compelling new products and services or at attracting and retaining customers, we may lose revenue and market share and our operating results could be adversely affected.\nWe believe that most contact center technology vendors incorrectly view messaging as a feature. They are content with building integrations to a messaging endpoint and offering messaging as just another product in their suite. LivePerson holds the perspective that messaging and AI are the foundation for conversational experiences, which transform how agents operate and how brands engage with consumers across service, sales, marketing, and brick and mortar. Brands must adapt their contact centers to an asynchronous messaging environment and leverage a combination of human agents, bots and AI to achieve scale and efficiencies. When done correctly, the entire consumer lifecycle with a brand will be maintained within the Conversational Space, and traffic will steadily shift away from lower returning voice calls, websites, email and apps to higher returning messaging endpoints.\nWe believe that our differentiated approach to the Conversational Space, combined with our unique technology and expertise, has established the Company as a market leader, with an ability to deliver superior returns on investment:\n\u2022The Conversational Cloud, LivePerson's enterprise-class, automation-first, cloud-based platform, was designed for AI-assisted and human-powered messaging in mobile and online channels. The platform offers best-in-class security and scalability, offers the broadest ecosystem of messaging endpoints, is designed for ease of use, and features an AI engine custom built for the Conversational Space, intent recognition, robust real-time reporting, role-based real-time analytics, predictive intelligence, and innovations in customer satisfaction and connection measurement. Additionally, the Conversational Cloud is an open platform with pre-built, enterprise-grade integrations into back-end systems as well as the ability to work across NLU providers.\n\u2022The platform has expanded to power conversations across a broad spectrum of channels and use cases, from traditional sales and customer service, to marketing, social, email, advertising and brick and mortar.\n\u2022The Company has a data moat built on hundreds of millions of conversations across industries, geographies and use cases that is feeding the machine learning engines that power intent understanding.\n\u2022LivePerson has deep domain expertise across verticals and messaging endpoints, a global footprint, referenceable enterprise brands and a team of technical, solutions and consulting professionals to assist customers along their transformational journeys. We are positioned as an authority in the Conversational Space,. We have developed a Transformation Model that is introduced to existing and prospective customers to help guide them on their journeys from legacy and often times inefficient legacy voice, email and chat solutions to modern conversational ones powered by messaging and AI.\nWe believe this focus on technological innovation, expertise and enterprise-class capabilities is positioning LivePerson as a leader in the Conversational Space. For example, we estimate that LivePerson held an approximate 33% share of Apple Business Chat deployments in 2018, and that the Company at least maintained that position in 2019 and 2020.\nWe have current and potential competition from providers of messaging and digital engagement solutions that enable companies to engage and connect with their consumer customers, as well as technology providers that offer customer relationship management and contact center solutions. We have current and potential competitors in many different industries, including:\n\u2022technology or service providers offering or powering competing digital engagement, contact center, communications or customer relationship management solutions such as, eGain, Genesys, Nuance, Oracle, Salesforce.com and Twilio;\n\u2022service providers that offer basic messaging products or services with limited functionality free of charge or at significantly reduced entry level prices;\n\u2022social media, social listening, messaging, artificial intelligence, bots, e-commerce, and/or data and data analytics companies, such as Facebook, Google, and WeChat, which may leverage their existing or future capabilities and consumer relationships to offer competing business-to-business solutions; and\n\u2022customers that develop and manage their messaging solutions in-house.\nIn addition, many of our current and potential competitors have substantial competitive advantages, such as greater brand recognition, significantly larger financial, marketing, and resource and development budgets, access to larger customer and/or consumer bases, larger and more established marketing and distribution relationships, and/or more diverse product and service offerings. As a result, these competitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to any change in the general market acceptance of messaging services or any new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards, pricing strategies or customer requirements. Also, because of these advantages, potential customers may select a competitor\u2019s products and services, even if our services are more effective. For all of these reasons, we may not be able to compete successfully against our current and future competitors.\nTechnology\nFour key technological features distinguish the LivePerson services:\n\u2022We support our customers through a secure, scalable server infrastructure. In North America, our primary servers are hosted in a fully-secured, top-tier, third-party server center located in the Mid-Atlantic United States, and are supported by a top-tier backup server facility located in the Western United States. In Europe, our primary servers are hosted in a fully-secured, top-tier, third-party server center located in the United Kingdom and are supported by a top-tier backup server facility located in The Netherlands. In the Asia Pacific region, our primary and backup servers are hosted in fully-secured, top-tier, third-party server centers located in Australia. Nearly all of our larger customers outside of the United States are hosted within our UK- and Australia-based facilities. By managing our servers directly, we maintain greater flexibility and control over the production environment allowing us to be responsive to customer needs and to continue to provide a superior level of service. Utilizing advanced network infrastructure and protocols, our network, hardware and software are designed to accommodate our customers\u2019 demand for secure, high-quality 24/7 service, including during peak times such as the holiday shopping season.\n\u2022As a hosted service, we are able to add additional capacity and new features quickly and efficiently. This has enabled us to provide these benefits simultaneously to our entire customer base. In addition, it allows us to maintain a relatively short development and implementation cycle.\n\u2022 As a SaaS provider, we focus on the development of tightly integrated software design and network architecture. We dedicate significant resources to designing our software and network architecture based on the fundamental principles of security, reliability and scalability.\n\u2022LivePerson\u2019s powerful Conversational AI is powered by over 20 years of proprietary, verbatim conversation data that the company has accumulated helping thousands of clients, including the world\u2019s largest brands, message with consumers at scale. The strength of the company\u2019s Conversational AI can also be attributed to the company\u2019s laser focus on brand-consumer conversations. Unlike other AIs, which are applied to wide-\nranging and unrelated use cases, LivePerson\u2019s AI has been built specifically to power conversations between brands and consumers, giving it the edge in understanding consumer intents and the resolutions that best satisfy them.\nSoftware Design. Our software design is based on client-server architecture. Since we are a SaaS provider, Conversational Cloud customers and visitors to our customers\u2019 websites require only a standard Web browser and do not need to download software from LivePerson in order to interact with our customers\u2019 operators or to use the LivePerson services. We also provide APIs that enable our customers and third-parties to integrate the Conversational Cloud with custom designed applications.\nNetwork Architecture. The software underlying our services is integrated with scalable and reliable network architecture. Our network is scalable; we do not need to add new hardware or network capacity for each new LivePerson customer. This network architecture is hosted in co-location facilities with redundant network connections, servers and other infrastructure, enabling superior availability. Our backup server infrastructure housed at separate locations provides our primary hosting facilities with effective disaster recovery capability. We comply with security standards such as SOC2 and PCI. For increased security, through a multi-layered approach, we use advanced firewall architecture and industry-leading encryption standards and employ third-party experts to further validate our systems\u2019 security. We also enable our customers to further encrypt their sensitive data using more advanced encryption algorithms.\nGovernment Regulation\nWe and our customers are subject to a number of laws and regulations in the United States and abroad, including laws related to conducting business on the Internet and on mobile devices, such as laws regarding data privacy, data protection, information security, cybersecurity, restrictions or technological requirements regarding the collection, use, storage, protection, disposal transfer or other processing of consumer data, content, consumer protection, internet (or net) neutrality, advertising, electronic contracts, taxation, provision of online payment services (including credit card processing), and intellectual property rights, which are continuously evolving and developing.\nU.S. and international privacy laws and regulations are evolving and changing, are subject to differing interpretations, may be costly to comply with, and may be inconsistent among countries and jurisdictions or conflict with other rules. As we expand our operations in these countries, our liability exposure and the complexity and cost of compliance with data and privacy requirements will likely increase. Any failure by us to comply with our posted privacy policies, applicable federal, state or international laws and regulations relating to data privacy and data protection, or the privacy commitments contained in our contracts, could result in proceedings against us by governmental entities, customers, consumers, watchdog groups or others, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the increased attention focused upon liability as a result of lawsuits, investigations, and legislative proposals and enactments could harm our reputation or otherwise impact the growth of our business.\nIntellectual Property and Proprietary Rights\nWe rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trade secret, trademark and other common law protections in the United States and other jurisdictions, as well as confidentiality requirements and contractual provisions, to protect our proprietary technology, processes and other intellectual property. We own a portfolio of patents and patent applications in the United States and internationally and regularly file patent applications to protect intellectual property that we believe is important to our business, including intellectual property related to digital engagement technology and web and mobile based consumer-facing services. We believe the duration of our patents is adequate relative to the expected lives of our products and services. We pursue the registration of our domain names, trademarks and trade names in the United States and in certain locations outside the United States. We also own copyrights, including in our software, publications and other documents authored by us. These intellectual property rights are important to our business and marketing efforts. We seek to protect our intellectual property rights by relying on federal, state, and common law rights, including registration, or otherwise in the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions, as well as contractual restrictions. However, we believe that factors such as the technological and creative skills of our personnel, new service developments, frequent enhancements and reliable maintenance are more essential to establishing and maintaining a competitive advantage. Others may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology. We enter into confidentiality and other written agreements (including invention assignment agreements) with our employees, consultants, customers, potential customers, strategic partners, and other third parties, and through these and other written agreements, we attempt to control access to and distribution of our software, documentation and other proprietary information. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, third parties may, in an unauthorized manner, attempt to use, copy or otherwise obtain and market or distribute our intellectual property rights or technology or otherwise develop a service with the same functionality as our services. Policing unauthorized use of our services and intellectual property rights is difficult, and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent misappropriation of our technology or intellectual property rights, particularly in foreign countries where we do business, where our services are sold or used, where the laws may not\nprotect proprietary rights as fully as do the laws of the United States or where enforcement of laws protecting proprietary rights is not common or effective.\nSubstantial litigation regarding intellectual property rights exists in the software industry. In the ordinary course of our business, our services and/or our customers' use of our services have been and may be increasingly subject to third-party infringement claims as claims by non-practicing entities become more prevalent and as the number of competitors in our industry segment grows and the functionality of services in different industry segments overlaps. Some of our competitors in the market for digital engagement technology and/or web and mobile based consumer-facing services or other third parties may have filed or may intend to file patent applications covering aspects of their technology and have asserted or may assert claims against us. Any claims alleging infringement of third-party intellectual property rights could require us to spend significant amounts in litigation (even if the claim is invalid), distract management from other tasks of operating our business, pay substantial damage awards, prevent us from selling our products, delay delivery of our services, develop non-infringing software, technology, business processes, systems or other intellectual property (none of which might be successful), or limit our ability to use the intellectual property that is the subject of any of these claims, unless we enter into license agreements with the third parties (which may be costly, unavailable on commercially reasonable terms, or not available at all). Therefore, any such claims could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nThe duration of the protection afforded to our intellectual property depends on the type of property in question, the laws and regulations of the relevant jurisdiction and the terms of its license agreements with others. With respect to our trademarks and trade names, trademark laws and rights are generally territorial in scope and limited to those countries where a mark has been registered or protected. While trademark registrations may generally be maintained in effect for as long as the mark is in use in the respective jurisdictions, there may be occasions where a mark or title is not registrable or protectable or cannot be used in a particular country. In addition, a trademark registration may be cancelled or invalidated if challenged by others based on certain use requirements or other limited grounds. The duration of property rights in trademarks, service marks and tradenames in the United States, whether registered or not, is predicated on our continued use.\nHuman Capital Management\nAs a leading provider of conversational solutions, we are at the forefront of a consumer-led shift to Conversational AI, and our Conversational Cloud is setting the industry standard for this future. As a result of these efforts, LivePerson was named to Fast Company\u2019s annual list of the World\u2019s Ten Most Innovative Artificial Intelligence Companies of 2020. Our employees understand that they are critical to our mission of making life easier for people and brands everywhere through trusted Conversational AI. We will continue to invest in the diversity, inclusiveness, health and happiness of our employees in order to foster creativity, productivity and growth.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had 1,201 full-time employees worldwide, located in more than 12 countries. Of these, 603 were located in the Americas, 502 in Europe, Middle East and Africa and 96 in Asia-Pacific. Although we have statutory employee representation obligations in certain countries, our U.S. employees are not covered by collective bargaining arrangements. We believe we have good relations with our employees. For 2020, our key human capital management efforts focused on the following:\nTalent Acquisition and Development\nWe place a high priority on attracting, recruiting, developing and retaining diverse global talent. As a company, we are focused on benefits and programs that support our employees across the entire employee lifecycle, from recruitment and onboarding, to well-being, learning and development. Our recruiting processes are designed to ensure that we bring on employees who are aligned to our values and culture, and we follow a comprehensive process in order to solicit multiple perspectives and eliminate bias. In 2020, we scaled and expanded an internal program to train employees to become objective \u201chiring experts\u201d and to reduce unconscious bias in the hiring process. We also launched a new virtual onboarding and orientation program for new hires globally, which includes a multi-day immersion into our principles and team building exercises.\nIn 2020, we also launched a \u201cLivePerson AI Native\u201d program, a four week seminar style cohort program to ensure LivePerson employees understand the foundation of AI and how AI is transforming industries and society. The program also features monthly external AI speakers and a monthly podcast series showcasing internal product leaders and AI specialists. Approximately 25% of employees earned LivePerson AI Native certificates during 2020, and we plan to expand the program during 2021 due to continuing employee demand.\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion\nDiversity, equity and inclusion (\u201cDEI\u201d) is core to our global strategy. We believe that diverse and inclusive teams foster innovation, creativity and productivity. We have invested resources in this area for some time, and will continue to enhance and improve our efforts. For example, we required all employees hired for recruiting roles in 2020 to have demonstrated previous DEI recruiting experience. We also began working with two diversity recruiting platforms, intentionally diversified our interview panels, and recalibrated our job description templates to focus more heavily on inclusivity.\nWe are committed to fostering a diverse and inclusive workplace that celebrates different perspectives, cultures and experiences. We regularly measure the representation of women and minority groups in the company, including in leadership and technical positions, and will continue our ongoing efforts to increase hiring of employees from these groups. We are committed to equal pay for equal work. As part of that commitment, we run a pay equity analysis when we conduct our annual compensation assessments and when we grant equity.\nDuring 2020, we launched an employee-led diversity council empowered to drive global programs focused on DEI as well as to support independent employee resource groups and help ensure the diversity of teams and projects within our company. We have launched several employee-led DEI programs under this umbrella in 2020, including a Women in Technology (WiT) program, a peer mentoring program that we plan to scale in 2021, and multiple thought leadership programs and seminars devoted to DEI topics.\nEmployee Wellness and COVID-19 Response\nWe remain focused on programs that promote the total wellness of our employees, including resources and services to support physical, mental and financial wellness. We offer industry-leading benefits packages based on the diverse needs of our employees and their families, including comprehensive healthcare, accident insurance, a 401(k) plan, an employee stock purchase program, and time off programs. We work hard to ensure that our employees are aware of and take advantage of these opportunities, and we review our programs annually to ensure they remain competitive.\nThis was particularly important during the COVID-19 pandemic, where we proactively prioritized the safety and health of our employees. Before local health experts suggested shelter in place initiatives, we began to limit business travel and encourage all employees to work remotely. We went on to adopt a company policy for all employees to work from home and closed virtually all of our offices (including our corporate headquarters). Since transitioning to a remote work environment, we established multiple employee-led committees to design future of work programs and launched two surveys to gather employee feedback. Based on survey results from over 75% of our global workforce, we identified key themes and opportunities for enhancement, and we have already implemented several employee recommendations.\nWe also provided opportunities for virtual peer connection, virtual learning, and enhanced emotional well being benefits and programs, along with flexible work arrangements to ensure our employees have the resources they need to care for themselves and their families. We will continue to offer time away, wellness and caregiving leave and financial support and reimbursement for work from home equipment to foster a healthy and happy workforce and community with support for productive remote workspaces.\nWebsite Access to Reports\nWe make available, free of charge, on our website ( www.liveperson.com ), our annual reports on Form 10-K, our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and our current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Sections 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as soon as reasonably practicable after we have electronically filed such material with, or furnished it to, the Securities and Exchange Commission.

    "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe following are certain of the important risk factors that could cause, or contribute to causing, our actual operating results to differ materially from those indicated, expected or suggested by forward-looking statements made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or presented elsewhere by management from time to time. The risks described below are not the only\nones we face. Additional risks not presently known to us, or that we currently deem to be immaterial, could also materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, prospects and/or the price of our outstanding securities.\nSummary of Risk Factors\nThe following is a summary of the principal risks and uncertainties that could materially adversely affect our business, results\nof operations, financial condition, cash flows, prospects and/or the price of our outstanding securities, and make an investment\nin our securities speculative or risky. You should read this summary together with the more detailed description of each risk\nfactor contained below.\nRisks Related to Operating our Business\n\u2022Our business depends significantly on our ability to retain our key personnel, attract new personnel, and manage attrition.\n\u2022Supporting our existing and growing customer base could strain our personnel resources and infrastructure, and if we are unable to scale our operations and increase productivity, we may not be able to successfully implement our business plan.\n\u2022The success of our business depends on retention of existing customers and their purchase of additional services, and attracting new customers and new consumer users of our consumer services.\n\u2022Our expansion into new products, services and technologies could subject us to additional risks.\n\u2022Major public health issues, and specifically the pandemic caused by the spread of COVID-19, could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, prospects and/or the price of our outstanding securities.\n\u2022If we do not successfully integrate past or potential future acquisitions, we may not realize the expected business or financial benefits and our business could be adversely impacted.\n\u2022Capital needs necessary to execute our business strategy could increase substantially and we may not be able to secure additional financing to execute this strategy.\n\u2022Our sales cycles can be lengthy, and the timing of sales can be difficult to predict, which may cause our operating results to vary significantly.\n\u2022Delays in our implementation cycles could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nRisks Related to our Financial Condition and Operating Results\n\u2022Our quarterly revenue and operating results may fluctuate significantly, which may cause a substantial decline in the trading price of our securities.\n\u2022In the past we have experienced losses, we had an accumulated deficit of $391.9 million as of December 31, 2020 and we may incur losses in the future.\n\u2022The non-payment or late payment of amounts due to us from a significant number of customers may negatively impact our financial condition or make it difficult to forecast our revenues accurately.\n\u2022Because we recognize revenue from subscriptions for our service over the term of the subscription, declines in business may not be immediately reflected in our operating results.\nRisks Related to Industry Dynamics and Competition\n\u2022If we are unable to develop and maintain successful relationships with social media and other third-party consumer messaging platforms and endpoints, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n\u2022If we are unable to effectively operate on mobile devices, our business could be adversely affected.\n\u2022The markets in which we participate are highly competitive, and we may lose customers and revenue if we are not able to innovate or effectively compete.\n\u2022Downturns in the global economic environment or in particular industries in which our sales are concentrated may adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Security Vulnerabilities and Service Reliability\n\u2022Failures or security breaches in our services or systems, those of our third party service providers, or in the websites of our customers, including those resulting from cyber-attacks, security vulnerabilities, defects or errors, could harm our business.\n\u2022We may be liable if third parties access or misappropriate confidential or personal data from our systems or services.\n\u2022We provide service level commitments to certain customers. If we do not meet these contractual commitments, we could be obligated to provide credits or refunds or face contract terminations, which could adversely affect our revenue and harm our reputation.\n\u2022We are dependent on technology systems and third-party content that are beyond our control.\n\u2022Failure to license necessary third party software for use in our products and services, or failure to successfully integrate third party software, could cause delays or reductions in our sales, or errors or failures of our service.\nRisks Related to Regulatory and Data Privacy Issues\n\u2022Our business is subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws and regulations regarding privacy and data protection, and increased public scrutiny of privacy and security issues could result in increased government regulation, industry standards and other legal obligations that could adversely affect our business.\n\u2022We may be subject to governmental export controls and economic sanctions regulations that could impair our ability to compete in international markets due to licensing requirements and could subject us to liability if we are not in compliance with applicable laws.\n\u2022Industry-specific regulation is evolving and unfavorable industry-specific laws, regulations or interpretive positions could harm our business.\n\u2022Future regulation of the Internet or mobile devices may slow our growth, resulting in decreased demand for our services and increased costs of doing business.\nRisks Related to our Intellectual Property\n\u2022Our products and services may infringe upon intellectual property rights of third parties and any infringement could require us to incur substantial costs and may distract our management.\n\u2022Our business and prospects would suffer if we are unable to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights.\n\u2022Issues in the use of AI in our product offerings may result in reputational harm or liability.\nRisks Related to our International Operations and Tax Issues\n\u2022Our results of operations may be adversely impacted due to our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\n\u2022We may be unsuccessful in expanding our operations internationally and/or into direct-to-consumer services due to additional regulatory requirements, tax liabilities, currency exchange rate fluctuations and other risks, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\n\u2022Our operations may expose us to greater than anticipated income, non-income and transactional tax liabilities, which could harm our financial condition and results of operations.\n\u2022Our ability to use our net operating losses to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations.\n\u2022Political, economic and military conditions in Israel could negatively impact our Israeli operations.\nRisks Related to our Outstanding Convertible Notes\n\u2022Servicing our debt may require a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our indebtedness.\n\u2022We may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to settle conversions of the Notes in cash or to repurchase the Notes upon a fundamental change, and any future debt may contain limitations on our ability to pay cash upon conversion or repurchase of the Notes.\n\u2022Provisions in the indentures for the Notes may deter or prevent a business combination that may be favorable to you.\n\u2022The conditional conversion feature of the Notes, if triggered, may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\n\u2022The accounting method for convertible debt securities that may be settled in cash, such as the Notes, could have a material effect on our reported financial results.\n\u2022The capped call transactions may affect the value of the Notes and our common stock.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock\n\u2022Our stock price has been, and may continue to be, highly volatile, which could reduce the value of your investment and subject us to litigation.\n\u2022Our common stock is traded on more than one market and this may result in price variations.\n\u2022If our officers, directors and largest stockholders choose to act together, they may be able to significantly influence our management and operations, acting in their own best interest and not necessarily those of our other stockholders.\n\u2022Future sales of substantial amounts of our common stock may negatively affect our stock price.\n\u2022Provisions in our charter documents and Delaware law could discourage, delay or prevent a takeover that stockholders may consider favorable.\nRisks Related to Operating our Business\nOur business depends significantly on our ability to retain our key personnel, attract new personnel, and manage attrition.\nOur success depends largely on the continued services of our senior management team. The loss of one or more members of senior management could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We are also substantially dependent on the continued service of other key personnel, including key sales executives responsible for revenue generation and key development personnel accountable for product and service innovation and timely development and delivery of upgrades and enhancements to our existing products and services. Changes to senior management and key employees could also lead to additional unplanned losses of key employees. The loss of key employees could seriously harm our ability to release new products and services and upgrade existing products and services on a timely basis, and put us at a competitive disadvantage.\nIn the technology industry, there is substantial competition for key personnel, including skilled engineers, sales executives and operations personnel. We may not be able to successfully recruit, integrate and retain qualified personnel in the future, which could impact our ability to innovate and deliver new or updated products to our customers, which could harm our business. Among other things, our decision to close virtually all of our offices following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic may make it harder for us to recruit and retain our personnel. If our retention and recruitment efforts are ineffective, employee turnover could increase and our ability to provide services to our customers would be materially and adversely affected. Furthermore, the requirement to expense stock options may discourage us from granting the size or type of stock option awards that job candidates may require in order to join our company.\nIn addition, we may not be able to outsource certain functions. We expect to evaluate our needs and the performance of our staff on a periodic basis, and may choose to make adjustments in the future. If the size of our staff is significantly reduced, either by our choice or otherwise, it may become more difficult for us to manage existing, or establish new, relationships with customers and other counter-parties, or to expand and improve our service offerings. It may also become more difficult for us to implement changes to our business plan or to respond promptly to opportunities in the marketplace. Further, it may become more difficult for us to devote personnel resources necessary to maintain or improve existing systems, including our financial and managerial controls, billing systems, reporting systems and procedures. Thus, any significant amount of staff attrition could cause our business and financial results to suffer.\nSupporting our existing and growing customer base could strain our personnel resources and infrastructure, and if we are unable to scale our operations and increase productivity, we may not be able to successfully implement our business plan.\nWe continue to experience significant growth in our customer base and personnel, which has placed a strain on our management, administrative, operational and financial infrastructure. We anticipate that additional investments in our internal infrastructure, data center capacity, research, customer support and development, and real estate spending will be required to scale our operations and increase productivity, to address the needs of our customers, to further develop and enhance our services, to expand into new geographic areas, and to scale with our overall growth. We may also need to make additional investments with third party outsourcing providers, such our announced plans to work with Infosys to move our technology infrastructure to the public cloud. The additional investments we are making will increase our cost base, which will make it more difficult for us to offset any future revenue shortfalls by reducing expenses in the short term, and there is no guarantee that they will be successful or meet our customers\u2019 needs.\nWe regularly upgrade or replace our various software systems. If the implementations of these new applications are delayed, or if we encounter unforeseen problems with our new systems or in migrating away from our existing applications and systems, our operations and our ability to manage our business could be negatively impacted.\nOur success will depend in part upon the ability of our senior management to manage our projected growth effectively. To do so, we must continue to increase the productivity of our existing employees and to hire, train and manage new employees as needed. To manage the expected domestic and international growth of our operations and personnel, we will need to continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls, our reporting systems and procedures, and our utilization of real estate. If we fail to successfully scale our operations and increase productivity, we may be unable to execute our business plan and the market price of our securities could decline.\nThe success of our business depends on retention of existing customers and their purchase of additional services, and attracting new customers and new consumer users of our consumer services.\nOur customers typically subscribe for our services for a twelve month term and may have no obligation to renew their subscription after expiration of the twelve month term. In some cases, our agreements are terminable or may terminate upon 30 to 90 days\u2019 notice without penalty. If a significant number of our customers, or any one customer to whom we provide a significant amount of services, were to terminate services, reduce the amount of services purchased, or fail to purchase additional services, our results of operations may be negatively and materially affected. Dissatisfaction with the nature or quality of our services could also lead customers to terminate our service.\nWe depend on monthly fees and interaction-based fees from our services for substantially all of our revenue. As part of our strategy, we are increasingly offering customers subscriptions with interaction-based fees. While this interaction-based fee model has demonstrated success in our business to date, it could potentially produce greater variability in our revenue as revenue in this model is impacted by the number of interactions that our customers generate through use of our products. Because of the historically small amount of services sold in initial orders, we depend significantly on the growth of our customer base and sales to new customers and sales of additional services to our existing customers. The success of our consumer offerings similarly depends on our ability to attract and retain new customers. Our revenue could decline unless we are able to obtain additional customers or alternate revenue sources.\nOur expansion into new products, services and technologies could subject us to additional risks.\nWe may have limited or no experience in new market segments that we enter or new services that we decide to offer, and customers may not choose to buy or use our service offerings. These offerings, which can present new and difficult technology challenges, may subject us to claims if customers of these offerings experience service disruptions or failures or other quality issues. In addition, profitability, if any, in our newer activities may not meet our expectations, and we may not be successful enough in these newer activities to recoup our investments in them. Failure to realize the benefits of amounts we invest in new technologies, products, or services could result in the value of those investments being written down or written off.\nMajor public health issues, and specifically the pandemic caused by the spread of COVID-19, could have a material adverse\nimpact on our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, prospects and/or the price of our outstanding\nsecurities.\nOur results of operations could in the future be materially adversely impacted by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. We closely monitor developments related to the COVID-19 pandemic to assess its impact on our business. While still evolving, the global spread of the COVID-19 pandemic has created significant economic disruption, and financial volatility and uncertainty both in the U.S. and around the world. Though vaccines believed to be highly effective at preventing symptomatic COVID-19 have been produced and are currently in the process of being distributed, it is not possible to estimate how long it will take to halt the spread of the virus or the longer term-effects that the COVID-19 pandemic could have on our business. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows or prospects will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and that we may not be able to accurately predict, including the duration and severity of the pandemic; governmental, business and individuals\u2019 actions that have been and continue to be taken in response to the pandemic; the rate of vaccine adoption, the efficacy of vaccines in the broader population, and how widespread such vaccine adoption is; the impact of the pandemic on economic activity and actions taken in response; the effect on our clients and client demand for our services and solutions, including the potential lengthening of the sales cycle; our ability to sell and provide our services and solutions, including through in-person global customer summits, which have proven successful for us in the past, travel restrictions and people working from home; the ability of our clients to pay for our services and solutions; and any closures of our and our clients\u2019 offices and facilities. Clients may also slow down decision making, delay planned work, seek to terminate existing agreements and/or delay payment terms.\nWhile we have implemented risk management and contingency plans and taken preventive measures and other precautions, the ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business is uncertain. In 2020, due to health concerns related to the global novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, we vacated our physical offices around the world, and began transitioning to a work-from-anywhere model. While we have been able to operate effectively from remote locations, the long-term impact of such work arrangements remains unknown. For example, such remote work arrangements may increase the risk of cyber incidents or data breaches. Furthermore, we have incurred, and will in the future incur, expenses associated with the early termination of various leases at our office locations around the world.\nWe also outsource certain critical business activities to third parties and plan to continue to increase these activities, such as through our announced outsourcing partnership with Infosys. As a result, we rely upon the successful implementation and execution of the business continuity and repopulation planning of such entities in the current environment. While we\nclosely monitor the business continuity activities of these third parties, successful implementation and execution of their business continuity and repopulation strategies are largely outside our control. If one or more of the third parties to whom we outsource certain critical business activities experience operational failures as a result of the impacts from the spread of COVID-19, or claim that they cannot perform due to a force majeure, it may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows.\nWhile governmental and non-governmental organizations are engaging in efforts to combat the spread and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic and related public health issues, these measures may not be effective. We also cannot predict how legal and regulatory responses to concerns about the COVID-19 pandemic and related public health issues will impact our business. Such events or conditions could result in additional regulation or restrictions affecting the conduct of our business in the future.\nAny of these events or other currently unforeseen consequences of the coronavirus pandemic, or of other pandemics, epidemics or similar widespread public health concerns, could cause or contribute to the risks and uncertainties enumerated in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, prospects and/or the price of our outstanding securities.\nIf we do not successfully integrate past or potential future acquisitions, we may not realize the expected business or financial benefits and our business could be adversely impacted.\nAs part of our business strategy, we have made and will continue to make acquisitions to add complementary businesses, products, technologies, revenue and intellectual property rights. We have made a number of acquisitions in the past, including three in 2018. In October 2018, we acquired AdvantageTec, Inc., a leading provider of texting solutions for service departments of automotive dealerships that helps enable the conversational experience across the entire dealership, including variable and fixed operations. In September 2018, we acquired the employees and technology assets of Conversable, Inc. a SaaS based Artificial Intelligence powered conversational platform. In January 2018, we acquired the employees and technology assets of BotCentral, Inc., a Silicon Valley based startup which has created a number of bot solutions for major brands in banking, insurance, and travel, running on LivePerson\u2019s conversational platform.\nAcquisitions and investments involve numerous risks to us, including:\n\u2022 potential failure to achieve the expected benefits of the combination or acquisition;\n\u2022 inability to generate sufficient revenue to offset acquisition or investment cost;\n\u2022 difficulties in integrating operations, technologies, products and personnel;\n\u2022 diversion of financial and management resources from efforts related to existing operations;\n\u2022 risks of entering new markets in which we have little or no experience or where competitors may have stronger\nmarket positions;\n\u2022 potential loss of our existing key employees or key employees of the company we acquire;\n\u2022 inability to maintain relationships with customers and partners of the acquired business\n\u2022 potential unknown liabilities associated with the acquired businesses; and\n\u2022 the tax effects of any such acquisitions.\nThese difficulties could disrupt our ongoing business, expose us to unexpected costs, distract our management and employees, increase our expenses and adversely affect our results of operations. Furthermore, we may incur debt or issue equity securities to pay for any future acquisitions. The issuance of equity securities could be dilutive to our existing stockholders.\nCapital needs necessary to execute our business strategy could increase substantially and we may not be able to secure additional financing to execute this strategy.\nTo the extent that we require additional funds to support our operations or the expansion of our business, or to pay for acquisitions, we may need to sell additional equity, issue debt or convertible securities or obtain credit facilities through financial institutions. In the past, we have obtained financing principally through the sale of preferred stock, common stock, warrants and convertible notes. If additional funds are raised through the issuance of debt or preferred equity securities, these securities could have rights, preferences and privileges senior to holders of common stock, and could have terms that impose restrictions on our operations. If additional funds are raised through the issuance of additional equity or convertible securities, our stockholders could suffer dilution. We cannot assure you that additional funding, if required, will be available to us in amounts or on terms acceptable to us. If sufficient funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, our ability to fund any potential expansion, take advantage of acquisition opportunities, develop or enhance our services or products, or otherwise respond to competitive pressures would be significantly limited. Those limitations would materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nOur sales cycles can be lengthy, and the timing of sales can be difficult to predict, which may cause our operating results to\nvary significantly.\nThe sales cycle for our products can be several months or more and varies substantially from customer to customer, particularly for sales to enterprise customers. Because we sell complex, integrated solutions, it can take many months to close sales as customers evaluate our product offering against available alternatives and define their requirements. We are often required to expend substantial time, effort, and money educating potential customers them about the value of our offerings. The increasingly complex needs of our customers can contribute to a longer sales cycle.\nAdditionally, our quarterly sales have historically reflected an uneven pattern in which a disproportionate percentage of a quarter\u2019s total sales occur in the last month, weeks and days of each quarter. These patterns make prediction of revenue especially difficult and uncertain and increase the risk of unanticipated variations in our results of operations. As a result, we are not always able to precisely predict the quarter in which expected sales will occur. In addition, historically a large portion of our revenue has derived from large orders from large clients. Consequently, delays in the closing of sales, especially from large clients, could have a material impact on the timing of revenue and results of operations.\nDelays in our implementation cycles could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nCertain of our products require some implementation services, including but not limited to, training our customers. As an open platform, we also work with other third parties on implementing a variety of integrations into our platform. We have historically experienced a lag between signing a customer contract and recognizing revenue from that customer. Although this lag has typically ranged from 30 to 90 days, it may take more time between contract signing and recognizing revenue in certain situations. If we experience delays in implementation or do not meet project milestones in a timely manner, we could be obligated to devote more customer support, engineering and other resources to a particular project. If new or existing customers cancel or have difficulty deploying our products or require significant amounts of our professional services, support, or customized features, revenue recognition could be canceled or delayed and our costs could increase, which could negatively impact our operating results.\nOur services are subject to payment-related risks.\nFor certain payment methods, including credit and debit cards, we pay interchange and other fees, which may increase over time and raise our operating costs and lower our profit margins. We rely on third parties to provide payment processing services, including the processing of credit cards and debit cards and it could disrupt our business if these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us. We are also subject to payment card association operating rules, certification requirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers, which could change or be reinterpreted in such a way as to make compliance infeasible. If we fail to comply with these rules or requirements, we may be subject to fines and higher transaction fees and lose our ability to accept credit and debit card payments from our customers or facilitate other types of online payments, and our business and operating results could be adversely affected.\nThrough our consumer-facing platform, we facilitate online transactions between individual service providers who provide online advice and information to consumers. In connection with these services, we accept payments using a variety of methods, such as credit card, debit card and PayPal. These payments are subject to \u201cchargebacks\u201d when consumers dispute payments they have made to us. Chargebacks can occur whether or not services were properly provided. Susceptibility to chargebacks puts a portion of our revenue at risk. We take measures to manage our risk relative to chargebacks and to recoup properly charged fees, however, if we are unable to successfully manage this risk our business and operating results could be adversely affected. As we offer new payment options to our users, we may be subject to additional regulations, compliance requirements, and fraud.\nWe are also subject to a number of other laws and regulations relating to money laundering, international money transfers, privacy and information security and electronic fund transfers. If we were found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations, we could be subject to civil and criminal penalties or forced to cease our payments services business.\nOur reputation depends, in part, on factors which are partially or entirely outside of our control.\nOur services typically appear under the LivePerson brand or as a LivePerson-branded icon on our customers\u2019 websites. The customer service operators and Experts who respond to the inquiries of our customers\u2019 users are employees or agents of our customers or independent consultants rather than employees of LivePerson. As a result, we are not able to control the actions of these operators or Experts and the impression that such operator or Expert leaves the user with whom they interact. A user may\nnot know that the operator or Expert is not a LivePerson employee. If a user were to have a negative experience in a LivePerson-powered real-time dialogue, it is possible that this experience could be attributed to us, which could diminish our brand and harm our business. Additionally, we believe the success of our business services is aided by the prominent placement of the chat icon on a customer\u2019s website, over which we also have no control.\nWe are subject to risks related to corporate and social responsibility and reputation.\nMany factors influence our reputation including the perception held by our customers, business partners and other key stakeholders. Businesses face increasing scrutiny related to environmental, social and governance activities. We risk damage to our reputation if we fail to act responsibly in a number of areas, such as diversity and inclusion, sustainability and social responsibility. Any harm to our reputation could impact employee engagement and retention, our corporate culture and the willingness of customers and our partners to do business with us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and cash flows.\nRisks Related to our Financial Condition and Operating Results\nOur quarterly revenue and operating results may fluctuate significantly, which may cause a substantial decline in the trading price of our securities.\nWe have in the past incurred, and may in the future incur, losses and experience negative cash flows, either or both of which may be significant and may cause our quarterly revenue and operating results to fluctuate significantly. These fluctuations may result from a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control. Some of the important factors that may cause our revenue and operating results to fluctuate include:\n\u2022 our ability to attract and retain new customers;\n\u2022 our ability to retain and increase sales to existing customers;\n\u2022 demand from customers and consumers for our services;\n\u2022 our ability to innovate and provide new services to current and future customers;\n\u2022 our ability to continue to add artificial intelligence, machine learning and automation into our services;\n\u2022 the introduction of new services by us or our competitors;\n\u2022 our ability to avoid and/or manage service interruptions, disruptions, or security incidents;\n\u2022 changes in our pricing models or policies or in those of our competitors;\n\u2022 our ability to maintain and add integrations with third-party consumer messaging platforms and endpoints;\n\u2022 continued adoption by companies of mobile and cloud-based messaging solutions;\n\u2022 investments in growing our sales and marketing programs;\n\u2022 continued adoption by Experts and Users of web-based advice services;\n\u2022 exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations; and\n\u2022 the amount and timing of capital expenditures and other costs related to operation and expansion of our business, including those related to acquisitions.\nOur revenue and operating results may also fluctuate significantly in the future due to the following factors that are entirely outside of our control:\n\u2022 new laws, regulations or regulatory or law enforcement initiatives;\n\u2022 economic conditions specific to the web, mobile technology, electronic commerce and cloud computing;\n\u2022 consequences of unexpected geopolitical events, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism, outbreaks of contagious disease (e.g., coronavirus) or climate change; and\n\u2022 general, regional and/or global economic and political conditions.\nAs a result, comparing our operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful. You should not rely upon these comparisons or our past results as indicators of our future performance. Due to the foregoing factors, it is possible that our operating results in one or more future quarters may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors or below any guidance we may provide to the market. If this occurs, the trading price of our securities could decline significantly.\nIn the past we have experienced losses, we had an accumulated deficit of $391.9 million as of December 31, 2020 and we\nmay incur losses in the future.\nWe have in the past incurred, and we may in the future incur, losses and experience negative cash flow, either or both of which may be significant. We recorded net losses from inception through the year ended December 31, 2003. We recorded net income for the years ended December 31, 2004 through 2007 and 2009 through 2012, while we recorded net losses for the years ended December 31, 2008, and 2013 through 2020. We recorded a net loss of $107.6 million for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2020, our accumulated deficit was approximately $391.9 million. We cannot assure you that we can sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future. Failure to maintain profitability may materially and adversely affect the market price of our securities.\nThe non-payment or late payment of amounts due to us from a significant number of customers may negatively impact our financial condition or make it difficult to forecast our revenues accurately.\nDuring 2020, we increased our allowance for doubtful accounts from $3.1 million to approximately $5.3 million. During 2019, we increased our allowance for doubtful accounts from $2.3 million to approximately $3.1 million. We base our allowance for doubtful accounts on specifically identified credit risks of customers, historical trends and other information that we believe to be reasonable. A large proportion of receivables are due from larger corporate customers that typically have longer payment cycles. We adjust our allowance for doubtful accounts when accounts previously reserved have been collected. As a result of increasingly long payment cycles, we have faced increased difficulty in predicting our operating results for any given period, and have experienced significant unanticipated fluctuations in our revenues from period to period. Any failure to achieve anticipated revenues in a period could cause the market price of our securities to decline.\nThere are inherent limitations on the effectiveness of our controls.\nWe do not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well-designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system\u2019s objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that resource constraints exist, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate due to changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures. If our controls become inadequate, we could fail to meet our financial reporting obligations, our reputation may be adversely affected, our business and operating results could be harmed, and the market price of our securities could decline.\nWith the recent volatility in the capital markets, there is a risk that we could suffer a loss of principal in our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments and suffer a reduction in our interest income or in our return on investments.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had $654.2 million in cash and cash equivalents. We regularly invest excess funds from our cash and cash equivalents in short-term money market funds. We currently hold no mortgaged-backed or auction rate securities. However, some of our investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks, which may be exacerbated by any ongoing uncertainty in the United States and global credit markets. In the future, these market risks associated with our investment portfolio may harm the results of our operations, liquidity and financial condition. Although we believe we have chosen a more cautious portfolio designed to preserve our existing cash position, it may not adequately protect the value of our investments. Furthermore, this more cautious portfolio is unlikely to provide us with any significant interest income in the near term.\nBecause we recognize revenue from subscriptions for our service over the term of the subscription, declines in business may not be immediately reflected in our operating results.\nWe generally recognize revenue from customers ratably over the terms of their subscription agreements, which are typically 12 or more months. As a result, much of the revenue we report in each quarter is the result of subscription agreements entered into during previous quarters. Consequently, a decline in new or renewed subscriptions or cancellations of existing subscriptions in any one quarter may not be reflected in our revenue results for that quarter. Any such decline, however, could negatively affect our revenue in future quarters. Our subscription model also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue through additional sales in any period, because revenue from new customers and additional revenue from existing customers is generally recognized over the applicable subscription term, rather than immediately.\nOur reported financial results may be adversely affected by changes in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.\nAccounting principles generally accepted in the United States are subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the \u201cFASB\u201d), the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, the SEC, and various bodies formed to\npromulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles. A change in these principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported financial results, and could affect the reporting of transactions completed before the announcement of a change.\nIf our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets become impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to\nearnings.\nUnder accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, we review our amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicated that the carrying value may not be recoverable. We review our goodwill for impairment at least annually and when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not\nbe recoverable. Factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable include a decline in stock price and market capitalization, reduced future cash flow estimates, and slower growth rates in our industry. Based on our annual review for 2020, we determined that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting units is less than their carrying amount. However, future assessments may yield a different result, and from time to time, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our consolidated financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill is determined, resulting in a negative impact on our results of operations.\nRisks Related to Industry Dynamics and Competition\nIf we are unable to develop and maintain successful relationships with social media and other third-party consumer messaging platforms and endpoints, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nWe believe that continued growth for companies in our industry depends, in part, on enabling brands to connect with consumers across consumers\u2019 preferred conversational interfaces and messaging endpoints, such as SMS, Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, Apple Business Chat, Google Rich Business Messenger, Line and Alexa. In order to grow our business, we have identified and developed, and maintain, strategic relationships with many key technology partners. As part of our growth strategy, we plan to further develop partnerships and specific solution areas with additional technology partners. If we fail to establish these relationships in a timely and cost-effective manner, or at all, or if we lose any or all of our current relationships, then our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. Additionally, even if we are successful at developing these relationships, but there are problems or issues with the integrations, or our ability to scale and onboard our customers onto new endpoints, our reputation and ability to grow our business may be adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to effectively operate on mobile devices, our business could be adversely affected.\nThe number of people who access the Internet and complete transactions over the Internet through devices other than desktop computers, including smartphones, handheld tablets and mobile phones, has increased dramatically in the past few years and is projected to continue to increase. To address these developments, we continue to extend our products and services to support messaging on mobile phone and tablet applications belonging to our company and our customers. If the mobile solutions we have developed do not meet our customers\u2019 needs or the needs of their website visitors, or are not widely adopted by our customers and consumers, we may fail to retain existing customers and we may have difficulty attracting new customers. Such solutions may also create new risks related to privacy and security, which could subject us to investigations, litigation or reputational harm. If we are unable to rapidly innovate and grow mobile revenue, or if we incur excessive expenses in this effort, our financial performance and ability to continue to grow overall revenue may be negatively affected.\nAdditionally, our mobile phone and tablet applications and those of our customers depend on their interoperability with popular mobile operating systems, networks and standards that we and they do not control, such as Android and iOS operating systems, and any changes in such systems and terms of service that degrade the functionality of our solutions or give preferential treatment to competitive products could adversely affect our revenue. We may not be successful in developing products that operate effectively with these technologies, systems, networks or standards. As new devices and platforms are continually being released, it is difficult to predict the challenges we may encounter in developing versions of our solutions for use on these alternative devices.\nThe markets in which we participate are highly competitive, and we may lose customers and revenue if we are not able to innovate or effectively compete.\nThe markets for mobile and online business messaging and digital engagement and AI technology are intensely competitive, rapidly changing and characterized by aggressive marketing, pricing pressure, evolving industry standards, rapid technology developments and frequent new product introductions. We believe that competition will continue to increase as our\ncurrent competitors increase the sophistication of their offerings and as new participants enter the market, which may cause additional pressure. If we are unable to accurately anticipate technology developments and continue to innovate in the markets in which we compete and develop successful integrations with third-party consumer messaging platforms, AI providers and endpoints, or our competitors are more successful than us at developing compelling new products, services and integrations, or at attracting and retaining customers, we may lose revenue and market share and our operating results could be adversely affected.\nWe have current and potential competition from providers of messaging and digital engagement solutions that enable companies to engage and connect with their consumer customers, as well as technology providers that offer customer relationship management and contact center solutions. We have current and potential competitors in many different industries, including:\n\u2022 technology or service providers offering or powering competing digital engagement, contact center, communications or customer relationship management solutions, such as eGain, Genesys, Nuance, Oracle, Salesforce.com, and Twilio;\n\u2022 service providers that offer basic messaging products or services with limited functionality free of charge or at significantly reduced entry level prices;\n\u2022 social media, social listening, messaging, artificial intelligence, bots, e-commerce, and/or data and data analytics companies, such as Facebook, Google and WeChat, which may leverage their existing or future capabilities and consumer relationships to offer competing B2B solutions; and\n\u2022 customers that develop and manage their messaging solutions in-house.\nIn addition, many of our current and potential competitors have substantial competitive advantages, such as greater brand recognition, significantly larger financial, marketing, and resource and development budgets, access to larger customer and/or consumer bases, larger and more established marketing and distribution relationships, and/or more diverse product and service offerings. As a result, these competitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to any change in the general market acceptance of messaging services or any new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards, pricing strategies or customer requirements. Also, because of these advantages, potential customers may select a competitor\u2019s products and services, even if our services are more effective. For all of these reasons, we may not be able to compete successfully against our current and future competitors.\nWe may be unable to respond to the rapid technological change and changing customer preferences in the online sales, marketing, customer service, and/or online consumer services industries and this may harm our business.\nIf we are unable, for technological, legal, financial or other reasons, to adapt in a timely manner to changing market conditions in the online sales, marketing, customer service and/or e-commerce industry or our customers\u2019 or consumers\u2019 requirements or preferences, our business, results of operations and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected. Online business is characterized by rapid technological change. In addition, the market for online sales, marketing, customer service and expert advice solutions is relatively new. Sudden changes in customer and consumer requirements and preferences, frequent new product and service introductions embodying new technologies, and the emergence of new industry and regulatory standards and practices such as but not limited to data privacy and security standards, could render the LivePerson services and our proprietary technology and systems obsolete. The rapid evolution of these products and services will require that we continually improve the performance, features and reliability of our services. Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to:\n\u2022 enhance the features and performance of our services;\n\u2022 develop and offer new services that are valuable to companies doing business online as well as consumers; and\n\u2022 respond to technological advances and emerging industry and regulatory standards and practices in a cost-effective and timely manner.\nIf any of our new services, including upgrades to our current services, do not meet our customers\u2019 or consumers\u2019 expectations, we could lose customers and our business may be harmed. Updating our technology may require significant additional capital expenditures and could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf new services require us to grow rapidly, this could place a significant strain on our managerial, operational, technical and financial resources. In order to manage our growth, we could be required to implement new or upgraded operating and financial systems, procedures and controls. Our failure to expand our operations in an efficient manner could cause our expenses to grow, our revenue to decline or grow more slowly than expected and could otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nDownturns in the global economic environment or in particular industries in which our sales are concentrated may adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nThe United States and other global economies have experienced in the past and could in the future experience economic downturn that affects all sectors of the economy, particularly in the financial services and retail industries, resulting in declines in economic growth and consumer confidence, increases in unemployment rates and uncertainty about economic stability. Further, there is increased uncertainty regarding social, political, immigration and trade policies in the United States, which could impact our global operations and our business. Global credit and financial markets have in the past experienced extreme disruptions, including diminished liquidity and credit availability and rapid fluctuations in market valuations. Our business has been affected by these conditions in the past and could be similarly impacted in the future by any downturn in global economic conditions.\nOur business is, and will continue to be, dependent on sales to customers in the telecommunications, financial services, retail, automotive, real estate and technology industries. A downturn in one or more of these industries could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In the event that industry conditions deteriorate in one or more of these industries, we could experience, among other things, cancellation or non-renewal of existing contracts, reduced demand for our products and reduced sales. It could be difficult to predict the timing, strength or duration of any economic slowdown or subsequent economic recovery, either relating to the global economic environment or to the particular industries in which our sales are concentrated, which, in turn, could make it more challenging for us to forecast our operating results, make business decisions and identify risks that may adversely affect our business, sources and uses of cash, financial condition and results of operations.\nWeak economic conditions may also cause our customers to experience difficulty in supporting their current operations and implementing their business plans. Our customers may reduce their spending on our services, may not be able to discharge their payment and other obligations to us, may experience difficulty raising capital, or may elect to scale back the resources they devote to customer service and/or sales and marketing technology, including services such as ours. Economic conditions may also lead consumers and businesses to postpone spending, which may cause our customers to decrease or delay their purchases of our products and services. If economic conditions deteriorate for us or our customers, we could be required to record charges relating to restructuring costs or the impairment of assets, may not be able to collect receivables on a timely basis, and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Security Vulnerabilities and Service Reliability\nFailures or security breaches in our services or systems, those of our third party service providers, or in the websites of our customers, including those resulting from cyber-attacks, security vulnerabilities, defects or errors, could harm our business.\nOur products and services involve the storage and transmission of proprietary information and personal data related to our customers and their users, as well as experts and consumers, and theft and security breaches expose us to a risk of loss of such information and data, improper use and disclosure thereof, litigation, regulatory investigation, and potential liability. We experience cyber-attacks of varying degrees on a regular basis. Our security measures may also be breached due to employee or other error, intentional malfeasance and other third party acts, and system errors or vulnerabilities, including vulnerabilities of our third party service providers, or customers, or otherwise. Additionally, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, a majority of our office employees are working remotely. We currently expect this to continue for the foreseeable future, which may potentially further increase the risk of cyber incidents or data breaches. Any such breach or unauthorized access, or attempts by outside parties to fraudulently induce employees, users, vendors or customers to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our data or data of our customers, users, experts or consumers, including, but not limited to, individual personal information and financial credit or debit card data that is protected by law or contract, could result in significant legal and financial exposure, damage to our reputation, and a loss of confidence in the security of our products and services that could potentially have an adverse effect on our business.\nWhile we continue to expand our focus on this issue and are taking measures to safeguard our products and services from cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities in desktop computers, mobile phones, smartphones and handheld devices, cyber-attacks and other security incidents continue to evolve in sophistication and frequency. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems, are constantly evolving in sophisticated ways to avoid detection and often are not recognized until launched against a target, it may be difficult or impossible for us to anticipate or identify these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. And while technological advancements enable more data and processes, such as mobile computing and mobile payments, they also increase the risk that cyber-attacks and other security incidents will occur. We engage third parties to review and assist in safeguarding our products and services from such\nthreats. Those parties may identify vulnerabilities, some of which may not be immediately remedied. A significant cyber-attack, or a security incident of any magnitude that is profiled in the media, involving our, our third party service providers\u2019 or our customers\u2019 systems, could result in material harm to our brand and reputation, our ability to deliver our services or retain customers, and expose us to lawsuits, regulatory investigations, and significant damages, fines or penalties.\nIn addition, our customers may authorize third party access to their customer data located in our cloud environment. Because we do not control the transmissions to customer-authorized third parties, or the processing of such data by customer authorized third parties, we cannot ensure the integrity or security of such transmissions or processing. Because our services are responsible for critical communication between our customers and consumers, any security failures, defects or errors in our components, materials or software or those used by our customers could have an adverse impact on us, on our customers and on the end users of their websites. Such adverse impact could include a decrease in demand for our services, damage to our reputation and to our customer relationships, legal exposure, and other financial liability or harm to our business.\nWe may be liable if third parties access or misappropriate confidential or personal data from our systems or services.\nThe dialogue transcripts of the text-based chats, email interactions and other interactions between our customers and their users may include information, such as personal contact and demographic information. Although we employ and continually test and update our security measures to protect this information from unauthorized access, it is still possible that our security measures could be breached and such a breach could result in unauthorized access to our customers\u2019 data or our data, including our intellectual property and other confidential business information. Because the techniques employed by hackers to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and are becoming more sophisticated in circumventing security measures and avoiding detection, we may be unable to anticipate all techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. Any security breach could result in disclosure of our trade secrets or disclosure of confidential customer, supplier or employee data. If third parties were able to penetrate our network security or otherwise misappropriate personal data relating to our customers\u2019 users or the text of customer service inquiries, our competitive position may be harmed and we could be subject to liability. In the event of a security incident, we could be required to comply with a myriad of breach notification laws at the state, federal and international level, which may cause business disruption and extensive notification costs, and could lead to penalties, government investigations and lawsuits for compliance failures. We may as a result of a security incident be deemed out of compliance with United States federal and state laws, international laws, or contractual commitments, and we may be subject to government investigations, lawsuits, fines, criminal penalties, statutory damages, and other costs to respond to breach or security incidents, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We may incur significant costs to protect against the threat of security breaches or to mitigate the harm and alleviate problems caused by such breaches. While we currently maintain insurance coverage that may cover certain cyber security risks, such insurance coverage is subject to certain exclusions and exceptions and may be insufficient to cover all losses.\nFurthermore, certain software and services that we use to operate our business are hosted and/or operated by third parties or integrated with our systems. If these services were to be interrupted or their security breached, our business operations could be similarly disrupted and we could be exposed to liability and costly investigations or litigation. The need to properly secure, and securely transmit and store, confidential information online has historically been a significant barrier to e-commerce and online communications, and will become increasingly highlighted as a consumer and regulatory focus and concern. Any publicized compromise of security could deter people from using online services such as the ones we offer or from using them to conduct transactions, which involve transmitting confidential information. Because our success depends on the general acceptance and reputation of our services and electronic commerce, we may incur significant costs to protect against the threat of security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by these breaches.\nWe provide service level commitments to certain customers. If we do not meet these contractual commitments, we could be obligated to provide credits or refunds or face contract terminations, which could adversely affect our revenue and harm our reputation.\nAs is common for many cloud service providers, we offer service level commitments in certain of our customer contracts, primarily related to uptime of our service. If we are unable to meet the stated service level commitments or suffer periods of downtime that exceed the periods allowed under our customer contracts, whether due to downtime caused by us or our third-party service providers, which has occurred on several occasions in the past and could occur in the future, we may be contractually obligated to provide these customers with service credits and/or pay financial penalties, which could significantly impact our revenue. In addition, even if our contracts provide otherwise, these customers may attempt to terminate or reduce their contracts, which has occurred from time to time, and/or pursue other legal remedies. Recurring or extended service outages could also cause damage to our reputation and result in substantial customer dissatisfaction or loss, which could adversely affect our current and future revenue and operating results.\nWe are dependent on technology systems and third-party content that are beyond our control.\nThe success of our services depends in part on our customers\u2019 online services as well as the Internet and mobile connectivity of consumers, both of which are outside of our control. As a result, it may be difficult to identify the source of problems if they occur. In the past, we have experienced problems related to connectivity, which has resulted in slower than normal response times to user messaging requests and interruptions in service. Our services rely both on the Internet and on our connectivity vendors for data transmission. Therefore, even when connectivity problems are not caused by our services, our customers or their consumers may attribute the problem to us. This could diminish our brand and harm our business, divert the attention of our technical personnel from our product development efforts or cause significant customer relations problems.\nIn addition, we rely in part on third party service providers and other third parties for various services, including, but not limited to, Internet connectivity, network infrastructure hosting, security and maintenance, and software and hardware from a variety of vendors. These providers may experience problems that result in slower than normal response times and/or interruptions in service. If we are unable to continue utilizing the third party services that support our web hosting and infrastructure or if our services experience interruptions or delays due to existing third party service providers or transition to new third party service providers, our reputation and business could be harmed, and we may be exposed to legal and reputational risk, and significant remediation costs.\nWe also rely on the security of our third party service providers to protect our proprietary information and information of our customers. Information technology system failures, including a breach of our or our third party service providers\u2019 data security, could disrupt our ability to function in the normal course of business by potentially causing, among other things, an unintentional disclosure of customer information or loss of information. Additionally, despite our security procedures or those of our third party service providers, information systems may be vulnerable to threats such as computer hacking, cyber-terrorism or other unauthorized attempts by third parties to access, obtain, modify or delete our or our customers\u2019 data. Any such breach could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and our reputation as a provider of business collaboration and communications solutions and could subject us to significant penalties and negative publicity, as well as government investigations and claims for damages or injunctive relief under state, federal and foreign laws or contractual agreements.\nWe also depend on third parties for hardware and software, and our consumer services depend on third parties for content. Such products and content could contain defects or inaccurate information. Problems arising from our use of such hardware or software or third party content could require us to incur significant costs or divert the attention of our technical or other personnel from our product development efforts or to manage issues related to content. To the extent any such problems require us to replace such hardware or software we may not be able to do so on acceptable terms, if at all.\nWe depend on the continued viability of the infrastructure of the Internet.\nTo the extent that the Internet continues to experience growth in the number of users and frequency of use by consumers resulting in increased bandwidth demands, we cannot assure you that the infrastructure for the Internet will be able to support the demands placed upon it. The Internet has experienced outages and delays as a result of damage to portions of its infrastructure. Outages or delays could adversely affect online sites, email and the level of traffic on the Internet. The Internet is also subject to continued and ongoing cyber-attacks and related conduct, which affect all online businesses. We also depend on Internet service providers that provide our customers and Internet users with access to the LivePerson services. In the past, users have experienced difficulties due to system failures unrelated to our service. In addition, the Internet could lose its viability due to delays in the adoption of new standards and protocols required to handle increased levels of Internet activity. Insufficient availability of telecommunications services to support the Internet also could result in slower response times and negatively impact use of the Internet generally, and our customers\u2019 sites (including their use of the Conversational Cloud) in particular. If the infrastructure of the Internet does not effectively support the growth of the Internet, we may not maintain profitability and our business, results of operations and financial condition will suffer.\nTechnological or other defects could disrupt or negatively impact our services, which could harm our business and reputation.\nWe face risks related to the technological capabilities of our services. We expect the number of interactions between our customers\u2019 operators and consumers over our system to increase significantly as we expand our customer base. Our network hardware and software may not be able to accommodate this additional volume. Additionally, we must continually upgrade our software to improve the features and functionality of our services in order to be competitive in our markets. If future versions of\nour software contain undetected errors, our business could be harmed. If third-party content is flawed, our business could be harmed. As a result of software upgrades at LivePerson, our customer sites have, from time to time, experienced slower than normal response times and interruptions in service. If we experience system failures or degraded response times, our reputation and brand could be harmed. We may also experience technical problems in the process of installing and initiating the LivePerson services on new web hosting services. These problems, if not remedied, could harm our business.\nOur services also depend on complex software which may contain defects, particularly when we introduce new versions onto our servers. We may not discover software defects that affect our new or current services or enhancements until after they are deployed. It is possible that, despite testing by us, defects may occur in the software. These defects could result in:\n\u2022 damage to our reputation;\n\u2022 lost sales;\n\u2022 contract terminations;\n\u2022 loss of market share;\n\u2022 delays in or loss of market acceptance of our products; and\n\u2022 unexpected expenses and diversion of resources to remedy errors.\nOur products are complex, and errors, failures or \u201cbugs\u201d may be difficult to correct.\nOur products are complex, integrating hardware, software and elements of a customers\u2019 existing infrastructure. Despite quality assurance testing conducted prior to the release of our products our software may contain \u201cbugs\u201d that are difficult to detect and fix. Any such issues could interfere with the expected operation of a solution, which might negatively impact customer satisfaction, reduce sales opportunities or affect gross margins. Depending upon the size and scope of any such issue, remediation may have a negative impact on our business. Our inability to cure an application or product defect, should one occur, could result in the failure of an application or product line, damage to our reputation, litigation and/or product reengineering expenses. Our insurance may not cover or may be insufficient to cover expenses associated with such events.\nFailure to license necessary third party software for use in our products and services, or failure to successfully integrate third party software, could cause delays or reductions in our sales, or errors or failures of our service.\nWe license third party software that we plan to incorporate into our products and services. In the future, we might need to license other software to enhance our products and meet evolving customer requirements. These licenses may not continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Some of this technology could be difficult to replace once integrated. The loss of, or inability to obtain, these licenses could result in delays or reductions of our products and services until we identify, license and integrate or develop equivalent software, and new licenses could require us to pay higher royalties. If we are unable to successfully license and integrate third party technology, we could experience a reduction in functionality and/or errors or failures of our products, which may reduce demand for our products and services.\nThird-party licenses may expose us to increased risks, including risks associated with the integration of new technology, the impact of new technology integration on our existing technology, open source software disclosure requirements, the diversion of resources from the development of our own proprietary technology, and our inability to generate revenue from new technology sufficient to offset associated acquisition and maintenance costs.\nOur business is subject to the risks of earthquakes, fires, floods and other natural catastrophic events and to interruption by man-made problems such as terrorism or computer viruses.\nOur systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, fires, floods, hurricanes, other acts of nature, power losses, telecommunications failures, terrorist attacks, acts of war, human errors, break-ins, cyber-attacks or failures, pandemics or other public health crises, or similar events. For example, a significant natural disaster, such as an earthquake, fire or flood, could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition, and our insurance coverage may be insufficient to compensate us for losses that may occur. In addition, acts of terrorism could cause disruptions in our business or the economy as a whole. Our headquarters are located in New York City and we have a significant employee presence located in Israel, each of which regions has experienced acts of terrorism in the past. Our servers may also be vulnerable to computer viruses, break-ins, cyber-attacks, such as coordinated denial-of-service attacks or ransomware, or other failures, and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our computer systems, which could lead to interruptions, delays, loss of critical data or the unauthorized disclosure of confidential customer data. Although we have implemented security measures and disaster recovery capabilities, there can be no assurance that we will not suffer from business interruption, or unavailability or loss of data, as a result of any such events. As we rely heavily on our servers, computer and communications systems and the internet to conduct our business and provide high quality service to our\ncustomers, such disruptions could negatively impact our ability to run our business, result in loss of existing or potential customers and increased expenses, and/or have an adverse effect on our reputation and the reputation of our products and services, any of which would adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Regulatory and Data Privacy Issues\nOur business is subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws and regulations regarding privacy and data protection, and increased public scrutiny of privacy and security issues could result in increased government regulation, industry standards and other legal obligations that could adversely affect our business.\nWe collect, process, store and use personal data and other information generated during mobile and online messaging between brands and consumers and between experts and consumers. We post our privacy policies and practices on our websites and we also often include privacy commitments in our contracts. Our business is subject to numerous federal, state and international laws and regulations regarding privacy, data protection, personal information, security, data collection, storage, use and transfer, and the use of cookies and similar tracking technologies. To the extent that additional legislation regarding user privacy is enacted, such as legislation governing the collection and use of information regarding Internet or mobile users through the use of cookies or similar technologies, the effectiveness of our services could be impaired by restricting us from collecting or using information that may be valuable to our customers and/or exposing us to lawsuits or regulatory investigations. The foregoing could have a material adverse effect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe scope of U.S. and international privacy laws and regulations is evolving and changing, subject to differing interpretations, may be costly to comply with, and may be inconsistent among countries and jurisdictions or conflict with other rules. As we expand our operations in these countries, our liability exposure and the complexity and cost of compliance with data and privacy requirements will likely increase. Any failure by us to comply with our posted privacy policies, applicable federal, state or international laws and regulations relating to data privacy and data protection, or the privacy commitments contained in our contracts, could result in proceedings against us by governmental entities, customers, consumers, watchdog groups or others, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the increased attention focused upon liability as a result of lawsuits and legislative proposals and enactments could harm our reputation or otherwise impact the growth of our business.\nLaws and practices regarding handling and use of personal and other information by companies have come under increased public scrutiny, and governmental entities, consumer agencies and consumer advocacy groups have called for, and in many instances, enacted increased regulation and changes in industry practices. For example, the European Union (\u201cE.U.\u201d) General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d), which became effective in May 2018, replacing the E.U. Data Protection Directive, imposes significantly greater compliance burdens on companies that control or process personal data of users primarily located in the E.U. and, for noncompliance, provides for considerable fines up to the higher of 20 million Euros or 4% of global annual revenue. European regulators have issued numerous fines pursuant to the GDPR. One material change is that data processors (as that term is defined by applicable E.U. data protection law) have direct obligations, including implementing technical and organizational measures, and are subject to enhanced notification rules. The GDPR also imposes certain technological requirements that may, from time to time, require us to make changes to our services to enable LivePerson and/or our customers to meet legal requirements and may impact how data protection is addressed in our customer and vendor agreements. Ensuring compliance with the GDPR is an ongoing commitment that involves substantial costs, and it is possible that despite our efforts, governmental authorities or third parties will assert that our services or business practices fail to comply. We also must require vendors that process personal data to take on additional privacy and security obligations, and some may refuse, causing us to incur potential disruption and expense related to our business processes. If our policies and practices, or those of our vendors, are, or are perceived to be, insufficient, we could be subject to enforcement actions or investigations by Data Protection Authorities (including in the EU) or lawsuits by private parties, and our business could be negatively impacted.\nThe E.U. has also released a proposed Regulation on Privacy and Electronic Communications (e-Privacy Regulation) to replace the E.U.\u2019s Privacy and Electronic Communications Directive (e-Privacy Directive) to, among other things, better align with the GDPR, to amend the current e-Privacy Directive\u2019s rules on the use of cookies and other tracking technologies, and to harmonize across current E.U. member state e-privacy data protection laws. Compliance with changes in laws and regulations related to privacy may require significant cost, limit the use and adoption of our services, and require material changes in our business practices that result in reduced revenue. Noncompliance could result in material fines and penalties, litigation, regulatory investigation and/or governmental orders requiring us to change our data practices, which could damage our reputation and harm our business.\nAdditionally, as web and mobile commerce continues to evolve, regulation by federal, state and foreign governments or agencies in the areas of data privacy and data security is likely to increase. For instance, recent legal developments in Europe have created complexity and regulatory compliance uncertainty regarding certain transfers of personal information from the\nEuropean Economic Area (the \u201cEEA\u201d) to the United States and certain other third countries. For example, on July 16, 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union (\u201cCJEU\u201d) invalidated the E.U.-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework (the \u201cE.U.-U.S. Privacy Shield\u201d) under which personal information could be transferred from the EEA to U.S. entities who had self-certified under the Privacy Shield program. While the CJEU upheld the adequacy of E.U.-specified standard contractual clauses as an adequate personal information transfer mechanism, it made clear that reliance on them alone may not necessarily be sufficient in all circumstances and that their use must be assessed on a case-by-case basis taking into account the surveillance laws in and the right of individuals afforded by, the destination country. The CJEU went on to state that, if the competent supervisory authority believes that the standard contractual clauses cannot be complied with in the destination country and the required level of protection cannot be secured by other means, such supervisory authority is under an obligation to suspend or prohibit that transfer unless the data exporter has already done so itself. Similarly, on September 8, 2020, the Swiss Data Protection Authority announced in a position statement that it no longer considers the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield adequate for the purpose of transferring personal data from Switzerland to the United States.\nWe rely on a mixture of mechanisms to govern the transfer of personal data from our E.U. business to the U.S. and are continuing to evaluate what additional mechanisms may be required to establish adequate safeguards for the cross-border transfer of personal data. In November 2020, the European Commission released a draft set of new standard contractual clauses. It is unclear when the new contractual standards may be approved and what additional changes will be made, however we will ultimately need to be prepared to adopt and comply with them in order to legitimize data transfers between E.U. and the U.S. As supervisory authorities issue further guidance on personal data export mechanisms, including circumstances where the standard contractual clauses cannot be used and/or start taking enforcement action, we could incur increased costs, lower revenue, reduced efficiency, and greater difficulty in competing with foreign-based firms. Failure to comply with existing or new rules may result in significant penalties or orders to stop the alleged noncompliant activity.\nMoreover, if we are otherwise unable to transfer personal data or information between and among countries and regions in which we operate, it could affect how we provide our services and could adversely impact our financial results.\nOn January 31, 2020, the United Kingdom (\u201cU.K.\u201d) withdrew its membership from the European Union (\u201cE.U.\u201d), which is commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit.\u201d In the U.K., Brexit has created uncertainty with regard to the regulation of data protection. In particular, while the Data Protection Act of 2018, which implements and complements the GDPR achieved Royal Assent on May 23, 2018 and is now effective in the United Kingdom, it is still unclear whether transfer of personal data from the EEA to the United Kingdom will remain lawful under the GDPR after Brexit. In December 2020, the Brexit Trade and Cooperation Agreement (\u201cTCA\u201d) established a four- to six-month grace period during which transfers of personal data from the E.U. to the U.K. can continue without additional safeguards, provided that the U.K. maintains its pre-TCA data protection laws. On February 19, 2021, the European Commission released a draft adequacy decision for review by the European Data Protection Board. If adopted, that decision would permit the continued flow of personal data between the U.K. and the E.U. However, it is unclear how data transfers to and from the U.K. will be regulated after the grace period expires and whether or not the U.K. will receive a final adequacy decision from the European Commission permitting cross-border data transfer from the E.U. to the U.K. In addition, we cannot fully predict how the Data Protection Act and other U.K. data protection laws or regulations may develop in the medium to longer term.\nIn addition to the changing regulatory landscape in the E.U. and the U.K., in June 2018, the State of California legislature passed the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (\u201cCCPA\u201d), which came into effect in January of 2020. The CCPA gives California residents new data privacy rights, allows consumers to opt out of certain data sharing with third parties, and provides a new private cause of action for data breaches. Moreover, a new privacy law, the California Privacy Rights Act (\u201cCPRA\u201d), was approved by voters in California in a ballot proposition in the November 3, 2020 election. The CPRA will significantly modify the CCPA, and will impose additional data protection obligations on companies doing business in California, potentially resulting in further complexity and requiring us to incur additional costs and expenses in an effort to comply. We also may be subject to additional compliance obligations as other states consider and adopt similar legislation.\nIn addition to government activity, privacy advocacy and other industry groups have established and may continue to establish new self-regulatory standards that may place additional burdens on us. If our privacy practices are deemed unacceptable by watchdog groups or privacy advocates, such groups may take measures that harm our business by, for example, disparaging our reputation and our business, which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, privacy concerns may cause consumers to avoid online sites that collect various forms of data or to resist providing the data necessary to allow our customers to use our services effectively. Even the perception of data security and data privacy concerns, whether or not valid, could inhibit sales and market acceptance of our products and services.\nOur business is subject to a variety of U.S. and foreign laws, and existing, new and developing regulatory or other legal requirements could subject us to claims or materially impact our business.\nWe and our customers are subject to a number of laws and regulations in the United States and abroad, including laws related to conducting business on the Internet or mobile devices, such as laws regarding data privacy, data protection, information security, cybersecurity, restrictions or technological requirements regarding the collection, use, storage, protection, transfer or other processing of consumer data, content, consumer protection, internet (or net) neutrality, advertising, electronic contracts, taxation, provision of online payment services (including credit card processing), and intellectual property rights, which are continuously evolving and developing. Because our services are accessible worldwide, certain foreign jurisdictions may claim that we are required to comply with their laws, even if we do not have a local entity, employees or infrastructure. Foreign data protection, privacy, and other laws and regulations may often be more restrictive than those in the United States. The scope and interpretation of the laws and other obligations that apply to us, including those related to user privacy and data security, are often uncertain and may be conflicting, particularly laws and obligations outside the United States. There is a risk that these laws may be interpreted and applied differently in any given jurisdiction in a manner that is not consistent with our current practices, which could cause us to incur substantial cost and could negatively impact our brand, reputation and business.\nBusinesses using our products and services may collect data from their users. Various federal, state and foreign government bodies and agencies impose laws regarding collection, use, storage, retention, disposal, transfer or other processing of data from website visitors. We offer our customers a variety of data security procedures and practices, such as encryption for data at rest and masking algorithms for sensitive data prior to transfer to our database, in an effort to protect information. Changes to applicable laws and how they are interpreted relating to privacy and data security could significantly increase the cost to us and our customers of regulatory compliance and could negatively impact our business.\nFor instance, some states in the United States have enacted legislation designed to protect consumer privacy by prohibiting the distribution of \u201cspyware\u201d over the Internet. Such legislation typically focuses on restricting the proliferation of software that, when installed on an end user\u2019s computer, is used to intentionally and deceptively take control of the end user\u2019s machine. We do not believe that the data monitoring methods that we employ constitute \u201cspyware\u201d or are prohibited by applicable laws. However, federal, state and foreign laws and regulations, many of which can be enforced by government entities or private parties, are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant changes in application and interpretation. If, for example, the scope of the previously mentioned \u201cspyware\u201d legislation were changed to include web analytics, such legislation could apply to the technology we use and potentially restrict our ability to conduct our business.\nFurther, various federal, state and foreign government bodies and agencies are highly focused on consumer protection initiatives, particularly in light of the increase in new technologies and services that incorporate or use bots, artificial intelligence and/or machine learning. For example, the California B.O.T. Act came into effect in July 2019 and requires that companies using bots on platforms with more than 10 million unique monthly visitors from the U.S. use clear and conspicuous disclosure to inform consumers that they are not speaking to a human. Similar bills entitled the \u201cBot Disclosure and Accountability Act of 2019\u201d were introduced to the U.S. House and Senate in July 2019. Regulation in this area could impact how businesses use our products and services to interact with consumers and how we provide our services to our customers. AI tools can also present unique technological and legal challenges, such as the possibility of insufficient data sets, or data sets that contain biased information, which can negatively impact the decisions, predictions or analyses that AI applications produce. Deficiencies such as these could cause us reputational harm and subject us to legal liability, including claims of product liability, breach of warranty or negligence.\nIn addition, regulatory authorities and governments around the world are considering a number of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning privacy, collection and use of website visitor data, data storage, data protection, the \u201cright to be forgotten,\u201d content regulation, cybersecurity, government access to personal information, online advertising, email and other categories of electronic spam, and other matters that may be applicable to our business. Compliance with these laws may require substantial investment or may be technologically challenging for us. For example, some jurisdictions, including in the United States, are considering whether the collection of anonymous data may invade the privacy of website visitors. If laws or regulations are enacted that limit data collection or use practices related to anonymous data, we and/or our customers may be required to obtain the express consent of web visitors in order for our technology to perform certain basic functions that are based on the collection and use of technical data. Requirements that a website must first obtain consent from its web visitors before using our technology could reduce the amount and value of the services we provide to customers, which might impede sales and/or cause some existing customers to discontinue using our services.\nIt is also likely that, as our business grows and evolves, an increasing portion of our business shifts to mobile, and our solutions are offered and used in a greater number of countries, we will become subject to laws and regulations in additional jurisdictions. We may need to expend considerable effort and resources to develop new product features and/or procedures to comply with any such legal requirements. It is difficult to predict how existing laws will apply to our business and what new laws and legal obligations we may become subject to. If we are not able to comply with these laws or other legal obligations, or\nif we become liable under them, we may be forced to implement material changes to our business practices, delay release of new and enhanced services and expend substantial resources, which would negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, any increased attention focused on liability issues, or as a result of regulatory fines or lawsuits, could harm our reputation or otherwise impact the growth of our business. Any costs incurred as a result of this potential liability could harm our business and operating results.\nWe monitor pending legislation and regulatory initiatives to ascertain relevance, analyze impact and develop strategic direction surrounding regulatory trends and developments. Due to shifting economic and political conditions, tax policies or rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. A range of other proposed or existing laws and new interpretations of existing laws could have an impact on our business. For example:\nGovernment agencies and regulators have reviewed, are reviewing and will continue to review, the personal data handling practices of companies doing business online, including privacy and security policies and practices. This review may result in new laws or the promulgation of new regulations or guidelines that may apply to our products and services. For example, the State of California and other states have passed laws relating to disclosure of companies\u2019 practices with regard to Do-Not-Track signals from Internet browsers, the ability to delete information of minors, and new data breach notification requirements. The CCPA, California\u2019s new consumer privacy legislation, came into effect in January 2020. Outside the E.U. and the United States, a number of countries have adopted or are considering privacy laws and regulations that may result in significant greater compliance burdens. Existing and proposed laws and regulations regarding cybersecurity and monitoring of online behavioral data, such as proposed \u201cDo Not Track\u201d regulations, regulations aimed at restricting certain targeted advertising practices and collection and use of data from mobile devices, new and existing tools that allow consumers to block online advertising and other content, and other proposed online privacy legislation could potentially apply to some of our current or planned products and services. Existing and proposed laws and regulations related to email and other categories of electronic spam could impact the delivery of commercial email and other electronic communications by us or on behalf of customers using our services.\nThe Federal Trade Commission (\u201cFTC\u201d) in particular has aggressively investigated and brought enforcement actions against companies that fail to comply with their privacy or data security commitments to consumers, or fail to comply with regulations or statutes such as the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act. Any investigation or review of our practices may require us to make changes to our products and policies, which could harm our business. Currently there are many proposals by lawmakers and industry groups in this area, both in the United States and overseas, which address the collection, maintenance and use of personal information, web browsing and geolocation data, and establish data security and breach notification requirements. Further, regulators and industry groups have also released self-regulatory principles and guidelines for various data privacy and security practices. Given that this is an evolving and unsettled area of regulation, the imposition of any new significant restrictions or technological requirements could have a negative impact on our business.\nVarious governmental bodies and many customers and businesses are increasingly focused on environmental, social and governance issues, which has in the past resulted, and may in the future continue to result, in the adoption of new laws and regulations and changing buying practices. If we fail to keep pace with these developments, our reputation and results of operations could be adversely impacted.\nWe might unintentionally violate such laws now or in the future; such laws or their interpretation or application may be modified; and new laws may be enacted in the future. Any such developments could subject us to legal liability exposure, and harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe may be subject to governmental export controls and economic sanctions regulations that could impair our ability to compete in international markets due to licensing requirements and could subject us to liability if we are not in compliance with applicable laws.\nCertain of our products and services may be subject to export control and economic sanctions regulations, including the U.S. Export Administration Regulations, U.S. Customs regulations and various economic and trade sanctions regulations administered by the U.S. Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control. Exports of our products and the provision of our services must be made in compliance with these laws and regulations. If we fail to comply with these laws and regulations, we and certain of our employees could be subject to substantial civil or criminal penalties, including: the possible loss of export privileges; fines, which may be imposed on us and responsible employees or managers; and, in extreme cases, the incarceration of responsible employees or managers. Obtaining the necessary authorizations, including any required license, for a particular deployment may be time-consuming, is not guaranteed and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities. In addition, changes in our products or services, or changes in applicable export or economic sanctions regulations may create delays in the introduction and deployment of our products and services in international markets, or, in some cases, prevent the export of our products or provision of our services to certain countries or end users. Any change in export or economic sanctions regulations, shift in the enforcement or scope of existing regulations, or change in the countries, governments, persons or technologies\ntargeted by such regulations, could also result in decreased use of our products and services, or in our decreased ability to export our products or provide our services to existing or prospective customers with international operations. Any decreased use of our products and services or limitation on our ability to export our products and provide our services could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Further, we incorporate encryption technology into certain of our products. Various countries regulate the import of certain encryption technology, including through import permitting and licensing requirements, and have enacted laws that could limit our customers\u2019 ability to import our products into those countries. Encryption products and the underlying technology may also be subject to export control restrictions. Governmental regulation of encryption technology and regulation of exports of encryption products, or our failure to obtain required approval for our products, when applicable, could harm our international sales and adversely affect our revenue. Compliance with applicable regulatory requirements regarding the export of our products and provision of our services, including with respect to new releases of our products and services, may create delays in the introduction of our products and services in international markets, prevent our customers with international operations from deploying our products and using our services throughout their globally-distributed systems or, in some cases, prevent the export of our products or provision of our services to some countries altogether.\nIndustry-specific regulation is evolving and unfavorable industry-specific laws, regulations or interpretive positions could harm our business.\nOur customers and potential customers do business in a variety of industries, including financial services, the public sector, healthcare and telecommunications. Regulators of various industries have adopted and may in the future adopt regulations or interpretive positions regarding the use of cloud computing and other outsourced services. The costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, industry-specific laws, regulations and interpretive positions may limit our customers\u2019 use and adoption of our services and reduce overall demand. For example, some financial services regulators have imposed guidelines for use of cloud computing services that mandate specific controls or that require financial services providers to obtain regulatory approval prior to outsourcing certain functions. If we are unable to comply with these guidelines or controls, or if our customers are unable to obtain regulatory approval to use our service where required, our business may be harmed and we may be unable to conduct business with customers in such industries. In addition, an inability to satisfy the standards of certain third-party certification bodies that our customers may expect, such as the Payment Card Industry (PCI) Data Security Standards, may have an adverse impact on our business. If we are unable in the future to achieve or maintain these industry-specific certifications or comply with other similar requirements or standards that are relevant to our customers, our business and our revenue may be adversely impacted.\nIn some cases, industry-specific laws, regulations or interpretive positions may also apply directly to us as a service provider. Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with such requirements could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\nIn addition, we may become subject to additional regulatory and compliance burdens as we expand our product offerings into new conversational businesses. For example, we recently launched a new conversational banking initiative. While we are relying on the banking license of a third party and certain of their compliance programs for this initiative, if we or our partner fail to comply with applicable laws, rules and regulations, fail to successfully manage our regulatory or compliance obligations, or fail to obtain and maintain required licenses, we could be subject to fines and/or proceedings by governmental agencies, regulatory bodies, and/or private litigation, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFuture regulation of the Internet or mobile devices may slow our growth, resulting in decreased demand for our services and increased costs of doing business.\nState, federal and foreign regulators could adopt laws and regulations that impose additional burdens on companies that conduct business online or that adversely affect the growth or use of the Internet or mobile commerce. For example, these laws and regulations could discourage communication by e-mail or other web-based communications, particularly targeted e-mail of the type facilitated by our services, which could reduce demand for our services. Laws or regulations that affect the use of the Internet or mobile devices, including but not limited to laws affecting net neutrality could also decrease demand for our services and increase our costs. Some jurisdictions have adopted regulations prohibiting certain forms of discrimination by Internet access providers; however, substantial uncertainty exists in the United States and elsewhere. For example, in the United States, the Federal Communications Commission repealed net neutrality rules effective June 11, 2018, which could lead internet access providers to restrict, block, degrade or charge for access to our products and services. Further, regulatory focus on data privacy, data security and consumer protection continues to expand on a worldwide basis and is becoming more complex, which will increase the risks to our business on reputational, operational, and compliance bases.\nThe continued growth and development of the market for online services may prompt calls for more stringent consumer protection laws or laws that will inhibit the use of Internet-based or mobile-based communications or the information contained\nin these communications or the ways in which information may be collected, stored, used and transferred in the course of providing services. For example, in the United States, the CAN-SPAM Act regulates the transmission and content of commercial emails, and, among other things, obligates the sending of such emails to provide recipients with the ability to opt-out or unsubscribe and other requirements; and the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act regulates the ability of certain online services to collect or use certain categories of information from children under age 13 absent parental consent. The adoption of any additional laws or regulations, or changes to existing laws or regulations, may decrease the expansion of the Internet or smartphone usage. A decline in the growth of the Internet or smartphone usage, particularly as it relates to online communication, could decrease demand for our services and increase our costs of doing business, or otherwise harm our business. Any new legislation or regulations, application of laws and regulations from jurisdictions whose laws do not currently apply to our business, or application of existing laws and regulations to the Internet, mobile and other online services could increase our costs and harm our growth.\nRisks Related to our Intellectual Property\nOur products and services may infringe upon intellectual property rights of third parties and any infringement could require us to incur substantial costs and may distract our management.\nWe have had patent and other infringement lawsuits filed against us claiming that certain of our products and services infringe third party intellectual property rights, and we are subject to the future risk of additional third party claims alleging infringement against us or against our customers for use of our products and services. Many of our customer and partner contracts, including certain suppliers, contain indemnification obligations requiring us to indemnify our customers from certain claims against them or arising from the use of our services. Substantial litigation regarding intellectual property rights exists in the software industry. In the ordinary course of our business, our services and/or our customers\u2019 use of our services may be increasingly subject to third-party infringement claims as claims by non-practicing entities become more prevalent and the number of competitors in our industry segment grows and the functionality of services in different industry segments overlaps. Some of our competitors in the market for digital engagement technology, and/or web and mobile based consumer-facing services or other third parties may have filed or may intend to file patent applications covering aspects of their technology and have asserted and may in the future assert claims against us. Any claims alleging infringement of third-party intellectual property rights could require us to spend significant amounts in litigation (even if the claim is invalid), distract management from other tasks of operating our business, pay substantial damage awards, prevent us from selling our products, delay delivery of our services, require the development of non-infringing software, technology, business processes, systems or other intellectual property (none of which might be successful), or limit our ability to use the intellectual property that is the subject of any of these claims, unless we enter into license agreements with the third parties (which may be costly, unavailable on commercially reasonable terms, or not available at all). Therefore, any such claims could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nOur business and prospects would suffer if we are unable to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights.\nOur success and ability to compete depend, in part, upon the protection of our intellectual property rights relating to the technology underlying our services. We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trade secret, trademark and other common law protections in the United States and other jurisdictions, as well as confidentiality requirements and contractual provisions, to protect our proprietary technology, processes and other intellectual property. We own a portfolio of patents and patent applications in the United States and internationally and regularly file patent applications to protect intellectual property that we believe is important to our business, including intellectual property related to digital engagement technology, and/or web and mobile based consumer-facing services. We believe the duration of our patents is adequate relative to the expected lives of our products and services. We pursue the registration of our domain names, trademarks and trade names in the United States and in certain locations outside the United States. We also own copyrights, including in our software, publications and other documents authored by us. These intellectual property rights are important to our business and marketing efforts. We seek to protect our intellectual property rights by relying on federal, state, and common law rights, including registration, or otherwise in the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions, as well as contractual restrictions. However, we believe that factors such as the technological and creative skills of our personnel, new service developments, frequent enhancements and reliable maintenance are more essential to establishing and maintaining a competitive advantage. Others may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology. We enter into confidentiality and other written agreements (including invention assignment agreements) with our employees, consultants, customers, potential customers, strategic partners, and other third parties, and through these and other written agreements, we attempt to control access to and distribution of our software, documentation and other proprietary information. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, third parties may, in an unauthorized manner, attempt to use, copy or otherwise obtain and market or distribute our intellectual property rights or technology or otherwise develop a service with the same functionality as our services. Policing unauthorized use of our services and intellectual property rights is difficult, and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent misappropriation of our technology or intellectual property rights, particularly in foreign countries where we do business, where our services are\nsold or used, where the laws may not protect proprietary rights as fully as do the laws of the United States or where enforcement of laws protecting proprietary rights is not common or effective.\nThe duration of the protection afforded to our intellectual property depends on the type of property in question, the laws and regulations of the relevant jurisdiction and the terms of its license agreements with others. With respect to our trademarks and trade names, trademark laws and rights are generally territorial in scope and limited to those countries where a mark has been registered or protected. While trademark registrations may generally be maintained in effect for as long as the mark is in use in the respective jurisdictions, there may be occasions where a mark or title is not registrable or protectable or cannot be used in a particular country. In addition, a trademark registration may be cancelled or invalidated if challenged by others based on certain use requirements or other limited grounds. The duration of property rights in trademarks, service marks and tradenames in the United States, whether registered or not, is predicated on our continued use.\nIt is possible that:\n\u2022 any issued patent or patents issued in the future may not be broad enough to protect our intellectual property rights;\n\u2022 any issued patent or any patents issued in the future could be successfully challenged by one or more third parties, which could result in our loss of the right to prevent others from exploiting the inventions claimed in the patents;\n\u2022 current and future competitors may independently develop similar technologies, duplicate our services or design around any patents we may have; and\n\u2022 effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which we do business, where our services are sold or used, where the laws may not protect proprietary rights as fully as do the laws of the United States or where enforcement of laws protecting proprietary rights is not common or effective.\nFurther, to the extent that the invention described in any United States patent was made public prior to the filing of the patent application, we may not be able to obtain patent protection in certain countries. We also rely upon copyright, trade secret, trademark and other common law in the United States and other jurisdictions, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions, to protect our proprietary technology, processes and other intellectual property. Any steps we might take may not be adequate to protect against infringement and misappropriation of our intellectual property by third parties. Similarly, third parties may be able to independently develop similar or superior technology, processes or other intellectual property. Third parties may register marks that are confusingly similar to the trademarks or services marks that we have used in the United States and our failure to monitor foreign registrations or mark usage may impact out rights in certain trademarks or services marks. Policing unauthorized use of our services and intellectual property rights is difficult, and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent misappropriation of our technology or intellectual property rights, particularly in foreign countries where we do business, where our services are sold or used, where the laws may not protect proprietary rights as fully as do the laws of the United States or where enforcement of laws protecting proprietary rights is not common or effective. The unauthorized reproduction or other misappropriation of our intellectual property rights could enable third parties to benefit from our technology without paying us for it. If this occurs, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, disputes concerning the ownership or rights to use intellectual property could be costly and time-consuming to litigate, may distract management from operating our business and may result in our loss of significant rights.\nIssues in the use of AI in our product offerings may result in reputational harm or liability.\nWe have built, and will continue to build, AI into many of our product offerings and we expect this element of our business to grow. We envision a future in which AI operating in our devices, applications and the cloud helps our customers be more productive in their business activities and interactions with consumers. As with many disruptive innovations, AI presents risks and challenges that could affect its adoption, and therefore our business. AI algorithms may be flawed. Datasets may be insufficient or contain biased information. Inappropriate or controversial data practices by us or others could impair the acceptance of AI solutions. These deficiencies could undermine the decisions, predictions, or analysis AI applications produce, subjecting us to competitive harm, legal liability, and brand or reputational harm. Some AI scenarios present ethical issues. If we enable or offer AI solutions that are controversial because of their impact on human rights, privacy, employment, or other social issues, we may experience a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may be subject to legal liability and/or negative publicity for the services provided to consumers via our technology platforms.\nOur technology platforms enable representatives of our customers as well as individual service providers to communicate with consumers and other persons seeking information or advice on the web or via mobile devices. The law relating to the liability of online platform providers such as us for the activities of users of their online platforms is often challenged in the United States and internationally. We may be unable to prevent users of our technology platforms from providing negligent, unlawful or inappropriate advice, information or content via our technology platforms, or from behaving in\nan unlawful manner, and we may be subject to allegations of civil or criminal liability for negligent, fraudulent, unlawful or inappropriate activities carried out by users of our technology platforms.\nClaims could be made against online services companies under both United States and foreign law, such as fraud, defamation, libel, invasion of privacy, negligence, data breach, copyright or trademark infringement, or other theories based on the nature and content of the materials disseminated by users of our technology platforms. In addition, domestic and foreign legislation has been proposed that could prohibit or impose liability for the transmission over the Internet of certain types of information. Our defense of any of these actions could be costly and involve significant time and attention of our management and other resources.\nThe Digital Millennium Copyright Act, or DMCA, is intended, among other things, to reduce the liability of online service providers for transmitting or storing materials that infringe copyrights of others or referring, listing or linking to third party web properties that include materials that infringe copyrights of others. Additionally, Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, or CDA, is intended to provide statutory protections to online service providers who host or distribute third party content. A safe harbor for copyright infringement is also available under the DMCA to certain online service providers that provide specific services, if the providers take certain affirmative steps as set forth in the DMCA. There are various Congressional efforts to restrict the scope of the protections from liability for service providers in certain circumstances. Important questions regarding the safe harbor under the DMCA and the CDA have yet to be litigated, and we cannot guarantee that we will meet the safe harbor requirements of the DMCA or of the CDA. If we are not covered by a safe harbor, for any reason, we could be exposed to claims, which could be costly and time-consuming to defend.\nOur consumer service allows consumers to provide feedback regarding service providers. Although all such feedback is generated by users and not by us, claims of defamation or other injury could be made against us for content posted on our websites. Our liability for such claims may be higher in jurisdictions outside the United States where laws governing Internet or mobile transactions are unsettled.\nIf we become liable for information provided by our users and carried via our service in any jurisdiction in which we operate, we could be directly harmed and we may be forced to implement new measures to reduce our exposure to this liability. In addition, the increased attention focused upon liability issues as a result of these lawsuits and legislative proposals could harm our reputation or otherwise impact the growth of our business. Any costs incurred as a result of this potential liability could harm our business.\nIn addition, negative publicity and user sentiment generated as a result of fraudulent or deceptive conduct by users of our technology platforms could damage our reputation, reduce our ability to attract new users or retain our current users, and diminish the value of our brand.\nIn the future, we may be required to spend substantial resources to take additional protective measures or discontinue certain service offerings, either of which could harm our business. Any costs incurred as a result of potential liability relating to the sale of unlawful services or the unlawful sale of services could harm our business. In addition to legislation and regulations relating to privacy and data security and collection, we may be subject to consumer protection laws that are enforced by regulators such as the FTC and private parties, and include statutes that regulate the collection and use of information for marketing purposes. Any new legislation or regulations regarding the Internet, mobile devices, software sales or export and/or the cloud or Software-as-a-Service industry, and/or the application of existing laws and regulations to the Internet, mobile devices, software sales or export and/or the cloud or Software-as-a-Service industry, could create new legal or regulatory burdens on our business that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, as we operate outside the United States, the international regulatory environment relating to the Internet, mobile devices, software sales or export, and/or the Software-as-a-Service industry could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to our International Operations and Tax Issues\nOur results of operations may be adversely impacted due to our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\nWe conduct business in currencies other than the U.S. dollar in Europe, Australia, Japan and Israel. As we continue to expand our international operations we become more exposed to the effects of fluctuations in currency exchange rates. As a result of the expanding size and scope of our international operations, our currency rate fluctuation risk associated with the exchange rate movement of the U.S. dollar has increased.\nSince we conduct business in currencies other than the U.S. dollar but report our financial results in U.S. dollars, fluctuations in currency exchange rates could adversely affect our results of operations. For example, during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2020, we experienced a foreign currency exchange impact of approximately 0.6% percent, or approximately $2.2 million if held in constant currency, to our revenue. Fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to other foreign currencies could materially affect our revenue, cost of revenue and operating expenses, and result in foreign currency transaction gains and losses. In January 2015, we began hedging a portion of our foreign currency exchange rate exposure; however, significant fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies may nonetheless adversely affect our net income (loss). As of December 31, 2019, we are no longer party to any foreign currency hedging transactions. We may seek to enter into additional hedging transactions in the future or to use financial instruments, such as derivative financial instruments, to mitigate risk, but we may be unable to enter into them successfully, on acceptable terms or at all. Additionally, these programs rely on our ability to forecast accurately and could expose us to additional risks that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. We cannot predict whether or not we will incur foreign exchange losses in the future. To the extent the international component of our revenues grows, our results of operations will become more sensitive to foreign exchange rate fluctuations.\nEconomic conditions and regulatory changes caused by the United Kingdom\u2019s exit from the European Union could negatively impact our business.\nOn January 31, 2020, the United Kingdom (\u201cU.K.\u201d) withdrew its membership from the European Union (\u201cE.U.\u201d), which is commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit.\u201d Pursuant to the withdrawal arrangements entered into between the U.K. and the E.U. in connection with Brexit, the U.K. was no longer a part of the E.U. at the end of the transition period on December 31, 2020. While the U.K. has for the most part chosen to retain existing E.U. law and on December 24, 2020 the U.K. and E.U. agreed to a trade and cooperation agreement which took provisional effect from January 1, 2020, the longer term economic, legal, political and social implications for the U.K. and the E.U. remain unclear and may lead to ongoing political, regulatory and economic uncertainty and periods of exacerbated volatility in both the U.K. and in wider European markets for some time. Such uncertainty may have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate in the U.K. and the E.U.\nBrexit has resulted in significant volatility in global stock market and currency exchange rate fluctuations that resulted in strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to other foreign currencies in which we conduct business and global economic uncertainty. The continuing uncertainty may cause our customers to closely monitor their costs and reduce their spending budgets. This could negatively impact our business, including affecting our relationships with our existing and future customers, suppliers and employees.\nFurther volatility in exchange rates resulting from Brexit is expected to continue in the short term as a result of Brexit. We translate sales and other results denominated in foreign currency into U.S. dollars for our financial statements. During periods of a strengthening dollar, our reported international sales and earnings could be reduced because foreign currencies may translate into fewer U.S. dollars.\nThe longer term economic, legal, political and social implications of Brexit could potentially disrupt the markets we serve and the tax jurisdictions in which we operate and adversely change tax benefits or liabilities in these or other jurisdictions. They may also impact how we deliver our products and services to customers in the U.K. and in the E.U., which may cause us to lose customers, suppliers and/or employees and could result in increased operating expenses. In addition, Brexit could lead to further legal uncertainty and potentially divergent laws and regulations, as well as other adverse effects that we are unable to anticipate. Any of these effects of Brexit, among others, could negatively impact our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and prospects.\nWe may be unsuccessful in expanding our operations internationally and/or into direct-to-consumer services due to additional regulatory requirements, tax liabilities, currency exchange rate fluctuations and other risks, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nIn addition to our operations in the United States, we have operations in Australia, Bulgaria, Canada, France, Germany, Israel, Italy, Japan, Latin America, Netherlands, Singapore, Spain and the United Kingdom. We have also continued to invest in global messaging initiatives and in acquisitions. Our ability to continue to expand into international markets and in the online consumer market involves various risks, including the possibility that returns on such investments will not be achieved in the near future, or ever, and the difficulty of competing in markets with which we are unfamiliar.\nOur international operations and direct-to-consumer services may also fail due to other risks inherent in foreign and/or online consumer operations, including:\n\u2022 varied, unfamiliar, unclear and changing legal and regulatory restrictions, including different legal and regulatory standards applicable to Internet or mobile services, communications, privacy, and data protection;\n\u2022 difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations;\n\u2022 differing intellectual property laws that may not provide sufficient protection for our intellectual property;\n\u2022 adverse tax consequences or additional tax liabilities;\n\u2022 difficulty in addressing country-specific business requirements and regulations, for instance, data privacy laws;\n\u2022 fluctuations in currency exchange rates;\n\u2022 strains on financial and other systems to properly administer VAT and other taxes;\n\u2022 different consumer preferences and requirements in specific international markets; and\n\u2022 international legal, compliance, political, regulatory or systemic restrictions, or other international governmental scrutiny, applicable to United States companies with sales and operations in foreign countries, including, but not limited to, possible compliance issues involving the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act, and similar laws in other jurisdictions.\nOur current and any future international expansion plans will require management attention and resources and may be unsuccessful. We may find it impossible or prohibitively expensive to continue expand internationally or we may be unsuccessful in our attempt to do so, and our results of operations could be adversely impacted. In addition, violations of any foreign laws or regulations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation.\nOur operations may expose us to greater than anticipated income, non-income and transactional tax liabilities, which could harm our financial condition and results of operations.\nThere is heightened scrutiny by fiscal authorities in many jurisdictions on the potential taxation of e-commerce businesses. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has issued guidelines, referred to as the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting project (BEPS), to its member-nations aimed at encouraging broad-based legislative initiatives intended to prevent perceived base erosion transactions and income shifting in a tax-advantaged manner. Further, for the past several years, the OECD has had a specific focus on the taxation implications of e-commerce business, generally referred by the OECD as the \u201cdigital economy.\u201d In the fourth quarter of 2019, the OECD released details on its proposed approach which would, among other changes, create a new right to tax certain \u201cdigital economy\u201d income not necessarily based on traditional nexus concepts nor on the \u201carm\u2019s length principle.\u201d At this point, there is a lack of consensus among the key members, particularly the United States, with the latest OECD proposal. The United States has expressed that it would generally support a solution along the lines proposed by the OECD only if the solution was in the form of a \u201csafe-harbor\u201d rather than a mandatory requirement. A failure to reach full consensus on an executable plan within the tight timeframe under which the OECD is operating could result in individual jurisdictions legislating digital tax provisions in an uncoordinated and unilateral manner, and further result in greater or even double taxation that companies may not have sufficient means to remedy. For example, a number of jurisdictions, including the U.K., France and Italy, have already adopted or have formally proposed legislation to effect the taxation of certain e-commerce business based on differing criteria and metrics. Efforts to alleviate this increased tax burden will increase the cost of structuring and compliance as well as the cost of doing business internationally. Any changes to the taxation of our international activities may increase our worldwide effective tax rate and adversely impact our financial position and results of operations.\nFurther, the prospective taxation by multiple jurisdictions of e-commerce businesses could subject us to exposure to withholding, sales, VAT and/or other transaction taxes on our past and future transactions in such jurisdictions where we currently or in the future may be required to report taxable transactions. A successful assertion by any jurisdiction that we failed to pay such withholding, sales, VAT or other transaction taxes, or the imposition of new laws requiring the registration for, collection of, and payment of such taxes, could result in substantial tax liabilities related to past, current and future sales, create increased administrative burdens and costs, discourage customers from purchasing content from us, or otherwise substantially harm our business and results of operations. We are currently subject to and in the future may become subject to additional compliance requirements for certain of these taxes. Changes in our exposure to withholding, sales, VAT and/or other transaction taxes could have an adverse impact on our financial condition in the future.\nIn addition, an increasing number of states have considered or adopted laws that attempt to impose tax collection obligations on out-of-state companies. In June 2018, the Supreme Court of the United States issued its decision in the matter of South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc. This decision effectively reversed the 25-year-old \u201cphysical presence doctrine\u201d previously established by the Supreme Court in Quill Corp. v. North Dakota, which required a minimum level of physical presence within a state before the state could impose an obligation to register and remit sales tax on revenue derived within that state. This decision may significantly increase the effort, resources and costs associated with the sales tax collection and compliance burden. Since the decision, a number of states have enacted sales tax enabling legislation which has had the effect of significantly expanding the liability of e-commerce companies to register, collect and remit state sales taxes from customers. A successful assertion by one or more states requiring us to collect taxes where we presently do not do so, or to collect more taxes in a jurisdiction in which we currently do collect some taxes, could result in substantial tax liabilities, including taxes on past sales, as well as penalties and interest. The imposition by state governments or local governments of sales tax collection obligations on out-of-state sellers could also create additional administrative burdens for us, put us at a competitive disadvantage if they do not impose similar obligations on our competitors, and decrease our future sales, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur ability to use our net operating losses to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had federal net operating loss carryforwards (\u201cNOLs\u201d) of approximately $310.7 million which are available to offset future federal taxable income. In general, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d), a corporation that undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d (generally defined as a greater than 50-percentage-point cumulative change (by value) in the equity ownership of certain stockholders over a rolling three-year period) is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its pre-change NOLs to offset post-change taxable income. Under Section 382 of the Code, our existing NOLs may be subject to limitations arising from previous ownership changes, and if we undergo an ownership change in the future, our ability to utilize NOLs could be further limited by Section 382 of the Code, or as a result of a corresponding provision of state law. Future changes in our stock ownership, some of which may be outside of our control, could result in an ownership change under Section 382 of the Code. Federal NOLs generated in taxable years ending on or before December 31, 2017, are eligible to be carried forward for up to 20 tax years (and carried back up to two tax years) following their incurrence. Federal NOLs generated in taxable years ending after December 31, 2017, are eligible to be carried forward indefinitely, but generally may only offset up to 80% of federal taxable income earned in a taxable year. As of December 31, 2020, approximately $41.2 million of our approximately $310.7 million of federal NOLs were generated in taxable years ending on or before December 31, 2017. If our ability to utilize federal NOLs were limited by Section 382 of the Code, it could result in NOLs generated on or before December 31, 2017, expiring unused. Our ability to utilize our NOLs is conditioned upon our maintaining profitability in the future and generating U.S. federal taxable income. Since we do not know whether or when we will generate the U.S. federal taxable income necessary to utilize our remaining NOLs, our NOLs generated on or prior to December 31, 2017 could expire unused.\nOn March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act was signed into law making several changes to the Code including, but not limited to, allowing companies to carryback certain NOLs and increasing the amount of NOL carryforwards that corporations can use to offset taxable income in the 2018 through 2020 taxable years. As a result of the CARES Act, we amended returns for net operating loss carrybacks available from 2013 to 2018 and for foreign tax, and research and development credit carrybacks from 2012 to 2013, resulting in refund claims of approximately $580,000.\nPolitical, economic and military conditions in Israel could negatively impact our Israeli operations.\nA substantial portion of our product development staff, help desk and online sales support operations are located in Israel. As of December 31, 2020, we had 325 full-time employees in Israel. Although substantially all of our sales to date have been made to customers outside Israel, we are directly influenced by the political, economic and military conditions affecting Israel. Since the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948, a number of armed conflicts have taken place between Israel and its neighboring countries, Hamas (an Islamist militia and political group that controls the Gaza Strip), Hezbollah (an Islamist militia and political group based in Lebanon) and other armed groups. Furthermore, Iran has threatened to attack Israel and may be developing nuclear weapons.\nIn addition, the State of Israel and Israeli companies have been subject to economic boycotts. Several countries still restrict business with the State of Israel and with Israeli companies. These restrictive laws and policies may have an adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition or the expansion of our business. A campaign of boycotts, divestment, and sanctions has been undertaken against Israel, which could also adversely affect our business. Actual or perceived political instability in Israel or any negative changes in the political environment, may individually or in the aggregate adversely affect the Israeli economy and, in turn, our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nParties with whom we do business may sometimes decline to travel to Israel during periods of heightened unrest or tension, forcing us to make alternative arrangements when necessary in order to meet our business partners face to face. In addition, the political and security situation in Israel may result in parties with whom we have agreements involving performance in Israel claiming that they are not obligated to perform their commitments under those agreements pursuant to force majeure provisions in such agreements.\nFurther, shifting economic and political conditions in the United States and in other countries may result in changes in how the United States and other countries conduct business and other relations with Israel, which may have an adverse impact on our Israeli operations and a material adverse impact on our business.\nOur commercial insurance may not cover losses that could occur as a result of events associated with the security situation in the Middle East. Any losses or damages incurred by us could have a material adverse effect on our business. Armed conflicts or political instability in the region could negatively affect our business and could harm our results of operations.\nContinued hostilities between Israel and its neighbors and any future armed conflict, terrorist activity or political instability in the region could adversely affect our operations in Israel and adversely affect the market price of our securities. In\naddition, escalation of tensions or violence might require more widespread military reserve service by some of our Israeli employees and might result in a significant downturn in the economic or financial condition of Israel, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations in Israel and our business.\nRisks Related to our Outstanding Convertible Notes\nServicing our debt may require a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our indebtedness.\nIn March 2019, we issued $230.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 0.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2024 in a private placement (the \u201c2024 Notes\u201d). The interest rate on the 2024 Notes is fixed at 0.75% per annum and is payable semi-annually in arrears on March 1 and September 1 of each year. In December 2020, we issued $517.5 million in aggregate principal amount of 0% Convertible Senior Notes due 2026 in a private placement (the \u201c2026 Notes,\u201d and together with the 2024 Notes, the \u201cNotes\u201d). The 2026 Notes do not bear any regular interest payments.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on or to refinance our Notes or any additional future indebtedness depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service our debt and make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt or obtaining additional debt financing or equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance our current or any future indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations. In addition, any of our future debt agreements may contain restrictive covenants that may prohibit us from adopting any of these alternatives. Our failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of our debt.\nWe may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to settle conversions of the Notes in cash or to repurchase the Notes upon a fundamental change, and any future debt may contain limitations on our ability to pay cash upon conversion or repurchase of the Notes.\nHolders of the Notes have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of their Notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change before the maturity date at a fundamental change repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. In addition, upon conversion of the Notes, unless we elect to deliver solely shares of our common stock to settle such conversion (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we are required to make cash payments in respect of the Notes being converted. However, we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to make repurchases of Notes surrendered therefor or pay cash with respect to Notes being converted. In addition, our ability to repurchase Notes or to pay cash upon conversions of Notes may be limited by law, regulatory authority, or any agreements governing our future indebtedness. Our failure to repurchase Notes at a time when the repurchase is required by the indenture or to pay any cash upon conversions of Notes as required by the indenture would constitute a default under the indenture. A default under the indenture or the fundamental change itself could also lead to a default under agreements governing any future indebtedness. If the payment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and repurchase the Notes or to pay cash upon conversions of Notes.\nProvisions in the indentures for the Notes may deter or prevent a business combination that may be favorable to you.\nIf a fundamental change occurs prior to the maturity date of the Notes, the holders of the Notes will have the right, at their option, to require us to repurchase all or a portion of their Notes. In addition, if a make-whole fundamental change occurs prior the maturity date of the Notes, we will in some cases be required to increase the conversion rate for a holder that elects to convert its Notes in connection with such make-whole fundamental change. Furthermore, the indentures for the Notes prohibit us from engaging in certain mergers or acquisitions unless, among other things, the surviving entity assumes our obligations under the Notes. These and other provisions in the indentures governing the Notes could deter or prevent a third party from acquiring us even when the acquisition may be favorable to you.\nThe conditional conversion feature of the Notes, if triggered, may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nIn the event the conditional conversion feature of the Notes is triggered, holders of the Notes will be entitled to convert their Notes at any time during specified periods at their option. If one or more holders elect to convert their Notes, unless we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering solely shares of our common stock (other than paying cash in lieu of\ndelivering any fractional share), we would be required to settle a portion or all of our conversion obligation through the payment of cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity. In addition, even if holders of Notes do not elect to convert their Notes, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the Notes as a current rather than long-term liability, which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital.\nThe accounting method for convertible debt securities that may be settled in cash, such as the Notes, could have a material effect on our reported financial results.\nUnder Accounting Standards Codification 470-20, Debt with Conversion and Other Options, or ASC 470-20, an entity must separately account for the liability and equity components of the convertible debt instruments (such as the Notes) that may be settled entirely or partially in cash upon conversion in a manner that reflects the issuer\u2019s economic interest cost. The effect of ASC 470-20 on the accounting for the Notes is that the equity component, net of issuance costs, is required to be included in the additional paid-in capital section of stockholders\u2019 equity on our condensed consolidated balance sheet at the issuance date and the value of the equity component is treated as original issue discount for purposes of accounting for the liability component of the Notes. As a result, we are required to record a greater amount of non-cash interest expense in current periods presented as a result of the amortization of the discounted carrying value of the Notes to their face amount over the term of the Notes. We will report larger net losses (or lower net income) in our financial results because ASC 470-20 requires interest to include both the current period\u2019s amortization of the debt discount and the instrument\u2019s non-convertible coupon interest rate, which could adversely affect our reported or future financial results, the trading price of our common stock and the trading price of the Notes.\nIn addition, under certain circumstances, convertible debt instruments (such as the Notes) that may be settled entirely or partly in cash may be accounted for utilizing the treasury stock method, the effect of which is that the shares issuable upon conversion of such Notes are not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share except to the extent that the conversion value of such Notes exceeds their principal amount. Under the treasury stock method, for diluted earnings per share purposes, the transaction is accounted for as if the number of shares of common stock that would be necessary to settle such excess, if we elected to settle such excess in shares, are issued. We cannot be sure that the accounting standards in the future will continue to permit the use of the treasury stock method. If we are unable to use the treasury stock method in accounting for the shares issuable upon conversion of the Notes, then our diluted earnings per share would be adversely affected.\nThe capped call transactions may affect the value of the Notes and our common stock.\nIn connection with the transaction in which we issued the Notes, we entered into capped call transactions with certain option counterparties. The capped call transactions are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution to our common stock upon any conversion of Notes and/or offset any cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of the converted Notes, as the case may be, upon any conversion of Notes, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap.\nThe option counterparties or their respective affiliates are expected to modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to our common stock and/or purchasing or selling our common stock, the Notes or other of our securities or instruments (if any), in secondary market transactions prior to the maturity of the Notes (and are likely to do so during any observation period related to a conversion of Notes or following any earlier conversion or any repurchase of Notes by us on any fundamental change repurchase date or otherwise). This activity could also cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in the market price of our common stock or the Notes, which could affect a holder\u2019s ability to convert the Notes and, to the extent the activity occurs during any observation period related to a conversion of Notes, it could affect the amount and value of the consideration that a holder will receive upon conversion of such Notes.\nThe potential effect, if any, of these transactions and activities on the market price of our common stock or the Notes will depend in part on market conditions and cannot be ascertained at this time. Any of these activities could adversely affect the value of our common stock and the value of the Notes (and as a result, the amount and value of the consideration that a holder would receive upon the conversion of any Notes) and, under certain circumstances, a holder\u2019s ability to convert his or her Notes.\nWe do not make any representation or prediction as to the direction or magnitude of any potential effect that the transactions described above may have on the price of our common stock or the Notes. In addition, we do not make any representation that the option counterparties or their respective affiliates will engage in these transactions or that these transactions, once commenced, will not be discontinued without notice.\nWe are subject to counterparty risk with respect to the capped call transactions.\nThe option counterparties to the capped call transactions are financial institutions, and we are subject to the risk that any or all of them may default under the capped calls. Our exposure to the credit risk of the option counterparties is not secured by\nany collateral. Global economic conditions have in the recent past resulted in, and may again result in, the actual or perceived failure or financial difficulties of many financial institutions. If an option counterparty becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings, with a claim equal to our exposure at that time under our transactions with that option counterparty. Our exposure depends on many factors but, generally, an increase in our exposure will be correlated to an increase in the market price and in the volatility of our common stock. In addition, upon a default by an option counterparty, we may suffer more dilution than we currently anticipate with respect to our common stock. We can provide no assurances as to the financial stability or viability of the option counterparties.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock\nOur stock price has been, and may continue to be, highly volatile, which could reduce the value of your investment and subject us to litigation.\nThe price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past and may continue to be highly volatile, with extreme price and volume fluctuations. Our trading price could fluctuate substantially in the future, including in response to the following factors, some of which are beyond our control:\n\u2022 quarterly variations in our operating results or those of our competitors;\n\u2022 earnings announcements that are not in line with analyst expectations;\n\u2022 changes in recommendations or financial estimates by securities analysts;\n\u2022 announcements or rumors about mergers or strategic acquisitions by us or by our competitors;\n\u2022 announcements about customer additions and cancellations or failure to complete significant sales;\n\u2022 changes in market valuations of companies that investors believe are comparable to us;\n\u2022 additions or departures of key personnel;\n\u2022 consequences of unexpected geopolitical events, natural disasters, acts of war or climate change;\n\u2022 pandemics, epidemics or similar widespread public health concerns; and\n\u2022 general economic, political and market conditions, such as recessions, political unrest or terrorist attacks, or in the specific locations where we operate, such as the United States, Israel and the United Kingdom.\nIn addition, extreme price and volume fluctuations in the stock markets generally, and in the markets for technology companies in particular, could cause the market price for our common stock to decline. In the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been the subject of securities class action litigation. We may in the future be the target of similar litigation, which could result in substantial costs and distract management\u2019s attention and resources.\nOur common stock is traded on more than one market and this may result in price variations.\nOur common stock is currently traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market and the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange (\u201cTASE\u201d). Trading in our common stock on these markets takes place in different currencies (U.S. dollars on the Nasdaq and New Israeli Shekels on the TASE) and at different times (due to different time zones, trading days and public holidays in the United States and Israel). The trading prices of our common stock on these two markets may differ due to these and other factors. Any decrease in the trading price of our common stock on one of these markets could cause a decrease in the trading price of our common stock on the other market. Differences in trading prices on the two markets could negatively impact our trading price.\nIf our officers, directors and largest stockholders choose to act together, they may be able to significantly influence our management and operations, acting in their own best interest and not necessarily those of our other stockholders.\nAs of December 31, 2020, our executive officers, directors and holders of 5% or more of our outstanding common stock and their affiliates in the aggregate beneficially owned approximately 44.2% of our outstanding common stock. As a result, these stockholders, acting together, have the ability to significantly influence all matters requiring approval by our stockholders, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions. Our executive officers, directors and principal stockholders could also delay or prevent a change in control. The interests of this group of stockholders may not always coincide with LivePerson\u2019s interests or the interests of other stockholders, and they may act in a manner that advances their best interests and not necessarily those of our other stockholders.\nFuture sales of substantial amounts of our common stock may negatively affect our stock price.\nIf we or our stockholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock, including shares issuable upon the exercise of outstanding options and warrants, or upon the conversion of the Notes, in the public market, or if the market perceives that these sales might occur, the market price of our common stock could fall. These sales also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and price that we deem appropriate. No prediction can be made as to the effect, if any, that market sales of our common stock will have on the market price of our common stock.\nProvisions in our charter documents and Delaware law could discourage, delay or prevent a takeover that stockholders may consider favorable.\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may have the effect of discouraging, delaying or preventing a change in control or changes in our management that stockholders may deem advantageous. These provisions include the following:\n\u2022 Our board of directors is divided into three classes, with each class serving three-year staggered terms, which prevents stockholders from electing an entirely new board of directors at any annual meeting.\n\u2022 Vacancies on our board of directors may only be filled by a vote of a majority of directors then in office, even if less than a quorum.\n\u2022 Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation prohibits cumulative voting in the election of directors or any other matters. This limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect director candidates.\n\u2022 Our stockholders may only act at a duly called annual or special meeting and may not act by written consent.\n\u2022 Stockholders must provide advance notice to nominate individuals for election to our board of directors or to propose other matters that can be acted upon at a stockholders\u2019 meeting.\n\u2022 We require super-majority voting by stockholders to amend certain provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and to amend our amended and restated bylaws.\n\u2022 Our amended and restated bylaws expressly authorize a super-majority of the board of directors to amend our amended and restated bylaws.\nAs a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which generally prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any of a broad range of business combinations with an interested stockholder for a period of three years following the date on which the stockholder became an interested stockholder, unless certain conditions are met. This anti-takeover provision defenses could discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company, whether or not it is desired by or beneficial to our stockholders, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\nWe cannot assure our stockholders that any stock repurchase programs will be fully consummated or will enhance long-term stockholder value, and stock repurchases could increase the volatility of the price of our common stock and will diminish our cash reserves.\nFrom 2012 through 2018, we had a stock repurchase program in place, pursuant to which we were authorized to repurchase shares of our common stock, in the open market or privately negotiated transactions, at times and prices considered appropriate by the Board of Directors depending upon prevailing market conditions and other corporate considerations. The timing and actual number of shares repurchased depended on a variety of factors including the timing of open trading windows, price, corporate and regulatory requirements, and other market conditions. The program was discontinued at the end of 2018. We may or may not enter into a new stock repurchase program in the future.\nRepurchases pursuant to our stock repurchase program could affect our stock price and increase its volatility. The existence of a stock repurchase program could also cause our stock price to be higher than it would be in the absence of such a program and could potentially reduce the market liquidity for our stock. Additionally, repurchases under a stock repurchase program would diminish our cash reserves, which could impact our ability to pursue possible future strategic opportunities and acquisitions and could result in lower overall returns on our cash balances. There can be no assurance that any stock repurchases will enhance stockholder value because the market price of our common stock may decline below the levels at which we repurchased shares of stock.",

    "item_3": "Item 3. Legal Proceedings\nWe previously filed an intellectual property suit against [24]7 Customer, Inc. (\"[24]/7\") in the Southern District of New York on March 6, 2014 seeking damages on the grounds that [24]7 reverse engineered and misappropriated our technology to develop competing products and misused our business information. On June 22, 2015, [24]7 Customer, Inc. filed suit against us in the Northern District of California alleging patent infringement. On December 7, 2015, [24]7 Customer Inc. filed a second patent infringement suit against us, also in the Northern District of California. On March 16, 2017, the New York case was voluntarily transferred and consolidated with the two California cases in the Northern District of California for all pre-trial purposes. Rulings by both the Court and the United States Patent Office in our favor have invalidated the majority of [24]7 patents that were asserted in the patent cases. Trial for our intellectual property and other claims asserted against [24]7 is set for May 24, 2021. Trial for [24]7's patent infringement claims has been vacated, to be reset after the trial on our claims. We believe the claims filed by [24]7 are entirely without merit and intend to defend them vigorously.\nWe routinely assess all of our litigation and threatened litigation as to the probability of ultimately incurring a liability, and record our best estimate of the ultimate loss in situations where we assess the likelihood of loss as probable.\nFrom time to time, we are involved in or subject to legal, administrative and regulatory proceedings, claims, demands and investigations arising in the ordinary course of business, including direct claims brought by or against us with respect to intellectual property, contracts, employment and other matters, as well as claims brought against our customers for whom we have a contractual indemnification obligation. We accrue for a liability when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether a loss is reasonably estimable. In addition, in the event we determine that a loss is not probable, but is reasonably possible, and it becomes possible to develop what we believe to be a reasonable range of possible loss, then we will include disclosure related to such matter as appropriate and in compliance with ASC 450. The accruals or estimates, if any, resulting from the foregoing analysis, are reviewed at least quarterly and adjusted to reflect the impact of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel and other information and events pertaining to a particular matter. To the extent there is a reasonable possibility that the losses could exceed the amounts already accrued, we will, as applicable, adjust the accrual in the period the determination is made, disclose an estimate of the additional loss or range of loss, indicate that the estimate is immaterial with respect to our financial statements as a whole or, if the amount of such adjustment cannot be reasonably estimated, disclose that an estimate cannot be made.\nFrom time to time, third parties assert claims against us regarding intellectual property rights, privacy issues and other matters arising in the ordinary course of business. Although we cannot be certain of the outcome of any litigation or the disposition of any claims, nor the amount of damages and exposure, if any, that we could incur, we currently believe that the final disposition of all existing matters will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. In addition, in the ordinary course of our business, we are also subject to periodic threats of lawsuits, investigations and claims. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources and other factors.",

The tables below present a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA and adjusted operating income to net (loss) income, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.\nWe have included adjusted EBITDA and adjusted operating income in this Annual Report on Form 10-K because these are key measures used by our management and board of directors to understand and evaluate our core operating performance and trends, to prepare and approve our annual budget and to develop short and long-term operational plans. In particular, the exclusion of certain expenses in calculating adjusted EBITDA and adjusted operating income can provide a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our core business. Additionally, adjusted EBITDA is a key financial measure used by the compensation committee of our board of directors in connection with the payment of bonuses to our executive officers. Accordingly, we believe that adjusted EBITDA and adjusted operating income provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management and board of directors.\nOur use of adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are:\n\u2022although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements;\n\u2022adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;\n\u2022adjusted EBITDA does not consider the impact of acquisition costs;\n\u2022adjusted EBITDA does not consider the impact of restructuring costs;\n\u2022adjusted EBITDA does not consider the impact of other costs;\n\u2022adjusted EBITDA does not reflect tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us; and\n\u2022other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate adjusted EBITDA differently, which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure.\nBecause of these limitations, you should consider adjusted EBITDA alongside other financial performance measures, including various pre-tax GAAP loss and our other GAAP results.

Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nGeneral\nYou should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this report. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this report, particularly in \u201cRisk Factors.\u201d\nOverview\nLivePerson, Inc. (\u201cLivePerson\u201d, the \u201cCompany\u201d, \u201cwe\u201d or \u201cour\u201d) makes life easier for people and brands everywhere through trusted Conversational AI. Conversational AI allows humans and machines to interact using natural language, including speech or text. During the past decade, consumers have made mobile devices the center of their digital lives, and they have made mobile messaging the center of communication with friends, family and peers. This trend has been significantly accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic and can now be viewed as a permanent, structural shift in consumer behavior. Our\ntechnology enables consumers to connect with businesses through these same preferred conversational interfaces, including Facebook Messenger, SMS, WhatsApp, Apple Business Chat, Google Rich Business Messenger and Alexa. These messaging conversations harness human agents, bots and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to power convenient, personalized and content-rich journeys across the entire consumer lifecycle, from discovery and research, to sales, service and support, and increasingly marketing, social, and brick and mortar engagements. For example, consumers can look up product info like ratings, images and pricing, search for stores, see product inventory, schedule appointments, apply for credit, approve repairs, and make purchases or payments - all without ever leaving the messaging channel. These AI and human-assisted conversational experiences constitute the Conversational Space, within which LivePerson has strategically developed one of the industry's largest ecosystems of messaging endpoints and use cases.\nThe Conversational Cloud, our enterprise-class cloud-based platform, enables businesses to become conversational by securely deploying AI-powered messaging at scale for brands with tens of millions of customers and many thousands of agents. The Conversational Cloud powers conversations across each of a brand\u2019s primary digital channels, including mobile apps, mobile and desktop web browsers, short message service (SMS), social media and third-party consumer messaging platforms. Brands can also use the Conversational Cloud to message consumers when they dial a 1-800 number instead of forcing them to navigate interactive voice response systems (IVRs) and wait on hold. Similarly, the Conversational Cloud can ingest traditional emails and convert them into messaging conversations, or embed messaging conversations directly into web advertisements, rather than redirect consumers to static website landing pages. Agents can manage all conversations with consumers through a single console interface, regardless of where the conversations originated.\nLivePerson's robust, cloud-based suite of rich messaging, real-time chat, AI and automation offerings features consumer and agent facing bots, intelligent routing and capacity mapping, real-time intent detection and analysis, queue prioritization, customer sentiment, analytics and reporting, content delivery, Payment Card Industry (PCI) compliance, cobrowsing and a sophisticated proactive targeting engine. An extensible application programming interface (API) stack facilitates a lower cost of ownership by facilitating robust integration into back-end systems, as well as enabling developers to build their own programs and services on top of the platform. More than 40 APIs and software development kits are available on the Conversational Cloud.\nFor your reference:\n\u2022 Conversational AI: Conversational AI allows humans and machines to interact using natural language, including speech or text.\n\u2022 Conversational Space: In the Conversational Space, consumers message with brands on their own schedule, using natural language, to resolve their intents - all on their preferred messaging service. The core capabilities\nof the Conversational Space are voice and text-based interfaces, powered by AI and humans working together. Conversational Space is the simplest, most intuitive interface of all.\n\u2022 Conversational Cloud: LivePerson's enterprise-class, AI-powered Conversational Cloud platform empowers consumers to message their favorite brands, just as they do with friends and family.\nLivePerson\u2019s Conversational AI offerings put the power of bot development, training, management and analysis into the hands of the contact center and its agents, the teams most familiar with how to structure sales and service conversations to drive successful outcomes. The platform enables what we call \u201cthe tango\u201d of humans, AI and bots, whereby human agents act as bot managers, overseeing AI-powered conversations and seamlessly stepping into the flow when a personal touch is needed. Agents become ultra-efficient, leveraging the AI engine to serve up relevant content, define next-best actions and take over repetitive transactional work, so that the agent can focus on relationship building. By seamlessly integrating messaging with our proprietary Conversational AI, as well as third-party bots, the Conversational Cloud offers brands a comprehensive approach to scaling automations across their millions of customer conversations.\nComplementing our proprietary messaging and Conversational AI offerings are teams of technical, solutions and consulting professionals that have developed deep domain expertise in the implementation and optimization of conversational services across industries and messaging endpoints. We are a leading authority in the Conversational Space. LivePerson\u2019s products, coupled with our domain knowledge, industry expertise and professional services, have been proven to maximize the effectiveness of the Conversational Space and deliver measurable return on investment. Certain of our customers have achieved the following advantages from our offerings:\n\u2022the ability for each agent to manage as many as 40 messaging conversations at a time, as compared to one at a time for a voice agent and two to four at a time for a good chat agent. Adding AI and bots provides even greater scale to the number of conversations managed;\n\u2022labor efficiency gains of at least two times that of voice agents, effectively cutting labor costs by at least 50%;\n\u2022improving the overall customer experience, thereby fueling customer satisfaction increases of up to 20 percentage points, and enhancing retention and loyalty;\n\u2022more convenient, personalized and content-rich conversations that increase sales conversion by up to 20%, increase average order value and reduce abandonment;\n\u2022more satisfied contact center agents, thereby reducing agent churn by up to 50%;\n\u2022maintain a valued connection with consumers via mobile devices, either through native applications, websites, text messages, or third-party messaging platforms;\n\u2022leverage spending that drives visitor traffic by increasing visitor conversions;\n\u2022refine and improve performance by understanding which initiatives deliver the highest rate of return; and\n\u2022increase lead generation by providing a single platform that engages consumers through advertisements and listings on branded and third-party websites.\nAs a \u201ccloud computing\u201d or software-as-a-service (SaaS) provider, LivePerson provides solutions on a hosted basis. This model offers significant benefits over premise-based software, including lower up-front costs, faster implementation, lower total cost of ownership, scalability, cost predictability, and simplified upgrades. Organizations that adopt a fully-hosted, multi-tenant architecture that is maintained by LivePerson eliminate the majority of the time, server infrastructure costs, and IT resources required to implement, maintain, and support traditional on-premise software.\nTo further enhance our platform, in September 2020 we signed a partnership with Infosys, a leader in next-generation\ndigital services and consulting. We will work with Infosys to transform our technology infrastructure on the public cloud, to\nbuild integrated solutions and a global practice around our Conversational Cloud to sell into their channels and global enterprise\ncustomer base, and to redefine how the world\u2019s top brands communicate.\nMore than 18,000 businesses, including HSBC, Orange, The Home Depot, and GM Financial use our conversational solutions to orchestrate humans and AI, at scale, and create a convenient, deeply personal relationship with their customers.\nLivePerson's consumer services offering is an online marketplace that connects independent service providers\n(Experts) who provide information and knowledge for a fee via mobile and online messaging with individual consumers (Users). Users seek assistance and advice in various categories including personal counseling and coaching, computers and\nprogramming, education and tutoring, spirituality and religion, and other topics.\nThe key elements of LivePerson\u2019s business solutions strategy include:\nBuild awareness and drive adoption of the Conversational Space. LivePerson brought our first customer live on messaging in June 2016. Since that time, we have been focused on building awareness for conversational experiences and driving adoption. We have educated businesses on the financial and operational transformation that occurs when a contact center shifts to an asynchronous messaging environment, where the consumer controls the pace of the conversation, which can last minutes, hours or days, from a synchronous call or chat center, where conversations occur in real-time and have a distinct start and end.\nA key component of our industry awareness marketing strategy has been to hold multiple global customer summits each year (events in 2020 were held virtually in light of the COVID-19 pandemic) that target executives from enterprise customers and prospects, and feature a key theme within the Conversational Space, such as Apple Business Chat, Google Rich Business Messenger, IVR deflection or AI. LivePerson customers are the centerpoint of these summits, presenting why they chose LivePerson for conversational experiences, how they achieved success, and what type of ROI they have realized. Each attendee then receives a blueprint for how they can achieve similar outcomes. We have found this strategy to drive strong results for LivePerson, as we have seen a greater than 40% conversion rate on opportunities that were created or advanced as part of the customer summits. By year-end 2020, we had brought approximately 400 customers live on messaging and increased adoption within our enterprise customers to 66%. In addition, nearly 70% of messaging conversations had automation attached. We will continue to focus on building awareness for the Conversational Space and driving adoption of messaging and AI across our customer base.\nIncrease messaging volumes by developing a broad ecosystem, expanding customer use cases, and focusing on AI and automation. Our strategy is to drive higher messaging volumes by going both wide across messaging endpoints, deep across consumer use cases, and focusing on AI and automation as the means to deliver powerful scale. LivePerson offers a platform usage pricing model, where customers are offered access to our entire suite of messaging technologies across their entire agent pool for a pre-negotiated cost per interaction. We believe that over time this model will drive higher revenue for LivePerson by reducing barriers to adoption of new messaging endpoints and use cases.\nIn order to drive broad messaging adoption, it is imperative that the Conversational Cloud integrates to all of the messaging apps that consumers prefer to use for communication and addresses all key use cases. For example, if a consumer is\nan avid WhatsApp user, and a brand only offers SMS as a messaging option, that consumer may be reluctant to try messaging the brand. Therefore, a key strategy of ours has been to build one of the industry\u2019s broadest ecosystems of messaging endpoints and use cases. In June 2016, we launched with In-App messaging. In 2017, we introduced Facebook Messenger, SMS, Web messaging and IVR deflection integrations. In 2018, we added Apple Business Chat, Google Rich Business Messenger, Line, WhatsApp, Alexa, Google Home, Google Ad Lingo and Twitter. In 2019, we added email, allowing brands to manage emails through the same console they use for messaging, and to convert legacy emails into messaging conversations. We also added social monitoring and conversational tools for Twitter and Facebook, and introduced proactive messaging, allowing brands to transform traditional one-way notifications such as flight cancellations or phone plan overage alerts into two-way conversations. Finally, we connected to Facebook and WhatsApp digital advertisements, enabling consumers to initiate messaging conversations for marketing and customer care directly within the advertisement. In 2020, we added Instagram and Google\u2019s Business Messages, allowing brands to bring customer-initiated conversations into the Conversational Cloud directly from Instagram, Google Search, and Google Maps.\nEach channel and use case added opens the door to hundreds of millions of new consumers, providing brands a greater opportunity to shift share away from their legacy contact center channels into messaging. For example, in 2019, leading airlines launched on WhatsApp and Apple Business Chat with the ability to make secure payments; a baseball stadium launched an automated conversational concierge providing answers to a wide range of questions from restroom locations to player stats; and a multinational telecommunications company used proactive two-way messaging for outbound campaigns. In 2020, one of the largest telcos in Australia fully virtualized their contact centers, a leading U.S. quick-serve restaurant launched on Facebook Messenger to help customers order meals, one of the biggest banks in the world launched an Apple Business Chat channel to provide a secure way to perform day-to-day banking, and one of the world\u2019s largest jewelry retailers used the Conversational Cloud and QR codes to sell millions of dollars of product.\nLivePerson makes the management of all these disparate channels seamless to the brand. AI-based intelligent routing, queuing and prioritization software orchestrates these conversations at scale, regardless of which messaging endpoint they originated from, so that human and bot agents can engage with all customers through just one console.\nWe believe LivePerson is leading the structural shift to Conversational AI. In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, leading brands are turning to LivePerson's AI-powered messaging to overcome a capacity gap created by voice call agent work-from-home measures and increased demand for digital engagement as consumers practice social distancing. LivePerson is powering Conversational AI, automation and messaging strategies across a growing number of use cases from care and sales, to marketing, social, conversational advertising and brick and mortar. Our Conversational AI leadership and the increase in adoption have influenced LivePerson\u2019s enterprise and mid-market revenue retention rate, (the trailing-twelve-month change in total revenue from existing customers after upsells, downsells and attrition) which exceeded the high end of our target range of 105% to 115% for 2020. The benefit can also be seen in LivePerson\u2019s average revenue per user (ARPU) for our enterprise and mid-market customers, which increased approximately 35% in 2020 to $465,000 from approximately $345,000 in 2019.\nAttract the industry\u2019s best AI, machine learning and conversational talent. We believe that AI and machine learning are critical to successfully scaling in the Conversational Space, and that in order to develop the industry\u2019s leading technology, we need to attract the industry's best talent. In 2018, LivePerson recruited Alex Spinelli, key architect of the Alexa Operating System at Amazon.com, as our Global CTO. Under Mr. Spinelli\u2019s leadership, LivePerson hired more than 280 of the industry\u2019s brightest data scientists, machine learning engineers and automation engineers, many from firms such as Nike, Amazon.com, Microsoft and Target, who are working exclusively on applying AI to the Conversational Space. LivePerson also expanded its development talent base in Germany, and added key development talent through the acquisitions of BotCentral in Mountain View, California and Conversable in Austin, Texas.\nBring to market best-in-class AI and machine learning technologies designed for the conversational space. We believe that in the last decade many vendors introduced AI and bot offerings that created frustrating experiences for consumers and businesses alike, which in turn has eroded trust in automation. Many of these solutions have proven difficult to build and scale, and have been limited by stand-alone implementations that lacked the measurement, reporting and human oversight of conversational platforms such as the Conversational Cloud. In December 2018, LivePerson announced its patent pending AI engine that is designed to overcome these shortcomings and help brands rapidly bring to market conversational AI that can scale to millions of interactions, while increasing customer satisfaction and conversion rates.\nUnlike alternative solutions designed solely for IT departments, LivePerson\u2019s Conversational AI was built to be used by developers and contact center agents. By putting the power of conversational design and bot management in the hands of contact center agents, LivePerson\u2019s Conversational AI gives brands the ability to leverage the employees closest to the customer, those who are most versed in the voice of the brand, and with the most expertise in how to craft successful outcomes for customer service and sales journeys.\nSome of the key innovations behind LivePerson\u2019s Conversational AI include:\n\u2022a holistic approach to scaling AI by combining consumer facing bots, agent facing bots, intelligent routing and real-time intent understanding, with an analytics dashboard that helps users focus on the intents that are impacting their business and prioritize which intents to automate next;\n\u2022bot building software that is based on dialogue instead of workflow or code, so non-technical employees like contact center agents can design automations;\n\u2022leveraging data moat from hundreds of millions of conversations to feed the machine learning that rapidly and accurately detects consumer sentiment and intents in real-time. Customers of LivePerson can use intent understanding for advanced routing, next-best actions, and to fully contain conversations with automation;\n\u2022the establishing of contact center agents as bot managers, ensuring that every conversation is safeguarded by a human and that agents are continuously training the AI to be smarter and drive more successful outcomes;\n\u2022powerful Assist technology that multiplies the efficiency of agents by analyzing intents in real time and then suggesting next best actions, predefined content, and bots that can take over transactional work;\n\u2022pre-built templates for target verticals that provide out of the box support for the top intents and back-end integrations;\n\u2022the ability to bootstrap conversations with existing transcripts, reducing design effort and speeding time to market;\n\u2022third-party AI natural language understanding (NLU) integration, so customers aren\u2019t boxed into one vendor;\n\u2022AI analytics and reporting tailored to the Conversational Space, providing brands with immediate, actionable insights about their businesses and contact center operations.\nOur strategy is to continue to enhance the Conversational AI engine and related products, by leveraging our global R&D footprint and substantial library of mobile and online conversational data, with the aim of increasing agent efficiency, decreasing customer care costs, improving the customer experience and increasing customer lifetime value.\nSustain our leadership position by aligning brands to a vision that transforms how they communicate with consumers and delivers a superior return on investment. We believe that most contact center technology vendors incorrectly view messaging as a feature. They are content with building integrations to a messaging endpoint and offering messaging as just another product in their suite. LivePerson holds the perspective that messaging and AI are the foundation for transforming conversational experiences, disrupting how agents operate and how brands engage with consumers. Brands must adapt their contact centers to an asynchronous messaging environment and leverage a combination of human agents, bots and AI to achieve scale and efficiencies. When done correctly, the entire consumer lifecycle with a brand will be maintained within the Conversational Space, and traffic will steadily shift away from lower returning voice calls, websites, emails and apps to higher returning messaging endpoints.\nWe believe that LivePerson is uniquely positioned to deliver this transformation due to our technology and expertise:\n\u2022The Conversational Cloud, LivePerson's enterprise-class, automation-first, cloud-based platform, was designed for AI-assisted and human-powered messaging in mobile and online channels. The platform offers best-in-class security and scalability, offers the broadest ecosystem of messaging endpoints, is designed for ease of use, and features an AI engine custom built for the Conversational Space, intent recognition, robust real-time reporting, role-based real-time analytics, predictive intelligence, and innovations in customer satisfaction and connection measurement. Additionally, the Conversational Cloud is an open platform with pre-built, enterprise-grade integrations into back-end systems as well as the ability to work across NLU providers.\n\u2022The Company has a data moat built on hundreds of millions of conversations across industries, geographies and use cases that is feeding the machine learning engines that power intent understanding.\n\u2022The platform has expanded to power conversations across a broad spectrum of channels and use cases, from traditional sales and customer service, to marketing, social, email, advertising and brick and mortar.\n\u2022LivePerson has deep domain expertise across verticals and messaging endpoints, a global footprint, referenceable enterprise brands and a team of technical, solutions and consulting professionals to assist customers along their transformational journeys. We are positioned as an authority in the Conversational Space. We have developed a Transformation Model that is introduced to existing and prospective customers to help guide them on their journeys from legacy and often times inefficient legacy voice, email and chat solutions to modern conversational ones powered by messaging and AI.\nWe believe that LivePerson\u2019s differentiated approach to the Conversational Space, combined with our unique technology and expertise has established us as a market leader, with an ability to deliver superior returns on investment. LivePerson customers manage as many as 40 messaging conversations at a time, as compared to one at a time for a voice agent and two to four at a time for a good chat agent. Adding AI and bots provides even greater scale to the number of conversations managed. Our customers often see labor efficiency gains of at least two times that of voice agents, effectively cutting labor\ncosts by at least 50%. Furthermore, our ability to deliver more convenient, personalized and content-rich conversations often drives increases in customer satisfaction of up to 20 percentage points and increases in sales conversions of up to 20%, while\nenhancing average order value, customer retention and loyalty.\nStrengthen our position in both existing and new industries. We plan to continue to develop our market position by increasing our customer base, and expanding within our installed base. We will continue to focus primarily on key target markets: consumer/retail, telecommunications, financial services, travel/hospitality, technology and automotive within both our enterprise and mid-market sectors, as well as the small business (SMB) sector. In 2019, we made strong inroads into new verticals with key wins in the airline, food service and healthcare industries. In 2020, we strengthened our presence in key markets including travel/hospitality and retail, and opened new verticals like healthcare and government. We are experimenting\nwith new conversational businesses, including some that are in regulated industries, like online banking. We are increasingly structuring our field organization to emphasize our domain expertise and strengthen customer relationships across target industries.\nContinue to build our international presence. We are focused on building our international presence and expanding our international revenue contribution, which accounted for 38% and 41% of total revenue in 2020 and 2019, respectively. We are generating positive results from our recent investments in the Asia Pacific, Europe and Latin America regions.\nLeverage our open architecture to support partners and developers. In addition to developing our own applications, we continue to cultivate a partner eco-system capable of offering additional applications and services to our customers. We integrate into third-party messaging endpoints including SMS, Facebook Messenger, Apple Business Chat, Google Rich Business Messenger, Line, WhatsApp, Alexa, Google Home, WeChat, Google Ad Lingo, Google Search, Google Maps, Instagram and Twitter, multiple IVR vendors and dozens of branded apps. The Conversational Cloud integrates our proprietary messaging and Conversational AI with third-party bot offerings, empowering our customers to manage a mix of different bots, human agents and technologies from one control panel, thereby optimizing contact center efficiency. LivePerson\u2019s proprietary and third-party AI/bots enable brands to partially or fully automate communications with their customers.\nIn addition, we have opened up access to our platform and our products with more than 40 APIs and software development kits that allow customers and third parties to develop on top of our platform. Customers and partners can utilize these APIs to build our capabilities into their own applications and to enhance our applications with their services. In 2019, we launched LivePerson Functions, a serverless Function as a Service (FaaS) integration which enables brands to develop custom behaviors within LivePerson's conversational platform to easily and rapidly tailor conversation flows to their specific needs.\nExpand sales partnerships to broaden our presence and accelerate sales cycles. We are focused on broadening our market reach and accelerating sales cycles by partnering with systems integrators, technology providers, business process outsourcers, value added resellers and other sales partners. We formalized a relationship with IBM Global Business Services in 2017 and Accenture in 2018. In 2019, we announced strategic partnerships with TTEC, a leading BPO focused on customer experience, and DMI, a digital transformation company, to redefine the customer experience with digital engagement, messaging, and AI-driven automation. In 2020, Infosys joined LivePerson\u2019s network with a first-of-its-kind 360-degree partnership focusing not only on capturing the global rising demand for conversational commerce and building a personalized experience for customers, but also driving the transformation for internal corporate messaging and the employee experience through Conversational AI. LivePerson increased the number of partners focused on SMBs to more than 300 at year-end 2020 and 2019, from over 150 at year-end 2018, and approximately 40 at the end of 2017. Approximately one quarter of all opportunities were influenced by partners in 2020, and we are focused on driving that contribution toward 50% longer term.\nMaintain market leadership in technology and security expertise. As described above, we are devoting significant resources to creating new products and enabling technologies designed to accelerate innovation. We evaluate emerging technologies and industry standards and continually update our technology in order to retain our leadership position in each market we serve. We monitor legal and technological developments in the area of information security and confidentiality to ensure our policies and procedures meet or exceed the demands of the world\u2019s largest and most demanding corporations. We believe that these efforts will allow us to effectively anticipate changing customer and consumer requirements in our rapidly evolving industry.\nEvaluate strategic alliances and acquisitions when appropriate. We have successfully integrated several acquisitions over the past decade. While we have in the past, and may from time to time in the future, engage in discussions regarding acquisitions or strategic transactions or to acquire other companies that can accelerate our growth or broaden our product offerings, we currently have no binding commitments with respect to any future acquisitions or strategic transactions.\n.\nKey Metrics\nFinancial overview of the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2020 compared to the comparable periods in 2019 is as follows:\n\u2022Revenue increased 29% and 26% to $102.1 million and $366.6 million in the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2020, respectively, from $79.1 million and $291.6 million in the comparable periods in 2019.\n\u2022Revenue from our Business segment increased 29% and 26% to $94.1 million and $336.9 million in the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2020, respectively, from $72.8 million and $267.1 million in the comparable periods in 2019.\n\u2022Gross profit margin increased to 73% in the three months ended December 31, 2020 from 72% in the comparable period in 2019. Gross profit margin decreased to 71% in the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 from 73% in the comparable period in 2019.\n\u2022Cost and expenses increased 5% and 20% to $108.8 million and $456.1 million in the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2020, respectively, from $103.6 million and $378.6 million in the comparable periods in 2019.\n\u2022Net loss increased to $13.3 million and to $107.6 million in the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2020, respectively, from net loss of $27.3 million and $96.1 million for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019, respectively.\n\u2022Trailing-twelve-month average revenue per enterprise and mid-market customer was approximately $465,000 in 2020, as compared to approximately $345,000 in 2019.\n\u2022Revenue retention rate for enterprise and mid-market customers on Conversational Cloud exceeded the high end of our target range of 105% to 115% in 2020, and was within our target range of 105% to 115% for 2019.\nRevenue\nThe majority of our revenue is generated from monthly service revenues and related professional services from the sale of the LivePerson services. We charge a monthly fee, which varies by service and customer usage. The majority of our larger customers also pay a professional services fee related to implementation and ongoing optimization services. A large proportion of our revenue from new customers comes from large corporations. These companies typically have more significant implementation requirements and more stringent data security standards. Such customers also have more sophisticated data analysis and performance reporting requirements, and are likely to engage our professional services organization to provide such analysis and reporting on a recurring basis.\nWe determine revenue recognition through the following steps:\n\u2022identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer;\n\u2022identification of the performance obligations in the contract;\n\u2022determination of the transaction price;\n\u2022allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and\n\u2022recognition of revenue when, or as, the Company satisfies a performance obligation.\nFor more information about our revenue recognition policies, please see \u201c-- Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n-- Revenue Recognition.\u201d\nHosted Services- Business Revenue\nRevenue attributable to our monthly hosted Business services accounted for 78% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020, 77% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 and 79% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nProfessional Services Revenue\nRevenue attributable to professional services accounted for 14% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020, 14% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 and 13% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nContracts with Multiple Performance Obligations\nSome of our contracts with customers contain multiple performance obligations. For these contracts, we account for individual performance obligations separately if they are distinct. The transaction price is allocated to the separate performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price basis. We determine the standalone selling prices based on our overall pricing objectives, taking into consideration market conditions and other factors, including the value of our contracts, the cloud applications sold, and the number and types of users within our contracts.\nHosted Services- Consumer Revenue\nRevenue from our Consumer segment accounted for approximately 8% of total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nDeferred Revenues\nWe record deferred revenues when cash payments are received or due in advance of our performance. The decrease of $0.1 million in the deferred revenue balance for the year ended December 31, 2020 is primarily driven by satisfying our performance obligations and the revenue recognized of approximately $103.2 million that were included in the deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2019.\nCosts and Expenses\nOur cost of revenue consists of:\n\u2022compensation costs relating to employees who provide customer support and implementation services to our customers;\n\u2022outside labor provider costs;\n\u2022compensation costs relating to our network support staff;\n\u2022depreciation of certain hardware and software;\n\u2022allocated occupancy costs and related overhead;\n\u2022the cost of supporting our infrastructure, including expenses related to server leases, infrastructure support costs and Internet connectivity;\n\u2022the credit card fees and related payment processing costs associated with the consumer and SMB services; and\n\u2022amortization of certain intangibles.\nOur sales and marketing expenses consist of compensation and related expenses for sales personnel and marketing personnel, online marketing, allocated occupancy costs and related overhead, advertising, sales commissions, public relations, promotional materials, travel expenses, global customer summits and trade show exhibit expenses.\nOur general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and related expenses for executive, accounting, legal, information technology and human resources personnel, allocated occupancy costs and related overhead, litigation, professional fees, provision for doubtful accounts and other general corporate expenses.\nOur product development expenses consist primarily of compensation and related expenses for product development personnel, allocated occupancy costs and related overhead, outsourced labor and expenses for testing new versions of our software. Product development expenses are charged to operations as incurred.\nDuring 2020, we increased our allowance for doubtful accounts from approximately $3.1 million to approximately $5.3 million. During 2019, we increased our allowance for doubtful accounts from approximately $2.3 million to approximately $3.1 million. We perform a detailed assessment of the collectability of our accounts receivable. In estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts, management considers, among other factors, the aging of the accounts receivable, historical write-offs and the creditworthiness of each customer. A large proportion of receivables are due from larger corporate customers that typically have longer payment cycles.\nNon-Cash Compensation Expense\nThe net non-cash compensation amounts for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 consist of (amounts in thousands):\n2020 2019 2018\nStock-based compensation expense $ 65,946 $ 44,105 $ 14,841\nResults of Operations\nWe are organized into two operating segments for purposes of making operating decisions and assessing performance. The Business segment enables brands to leverage the Conversational Cloud sophisticated intelligence engine to connect with consumers through an integrated suite of mobile and online business messaging technologies. The Consumer segment facilitates online transactions between Experts and Users seeking information and knowledge for a fee via mobile and online messaging.\nThe following tables set forth our results of operations for the periods presented and as a percentage of our revenues for those periods.

This increase in Business revenue is driven mainly by increases in hosted services of approximately $60.9 million and an increase in professional services of approximately $8.8 million. Included in hosted services, is an increase in revenue that is variable based on interactions and usage of approximately $30.1 million.\nBusiness revenue increased by 16% to $267.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, from $230.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase in Business revenue is primarily attributable to an increase in hosted services of approximately $28.2 million and an increase in professional services of approximately $8.6 million.\nThe increase in Business revenue was driven in nearly equal parts by existing and new customers as LivePerson generated greater demand for its Conversational Commerce software and Gainshare (formerly \u201cPay for Performance\u201d) solutions. In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, leading brands are turning to LivePerson's AI-powered messaging to overcome a capacity gap created by voice call agent work-from-home measures and increased demand for digital engagement as consumers practice social distancing. LivePerson is powering Conversational AI, automation and messaging strategies across a growing number of use cases from care and sales, to marketing, social, conversational advertising, and brick and mortar. As adoption increases, we are seeing higher revenue per customer. Our average annual revenue per enterprise and midmarket customer was approximately $465,000 in 2020, as compared to approximately $345,000 in 2019. Similarly, we are seeing strong revenue retention rates. Revenue retention rate for enterprise and mid-market customers on Conversational Cloud exceeded the high end of our target range of 105% to 115% in 2020, and was within our target range of 105% to 115% for 2019.\nConsumer revenue increased by 22% to $29.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, from $24.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.

These decreases were offset in part by an increase in backup server facilities of approximately $0.7 million and in depreciation expense of approximately $0.6 million.\nIn 2020, the Company delayed its planned marketing events due to the COVID-19 pandemic and has also seen an impact in terms of the on-boarding and hiring of employees. The Company has been able to adjust its marketing and hiring efforts in this new environment going forward. Additionally, we have adapted our marketing strategy to include targeted digital experiences that emphasize the unique positioning of our messaging and AI offerings to help brands succeed in this new environment. Our marketing message has shifted to include business continuity and virtualization of the contact center in addition to business improvement.\nSales and marketing expenses increased by 49% to $140.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, from $94.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This is primarily related to an increase in salary, recruitment, and related employee expenses of approximately $29.5 million, as the Company doubled the number of quota carrying salespeople to approximately 100 at year-end 2019 from 50 at year-end 2018.

This increase is attributable to an increase in restructuring costs related to lease abandonment of approximately $24.1 million, along with severance and other compensation costs of approximately $5.3 million.\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company went through a re-evaluation of our real estate needs. In connection with this re-evaluation, and the success we have had working remotely, it was decided in July 2020 that we would significantly reduce the real estate space we lease. This decision resulted in the significant reduction of the real estate space we lease and the removal of the associated right of use assets (\"ROU assets\"). Furthermore, this resulted in various one-time expenses in connection with the abandonment of the majority of our leased facilities. The lease restructuring costs noted above are a result of this transition to an employee-centric workforce model that does not rely on traditional offices.\nRestructuring costs decreased by 54% to $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, from $4.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This decrease is attributable to a decrease in severance and other associated costs of approximately $2.5 million. Severance costs are associated with re-prioritizing and reallocating resources to focus on areas showing high growth potential.\nAmortization of Purchased Intangibles\nYear Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31,\n2020 2019 % Change 2019 2018 % Change\n($ in thousands) ($ in thousands)\nAmortization of purchased intangibles $ 1,639 $ 1,794 (9) % $ 1,794 $ 1,670 7 %\nPercentage of total revenue - % 1 % 1 % 1 %\nAmortization expense for purchased intangibles decreased by 9% to $1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, from $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, and increased by 7% to $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, from $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The year over year variance is primarily attributable to amortization of patents and customer relationships.\nOther (Expense) Income, net\nOther income, net primarily consists of interest income on cash and cash equivalents, investment income and financial (expense) income which is a result of currency rate fluctuations associated with exchange rate movement of the U.S. dollar against the New Israeli Shekel, Pound Sterling, Japanese Yen, Australian dollar and the Euro.\nYear Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31,\n2020 2019 % Change 2019 2018 % Change\n($ in thousands) ($ in thousands)\nInterest (expense) income (14,334) (7,407) 94 % (7,407) 22 (33,768) %\nOther income (expense) $ (1,343) $ 1,213 (211) % $ 1,213 $ (493) (346) %\nOther (expense) income, net $ (15,677) $ (6,194) 153 % $ (6,194) $ (471) 1,215 %\nOther (expense) income increased by $9.5 million to an expense of $15.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, from an expense of $6.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in interest expense attributable to the 0.750% Convertible Senior Notes due 2024 (the \u2018\u20182024 Notes\u2019\u2019), offset in part by interest income on cash and cash equivalents and financial income which is attributable to currency rate fluctuations.\nOther (expense) income increased by $5.7 million to an expense of $6.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, from an income of $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.

Our consolidated effective tax rate was impacted by the statutory income tax rates applicable to each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. During 2020, we recognized a benefit of $0.6 million due to net operating loss and research and development credits carryback resulting from the CARES Act. The decrease in tax expense is primarily due to these factors.\nIncome tax expense increased by 232% to $2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, from $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Our consolidated effective tax rate was impacted by the statutory income tax rates applicable to each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. During 2018, we recognized a benefit of $2.0 million related to a settlement with the Israeli Tax Authority. As a result of the settlement, we recognized a benefit as the recorded liability was less than the final settlement. A benefit was also recorded for U.S. federal tax refunds that were recognized due to increased foreign tax credits and increased federal NOLs from foreign tax deductions. The increase in tax expense was primarily due to these factors.\nNet Loss\nWe had a net loss of $107.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to a net loss of $96.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.

The increase is primarily attributable to cash provided by financing activities relating to issuance of the 2026 Notes, as described in Note 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, and the issuance of common stock. This was partially offset by purchases of capped calls, as described in Note 7 of the Notes to\nthe Consolidated Financial Statements, fixed assets for our co-location facilities, capitalization of internally developed software, debt issuance costs, and increases in prepaid expenses and accounts receivable.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $33.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. Our net loss was $107.6 million, which includes the effect of non-cash expenses related to stock-based compensation, amortization of purchased intangibles and finance leases, depreciation, and provision for doubtful accounts, as well as increases in operating lease liability due to the transition to an employee centric model under which employees will work remotely, and increase in accrued expenses and decrease in accounts receivable. This was partially offset by increases in prepaid expenses and other current assets and decrease in deferred revenue. Net cash used in operating activities was $59.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2019. Our net loss was $96.1 million, which includes the effect of non-cash expenses related to stock-based compensation, amortization of purchased intangibles, depreciation, and provision for doubtful accounts, as well as increases in deferred revenue due to more of our customers moving to cash payments in advance on annual billings and in accounts payable and accrued expenses. This was partially offset by increases in prepaid expenses, other current assets and accounts receivable, and decrease in deferred tax liability.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $43.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 due primarily to the purchase of fixed assets for our co-location facilities and capitalization of internally developed software. Net cash used in investing activities was $48.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2019 and consisted primarily of the purchase of fixed assets for our co-location facilities and capitalization of internally developed software.\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $483.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 due primarily to the proceeds from issuance of the 2026 Notes and proceeds from issuance of common stock in connection with the exercise of stock options by employees. This was partially offset by purchases of capped calls, debt issuance costs, and payment of our finance lease. The net proceeds of the 2026 Notes was approximately $506.6 million, after deducting initial purchaser debt issuance costs paid or payable by us, from issuance of the 2026 Notes, as described in Note 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Net cash provided by financing activities was $217.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2019 and consisted primarily of proceeds from issuance of the 2024 Notes and proceeds from issuance of common stock in connection with the exercise of stock options by employees. This was partially offset by purchases of capped calls, debt issuance costs, and repurchase of our common stock. The net proceeds of the 2024 Notes was approximately $221.4 million, after deducting initial purchaser debt issuance costs paid or payable by us, from issuance of the 2024 Notes, as described in Note 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nWe anticipate that our current cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to satisfy our working capital and capital requirements for at least the next 12 months. However, we cannot assure you that we will not require additional funds prior to such time, and we would then seek to sell additional equity or debt securities through public financings, or seek alternative sources of financing. We cannot assure you that additional funding will be available on favorable terms, when needed, if at all. If we are unable to obtain any necessary additional financing, we may be required to further reduce the scope of our planned sales and marketing and product development efforts, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. In addition, we may require additional funds in order to fund more rapid expansion, to develop new or enhanced services or products, or to invest in or acquire complementary businesses, technologies, services or products.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any special purposes entities, and other than operating leases, which are described below we do not engage in off-balance sheet financing arrangements.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nWe lease facilities and certain equipment under agreements accounted for as operating and finance leases. These leases generally require us to pay all executory costs such as maintenance and insurance. Total lease cost for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, was approximately $13.5 million, $13.0 million and $10.9 million, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2020, our principal commitments were approximately $24.4 million under various operating and finance leases, of which approximately $10.2 million is due in 2021. We currently expect that our principal commitments for the year ending December 31, 2021 will not exceed approximately $10.2 million in the aggregate.\nOur contractual obligations at December 31, 2020 are summarized as follows (amounts in thousands):\nPayments Due by Period\nContractual Obligations Total Less Than\n1 Year 1 - 3 Years 3 - 5 Years More Than\n5 Years\nOperating leases $ 14,197 $ 6,377 $ 5,759 $ 1,798 $ 263\nFinance leases $ 10,200 $ 3,814 $ 6,386 $ - $ -\nConvertible senior notes(1)\n$ - $ - $ - $ 230,000 $ 517,500\nTotal $ 24,397 $ 10,191 $ 12,145 $ 231,798 $ 517,763\n(1) See Note 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K for a discussion of our convertible senior notes.\nCapital Expenditures\nTotal capital expenditures in 2020 were approximately $41.6 million, primarily related to software capitalization and to the continued expansion of our co-location facilities. Our total capital expenditures are not currently expected to exceed $47.3 million in 2021. We anticipate that our current cash and cash equivalents and cash from operations will be sufficient to fund these capital expenditures.\nIndemnifications\nWe enter into service and license agreements in the ordinary course of business. Pursuant to some of these agreements, we agree to indemnify certain customers from and against certain types of claims and losses suffered or incurred by them as a result of using our products.\nWe also have agreements whereby our executive officers and directors are indemnified for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is, or was serving, at our request in such capacity. The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited; however, we have a directors and officers insurance policy that reduces our exposure and enables us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid. As a result of our insurance policy coverage, we believe the estimated fair value of these indemnification agreements is minimal. Currently, we have no liabilities recorded for these agreements as of December 31, 2020.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. As such, we are required to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions that management believes are reasonable based upon the information available. We base these estimates on our historical experience, future expectations and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for our judgments that may not be readily apparent from other sources. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods.\nWe believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with revenue recognition, stock-based compensation, accounts receivable, the valuation of goodwill and intangible assets, income taxes and legal contingencies have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements. We evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis. Actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions, and any differences could be material. For further information on all of our significant accounting policies, see Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe majority of our revenue is generated from monthly service revenues and related professional services from the sale of our services. Revenues are recognized when control of these services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those services.\nWe determine revenue recognition through the following steps:\n\u2022Identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer;\n\u2022Identification of the performance obligations in the contract;\n\u2022Determination of the transaction price;\n\u2022Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and\n\u2022Recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation.\nTotal revenue of $366.6 million, $291.6 million, and $249.8 million was recognized during the years ended December 31, 2020, December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively.\nHosted Services- Business Revenue\nHosted Services Business revenue is reported at the amount that reflects the ultimate consideration expected to be received and primarily consist of fees that provide customers access to the Conversational Cloud, our enterprise-class, cloud-based platform. We have determined such access represents a stand-ready service provided continually throughout the contract term. As such, control and satisfaction of this stand-ready performance obligation is deemed to occur over time. We recognize this revenue over time on a ratable basis over the contract term, beginning on the date that access to the Conversational Cloud platform is made available to the customer. The passage of time is deemed to be the most faithful depiction of the transfer of control of the services as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefit provided by our performance. Subscription contracts are generally one year or longer in length, billed, monthly, quarterly or annually in advance. There is no significant variable consideration related to these arrangements. Additionally, for certain of our larger customers, we may provide call center labor through an arrangement with one or more of several qualified vendors. For most of these customers, we pass the fee we incur with the labor provider and its fee for the hosted services through to our customers in the form of a fixed fee for each order placed via our online engagement solutions. For these Gainshare (formerly \u201cPay for Performance\u201d) arrangements in accordance with ASC-606, \u2018\u2018Principal Agent Considerations,\u2019\u2019 we act as a principal in a transaction if we control the specified goods or services before they are transferred to the customer.\nProfessional Services Revenues\nProfessional services revenue primarily consists of fees for deployment and optimization services, as well as training delivered on an on-demand basis which is deemed to represent a distinct stand-ready performance obligation. Professional Services Revenues are reported at the amount that reflects the ultimate consideration we expect to receive in exchange for such services. Control for the majority of our Professional Services contracts passes over time to the customer and is recognized ratably over the contracted period, as the passage of time is deemed to be the most faithful depiction of the transfer of control. For certain deployment services, which are not deemed to represent a distinct performance obligation, revenue will be recognized in the same manner as the fee for access to the Conversational Cloud platform, and as such will be recognized on a straight-line basis over the contract term. For services billed on a fixed price basis, revenue is recognized over time based on the proportion performed using time and materials as the measure of progress toward complete satisfaction of the performance obligation. Professional service contracts are generally one year or longer in length, billed, monthly, quarterly or annually in advance. There is no significant variable consideration related to these arrangements.\nContracts with Multiple Performance Obligations\nSome of our contracts with customers contain multiple performance obligations. For these contracts, we account for individual performance obligations separately if they are distinct. The transaction price is allocated to the separate performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price basis. We determine the standalone selling prices based on our overall pricing objectives, taking into consideration market conditions and other factors, including the value of our contracts, the cloud applications sold, and the number and types of users within our contracts.\nHosted Services- Consumer Revenue\nFor revenue from our Consumer segment generated from online transactions between Experts and Users, revenue is recognized at an amount net of Expert fees in accordance with ASC 606, \u201cPrincipal Agent Considerations,\u201d due primarily to the fact that we do not act as a principal in a transaction since we do not control the specified goods or services before they are transferred to the customer. Additionally, we perform as an agent without any risk of loss for collection, and we are not involved in selecting the Expert or establishing the Expert\u2019s fee. We collect a fee from the consumer and retain a portion of the fee, and then remit the balance to the Expert. Revenue from these transactions is recognized at the point in time when the transaction is complete and no significant performance obligations remain.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe follow ASC 718-10, \u201cStock Compensation,\u201d which addresses the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services, with a primary focus on transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share-based payment transactions. ASC 718-10 requires measurement of the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award (with limited exceptions). Incremental compensation costs arising from subsequent modifications of awards after the grant date must be recognized.\nAs of December 31, 2020, there was approximately $17.9 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested stock options. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 2.5 years. As of December 31, 2020, there was approximately $66.8 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested restricted stock units. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 2.8 years.\nAccounts Receivable\nWe perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers\u2019 financial condition (except for customers who purchase the LivePerson services by credit card via Internet download) and have established an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon factors surrounding the credit risk of customers, historical trends and other information that we believe to be reasonable, although they may change in the future. If there is a deterioration of a customer\u2019s credit worthiness or actual write-offs are higher than our historical experience, our estimates of recoverability for these receivables could be adversely affected. Although our large number of customers limits our concentration of credit risk, if we experience a significant write-off from one of our large customers, it could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements. No single customer accounted for or exceeded 10% of our total revenue in 2020, 2019 and 2018 . No single customer accounted for or exceeded 10% of our total accounts receivable in 2020 and 2018. Two customers exceeded 10% of our total accounts receivable in 2019. During 2020, we increased our allowance for doubtful accounts from approximately $3.1 million to approximately $5.3 million. A large proportion of receivables are due from larger corporate customers that typically have longer payment cycles.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of net identifiable assets acquired in a business combination. Goodwill is not amortized and is tested for impairment at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. The Company has determined that it operates as two reporting units and has selected September 30 as the date to perform its annual impairment test. In the valuation of goodwill, management must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows to be derived from the Company's business. If these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future, the Company may be required to record impairment for these assets.\nThe Company has the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. However, the Company may elect to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to the quantitative impairment tests. The impairment test involves comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. A goodwill impairment will be the amount by which a reporting unit\u2019s carrying value exceeds its fair value. The impairment is limited to the carrying amount of goodwill.\nNo goodwill impairment charges have been recorded for any period presented.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nThe carrying amounts of our long-lived assets, including property and equipment, lease right-of-use assets, capitalized internal-use software, costs to obtain customer contracts, and acquired intangible assets, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable or that the useful lives are shorter than originally estimated. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows the asset is expected to generate over its remaining life. If the asset is considered to be impaired, the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset. If the useful life is shorter than originally estimated, we amortize the remaining carrying value over the new shorter useful life. There was a loss on disposal of approximately $5.1 million in October 2020. The Company recognized accelerated depreciation of fixed assets that were determined to no longer be of future economic benefit to the Company based on the decision to vacate the leased office space.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences are expected to become deductible. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets in the jurisdiction from which they arise, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent operations. We include interest accrued on the underpayment of income taxes in interest expense and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in general and administrative expenses. We recorded a valuation allowance as we considered our cumulative loss in recent years as a significant piece of negative evidence. During the year ended December 31, 2020, there was an increase in the valuation allowance of $6.9 million.\nLegal Contingencies\nWe are subject to legal proceedings and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. Periodically, we evaluate the status of each legal matter and assess our potential financial exposure. If the potential loss from any legal proceeding or litigation is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, we accrue a liability for the estimated loss. Significant judgment is required to determine the probability of a loss and whether the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. The outcome of any proceeding is not determinable in advance. As a result, the assessment of a potential liability and the amount of accruals recorded are based only on the information available at the time. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to the legal proceeding or litigation, and may revise our estimates. Any revisions could have a material effect on our results of operations. See Note 13, Legal Matters, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on our legal proceedings and litigation.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nSee Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a full description of recently issued accounting standards.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a full description of recently adopted accounting pronouncements.",
    "item_7A": "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nCurrency Rate Fluctuations\nAs a result of the scope of our Israeli operations, there is currency rate fluctuation risk associated with the exchange rate movement of the U.S. dollar against the New Israeli Shekel (\u201cNIS\u201d). For the year ended December 31, 2020, the U.S dollar appreciated as compared to the NIS by an average of 4% as compared to December 31, 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2020, expenses generated by our Israeli operations totaled approximately $72.6 million. Based on our exposure to NIS exchange rate fluctuation against a dollar as of December 31, 2018, a 1% increase or decrease in the value of the NIS would increase or decrease our income before income taxes by approximately $0.7 million.\nWe actively monitor the movement of the U.S. dollar against the NIS, Pound Sterling, Euro, Australian dollar and Japanese Yen and have considered the use of financial instruments, including but not limited to derivative financial instruments, which could mitigate such risk. If we determine that our risk of exposure materially exceeds the potential cost of derivative financial instruments, we may in the future enter in to these types of investments. The functional currency of our wholly-owned Israeli subsidiaries, LivePerson Ltd. (formerly HumanClick Ltd.) and Kasamba Ltd., is the U.S. dollar; the functional currency of our operations in the United Kingdom is the Pound Sterling; the functional currency of our operations in the Netherlands, Germany, France and Italy is the Euro; the functional currency of our operations in Australia is the Australian Dollar; and the functional currency of our operations in Japan is the Japanese Yen.\nCollection Risk\nOur accounts receivable are subject, in the normal course of business, to collection risks. We regularly assess these risks and have established policies and business practices to protect against the adverse effects of collection risks. During 2020,\nwe increased our allowance for doubtful accounts from $3.1 million to approximately $5.3 million. During 2019, we increased our allowance for doubtful accounts by approximately $2.3 million to approximately $3.1 million. A large proportion of receivables are due from larger corporate customers that typically have longer payment cycles. We base our allowance for doubtful accounts on specifically identified credit risks of customers, historical trends and other information that we believe to be reasonable. We adjust our allowance for doubtful accounts when accounts previously reserved have been collected.\nInterest Rate Risk\nOur investments consist of cash and cash equivalents. Therefore, changes in the market\u2019s interest rates do not affect in any material respect the value of the investments as recorded by us.\nInflation Rate Risk\nWe do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business, financial conditions or results of operations. If our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases. Our inability or failure to do so could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.",

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (\u201cPCAOB\u201d), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (\u201cCOSO\u201d) and our report dated March 8, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nChange in Accounting Principle\nOn January 1, 2019, the Company changed its method of accounting for leases due to the adoption of Accounting Standards Codification Topic 842, Leases. The effects of the adoption are described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company\u2019s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nRevenue Contracts with Multiple Performance Obligations\nAs described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, certain of the Company\u2019s revenue contracts contain multiple performance obligations primarily relating to the sale of hosted subscription and professional services. For these revenue contracts, the Company accounts for the individual performance obligations separately if they are distinct. The transaction price is allocated to the performance obligations based on their relative standalone selling prices. The Company determines the standalone selling prices based on its overall pricing objectives, taking into consideration market conditions and\nother factors, including the value of its contracts, the cloud applications sold, and the number and types of users within its contracts.\nWe identified revenue recognition related to contracts that contain multiple performance obligations as a critical audit matter. The determination of whether multiple services within a contract are distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately and the estimates of the standalone selling price for each distinct performance obligation require management to exercise significant judgment that includes a high degree of subjectivity. Auditing these elements involved especially challenging auditor judgment due to the nature and extent of audit effort required to address these matters.\nThe primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included:\n\u2022Testing the design and operating effectiveness of certain controls relating to management\u2019s determination of standalone selling prices for each of the performance obligations.\n\u2022Evaluating management\u2019s technical accounting positions and assessing the reasonableness of management\u2019s judgments and assumptions in the determination of whether the products and services are distinct performance obligations and the determination of the standalone selling prices for each of the performance obligations.\n\u2022Testing the reasonableness of the identification of distinct performance obligations and determination of the standalone selling prices through review of a sample of revenue contracts.\nConvertible Senior Notes\nAs described in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company issued $517.5 million aggregate principal amount of 0% Convertible Senior Notes (the \u201c2026 Notes\u201d) in a private placement in 2020. In accounting for the issuance of the 2026 Notes, the Company separated the 2026 Notes into liability and equity components. The carrying amount of the liability component was calculated by measuring the fair value of a similar debt instrument that does not have an associated convertible feature. The carrying amount of the equity component representing the conversion option was determined by deducting the fair value of the liability component from the par value of the 2026 Notes.\nWe identified the accounting evaluation, including the related fair value determinations, of the 2026 Notes as a critical audit matter. The principal considerations for our determination were: (i) the evaluation of the potential derivatives that needed to be bifurcated, and (ii) considerations related to determination of the fair value of the 2026 Notes and the conversion option including complex valuation models and assumptions utilized by management. Auditing these elements involved especially challenging auditor judgment due to the nature and extent of audit effort required to address these matters, including the extent of specialized skill or knowledge needed.\nThe primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included:\n\u2022Utilizing personnel with specialized knowledge and skill in technical accounting to assist in: (i) evaluating the relevant terms and conditions of the 2026 Notes' agreements, and (ii) assessing the appropriateness of conclusions reached by the Company with respect to the accounting for the 2026 Notes and identification, assessment and accounting for potential derivatives.\n\u2022Utilizing personnel with specialized knowledge and skill in valuation to assist in assessing the appropriateness of the valuation models utilized by management to determine the fair value of the 2026 Notes and assessing the reasonableness of assumptions incorporated into the valuation models.\n/s/ BDO USA, LLP\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2005.\nNew York, New York\nMarch 8, 2021\nLIVEPERSON, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(IN THOUSANDS)\nDecember 31,\n2020 2019\nASSETS\nCURRENT ASSETS:\nCash and cash equivalents\n$ 654,152 $ 176,523\nAccounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts of $5,344 and $3,070, in 2020 and 2019, respectively\n80,423 87,620\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets\n14,236 13,964\nTotal current assets\n748,811 278,107\nOperating lease right of use asset 614 15,680\nProperty and equipment, net 106,055 76,236\nContract acquisition costs 41,021 31,965\nIntangibles, net 10,927 11,812\nGoodwill 95,192 94,987\nDeferred tax assets 2,032 2,179\nOther assets 1,780 1,744\nTotal assets $ 1,006,432 $ 512,710\nLIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY\nCURRENT LIABILITIES:\nAccounts payable\n$ 14,115 $ 12,302\nAccrued expenses and other current liabilities\n99,870 62,778\nDeferred revenue\n88,848 88,751\nOperating lease liability\n5,718 6,602\nTotal current liabilities\n208,551 170,433\nDeferred revenue, net of current portion\n409 438\nConvertible senior notes, net 538,432 179,012\nOther liabilities\n6,304 72\nOperating lease liability, net of current portion 7,180 12,865\nDeferred tax liability\n1,622 1,355\nTotal liabilities\n762,498 364,175\nCommitments and contingencies (See Note 9)\nSTOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY:\nPreferred stock, $0.001 par value -

Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nLivePerson was incorporated in the State of Delaware in November 1995 and the LivePerson service was introduced in November 1998. In April 2000, the company completed an initial public offering and is currently traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market and the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange. LivePerson is headquartered in New York City. In light of the COVID-19 pandemic and the company\u2019s strong performance working remotely, LivePerson has adopted an \u201cemployee-centric\u201d workforce model that does not rely on traditional offices.\nLivePerson, Inc. (\u201cLivePerson\u201d, the \u201cCompany\u201d, \u201cwe\u201d or \u201cour\u201d) makes life easier for people and brands everywhere through trusted Conversational AI. Conversational AI allows humans and machines to interact using natural language, including speech or text. During the past decade, consumers have made mobile devices the center of their digital lives, and they have made mobile messaging the center of communication with friends, family and peers. This trend has been significantly accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic and can now be viewed as a permanent, structural shift in consumer behavior. Our technology enables consumers to connect with businesses through these same preferred conversational interfaces, including Facebook Messenger, SMS, WhatsApp, Apple Business Chat, Google Rich Business Messenger and Alexa. These messaging conversations harness human agents, bots and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to power convenient, personalized and content-rich journeys across the entire consumer lifecycle, from discovery and research, to sales, service and support, and increasingly marketing, social, and brick and mortar engagements. For example, consumers can look up product info like ratings, images and pricing, search for stores, see product inventory, schedule appointments, apply for credit, approve repairs, and make purchases or payments - all without ever leaving the messaging channel. These AI and human-assisted conversational experiences constitute the Conversational Space, within which LivePerson has strategically developed one of the industry's largest ecosystems of messaging endpoints and use cases.\nThe Conversational Cloud, our enterprise-class cloud-based platform, enables businesses to become conversational by securely deploying AI-powered messaging at scale for brands with tens of millions of customers and many thousands of agents. The Conversational Cloud powers conversations across each of a brand\u2019s primary digital channels, including mobile apps, mobile and desktop web browsers, short message service (SMS), social media and third-party consumer messaging platforms. Brands can also use the Conversational Cloud to message consumers when they dial a 1-800 number instead of forcing them to navigate interactive voice response systems (IVRs) and wait on hold. Similarly, the Conversational Cloud can ingest traditional emails and convert them into messaging conversations, or embed messaging conversations directly into web advertisements, rather than redirect consumers to static website landing pages. Agents can manage all conversations with consumers through a single console interface, regardless of where the conversations originated.\nLivePerson's robust, cloud-based suite of rich messaging, real-time chat, AI and automation offerings features consumer and agent facing bots, intelligent routing and capacity mapping, real-time intent detection and analysis, queue prioritization, customer sentiment, analytics and reporting, content delivery, Payment Card Industry (PCI) compliance, cobrowsing and a sophisticated proactive targeting engine. An extensible application programming interface (API) stack facilitates a lower cost of ownership by facilitating robust integration into back-end systems, as well as enabling developers to build their own programs and services on top of the platform. More than 40 APIs and software development kits are available on the Conversational Cloud.\nLivePerson\u2019s Conversational AI offerings put the power of bot development, training, management and analysis into the hands of the contact center and its agents, the teams most familiar with how to structure sales and service conversations to drive successful outcomes. The platform enables what we call \u201cthe tango\u201d of humans, AI and bots, whereby human agents act as bot managers, overseeing AI-powered conversations and seamlessly stepping into the flow when a personal touch is needed. Agents become ultra-efficient, leveraging the AI engine to serve up relevant content, define next-best actions and take over repetitive transactional work, so that the agent can focus on relationship building. By seamlessly integrating messaging with our proprietary Conversational AI, as well as third-party bots, the Conversational Cloud offers brands a comprehensive approach to scaling automations across their millions of customer conversations.\nLivePerson's consumer services offering is an online marketplace that connects independent service providers (Experts) who provide information and knowledge for a fee via mobile and online messaging with individual consumers (Users). Users seek assistance and advice in various categories including personal counseling and coaching, computers and programming, education and tutoring, spirituality and religion, and other topics.\nLIVEPERSON, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n1. Description of Business and Summary of Accounting Policies (Continued)\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements reflect the operations of LivePerson and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\u201cGAAP\u201d) requires the Company\u2019s management to make a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the period. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include revenue recognition, stock-based compensation, accounts receivable, the valuation of goodwill and intangible assets, income taxes and legal contingencies. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nConcentration of Credit Risk\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable which approximate fair value at December 31, 2020 because of the short-term nature of these instruments. The Company invests its cash and cash equivalents with financial institutions that it believes are of high quality, and the Company performs periodic evaluations of these instruments and the relative credit standings of the institutions with which it invests. At certain times, the Company\u2019s cash balances with any one financial institution may exceed Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance limits. The Company believes it mitigates its risk by depositing its cash balances with high credit, quality financial institutions.\nThe Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers\u2019 financial condition (except for customers who purchase the LivePerson services by credit card via Internet download) and has established an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon factors surrounding the credit risk of customers, historical trends and other information. Concentration of credit risk is limited due to the Company\u2019s large number of customers. No single customer accounted for or exceeded 10% of revenue in 2020, 2019 and 2018 No single customer accounted for or exceeded 10% of the Company\u2019s total accounts receivable in 2020 and 2018. Two customers exceeded 10% of the Company's total accounts receivable in 2019.\nForeign Currency Translation\nThe Company\u2019s operations are conducted in various countries around the world and the financial statements of its foreign subsidiaries are reported in the applicable foreign currencies (functional currencies). Financial information is translated from the applicable functional currency to the U.S. dollar (the reporting currency) for inclusion in the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements. Income, expenses and cash flows are translated at weighted average exchange rates prevailing during the fiscal period, and assets and liabilities are translated at fiscal period-end exchange rates. Resulting translation adjustments are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders\u2019 equity. Foreign exchange transaction gain or losses are included in Other Income (Expense), net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe Company considers all highly liquid securities with original maturities of three months or less when acquired to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents, which primarily consist of money market funds, are recorded at cost, which approximates fair value.\nAccounts Receivable\nAccounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. The allowance for doubtful accounts is the Company\u2019s best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in the Company\u2019s existing accounts receivable. The Company determines the allowance based on historical write-off experience. The Company reviews its allowance for doubtful accounts monthly. Past due balances over 90 days and over a specified amount are reviewed individually for collectability. All other balances are reviewed on a pooled basis. Account balances are charged off against the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote. The Company does not have any off-balance sheet credit exposure related to its customers. The activity in the allowance for doubtful accounts is as follows (amounts in thousands):\nLIVEPERSON, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n1. Description of Business and Summary of Accounting Policies (Continued)\nYear Ended December 31,\nBeginning Balance Additions\nCharged to\nCosts and\nExpenses Deductions /\nWrite-Offs ASU 2016-13 (Topic 326) Adjustment Ending Balance\n2018 $ 1,318 $ 1,788 $ (830) $ - $ 2,276\n2019 $ 2,276 $ 2,159 $ (1,365) $ - $ 3,070\n2020 $ 3,070 $ 3,211 $ (1,666) $ 729 $ 5,344\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation, and amortization. Depreciation and amortization is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets, generally three to five years for equipment and software. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful life of the asset. Depreciation expense, which includes amortization of internal use software totaled $22.8 million, $16.4 million, and $14.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nInternal-Use Software Development Costs\nIn accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) Accounting Standards Codification (\u201cASC\u201d) 350-40, \u2018\u2018Internal-Use Software\u2019\u2019, the Company capitalizes its costs to develop its internal use software when preliminary development efforts are successfully completed, management has authorized and committed project funding, and it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used as intended. These costs are included in property and equipment in the Company's consolidated balance sheets and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the related asset, which approximates five years. Costs incurred prior to meeting these criteria, together with costs incurred for training and maintenance, are expensed as incurred.\nThe Company capitalized internal-use software costs of $33.9 million, $29.1 million, and $11.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nGoodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of net identifiable assets acquired in a business combination. Goodwill is not amortized and is tested for impairment at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. The Company has determined that it operates as two reporting units and has selected September 30 as the date to perform its annual impairment test. In the valuation of goodwill, management must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows to be derived from the Company's business. If these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future, the Company may be required to record impairment for these assets.\nThe Company has the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. However, the Company may elect to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to the quantitative impairment tests. The impairment test involves comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. A goodwill impairment will be the amount by which a reporting unit\u2019s carrying value exceeds its fair value. The impairment is limited to the carrying amount of goodwill.\nNo goodwill impairment charges have been recorded for any period presented.\nIntangible assets with estimable useful lives are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values, and reviewed for impairment in accordance with ASC 360-10-35, \u201cAccounting for Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.\u201d\nAcquired intangible assets consist of identifiable intangible assets, primarily developed technology and customer relationships, resulting from our acquisitions. Intangible assets are recorded at fair value on the date of acquisition.\nBusiness Combinations\nBusiness combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method and accordingly, the assets acquired (including identified intangible assets), the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquired business are recorded at their acquisition date fair values. The Company\u2019s acquisition model typically provides for an initial payment at closing and for\nLIVEPERSON, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n1. Description of Business and Summary of Accounting Policies (Continued)\nfuture additional contingent purchase price obligations. Contingent purchase price obligations are recorded as deferred acquisition consideration on the balance sheet at the acquisition date fair value and are remeasured at each reporting period. Changes in such estimated values are recorded in the results of operations. For further information, see Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein.\nFor each acquisition, the Company undertakes a detailed review to identify other intangible assets and a valuation is performed for all such identified assets. The Company uses several market participant measurements to determine estimated value. This approach includes consideration of similar and recent transactions, as well as utilizing discounted expected cash flow methodologies. A substantial portion of the intangible asset value that the Company acquires is the specialized know-how of the workforce, which is treated as part of goodwill and is not required to be valued separately. The majority of the value of the identifiable intangible assets acquired is derived from customer relationships, including the related customer contracts, as well as trade names. In executing the Company\u2019s overall acquisition strategy, one of the primary drivers in identifying and executing a specific transaction is the existence of, or the ability to, expand the existing client relationships. The expected benefits of the Company\u2019s acquisitions are typically shared across multiple agencies and regions.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nThe carrying amounts of our long-lived assets, including property and equipment, lease right-of-use assets, capitalized internal-use software, costs to obtain customer contracts, and acquired intangible assets, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable or that the useful lives are shorter than originally estimated. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows the asset is expected to generate over its remaining life. If the asset is considered to be impaired, the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset. If the useful life is shorter than originally estimated, we amortize the remaining carrying value over the new shorter useful life. There was a loss on disposal of approximately $5.1 million in September 2020. The Company recognized accelerated depreciation of fixed assets that were determined to no longer be of future economic benefit to the Company based on the decision to vacate the leased office space. Please refer to Note 14 for additional information regarding this shift to an employee-centric working model.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe majority of the Company\u2019s revenue is generated from monthly service revenues and related professional services from the sale of the LivePerson services. Revenues are recognized when control of these services is transferred to the Company's customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those services.\nThe Company determines revenue recognition through the following steps:\n\u2022Identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer;\n\u2022Identification of the performance obligations in the contract;\n\u2022Determination of the transaction price;\n\u2022Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and\n\u2022Recognition of revenue when, or as, the Company satisfies a performance obligation.\nTotal revenue of $366.6 million, $291.6 million, and $249.8 million was recognized during the years ended December 31, 2020, December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively.\nThe Company has made the following accounting policy election and elected to use a practical expedient specific to certain revenue streams, as permitted by the FASB, in applying Topic 606. The Company utilizes the right-to-invoice practical expedient with regard to the recognition of revenue upon the invoicing of certain revenue streams, as revenue for those streams are billed monthly.\nUnder Topic 606, the Company defers all incremental commission costs (\"contract acquisition costs\") to obtain the contract. The contract acquisition costs, which are comprised of prepaid sales commissions, have balances at December 31, 2020 and 2019 of $41.0 million and $32.0 million, respectively. The Company amortizes these costs over the related period of benefit using the customer expected life that the Company determined to be three to five years which is consistent with the\nLIVEPERSON, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n1. Description of Business and Summary of Accounting Policies (Continued)\ntransfer to the customer of the services to which the asset relates. The Company classifies contract acquisition costs as long-term unless they have an original amortization period of one year or less.\nHosted Services- Business Revenue\nHosted Services Business revenue is reported at the amount that reflects the ultimate consideration expected to be received and primarily consist of fees that provide customers access to the Conversational Cloud, the Company\u2019s enterprise-class, cloud-based platform. The Company has determined such access represents a stand-ready service provided continually throughout the contract term. As such, control and satisfaction of this stand-ready performance obligation is deemed to occur over time. The Company recognizes this revenue over time on a ratable basis over the contract term, beginning on the date that access to the Conversational Cloud platform is made available to the customer. The passage of time is deemed to be the most faithful depiction of the transfer of control of the services as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefit provided by the Company\u2019s performance. Subscription contracts are generally one year or longer in length, billed, monthly, quarterly or annually in advance. There is no significant variable consideration related to these arrangements. Additionally, for certain of the Company\u2019s larger customers, the Company may provide call center labor through an arrangement with one or more of several qualified vendors. For most of these customers, the Company passes the fee it incurs with the labor provider and its fee for the hosted services through to its customers in the form of a fixed fee for each order placed via the Company\u2019s online engagement solutions. For these Gainshare (formerly \u201cPay for Performance\u201d) arrangements in accordance with ASC-606, \u2018\u2018Principal Agent Considerations\u2019\u2019, the Company acts as a principal in a transaction if it controls the specified goods or services before they are transferred to the customer.\nProfessional Services Revenues\nProfessional services revenue primarily consists of fees for deployment and optimization services, as well as training delivered on an on-demand basis which is deemed to represent a distinct stand-ready performance obligation. Professional Services Revenues are reported at the amount that reflects the ultimate consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for such services. Control for the majority of the Company\u2019s Professional Services contracts passes over time to the customer and is recognized ratably over the contracted period, as the passage of time is deemed to be the most faithful depiction of the transfer of control. For certain deployment services, which are not deemed to represent a distinct performance obligation, revenue will be recognized in the same manner as the fee for access to the Conversational Cloud platform, and as such will be recognized on a straight-line basis over the contract term. For services billed on a fixed price basis, revenue is recognized over time based on the proportion performed using time and materials as the measure of progress toward complete satisfaction of the performance obligation. Professional service contracts are generally one year or longer in length, billed, monthly, quarterly or annually in advance. There is no significant variable consideration related to these arrangements.\nRemaining Performance Obligation\nAs of December 31, 2020, the aggregate amount of the total transaction price allocated in contracts with original duration of greater than one year to the remaining performance obligations was $285.7 million. Approximately 90% of the Company\u2019s remaining performance obligations is expected to be recognized during the next 24 months, with the balance recognized thereafter. The aggregate balance of unsatisfied performance obligations represents contracted revenue that has not yet been recognized, and does not include contract amounts that are cancellable by the customer, amounts associated with optional renewal periods, and any amounts related to performance obligations, which are billed and recognized as they are delivered. The Company has elected the optional exemption, which allows for the exclusion of the amounts for remaining performance obligations that are part of contracts with an original expected duration of one year or less. Such remaining performance obligations represent unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied performance obligation pursuant to ASC 606.\nContracts with Multiple Performance Obligations\nSome of the Company\u2019s contracts with customers contain multiple performance obligations. For these contracts, the Company accounts for individual performance obligations separately if they are distinct. The transaction price is allocated to the separate performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price basis. The Company determines the standalone selling prices based on its overall pricing objectives, taking into consideration market conditions and other factors, including the value of its contracts, the cloud applications sold, and the number and types of users within its contracts.\nLIVEPERSON, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n1. Description of Business and Summary of Accounting Policies (Continued)\nHosted Services- Consumer Revenue\nFor revenue from the Company\u2019s Consumer segment generated from online transactions between Experts and Users, revenue is recognized at an amount net of Expert fees in accordance with ASC 606, \u201cPrincipal Agent Considerations\u201d, due primarily to the fact that the Expert is the primary obligor. Additionally, the Company performs as an agent without any risk of loss for collection, and is not involved in selecting the Expert or establishing the Expert\u2019s fee. The Company collects a fee from the consumer and retains a portion of the fee, and then remits the balance to the Expert. Revenue from these transactions is recognized at the point in time when the transaction is complete and no significant performance obligations remain.\nDeferred Revenues\nThe Company records deferred revenues when cash payments are received or due in advance of its performance. The decrease in the deferred revenue balance for the year ended December 31, 2020 is primarily driven by satisfying our performance obligations and the revenue recognized of approximately $103.2 million that were included in the deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2019.\nThe following table presents deferred revenue by revenue source (amounts in thousands):\nDecember 31,\n2020 2019\nHosted services - Business $ 86,144 $ 82,892\nHosted services - Consumer 835 687\nProfessional services - Business 1,869 5,172\nTotal deferred revenue - short term $ 88,848 $ 88,751\nHosted services - Business $ - $ -\nProfessional services - Business 409 438\nTotal deferred revenue - long term $ 409 $ 438\nDisaggregated Revenue\nThe following table presents the Company's revenues disaggregated by revenue source (amounts in thousands):\nDecember 31,\n2020 2019 2018\nRevenue:\nHosted services - Business $ 286,588 $ 225,705 $ 197,474\nHosted services - Consumer 29,764 24,480 19,553\nProfessional services 50,268 41,424 32,811\nTotal revenue $ 366,620 $ 291,609 $ 249,838\nLIVEPERSON, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n1. Description of Business and Summary of Accounting Policies (Continued)\nRevenue by Geographic Location\nThe Company is domiciled in the United States and has international operations in the United Kingdom, Asia-Pacific, Latin America and Western Europe, particularly France and Germany. The following table presents the Company's revenues attributable to domestic and foreign operations for the years ended (amounts in thousands):\nDecember 31,\n2020 2019 2018\nUnited States $ 230,557 $ 170,815 $ 146,702\nOther Americas (1)\n13,420 11,462 7,315\nTotal Americas 243,977 182,277 154,017\nEMEA (2) (4)\n83,326 78,301 71,318\nAPAC (3)\n39,317 31,031 24,503\nTotal revenue $ 366,620 $ 291,609 $ 249,838\n(1) Canada, Latin America and South America\n(2) Europe, the Middle East and Africa (\u201cEMEA\u201d)\n(3) Asia-Pacific (\u201cAPAC\u201d)\n(4) Includes revenue from the United Kingdom of $53.4 million, $50.4 million, and $46.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. and from the Netherlands of $3.2 million, $10.0 million, and $8.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.\nInformation about Contract Balances\nAmounts collected in advance of services being provided are accounted for as deferred revenue. Nearly all of the Company's deferred revenue balance is related to Hosted Services- Business Revenue.\nIn some arrangements, the Company allows customers to pay for access to the Conversational Cloud over the term of the software license. The Company refers to these as subscription transactions. Amounts recognized as revenue in excess of amounts billed are recorded as unbilled receivables. Unbilled receivables, anticipated to be invoiced in the next twelve months, are included in accounts receivable on the consolidated balance sheet. The opening and closing balances of the Company's accounts receivable, unbilled receivables, and deferred revenues are as follows (amounts in thousands):\nAccounts Receivable (1) Unbilled Receivable (1) Contract Acquisition Costs (noncurrent) Deferred Revenue (current) Deferred Revenue (long term)\nOpening Balance as of December 31, 2019 $ 70,318 $ 17,302 $ 31,965 $ 88,751 $ 438\nIncrease (decrease), net (8,517) 1,320 9,056 97 (29)\nEnding Balance as of December 31, 2020 $ 61,801 $ 18,622 $ 41,021 $ 88,848 $ 409\n(1) These accounts include the $0.7 million adjustment in connection with the adoption of ASU 2016-13 (Topic 326).\nAdvertising\nThe Company expenses the cost of advertising and promoting its services as incurred in the sales and marketing expense on the consolidated statement of operations. Such costs totaled approximately $29.1 million, $28.6 million, and $17.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nStock-Based Compensation\nIn accordance with ASC Topic 718 -10, \"Stock Compensation\", the Company measures stock based awards at fair value and recognizes compensation expense for all share-based payment awards made to its employees and directors, including employee stock options.\nThe Company estimates the fair value of stock options granted using the Black-Scholes valuation model. This model requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions including, among other things, estimates regarding the length of\nLIVEPERSON, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n1. Description of Business and Summary of Accounting Policies (Continued)\ntime an employee will retain vested stock options before exercising them, the estimated volatility of its common stock price and the number of options that will be forfeited prior to vesting. The fair value is then recognized on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award, which is generally three to four years. Changes in these estimates and assumptions can materially affect the determination of the fair value of the stock-based compensation and consequently, the related amount recognized in the consolidated statement of operations.\nDeferred Rent\nThe Company records rent expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the related lease. The difference between the rent expense recognized for financial reporting purposes and the actual payments made in accordance with the lease agreement is recognized as deferred rent liability included in other liabilities on the Company\u2019s consolidated balance sheets.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in results of operations in the period that the tax change occurs. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets in the jurisdiction from which they arise, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent operations. We include interest accrued on the underpayment of income taxes in interest expense and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in general and administrative expenses. Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.\nComprehensive Loss\nIn accordance with ASC 220, \u2018\u2018Comprehensive Income\u2019\u2019, the Company reports by major components and as a single total, the change in its net assets during the period from non-owner sources. Comprehensive income (loss) consists of net income (loss), and accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), which includes certain changes in equity that are excluded from net income (loss). The Company\u2019s comprehensive loss for all periods presented is related to the effect of foreign currency translation.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nIn August 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) issued ASU 2020-06, \u201cDebt - Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entity's Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity's Own Equity\u201d, which simplifies the accounting for convertible instruments by eliminating existing accounting models that require separation of a cash conversion or beneficial conversion feature from the host contract. Accordingly, a convertible debt instrument will be accounted as a single liability measured at its amortized cost and a convertible preferred stock will be accounted as a single equity instrument measured at its historical cost, as long as no other embedded features require bifurcation as derivatives and the convertible debt was not issued at a substantial premium. The ASU also simplifies the derivative scope exception for accounting for contracts in an entity's own equity by:\n\u2022 removing certain conditions required to meet the settlement criterion\n\u2022 clarifying that Instruments that are not indexed to the issuer's own stock must be remeasured at fair value through\nearnings at each reporting period; and\n\u2022 clarifying the scope of reassessment guidance and disclosure requirements in Subtopic 815-40. The ASU also makes\ntargeted improvements to the disclosure requirements for convertible instruments and earnings-per-share guidance.\nFor SEC filers, excluding smaller reporting companies, the ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The ASU specifies that the guidance should be adopted as of the beginning of the annual fiscal year. The Company is assessing and evaluating the impact ASU 2020-06 will have on its consolidated financial statements.\nLIVEPERSON, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n1. Description of Business and Summary of Accounting Policies (Continued)\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, \u201cIncome Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes.\u201d The new guidance is intended to simplify the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions and by updating accounting requirements around franchise taxes, goodwill recognized for tax purposes, the allocation of current and deferred tax expense among legal entities, among other minor changes. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is assessing what impact ASU 2019-12 will have on its consolidated financial statements.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ASU 2016-13, \u201cFinancial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326)\u201d, in order to improve financial reporting of expected credit losses on financial instruments and other commitments to extend credit. ASU 2016-13 requires that an entity measure and recognize expected credit losses for financial assets held at amortized cost and replaces the incurred loss impairment methodology in prior GAAP with a methodology that requires consideration of a broader range of information to estimate credit losses. Such required disclosures include, but are not limited to, the Company's methodology for estimating its allowance for credit losses. The Company adopted ASU 2016-13 effective January 1, 2020 and applied the guidance using a modified retrospective approach requiring that the Company recognize the cumulative effect of initially applying the impairment standard as an adjustment to opening accumulated deficit for the incremental increase in its allowance for credit losses as of January 1, 2020 over its allowance for bad debts as of December, 31, 2019, which amounted to $0.7 million. The Company will continue to actively monitor the impact of the recent COVID-19 pandemic on expected credit losses. As of December 31, 2020, there has not been an impact to accounts receivable from the recent pandemic.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ASU 2017-04, \u201cSimplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment\u201d, which eliminates the computation of the implied fair value of goodwill to measure a goodwill impairment charge. Instead, entities will record a goodwill impairment charge based on the excess of a reporting unit\u2019s carrying amount over its fair value. The guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted ASU 2017-04 in the first quarter of 2020 which reduced the complexity surrounding the evaluation of goodwill for impairment. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements.\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-15, \u201cCustomer\u2019s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That Is a Service Contract,\u201d which clarifies the accounting for implementation costs in cloud computing arrangements. The new standard aligns the treatment of implementation costs incurred by customers in cloud computing arrangements that are service contracts with the treatment of similar costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software. Under the new standard, implementation costs are deferred and presented in the same financial statement caption on the condensed consolidated balance sheet as a prepayment of related arrangement fees. The deferred costs are recognized over the term of the arrangement in the same financial statement caption in the condensed consolidated income statement as the related fees of the arrangement. The Company adopted ASU 2018-15 in the first quarter of 2020 and the impact of the adoption was not material to the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nLIVEPERSON, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n2. Net Loss per Share\nThe Company calculates earnings per share (\u201cEPS\u201d) in accordance with the provisions of ASC 260-10 and the guidance of SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin (\u201cSAB\u201d) No. 98. Under ASC 260-10, basic EPS excludes dilution for common stock equivalents and is computed by dividing net income or loss attributable to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. All options, warrants or other potentially dilutive instruments issued for nominal consideration are required to be included in the calculation of basic and diluted net income attributable to common stockholders. Diluted EPS is calculated using the treasury stock method and reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock and resulted in the issuance of common stock.\nDiluted net loss per common share for the year ended December 31, 2020 does not include the effect of options to purchase 7,283,938 shares of common stock as the effect of their inclusion is anti-dilutive. Diluted net loss per common share for the year ended December 31, 2019 does not include the effect of options to purchase 8,848,907 shares of common stock as the effect of their inclusion is anti-dilutive. Diluted net loss per common share for the year ended December 31, 2018 does not include the effect of options to purchase 8,957,672 shares of common stock as the effect of their inclusion is anti-dilutive.\nA reconciliation of shares used in calculating basic and diluted earnings per share follows:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2019 2018\nBasic 65,888,450 62,593,026 59,203,400\nEffect of assumed exercised options - - -\nDiluted 65,888,450 62,593,026 59,203,400\n3. Segment Information\nThe Company accounts for its segment information in accordance with the provisions of ASC 280-10, \u201cSegment Reporting.\u201d ASC 280-10 establishes annual and interim reporting standards for operating segments of a company. ASC 280-10 requires disclosures of selected segment-related financial information about products, major customers, and geographic areas based on the Company\u2019s internal accounting methods. The Company is organized into two operating segments for purposes of making operating decisions and assessing performance. The Business segment enables brands to leverage the Conversational Cloud sophisticated intelligence engine to connect with consumers through an integrated suite of mobile and online business messaging technologies. The Consumer segment facilitates online transactions between independent service providers (\u201cExperts\u201d) and individual consumers (\u201cUsers\u201d) seeking information and knowledge for a fee via mobile and online messaging. Both segments currently generate their revenue primarily in the United States. The chief operating decision maker, who is the chief executive officer, evaluates performance, makes operating decisions, and allocates resources based on the operating income of each segment. The reporting segments follow the same accounting polices used in the preparation of the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements which are described in the summary of significant accounting policies. The Company allocates cost of revenue, sales and marketing and amortization of purchased intangibles to the segments, but it does not allocate product development expenses, general and administrative expenses, restructuring costs and income tax expense because management does not use this information to measure performance of the operating segments. There are currently no inter-segment sales.\nLIVEPERSON, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n3.

Convertible Senior Notes and Capped Call Transactions\nMarch 2019 Convertible Senior Notes\nIn March 2019, the Company issued $230.0 million aggregate principal amount of 0.750% Convertible Senior Notes due 2024 in a private placement, which amount includes $30.0 million aggregate principal amount of such Notes pursuant to the exercise in full of the over-allotment options of the initial purchasers (collectively, the \u201c2024 Notes\u201d). The interest on the 2024 Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on March 1 and September 1 of each year, beginning on September 1, 2019.\nThe 2024 Notes will mature on March 1, 2024, unless earlier repurchased or redeemed by the Company or converted pursuant to their terms. The total net proceeds from the debt offering, after deducting debt issuance costs, paid or payable by us, was approximately $221.4 million.\nEach $1,000 principal amount of the 2024 Notes is initially convertible into 25.9182 shares of the Company\u2019s common stock par value $0.001, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $38.58 per share. The conversion rate is subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain specified events but will not be adjusted for any accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, following certain corporate events that occur prior to the maturity date, the Company will increase the conversion rate for a holder who elects to convert its 2024 Notes in connection with such a corporate event. The 2024 Notes are not redeemable prior to the maturity date of the 2024 Notes and no sinking fund is provided for the 2024 Notes. If we undergo a fundamental change (as defined in the indenture governing the 2024 Notes) prior to the maturity date, holders may require us to repurchase for cash all or any portion of their 2024 Notes in principal amounts of $1,000 or a multiple thereof at a fundamental change repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2024 Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date.\nHolders of the 2024 Notes may convert their 2024 Notes at their option at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding November 1, 2023, in multiples of $1,000 principal amount, only under the following circumstances: (1) during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending on June 30, 2019 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price of the Company\u2019s common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price for the 2024 Notes on each applicable trading day as determined by the Company; (2) during the five business day period after any five consecutive trading day period (the \u201cmeasurement period\u201d) in which the \u201ctrading price\u201d (as defined in the indenture governing the 2024 Notes) per $1,000 principal amount of 2024 Notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of the Company\u2019s common stock and the conversion rate for the 2024 Notes on each such trading day; or (3) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events. On or after November 1, 2023, holders may convert all or any portion of their 2024 Notes at any time prior to the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, regardless of the foregoing circumstances. Upon conversion, the Company will pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of its common stock or a combination of cash and shares of its common stock, at the Company\u2019s election.\nLIVEPERSON, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nIt is the Company\u2019s current intent to settle the principal amount of its outstanding 2024 Notes in cash and any excess in shares of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, the conditions allowing holders of the 2024 Notes to convert were met, and, thus, holders of the 2024 Notes maintain the option to convert their 2024 Notes. No 2024 Notes were converted during the year ended December 31, 2020. The Company continues to classify the 2024 Notes as a long-term liability in its consolidated balance sheet as at December 31, 2020, based on contractual settlement provisions.\nThe 2024 Notes are senior unsecured obligations and will rank senior in right of payment to any of the Company\u2019s indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the 2024 Notes; equal in right of payment with the Company\u2019s existing and future liabilities that are not so subordinated; effectively subordinated to any of the Company\u2019s secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and structurally junior to all indebtedness and other liabilities (including trade payables) of current or future subsidiaries of the Company.\nIn accounting for the issuance of the 2024 Notes, the Company separated the 2024 Notes into liability and equity components. The carrying amount of the liability component was calculated by measuring the fair value of a similar debt instrument that does not have an associated convertible feature. The carrying amount of the equity component representing the conversion option was $52.9 million and was determined by deducting the fair value of the liability component from the par value of the 2024 Notes. The equity component is not remeasured as long as it continues to meet the conditions for equity classification. The excess of the principal amount of the liability component over its carrying amount, or the debt discount, is amortized to interest expense at an effective interest rate over the contractual terms of the 2024 Notes.\nIn accounting for the transaction costs related to the 2024 Notes, the Company allocated the total amount incurred of approximately $8.6 million to the liability and equity components of the 2024 Notes based on the proportion of the proceeds allocated to the debt and equity components. Issuance costs attributable to the liability component were approximately $6.6 million, were recorded as an additional debt discount and are amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the contractual terms of the 2024 Notes. Issuance costs attributable to the equity component were approximately $2.0 million and recorded as a reduction of additional paid in capital in stockholders\u2019 equity.\nIn connection with the offering of the 2024 Notes, the Company entered into privately-negotiated capped call option transactions with certain counterparties (the \u201ccapped calls\u201d). The capped calls each have an initial strike price of approximately $38.58 per share, subject to certain adjustments, which corresponds to the initial conversion price of the 2024 Notes. The capped calls have initial cap prices of $57.16 per share, subject to certain adjustment events. The capped calls cover, subject to anti-dilution adjustments, approximately 5.96 million shares of common stock. The capped calls are generally intended to reduce or offset the potential dilution to the common stock upon any conversion of the 2024 Notes with such reduction or offset, as the case may be, subject to a cap based on the cap price. The capped calls expire on March 1, 2024, subject to earlier exercise. The capped calls are subject to either adjustment or termination upon the occurrence of specified extraordinary events affecting the Company, including a merger event, a tender offer, and a nationalization, insolvency or delisting involving the Company. In addition, the capped calls are subject to certain specified additional disruption events that may give rise to a termination of the capped calls, including changes in law, failure to deliver, and hedging disruptions. The capped calls are recorded in stockholders\u2019 equity and are not accounted for as derivatives. The net cost of $23.2 million incurred to purchase the capped calls was recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.\nThe remaining term over which the March 2019 Convertible Senior Notes debt discount and debt issuance costs will be amortized is 3.2 years. The effective interest rate on the debt was 4.66% for the year ended December 31 2020.\nDecember 2020 Convertible Senior Notes\nIn December 2020, the Company issued $517.5 million aggregate principal amount of 0% Convertible Senior Notes due 2026 in a private placement, which amount includes $67.5 million aggregate principal amount of such Notes pursuant to the exercise in full of the over-allotment options of the initial purchasers (collectively, the \u201c2026 Notes\u201d, and, together with the 2024 Notes, the \"Notes\").\nThe 2026 Notes will mature on December 15, 2026, unless earlier repurchased or redeemed by the Company or converted pursuant to their terms. The total net proceeds from the debt offering, after deducting debt issuance costs, paid or payable by us, was approximately $505.3 million.\nEach $1,000 principal amount of the 2026 Notes is initially convertible into 13.2933 shares of the Company\u2019s common stock par value $0.001, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $75.23 per share. The conversion\nLIVEPERSON, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nrate is subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain specified events but will not be adjusted for any accrued and unpaid interest.

(\u201cAdvantageTec\u201d), a leading provider of texting solutions for service departments of automotive dealerships that helps enable the conversational experience across the entire dealership, including both front end/variable operations (new and used vehicle sales) and back end/fixed operations (parts and services). The purchase agreement was for total consideration of approximately $11.2 million, which includes approximately $6.0 million in cash, approximately $4.3 million in shares of common stock, and approximately $0.9 million of potential earn-out consideration in cash and shares of common stock. The earn-out is contingent upon achieving certain targeted financial, strategic and integration objectives and milestones and is included as part of the purchase price. During 2019, the Company recorded a $0.2 million fair value re-measurement adjustment and made payments of $0.5 million in earn-out consideration. The Company settled the remaining contingent earn-out of approximately $0.3 million in stock. As of December 31, 2020, there are no additional contingent earn-out payments.\nThe purchase price allocation resulted in approximately $9.1 million of goodwill and approximately $2.2 million of intangible assets. The goodwill will not be deductible for tax purposes. The intangible assets are being amortized over their expected period of benefit.

As such, fair value may be based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. The authoritative guidance on fair value measurements establishes a consistent framework for measuring fair value on either a recurring or nonrecurring basis whereby inputs, used in valuation techniques, are assigned a hierarchical level. The following are the hierarchical levels of inputs to measure fair value:\n\u2022Level 1: Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.\n\u2022Level 2: Inputs reflect: quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the assets or liabilities; or inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means.\n\u2022Level 3: Unobservable inputs reflecting the Company\u2019s assumptions incorporated in valuation techniques used to determine fair value. These assumptions are required to be consistent with market participant assumptions that are reasonably available.\nFinancial Assets and Liabilities\nThe carrying amount of cash, accounts receivable, and accounts payable approximate their fair value due to their short-term nature. The Company's assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis, by level, within the fair value hierarchy as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, are summarized as follows (amounts in thousands).\nDecember 31, 2020 December 31, 2019\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nAssets:\nCash equivalents:\nMoney market funds $ 328,195 $ - $ - $ 328,195 $ 2,899 $ - $ - $ 2,899\nTotal assets $ 328,195 $ - $ - $ 328,195 $ 2,899 $ - $ - $ 2,899\nLiabilities:\nContingent earn-out $ - $ - $ - $ - $ - $ - $ 557 $ 557\nTotal liabilities $ - $ - $ - $ - $ - $ - $ 557 $ 557\nIn determining fair value, the Company utilizes valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs to the extent possible as well as considers counterparty credit risk in its assessment of fair value. Observable or market inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect the Company\u2019s assumptions based on the best information available.\nThe Company\u2019s money market funds are measured at fair value on a recurring basis based on quoted market prices in active markets and are classified as level 1 within the fair value hierarchy. The Company\u2019s contingent earn-out liability is measured at fair value on a recurring basis and is classified as level 3 within the fair value hierarchy. On a nonrecurring basis, the Company uses fair value measures when analyzing asset impairment. Long-lived tangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If it is determined such indicators are present and the review indicates that the assets will not be fully recoverable, based on undiscounted estimated cash flows over the remaining amortization periods, their carrying values are reduced to estimated fair value. The Company uses an income approach and inputs that constitute level 3. During the third quarter of each year, the Company evaluates goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level. The Company uses qualitative factors in accordance with ASU No. 2011-08 to determine whether it is \u2018\u2018more likely than not\u2019\u2019 that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform a goodwill impairment test. This measurement is classified based on level 3 input.\nLIVEPERSON, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n9. Fair Value Measurements - (continued)\nAs of December 31, 2020 the fair value of the Notes issued in the two Convertible Senior Note transactions, as further described in Note 7 above, was approximately $557.5 million. Management determines the fair value by utilizing an independent valuation specialist using the antithetic variable technique and is considered a Level 2 fair value measurement.\nThe Company recorded a contingent earn-out of $2.4 million in December 2018 in connection with the acquisitions of Conversable, Inc. and AdvantageTec Inc. The contingent earn-out is based on achieving certain targeted financial, strategic, and integration objectives. The unobservable inputs considered are probability factors and the time value of money. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the contingent earn-out decreased by $0.6 million due to a decrease in re-measurement to fair value of AdvantageTec Inc, Inc. of approximately $0.3 million and payments of approximately $0.3 million in shares.\nThe changes in fair value of the Level 3 liabilities are as follows (amounts in thousands):\nContingent Earn-Out\nDecember 31,\n2020 2019\nBalance, Beginning of year $ 557 $ 2,372\nConversable, Inc. fair value adjustment (see Note 8) - (496)\nAdvantageTec, Inc. fair value adjustment (see Note 8) (263) 168\nPayments (294) (1,487)\nBalance, End of year $ - $ 557\n10. Commitments and Contingencies\nContractual Obligations\nThe Company has entered into various non-cancelable operating lease agreements for certain of our offices and vehicles. We have also entered into various non-cancelable finance lease agreements for certain network equipment. The leases have initial lease terms ranging from 1 to 12 years. Payments due under the lease contracts include primarily fixed payments. The lease terms include periods under options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. We do not assume renewals in our determination of the lease term unless the renewals are deemed to be reasonably assured. Our lease agreements generally do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.\nThe Company has evaluated its facility leases and determined which leases met the definition of the new standard in accordance with Topic 842. The Company also performed an evaluation of their other contracts with suppliers in accordance with Topic 842 and have determined that, except for the facilities, car, and network equipment leases described above, none of its supply contracts contain a lease. Further, the Company has made an accounting policy election to keep leases with a term of twelve months or less off the balance sheet. This policy applies to all classes of the underlying assets. The Company will recognize those lease payments and associated interest expense in the consolidated statement of operations evenly over the lease term.\nThe Company elected the \u201cpackage of practical expedients,\u201d which permits the Company not to reassess under ASC 842 its prior conclusions about lease identification, lease classification and initial direct costs. The Company also made a policy election not to separate non-lease components from lease components. Furthermore, the Company elected to not capitalize leases with a term of 12 months or less and recognize the lease expense for such leases generally on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nThe determination of the discount rate used to calculate the present value of the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities depends on whether an interest rate is implicit in the lease or not. If a rate is implicit in the lease, that rate is used when calculating the present value of lease payments. If the rate is not readily determinable, which is generally the case for the Company, the Company\u2019s incremental borrowing rate (\u201cIBR\u201d) as of the date of inception of the lease is used (for initial measurement, the IBR was determined as of the adoption date of the standard). The IBR is the rate of interest that the Company would have to pay to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term and amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment. The Company used a ratings benchmark report against its peers in the technology sector.\nLIVEPERSON, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n10. Commitments and Contingencies - (continued)\nThe Company has operating and finance leases for its corporate offices and other service agreements. The Company's leases have remaining lease terms of 1 to 5 years, some of which include options to extend. The Company's lease expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 consisted of operating and finance leases was approximately $13.5 million.\nOperating leases are included in operating lease right of use (\u201cROU\u201d) assets and current and noncurrent operating lease liabilities on the Company\u2019s consolidated balance sheets. Finance leases are included in property and equipment, accrued expenses and other liabilities, and other noncurrent liabilities on the Company\u2019s consolidated balance sheets.\nOn July 13, 2020, the Company announced its decision to transition to an employee-centric model under which employees will work remotely rather than in traditional offices. In connection with this decision, the Company abandoned 14 leases in its global portfolio of office leases during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. As a result, the Company recognized accelerated amortization to fully reduce the carrying value of the associated ROU assets between the decision date, which was determined to be July 13, 2020 and the cease use date. There were no changes to the accounting for the lease liabilities associated with the leased office spaces. Additionally, the Company recognized accelerated depreciation of fixed assets that were determined to no longer be of future economic benefit to the Company based on the decision to vacate the leased office space. Lease restructuring expenses of $24.3 million are included in restructuring costs in the condensed consolidated statements of operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. The Company also incurred other non-recurring expenses of $5.1 million in restructuring costs in the condensed consolidated statements of operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 associated with the transition to an employee-centric workforce model that does not rely on traditional offices. These expenses include termination penalties, moving expenses, storage expenses and incremental legal and consulting fees. The associated liability is presented on the condensed consolidated balance sheets within accrued expenses and other current liabilities as of December 31, 2020. Subsequent adjustments to these liabilities, including final settlement of the amounts, will be reflected in future period earnings.\nSupplemental cash flow information related to leases for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 are as follows (in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2019\nCash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities:\nOperating cash flows for operating leases 4,901 6,963\nOperating cash flows for finance leases 88 -\nFinancing cash flows for finance leases 1,154 -\nThe components of lease costs for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 are as follows (in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2019\nFinance lease cost\nAmortization of right-of-use assets 772 -\nInterest 88 -\nOperating lease cost 12,649 12,984\nTotal lease cost 13,509 12,984\nSupplemental balance sheet information related to leases is as follows:\nLIVEPERSON, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n10.

Commitments and Contingencies - (continued)\nEmployee Benefit Plans\nThe Company has a 401(k) defined contribution plan covering all eligible employees. In 2018, the Company provided for employer matching contributions equal to 50% of employee contributions, up to the lesser of 5% of eligible compensation or $6,000. Matching contributions are deposited into the employee\u2019s 401(k) account and are subject to 5 year graded vesting. Beginning in 2019, the Company\u2019s 401(k) policy was changed to a Safe Harbor Plan, whereby the Company matches 100% of the first 3% of eligible compensation and 50% of the next 2% of eligible compensation. Furthermore, the match is immediately vested. Total Company matching contributions were $3.1 million, $3.2 million, and $1.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nLetters of Credit\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company has a $0.1 million letter of credit outstanding substantially in favor of a certain landlord for office space. In addition, the Company has a letter of credit totaling $0.1 million as a security deposit for the due performance by the Company of the terms and conditions of a supply contract. As a result of our transition to an employee-centric workforce model that does not rely on traditional offices, there were two draws against our letter of credit in the aggregate amount of $1.8 million in connection with exiting leases in Alpharetta Georgia and Israel during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020.\nIndemnifications\nThe Company enters into service and license agreements in its ordinary course of business. Pursuant to some of these agreements, the Company agrees to indemnify certain customers from and against certain types of claims and losses suffered or incurred by them as a result of using the Company\u2019s products.\nThe Company also has agreements whereby its executive officers and directors are indemnified for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is, or was serving, at the Company\u2019s request in such capacity. The maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited; however, the Company has a directors and officers insurance policy that reduces its exposure and enables the Company to recover a portion of any future amounts paid. As a result of its insurance policy coverage, the Company believes the estimated fair value of these indemnification agreements is minimal. The Company has no liabilities recorded for these agreements as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nNon-Income Related Taxes\nThe Company is in the process of finalizing its sales tax liability analysis for states in which it has economic nexus. During the first quarter of 2020, the Company determined it was probable the Company would be subject to sales tax liabilities plus applicable interest in these states and has estimated the potential exposure to range between $2.5 million to $6.3 million. The Company determined that its best estimate of what would be reasonably expected for the Company to settle the potential exposure was $2.5 million and accordingly, the Company accrued this amount with a corresponding charge to earnings as of March 31, 2020. There has not been any significant changes in the Company\u2019s process of finalizing its sales tax liability nor in the overall accrued amount.\nCOVID-19 Pandemic\nIn December 2019, a novel coronavirus disease (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) was first reported. On March 11, 2020, due to worldwide spread of the virus, the World Health Organization characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic. The COVID-19 global pandemic has resulted in a widespread health crisis, and the resulting impact on governments, businesses and individuals and actions taken by them in response to the situation have resulted in widespread economic disruptions, significantly affecting broader economies, financial markets, and overall demand for the Company\u2019s products. The COVID-19 outbreak also has caused increased uncertainty in estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in the Company\u2019s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as the extent and period of recovery from the COVID-19 outbreak and related economic disruption is difficult to forecast.\nLIVEPERSON, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n10. Commitments and Contingencies - (continued)\nThe extent to which COVID-19 impacts the Company\u2019s business and financial results will depend on numerous evolving factors including, but not limited to, the magnitude and duration of COVID-19, the extent to which it will impact worldwide macroeconomic conditions, the speed of the anticipated recovery, and governmental and business reactions to the pandemic. The Company assessed certain accounting matters that generally require consideration of forecasted financial information in context with the information reasonably available to the Company and the unknown future impacts of COVID-19. The accounting matters assessed included, but were not limited to, the Company\u2019s allowance for credit losses and the carrying value of the goodwill and other long-lived assets. While there was not any significant impact to the operations of the Company, during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, the Company moved to an employee-centric model under which employees will work remotely rather than in traditional offices due to concerns about COVID-19. As a result of this decision, the Company recognized accelerated amortization to fully reduce the carrying value of the associated right of use assets (\u201cROU assets\u201d) for 14 leases within its global lease portfolio, which is a material impact to the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements as of and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. Refer to earlier paragraphs of this Note 10 for a detailed discussion of the impacts of this lease restructuring.\nThe Company\u2019s future assessment of the magnitude and duration of COVID-19, as well as other factors, could result in other material impacts to the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements in future reporting periods.\n11. Stockholders\u2019 Equity\nCommon Stock\nIn November 2019, the Company filed an amendment to its Certificate of Incorporation to authorize an additional 100,000,000 shares of common stock. As December 31, 2020, there were 200,000,000 shares of common stock authorized, and 70,264,265 and 67,554,435 shares issued and outstanding, respectively. As of December 31, 2019, there were 200,000,000 shares of common stock authorized, and 66,543,073 and 63,833,243 shares issued and outstanding, respectively. The par value for the common stock is $0.001 per share.\nPreferred Stock\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, there were 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock authorized, and zero shares issued and outstanding. The par value for the preferred stock is $0.001 per share.\nStock Repurchase Program\nFrom 2012 through 2018, the Company had a stock repurchase program in place pursuant to which the Company was authorized to repurchase shares of its common stock, in the open market or privately negotiated transactions, at times and prices considered appropriate by the Board of Directors depending upon prevailing market conditions and other corporate considerations. The timing and actual number of shares repurchased depend on a variety of factors including the timing of open trading windows, price, corporate and regulatory requirements and other market conditions. The program was discontinued at the end of 2018. The Company may or may not enter into a new stock repurchase program in the future.\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe Company follows FASB ASC 718-10, \u201cStock Compensation,\u201d which addresses the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services, with a primary focus on transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share-based payment transactions. ASC 718-10 requires measurement of the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award. Incremental compensation costs arising from subsequent modifications of awards after the grant date must be recognized.\nLIVEPERSON, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n11. Stockholders\u2019 Equity - (continued)\nThe per share weighted average fair value of stock options granted during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $13.84, $12.12, and $6.60, respectively. The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018:\nDecember 31,\n2020 2019 2018\nDividend yield -% -% -%\nRisk-free interest rate 0.26% - 0.66%\n1.66% - 3.05%\n2.5% - 3.1%\nExpected life (in years) 5.0 5.0 5.0\nHistorical volatility 46.50% - 53.91%\n43.42% - 44%\n43.5% - 48.4%\nA description of the methods used in the significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value of stock-based-based compensation awards follows:\nDividend yield - The Company uses 0% as it has never issued dividends and does not anticipate issuing dividends in the near term.\nRisk-free interest rate - The Company uses the market yield on U.S. Treasury securities at five years with constant maturity, representing the current expected life of stock options in years.\nExpected life - The Company uses historical data to estimate the expected life of a stock option.\nHistorical volatility - The Company uses a trailing five year from grant date to determine volatility.\nStock Option Plans\nDuring 1998, the Company established the Stock Option and Restricted Stock Purchase Plan (the \u201c1998 Plan\u201d). Under the 1998 Plan, the Board of Directors could issue incentive stock options or nonqualified stock options to purchase up to 5,850,000 shares of common stock. The 2000 Stock Incentive Plan (the \u201c2000 Plan\u201d) succeeded the 1998 Plan. Under the 2000 Plan, the options which had been outstanding under the 1998 Plan were incorporated in the 2000 Plan increasing the number of shares available for issuance under the plan by approximately 4,150,000, thereby reserving for issuance 10,000,000 shares of common stock in the aggregate.\nThe Company established the 2009 Stock Incentive Plan (the \u201c2009 Plan\u201d) as a successor to the 2000 Plan. Under the 2009 Plan, the options which had been outstanding under the 2000 Plan were incorporated into the 2009 Plan and the Company increased the number of shares available for issuance under the plan by 6,000,000. The Company amended the 2009 Plan (the \u201cAmended 2009 Plan\u201d) effective June 7, 2012. The Amended 2009 Plan increased the number of shares authorized for issuance under the plan by an additional 4,250,000. On June 2, 2017, the Company's Board of Directors amended and restated the Amended 2009 Plan effective April 30, 2017. The amended and restated plan increased the number of shares authorized for issuance under the plan by an additional 4,000,000.\nOn April 11, 2019, the Company\u2019s Board of Directors adopted, and on June 6, 2019, the Company\u2019s stockholders approved, the 2019 Stock Incentive Plan (\u2018\u20182019 Stock Incentive Plan\u2019\u2019) to replace the Amended 2009 Plan, which was set to expire under its terms on June 9, 2019. Under the 2019 Stock Incentive Plan, the number of shares underlying options and other equity awards which remain outstanding, as well as the number of shares that remained available for grant, under the Amended 2009 Plan and under the Amended 2000 Plan were incorporated, as of June 6, 2019, into the 2019 Stock Incentive Plan. In addition, under the 2019 Stock Incentive Plan, 4,250,000 new shares were authorized for issuance.\nOn April 29, 2020, the Company's Board of Directors adopted, and on June 11, 2020, the company's stockholders approved, certain amendments to the 2019 Stock Incentive Plan, including an increase in the number of shares authorized for issuance by 3,000,000 new shares.\nThe number of shares authorized for issuance under the 2019 Stock Incentive Plan, the Amended 2009 Plan, and the 2000 Plan is 35,067,744 shares in the aggregate. Options to acquire common stock granted thereunder have 10-year terms. As of December 31, 2020, approximately 3.3 million shares of common stock remained available for issuance under the 2019 Stock Incentive Plan (taking into account all option exercises and other equity award settlements through December 31, 2020).\nLIVEPERSON, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n11. Stockholders\u2019 Equity - (continued)\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan\nIn June 2010, the Company\u2019s stockholders approved the 2010 Employee Stock Purchase Plan with 1,000,000 shares of common stock initially reserved for issuance. Subject to stockholder approval, which was obtained on June 2, 2017, the Company's Board of Directors amended and restated the 2010 Employee Stock Purchase Plan effective April 30, 2017. The amended and restated plan increased the number of shares authorized for issuance under the plan by an additional 1,000,000, thereby reserving for issuance 2,000,000 shares of common stock in the aggregate.\nOn April 11, 2019, the Company\u2019s Board of Directors adopted, and on June 6, 2019, the Company\u2019s stockholders approved, the 2019 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the \u2018\u20182019 Employee Stock Purchase Plan\u2019\u2019) to replace the Amended and Restated 2010 Employee Stock Purchase Plan which was set to expire under its terms in June 2020. There are 1,000,000 shares authorized and reserved for issuance under the 2019 Employee Stock Purchase Plan. As of December 31, 2020, approximately 0.8 million shares of common stock remain available for issuance under the 2019 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (taking into account all share purchases through December 31 2019).\nInducement Plan\nDuring January 2018, the Company established the Inducement Plan (the \u201c2018 Plan\u201d). Under the 2018 Plan, the Board of Directors can issue nonqualified stock options or other equity-based awards in respect of up to 1,500,000 shares of common stock. On April 25, 2018, the Company\u2019s Board of Directors amended and restated the 2018 Plan (the \u2018\u2018Amended 2018 Plan\u2019\u2019). The Amended 2018 Plan increased the number of shares authorized for issuance under the plan by an additional 500,000 shares, and subsequently the Board of Directors approved and ratified, effective as of July 31, 2018, October 29, 2018 and February 13, 2019, increases of the number of shares authorized for issuance under the Amended 2018 Plan by 500,000, 250,000 and 618,048 shares, respectively, constituting 3,368,048 shares of common stock in the aggregate being reserved for issuance pursuant to grants under the Amended 2018 Plan. As of December 31, 2020, approximately 1.2 million shares of common stock remained available for issuance under the Amended 2018 Plan (taking into account all option exercises and other equity award settlements through December 31, 2020).\nLIVEPERSON, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n11.

For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company accrued approximately $19.0 million in cash awards to be settled in shares of the Company's stock and recorded a corresponding expense, which is included as a component of stock-based compensation expense in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nStock-based compensation expense recognized in the Company\u2019s consolidated statements of operations and cash flows was $65.9 million and $44.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n12. Income Taxes\nIncome taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those\nLIVEPERSON, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n12. Income Taxes - (continued)\ntemporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences are expected to become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. The Company includes interest accrued on the underpayment of income taxes in interest expense and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in general and administrative expenses. The Company recorded a valuation allowance against its U.S. deferred tax asset as it considered its cumulative loss in recent years as a significant piece of negative evidence. Since valuation allowances are evaluated on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis, we believe that the deferred tax assets related to LivePerson Australia, LivePerson UK, Kasamba Israel, LivePerson Japan and LivePerson LTD Israel are more likely than not to be realized as these jurisdictions have positive cumulative pre-tax book income after adjusting for permanent and one-time items. During the year ended December 31, 2020, there was an increase in the valuation recorded of $6.9 million.\nThe Company had a valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets for the years ended December 31, 2018, December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2020 of $30.2 million, $48.5 million and $55.4 million, respectively. An increase in the valuation allowance in the amount of $35.1 million was recorded as an expense and a decrease of $28.2 million related to convertible notes was charged to equity during 2020. An increase in the valuation allowance in the amount of $25.0 million was recorded as an expense and a decrease of $6.7 million related to the issuance of convertible notes was charged to equity during 2019.\nUnder Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u2018\u2018Code\u2019\u2019), the Company\u2019s use of its federal net operating loss (\u201cNOL\u201d) carryforwards may be limited if the Company experiences an ownership change, as defined in Section 382 of the Code. Such an annual limitation could result in the expiration of the NOL carryforwards before utilization. Corresponding provisions of state law may limit the Company\u2019s ability to utilize NOL carryforwards for state tax purposes. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had approximately $311.7 million of federal NOL carryforwards available to offset future taxable income. Included in this amount is $5.1 million of federal NOL carryovers from the Company\u2019s acquisition of Proficient in 2006. Approximately $41.2 million of these federal NOL carryforwards were generated in taxable years ending on or before December 31, 2017 and will expire in various years through 2037. Federal NOL carryforwards generated in taxable years ending after December 31, 2017, do not expire, but generally may only offset up to 80% of federal taxable income earned in a taxable year.\nThe domestic and foreign components of income (loss) before provision for income taxes consist of the following (amounts in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2019 2018\nUnited States $ (113,689) $ (105,961) $ (38,078)\nIsrael 2,214 2,791 3,163\nUnited Kingdom 536 5,377 3,690\nNetherlands 3,398 (465) 3,235\nAustralia 1,663 716 686\nGermany 243 3,854 2,900\nOther (1)\n507 462 230\n$ (105,128) $ (93,226) $ (24,174)\n(1) Includes Japan and France\nNo additional provision has been made for U.S. income taxes on the undistributed earnings of its Israeli subsidiary, LivePerson Ltd.

We have $221.9 million of state NOLs, of which $47.3 million can be carried forward indefinitely and $174.6 million expire between 2023 and 2040.\nASC Topic 740-10 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements in accordance with other provisions contained within this guidance. This topic prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities. The amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate audit settlement. The Company had unrecognized tax benefits of $3.6 million as of December 31, 2020 and $2.0 million as of December 31, 2019, respectively. Accrued interest and penalties included in the Company's liability related to unrecognized tax benefits and recorded in accrued expenses and other current liabilities were immaterial at December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nLIVEPERSON, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n12.

The changes include, but are not limited to: increasing the limitation on the amount of deductible interest expense, allowing companies to carryback certain net operating losses, and increasing the amount of net operating loss carryforwards that corporations can use to offset taxable income. As a result of the CARES Act, the Company filed refund claims relating to prior years totaling $0.6 million.\n13. Legal Matters\nThe Company previously filed an intellectual property suit against [24]7 Customer, Inc. (\u2018\u2018[24]7\u2019\u2019) in the Southern District of New York on March 6, 2014 seeking damages on the grounds that [24]7 reverse engineered and misappropriated the Company\u2019s technology to develop competing products and misused the Company\u2019s business information. On June 22, 2015, [24]7 Customer, Inc. filed suit against the Company in the Northern District of California alleging patent infringement. On December 7, 2015, [24]7 Customer Inc. filed a second patent infringement suit against the Company, also in the Northern District of California. On March 16, 2017, the New York case was voluntarily transferred and consolidated with the two California cases in the Northern District of California for all pre-trial purposes. Rulings by both the Court and the United States Patent Office in the Company\u2019s favor have invalidated the majority of [24]7 patents that were asserted in the patent cases. Trial for the Company\u2019s intellectual property and other claims asserted against [24]7 is set for May 24, 2021. Trial for [24]7\u2019s patent infringement claims has been vacated, to be reset after the trial on the Company's claims. The Company believes the claims filed by [24]7 are entirely without merit and intends to defend them vigorously.\nThe Company routinely assesses all of its litigation and threatened litigation as to the probability of ultimately incurring a liability, and records its best estimate of the ultimate loss in situations where the Company assesses the likelihood of loss as probable.\nFrom time to time, the Company is involved in or subject to legal, administrative and regulatory proceedings, claims, demands and investigations arising in the ordinary course of business, including direct claims brought by or against the Company with respect to intellectual property, contracts, employment and other matters, as well as claims brought against the Company\u2019s customers for whom the Company has a contractual indemnification obligation. The Company accrues for a liability when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether a loss is reasonably estimable. In addition, in the event the Company determines that a loss is not probable, but is reasonably possible, and it becomes possible to develop what the Company believes to be a reasonable range of possible loss, then the Company will include disclosure related to such matter as appropriate and in compliance with ASC 450. The accruals or estimates, if any, resulting from the foregoing analysis, are reviewed at least quarterly and adjusted to reflect the impact of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel and other information and events pertaining to a particular matter. To the extent there is a reasonable possibility that the losses could exceed the amounts already accrued, the Company will, as applicable, adjust the accrual in the period the determination is made, disclose an estimate of the additional loss or range of loss, indicate\nLIVEPERSON, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n13. Legal Matters - (Continued)\nthat the estimate is immaterial with respect to its financial statements as a whole or, if the amount of such adjustment cannot be reasonably estimated, disclose that an estimate cannot be made.\nFrom time to time, third parties assert claims against the Company regarding intellectual property rights, privacy issues and other matters arising in the ordinary course of business. Although the Company cannot be certain of the outcome of any litigation or the disposition of any claims, nor the amount of damages and exposure, if any, that the Company could incur, the Company currently believes that the final disposition of all existing matters will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. In addition, in the ordinary course of business, the Company is also subject to periodic threats of lawsuits, investigations and claims. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on the Company because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources and other factors.\nLIVEPERSON, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n14.Restructuring Costs\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company went through a re-evaluation of its real estate needs. In connection with this re-evaluation, and the success the Company has had working remotely, it was decided in July 2020 that the Company would significantly reduce the real estate space it leases. This decision resulted in the significant reduction of the real estate space leased by the Company and the removal of the associated ROU assets. Furthermore, this resulted in various one-time expenses in connection with the abandonment of the majority of the Company's leased facilities. The lease restructuring costs noted below are a result of this transition to an employee-centric workforce model that does not rely on traditional offices.\nOn top of the lease restructuring costs, the Company went through a further restructuring related to costs associated with re-prioritizing and reallocating resources to focus on areas showing high growth potential.\nThe expenses associated with these restructuring events were approximately $29.4 million, $2.0 million, and $4.5 million during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively, and is classified in the consolidated statements of operations as restructuring costs. The restructuring liability was approximately $4.7 million and $0.3 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and is classified as accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.\nThe following table presents the detail of the liability for the Company\u2019s restructuring charges for the periods presented (amounts in thousands):\nDecember 31, 2020 December 31, 2019\nBalance, Beginning of the year $ 314 $ 977\nLease restructuring costs 5,034 -\nSeverance and other associated costs 5,090 2,043\nCash payments (5,706) (2,706)\nBalance, End of year $ 4,732 $ 314\nThe following table presents the detail of expenses for the Company\u2019s restructuring charges for the periods presented (amounts in thousands):\nDecember 31, 2020 December 31, 2019 December 31, 2018\nLease restructuring costs:\nROU assets write down $ 13,938 $ - $ -\nAbandonment of property and equipment 5,147 - -\nOther lease restructuring costs 5,245 - -\nTotal Lease restructuring costs $ 24,330 $ - $ -\nSeverance and other associated costs $ 5,090 $ 2,043 $ 4,468\nTotal restructuring costs $ 29,420 $ 2,043 $ 4,468",

Controls and Procedures\nManagement\u2019s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nOur management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as that term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act. Our internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and Board of Directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements. Our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020 based on the framework established in \u201cInternal Control - Integrated Framework (2013),\u201d issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on its evaluation, our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that as of December 31, 2020, our internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria.\nThe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020 has been audited by BDO USA, LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm. Their attestation report is included herein.\nLimitations of the Effectiveness of Internal Control\nA control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can only provide reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the internal control system are met. Because of the inherent limitations of any internal control system, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues, if any, have been detected.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2020 identified in connection with the evaluation thereof by our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our \u201cdisclosure controls and procedures,\u201d as that term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act, as of December 31, 2020. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2020 to ensure that the information we are required to disclose in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s rules and forms, and to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Board of Directors and Stockholders\nLivePerson, Inc.\nNew York, New York\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited LivePerson, Inc.\u2019s (the \u201cCompany\u2019s\u201d) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the \u201cCOSO criteria\u201d). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on the COSO criteria.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (\u201cPCAOB\u201d), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, stockholders\u2019 equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes and our report dated March 8, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company\u2019s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Item 9A, Management\u2019s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit of internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ BDO USA, LLP\nNew York, New York\nMarch 8, 2021",
