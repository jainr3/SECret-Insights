    "item_1": "ITEM 1 - BUSINESS\nGENERAL\nNetSol Technologies, Inc. (Nasdaq CM: NTWK) is a worldwide provider of IT and enterprise software solutions to the global finance and leasing industry. We believe that our solutions constitute mission critical applications for clients, as they encapsulate end-to-end business processes, facilitating faster processing and increased transactions.\nNETSOL\u2019s primary sources of revenues have been licensing, subscriptions, modification, enhancement and support of its suite of financial applications, under the brand name NFS Ascent\u00ae for leading businesses in the global finance and leasing space. With constant innovation being a major part of NETSOL\u2019s DNA, we have enabled NFS Ascent\u00ae deployment on the cloud with several implementations already live and some underway. This shift to the cloud will enable NETSOL\u2019s new customers to opt for a subscription-based pricing model rather than the traditional licensing model.\nNETSOL\u2019s clients include blue chip organizations, Dow-Jones 30 Industrials, Fortune 500 manufacturers, financial institutions, global vehicle manufacturers and enterprise technology providers, all of which are serviced by NETSOL\u2019s strategically placed support and delivery locations around the globe.\nFounded in 1997, NETSOL is headquartered in Calabasas, California. While the Company follows a global strategy for sales and delivery of its portfolio of solutions and services, it continues to maintain regional offices in the following locations:\n\u25cf North America\nLos Angeles Area\n\u25cf Europe\nLondon Metropolitan Area, Horsham\n\u25cf Asia Pacific\nLahore, Karachi, Bangkok, Beijing, Shanghai, Jakarta and Sydney\nOUR BUSINESS\nCompany Business Model\nNETSOL believes that our strong technology solutions offer our customers a return on their investment and allows us to thrive in a hyper competitive and mature global marketplace. Our solutions are bolstered by our people. NETSOL believes that people are the drivers of success; therefore, we invest heavily in our hiring, training and retention of top-notch staff to ensure not only successful selling, but also the ongoing satisfaction of our clients. Taken together, this \u201cselling and attentive servicing\u201d approach creates a distinctive advantage for NETSOL and a unique value for its customers. NETSOL continues to underpin its proven and effective business model which is a combination of careful cost arbitrage, subject matter expertise, domain experience, scalability and proximity with its global and regional customers.\nNiche Market Focus\nBy specializing in leasing and financing solutions, we have gained a strong foothold in several global locations and a market leading position in the captive auto-finance segment. NETSOL has a significantly growing presence in the general asset finance space, including equipment and the big ticket financing industry together with startups and banks.\nSubject Matter Expertise\nOur dual expertise in enterprise technology implementation and financial application development has helped us emerge as a global player in the finance and leasing industry and secure a broad footprint across the major markets of North America, Asia Pacific and Europe. The Asia Pacific region has particularly benefitted from the organic growth in the fast-developing leasing automation industry, which is still nascent per Western standards.\nDomain Experience\nNETSOL has a strong presence in the captive auto-finance domain. With a collective experience of over two decades in Asia Pacific and Europe and of nearly four decades in North America, NETSOL is one of the few players in this niche industry with a global presence.\nProximity with Global and Regional Customers\nWe have offices across the world, located strategically to maintain close contact and proximity with our customers in various key markets. This has not only helped us in strengthening our customer relationships but also in building a deeper understanding of local market dynamics. Simultaneously, we are able to extend services and even support development through a combination of onsite and off-site resources. This approach has allowed us to offer blended rates to our customers by employing a unique and cost-effective global development model.\nWhile our business model is built around the development, implementation and maintenance of our suite of financial applications, we have employed the same facilities and competencies to extend our offerings into related segments, including but not limited to:\n\u25cf IT consulting and services\n\u25cf Business intelligence\n\u25cf Outsourcing services and software process improvement consulting\n\u25cf Maintenance and support of existing systems\n\u25cf Project management\n\u25cf Technology/start-up incubation\n\u25cf White label digital retailing for auto-captives\n\u25cf 3D mapping\nOur global operation is broken down into three regions: North America, Europe and Asia Pacific. All of the subsidiaries are seamlessly integrated to function effectively with global delivery capabilities, cross selling to multinational asset finance companies, leveraging a centralized marketing and pre-sales organization and, a network of employees connected across the globe to support local and global customers and partners.\nOUR SOLUTIONS\nNFS Ascent\u00ae\nCovering the complete finance and leasing cycle starting from quotation origination through end of contract transactions, NFS Ascent\u00ae has been designed and developed for a highly flexible setting and is capable of dealing with multinational, multi-company, multi-asset, multi-lingual, multi-distributor and multi-manufacturer environments. The solution fully automates the entire financing/leasing cycle for companies of any size, including those with multi-billion-dollar portfolios. NFS Ascent\u00ae empowers financial institutions to effectively manage their complex lending and leasing portfolios, enabling them to thrive in hyper-competitive global markets.\nNFS Ascent\u00ae is built on cutting-edge, modern technology that enables auto, equipment and big-ticket finance companies, alongside banks, to run their retail and wholesale finance business with ease. With comprehensive domain coverage and powerful configuration engines, it is architected to empower finance and leasing companies with a platform that supports their growth in terms of business volume and transactions.\nNETSOL\u2019s next generation platform offers a technologically advanced solution for the asset finance and leasing industry. NFS Ascent\u2019s\u00ae architecture and user interfaces were designed based on NETSOL\u2019s collective experience with blue chip organizations and global Fortune 500 companies over the past 40 years combined with modern UX design concepts. The platform\u2019s framework allows auto captive and asset finance companies to rapidly transform legacy driven technology into a state-of-the-art IT and business process environment.\nAt the core of the NFS Ascent\u00ae platform is a lease accounting and contract processing engine, which allows for an array of interest calculation methods, as well as robust accounting of multi-billion-dollar lease portfolios in compliance with various regulatory standards.

The loose coupling between various modules and layers reduces the risk of regression in other parts of the system as a result of changes made in one part of the system and follows proven and accepted SOA principles.\n\u25cf Improvement in talent acquisition and retention:\n\u25cc Because NFS Ascent\u00ae has been developed using the latest technologies and tools available in the market, it is helping us in attracting and retaining workforce equipped with the skills required to match our vision to strive for constant innovation.\n\u25cf Amplified customer satisfaction:\n\u25cc NFS Ascent\u00ae and NFS Digital empower not only the finance company and dealerships, but the end customer as well with self-service digital tools allowing a seamless customer experience throughout the customer journey from origination till contract maturity.\nNFS ASCENT\u00ae CONSTITUENT APPLICATIONS\nOmni Point of Sale (Omni POS)\nA highly agile, easy-to-use, web-based application - also accessible through mobile devices - Ascent\u2019s Omni POS system delivers an intuitive user experience, with features that enable rapid data capture.

The implementation process may also include related software services such as configuration, data migration, training, gaps development and any other additional third-party interfaces. Even after implementation, customers seek enhancements and additions to improve their business processes. We charge these efforts in a man-day rate.\nPost implementation, our consultants may remain at the client site to assist the customer in smooth operations. After this phase, the regular maintenance and support services phase for the implemented software begins. In addition to the daily rate paid by the customer for each consultant, the customer also pays for all transportation-related expenses, boarding of the consultants, and a living allowance. Our involvement in all the above steps is priced to bring value to our customers and increase our profitability.\nCloud-enabled solutions are offered via seamless and rapid deployments. The swift speed of implementations for our cloud-ready products enables businesses to be more responsive and attain a competitive advantage.\nPRICING AND REVENUE STREAMS\nThe company\u2019s revenue streams are the outcome of the following four main areas:\n\u25cf Product licensing\n\u25cf Subscription-based pricing\n\u25cf Implementation and customization-related services\n\u25cf Post contract support-related services\nLicense fees can range to a multi-million-dollar fee for single or multiple module implementations. License revenue is realized with traditional, non-SaaS-based agreements, whereas SaaS-based agreements do not contain license fees and are offered via flexible, value-driven, subscription-based pricing. There are various attributes which determine the level of complexity, a few of which are: number of contracts; size of the portfolio; business strategy of the customer; internal business processes followed by the customer; number of business users; amount of customization required; complexity of data migration and branch network of the customer.\nWe recognize revenue from license contracts when the software has been delivered to the customer. Implementation-related services, including configuration, data migration and third-party interfaces are recognized as the services are performed. Post customer support services are then provided on a continued basis. The annual support fee, which typically is an agreed upon percentage of overall monetary value of the license, then becomes an ongoing revenue stream realized on a yearly basis. Revenue from software services includes fixed price and time and materials-based contracts and is recognized as the services are performed.\nAdditionally, in order to avoid lumpiness in our revenues and to ensure a predictable revenue base over coming years, the business has shifted to a new pricing strategy whereby the business is now offering its cloud-ready products at SaaS/subscription-based pricing models. Rapid deployments coupled with affordable prices/payment schedules is expected to lead the business towards volume-based selling. Moreover, this value-driven pricing plan is intended to decrease the initial buy-in cost for new customers by eliminating heavy license fees and provides an alternative to current customers seeking lower software usage and maintenance costs.\nALLIANCES\nDaimler South East Asia Pte. Ltd. (\u201cDSEA\u201d), (through the regional office Daimler Financial Services (\u201cDFS\u201d) Africa Asia Pacific), has established a \u201cCentre of Competence\u201d (\u201cCoC\u201d) in Singapore to facilitate the regional companies in product related matters. The DSEA CoC is powered by highly qualified technical and business personnel. In conjunction with our Asia Pacific region, the CoC supports DFS companies in twelve different countries in Asia and Africa and this list can increase as more DFS companies from other countries opt for NFS Ascent\u00ae. In July 2004, the company entered into a Frame Agreement with DFS for the Asia Pacific and Africa region. This agreement was renewed in 2008, 2010, 2013 and most recently in January 2016. The agreement serves as a guideline for managing the business relationship with DFS and the use of licensed products of the company by DFS and its affiliated companies.\nWe have strategic partnerships with Microsoft and CGI pertaining to cloud-hosting activities for our cloud-based products. NETSOL hosts its cloud version of Ascent, NFS Ascent\u00ae deployed on the cloud and LeasePak Cloud - SaaS in the high performance and cost-effective Microsoft Azure cloud environment. A quick start implementation program combined with hassle-free Microsoft Azure\u2122 cloud connectivity ensures new clients see a time-to-value faster than ever before.\nNETSOL and CGI agreed to promote each other for their respective products and services amongst their respective existing customers across various regions. We also utilize CGI for managed services and cloud hosting-related activities for our engagements with their customers in Europe particularly.\nTECHNICAL AFFILIATIONS\nWe are a Microsoft Certified Silver Partner and an Oracle Certified Partner.\nMARKETING AND SELLING\nWe continue our optimism that we will experience ever increasing opportunities for our product and services offerings in 2021 and beyond. The objective of our marketing program is to create and sustain preference and loyalty for NETSOL. Marketing is performed at the corporate and business unit levels. The corporate marketing department has overall responsibility for communications, advertising, public relations and management of all digital owned and paid mediums including website, social media channels and collaboration with industry partners. In addition, corporate marketing oversees central marketing and communications programs for use by each of the business units.\nOur dedicated marketing personnel, within the regions, undertake a variety of marketing activities, including sponsoring focused client events to demonstrate our skills and products and participating in targeted conferences, webinars and holding private briefings with individual companies. We believe that the industry focus of our sales professionals and our business unit marketing personnel enhances their knowledge and expertise in these industries and will generate additional client engagements.\nGROWTH PROSPECTS FOR NFS ASCENT\u00ae\nGrowth prospects for NFS Ascent\u00ae are linked to the constant innovation in the product and its growing customer base across different geographic and product markets. NETSOL is eyeing key international markets for growth in sales. Its sales strategy not only focuses on expansion into new geographic markets, including the Americas, Europe, and further penetration of our leading position in Asia Pacific, but also within existing markets into new verticals with targeting of Tier 2 and Tier 3 prospects as well.\nGrowth in North America is expected to come from the potential market for replacement of legacy systems as well as acquisition of new customers. NFS Ascent\u00ae is aimed at providing a highly flexible and robust solution based on the latest technology and advanced architecture for North American customers looking to replace their legacy systems. We believe that NFS Ascent\u00ae can provide substantial competitive disruption to the market\u2019s lagging technology provided by incumbent vendors. The existing customer base may also represent latent demand for increased service and support revenues by offering business process optimization, customization and upgrade services. With a market ready product with successful implementation, the prospects for NFS Ascent\u00ae in the region are positive.\nFurther traction in Europe will come from NFS Ascent\u00ae deployed on the cloud, which will continue to allow the Europe division to support not only larger organizations, but also small and medium sized organizations including startups.\nGrowth in NETSOL\u2019s traditionally strong base in Asia Pacific is expected through diversification across market segments to include new customers in related banking and commercial lending areas. At the same time, the existing customer base is tapped for increased service and support revenues by offering enhanced features and new solutions to emerging customer needs. In addition, there is a potential for NFS Ascent\u00ae in Asia Pacific in the form of existing customers who are looking for replacement of their current system.\nIn China, NETSOL is a leader in the leasing and finance enterprise solution domain. With this position, NETSOL continues to enjoy demand for the current NFS\u2122 solution, as well as NFS Ascent\u00ae. NETSOL will continue strengthening its position within existing multinational auto manufacturers, as well as local Chinese captive finance and leasing companies.\nTHE MARKETS\nWe provide our services primarily to clients in global commercial industries. In the global commercial area, our service offerings are marketed to clients in a wide array of industries including, automotive, software, banks, higher education and financial services.\nThe Asian continent, including Australia and New Zealand, from the perspective of marketing, are targeted by the Asia Pacific Region from its Bangkok, Beijing, Jakarta, Lahore, Shanghai and Sydney facilities. The marketing for our core offerings in the Americas and Europe is carried out from our Los Angeles Area and London Metropolitan Area offices, respectively.\nPEOPLE AND CULTURE\nWe believe we have developed a strong corporate culture that is critical to our success. Our key values are delivering world-class quality software, client-focused timely delivery, leadership, long-term relationships, creativity, openness and transparency and professional growth. The services provided by NETSOL require proficiency in many fields, such as software engineering, project management, business analysis, technical writing, sales and marketing, and communication and presentation skills.\nDue to the growing demand for our core offerings and IT services, retention of technical and management personnel is essential. Our employee turnover was under 20% in 2021 with a goal to maintain the turnover level under 20% during the 2022 fiscal year and onwards. In addition, we are committed to improving key performance indicators such as efficiency, productivity and revenue per employee.\nTo encourage all employees to build on our core values, we reward teamwork and promote individuals that demonstrate these values. We believe that our growth and success are attributable in large part to the high caliber of our employees and our commitment to maintain the values on which our success has been based. We support gender diversity on a global basis. We are an equal opportunity employer with the largest concentration of female employees in Lahore, Pakistan and our U.S. headquarters.\nNETSOL believes it should give back to the community and employees as much as possible. Certain subsidiaries of ours are located in regions where basic services are not readily available. Where possible, NETSOL acts to not only improve the quality of life of its employees, but also the standard of living in these regions. Examples of such programs are as follows:\n\u25cf Humanitarian Relief: We are all aware of the devastation that can be wrought by natural disasters. We have historically supported earthquake and flood relief where the need is the greatest.\n\u25cf Literacy Program: Launched to educate our illiterate employees, the main objective of this program is to enable these employees to acquire basic reading, writing and arithmetic skills.\n\u25cf Higher Education and Science and Research Institutions: In order to support higher education in Pakistan, we have contributed endowments to NUST, Forman Christian College, and a few other universities who are focused on science and engineering.\n\u25cf Noble Cause Fund: A noble cause fund has been established to meet medical and education expenses of the children of the lower paid employees. Our employees voluntarily contribute a fixed amount every month to the fund and NETSOL matches the employee subscriptions with an equivalent contribution amount. A portion of this fund is also utilized to support social needs of certain institutions and individuals, outside of NETSOL.\n\u25cf Day Care Facility: NETSOL\u2019s human resources are its key assets and thus we take numerous steps to ensure the provision of basic comforts to our employees. In Pakistan, the provision of outside pre-school childcare is a rarity. With this in mind, a children\u2019s day care facility has been created near NETSOL\u2019s offices providing employees with peace of mind knowing their children are nearby and being taken care of by qualified staff in a child friendly facility. Due to COVID-19 restrictions, the facility is temporarily closed.\n\u25cf Preventative Health Care Program: In addition to the comprehensive out-patient and in-patient medical benefits, preventive health care has also been introduced. This phased program focuses on vaccination of our employees against such diseases as Hepatitis - A/B, Tetanus, Typhoid and Flu on a routine basis.\nThere is significant competition for employees with the skills required to perform the services we offer. We run an elaborate training program for different cadres of employees to cover technical skills and business domain knowledge, as well as communication, management and leadership skills. We believe that we have been successful in our efforts to attract and retain the highest level of talent available, in part because of the emphasis on core values, training and professional growth. We intend to continue to recruit, hire and promote employees who share our vision.\nAs of June 30, 2021, we had approximately 1,447 employees; comprised of 77% technical staff and 23% non-IT personnel.\nCOMPETITION\nNeither a single company, nor a small number of companies, dominate the IT market in the space in which we compete. A substantial number of companies offer services that overlap and are competitive with those offered by NETSOL. Some of these are large computer manufacturers and computer consulting firms that have greater financial resources than NETSOL and, in some cases, may have greater capacity to perform services similar to those provided by NETSOL.\nWe compete chiefly against leading suppliers of IT solutions to the global asset finance and leasing industry, including names such as White Clarke Group, Alfa, Cassiopae, LineData, FIS, International Decision Systems (IDS) and Data Scan.\nIn the IT-based business services areas, we compete with both smaller local firms and many global IT services providers, including names such as Wipro, InfoSys, Satyam Infoway, HCL and TCS (Tata Consulting).\nCUSTOMERS\nNETSOL\u2019s solutions and services cater to a broad spectrum of finance and leasing businesses, from automotive captive finance companies to equipment finance and leasing companies to large regional banks.\nNETSOL\u2019s customers include world renowned auto manufacturers through their finance arms. NETSOL is a strategic business partner for Daimler and BMW (which consists of a group of many companies in different countries), which accounts for approximately 21.0% and 13.0%, respectively, of our revenue for our fiscal year ended June 30, 2021. Other globally renowned auto captives that are customers of the company include Toyota, Nissan, Ford, and FIAT.\nOther customers of the company include equipment finance and leasing companies and banks worldwide such as GAC Sofinco, Paccar, Mololease, SCI, and BMO Harris, etc.\nGLOBAL OPERATIONS AND GEOGRAPHIC DATA\nNETSOL divides its operations into three regions: the Americas, Europe and Asia Pacific. The regions consist of individual subsidiaries which operate as autonomous companies and are strategically managed on a regional basis.\nThe Americas\nMr. Peter Minshall joined NetSol Technologies Americas, Inc. (NTA) as Executive Vice President in August 2020 and is responsible for the entire portion of NTA\u2019s business operations. He brings over three decades of international experience in the financial services industry holding various senior leadership roles with Daimler Financial Services.

OtozTM Co-founder and Chief Product Officer, Murad Baig is based out of our London office.\nEurope\nMr. Asad Ghauri is the President of Asia Pacific (APAC) and Group Managing Director of Europe. Mr. Ghauri has a strong management team in the U.K. comprised of Chris Mobley, Chris Tobey and Johannes Riedl.\nDue to the demand for our premier solution NFS Ascent\u2019s\u00ae Wholesale Platform in Europe, we appointed Chris Mobley as Head of NFS Ascent\u00ae Wholesale Operations in Europe. Mobley brings over two decades of industry experience to NETSOL with an accomplished background and domain-specific knowledge and expertise within the wholesale finance space.\nAt the starting of the previous financial year, NETSOL acquired the remaining stake in Virtual Lease Services (VLS) rebranded as Banking Works. Previously limited to being a UK-based portfolio and risk management servicing partner for business and consumer finance providers, Banking Works will now focus on supporting financial services businesses to achieve their own transformation ambitions. By acquiring the remaining stake, NETSOL became the outright owner of the organization. Banking Works recently announced the appointment of Mark Cawood, an industry veteran, as the company\u2019s new Managing Director. Mark Cawood will pick up the baton passed by Louise Ikonomides, who left Banking Works after over 20 years to pursue new ventures. While Mr. Cawood is going through the Financial Conduct Authority\u2019s approval process, Diane Roberts, Finance Director, will serve as the interim Managing Director.\nAsia Pacific Region\nNetSol Technologies, Ltd., (\u201cNetSol PK\u201d) a majority owned subsidiary of the parent company is located in Lahore, Pakistan and is headed by Mr. Salim Ghauri as its CEO. Mr. Ghauri is a Co-founder of NetSol PK and has been with the company since 1996. NetSol is the \u201cCenter of Excellence\u201d and a state-of-the-art facility for programming, R&D, global implementations and 24-hour support to our customers worldwide.\nNetSol Technologies (Beijing) Co. Ltd. (\u201cNetSol Beijing\u201d) is headed by Amanda Li as President.

Mr. Ghauri has been with NETSOL since 2000 and has over 20 years of experience in business and IT.\nThe Asia Pacific region including Australia/New Zealand and the Middle East, is supported and clients are serviced from the APAC region offices located in Sydney, Beijing, Shanghai, Bangkok, Indonesia, Lahore and Karachi. While Lahore, Pakistan continues to be a nucleus of NETSOL\u2019s delivery and research and development, Bangkok\u2019s expanded sales operation and client relations facility has grown into a back-up to the Lahore facility.

    "item_7": "ITEM 7 - MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion is intended to assist in understanding our financial position and results of operations for the year ended June 30, 2021. It should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nA few of our highlights for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021 were:\n\u25cf SCI Lease Corp, our first North American Ascent\u2122 customer, successfully went live with NFS Ascent\u00ae.\n\u25cf Peter Minshall was appointed Executive Vice President for NetSol Technologies Americas.\n\u25cf A leading captive finance company of a notable U.S. based auto manufacturer went live with LeasePak cloud.\n\u25cf NETSOL\u2019s U.S. based mobility startup, OtozTM, launched its digital automotive retail platform for BMW Group Financial Services in the U.S. for its key brand Mini Anywhere. This represents NETSOL\u2019s first retail platform solution in the North American market for Mini dealerships.\n\u25cf Daimler Financial Services went live with NFS Ascent\u00ae Retail Platform on a single code, single instance and involving multi-tenancy setup in Singapore. Daimler also went live with our NSF Ascent\u00ae Retail Platform in Thailand and began the implementation process of our NSF Ascent\u00ae Retail Platform in New Zealand and Australia.\n\u25cf We entered into an agreement with an existing tier one finance company in China for them to upgrade to our NFS Ascent\u00ae Retail and Wholesale platforms. The contract is expected to generate approximately $9,000,000 during the contract term.\n\u25cf A Captive auto finance company of a leading German Auto manufacturer based in China went successfully live with our NFS Ascent\u00ae Retail Platform.\n\u25cf NETSOL and WRLD3D introduced NXT - a smart workplace platform to support companies to return to work safely.\n\u25cf A rapidly growing U.K. bank serving small and medium-sized enterprises has successfully gone live with the NFS Ascent\u00ae Retail Platform. This is our first go live of an NFS Ascent\u00ae Retail client in the U.K.\n\u25cf We entered into an agreement with a renowned financial services company in the U.S. to implement LeasePak, one of our legacy solutions. The contract is expected to generate approximately $1,000,000 over the life of the contract.\n\u25cf The leasing division of a mid-sized regional bank in the U.S. went live with the SaaS version of our LeasePak solution.\n\u25cf We started the NFS Ascent\u00ae Retail implementation process for the subsidiary of a leading German Auto Manufacturer based in South Korea.\n\u25cf We signed an agreement with Motorcycle Group \u201cMotolease\u201d to deploy our cloud-based version of our NFS Ascent\u00ae platform. This agreement is the first official sale for NFS Ascent\u00ae in the U.S. market.\n\u25cf We generated approximately $2,100,000 of license revenue with the renewal of our NFS CAP and CMS legacy solutions with an existing customer in Thailand.\n\u25cf We generated approximately $1,400,000 of license revenue from an existing customer due to the increase in contracts being serviced on their system.\n\u25cf We effectively executed the share buyback plan with the purchase of 669,018 shares during the 2021 Fiscal Year.\nMarketing and Business Development Activities\nManagement has developed a growth strategy aimed at increasing competitiveness, enhancing global delivery capabilities and increasing financial strength to become a leading global IT institution in the leasing and finance space.\nThe growth strategy contemplates the following enhanced activities and initiatives to accomplish these goals:\n\u25cf Build strong C-level executive professional teams in each key location to execute our long-term strategy.\n\u25cf Develop, groom and retain the next tier level management for leadership to navigate long term growth.\n\u25cf Upgraded Bangkok and Beijing offices to support the growing and existing client relationships and new client acquisitions in the region.\n\u25cf Strengthen the NETSOL brand in the Americas and Europe and further penetrate the APAC markets such as China, Thailand, Indonesia, Japan, Australia and New Zealand.\n\u25cf Maintain the quality of our delivery, after delivery support, and client relationships.\n\u25cf Further penetration of NFS Ascent\u00ae into the leasing and financing sectors in China, APAC, Europe and North America by focusing on multi-national auto captive Fortune 500 companies.\n\u25cf Pursue a well thought out strategy to diversify into complimentary verticals by way of organic expansion, partnerships and synergistic M&A.\n\u25cf Continue to implement new tools, systems and processes, such as JIRA, and the Agile framework to further enhance productivity, efficiencies and operating margins.\n\u25cf Offer a cloud enabled NFS Ascent\u00ae at subscription-based pricing models to generate additional interest from prospects.\n\u25cf Continue investing in OtozTM and our innovation lab to generate new verticals for the business.\nGrowth Prospects for NFS Ascent\u00ae\nGrowth prospects for NFS Ascent\u00ae are linked to the maturing of the product portfolio and its growing customer base across different geographic and product markets. We are eyeing key international markets for growth in sales. Our sales strategy now carefully balances expansion into new geographic markets, including the Americas, Europe, and further penetration of our leading position in Asia Pacific.\nGrowth in North America is expected to come from the potential market for replacement of legacy systems. NFS Ascent\u00ae is aimed at providing a highly flexible and robust solution based on the latest technology and advanced architecture for the North American customers looking to replace their legacy systems. We believe that NFS Ascent\u00ae can provide substantial competitive disruption to the market\u2019s lagging technology provided by incumbent vendors. The existing customer base may also represent latent demand for increased service and maintenance revenues by offering business process optimization, customization and upgrade services.\nGrowth in Europe will come from the introduction of NFS Ascent\u00ae, which will allow NTE to support larger organizations than those typically selecting the existing LeaseSoft product set, and opens the door for European expansion. This is designed to attract larger license and professional services revenues across a wider geography. In addition, leveraging the core strengths of NFS Ascent\u00ae will increasingly provide opportunities in the automotive sector where NTE is currently underrepresented.\nGrowth in our traditionally strong base in Asia Pacific is expected through diversification across market segments to include new customers in related banking and commercial lending areas. At the same time, the existing customer base is tapped for increased service and maintenance revenues by offering enhanced features and new solutions to emerging customer needs. In addition, there is a potential for NFS Ascent\u00ae in Asia Pacific in the form of existing customers who are looking for replacement of their current system.\nIn China, we are a de facto leader in the leasing and finance enterprise solution domain. With this position, we continue to enjoy demand for the current NFS\u2122 solution, as well as NFS Ascent\u00ae. We will continue strengthening our position within existing multinational auto manufacturers, as well as, local Chinese captive finance and leasing companies. The Chinese auto leasing market is young and low on consumer penetration in comparison with the giant U.S. market.\nIn Thailand, we established a sales headquarters, client service center, as well as a headquarters for OtozTM. The NetSol Thai operation is the hub for our global markets and directly supports all APAC markets including China, Indonesia and Australia. Our operation in Bangkok serves a very robust and growing market for leasing companies and regional banks.\nMATERIAL TRENDS AFFECTING NETSOL\nManagement has identified the following material trends affecting NetSol.\nPositive trends:\n\u25cf NFS Ascent\u00ae SaaS offering is gaining traction in mid-size auto captives in North American and European markets.\n\u25cf Mobility and digital transformation is the new norm showing acceleration in every sector particularly in auto and banking.\n\u25cf On Cloud demand for our solution is on the rise.\n\u25cf COVID-19 has created new dynamics for businesses and corporations with employees and executives working from home. Essentially, the decreased office and maintenance costs, as well as the sharply reduced travel expenses, should positively impact our financials.\n\u25cf COVID-19 is creating new opportunities for our R&D teams to expand and monetize mobile and digital solutions in our space and complementary sectors.\n\u25cf In developing markets, new interests are emerging from existing clients for upgrades and mobility platforms.\n\u25cf Growing opportunities and dynamics of shared car ownership either through ride hailing and car sharing encouraging our innovation and development tools.\n\u25cf OtozTM platform is showing positive trajectory of interest from existing and new auto leasing and Tier 1 companies in all of our markets, including China, the US and Europe.\n\u25cf Improved stability in US and Pakistan relationship boosting confidence and trade relations.\n\u25cf The China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) investment, initiated by China, has exceeded $62 billion investment from the originally planned $46 billion on Pakistan energy and infrastructure sectors.\n\u25cf China\u2019s auto sector remains strong as our customers are constantly demanding \u2018Change Requests\u2019 or additional services and reflects resilience.\nNegative trends:\n\u25cf The degree to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our future business globally, results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments, which are uncertain, including but not limited to the duration, spread and severity of the pandemic, the availability, adoption and efficacy of vaccines, government responses and other actions to mitigate the spread of and to treat COVID-19, and when and to what extent normal business, economic and social activity and conditions resume.\n\u25cf We are unable to predict the extent to which the pandemic impacts our customers and other partners and their financial conditions, but adverse effects on these parties could also adversely affect us.\n\u25cf Most OEMs and auto sectors are experiencing a major slowdown due to lockdowns and health concerns.\n\u25cf The C-level decision making to acquire new systems or even upgrade will be elongated due to uncertainty of the COVID-19 virus.\n\u25cf Due to travel restrictions caused by COVID-19, it is increasingly difficult to conduct face to face meetings for global clients and new prospects removing the personal connection essential to some decision making.\n\u25cf The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected live industry conferences and events, such as those held by the Equipment Leasing and Finance Association (ELFA), reducing leads and market exposure.\n\u25cf Working from the office poses its own risk of virus spread until it vanishes completely.\n\u25cf Political actions, including trade protection and national security policies of the U.S. and Chinese governments, such as tariffs or bans could in the future limit or prevent companies from transacting business with China and aggravate the global business environment.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nOur financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d). Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected by management\u2019s application of accounting policies. Critical accounting policies for us include revenue recognition and multiple element arrangements, intangible assets, software development costs, and goodwill.\nREVENUE RECOGNITION\nThe Company determines revenue recognition through the following steps:\n\u25cf Identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer;\n\u25cf Identification of the performance obligations in the contract;\n\u25cf Determination of the transaction price;\n\u25cf Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and\n\u25cf Recognition of revenue when, or as, the Company satisfies a performance obligation.\nThe Company records the amount of revenue and related costs by considering whether the entity is a principal (gross presentation) or an agent (net presentation) by evaluating the nature of its promise to the customer. Revenue is presented net of sales, value-added and other taxes collected from customers and remitted to government authorities.\nThe Company has two primary revenue streams: core revenue and non-core revenue.\nCore Revenue\nThe Company generates its core revenue from the following sources: (1) software licenses, (2) services, which include implementation and consulting services, and (3) subscription and support, which includes post contract support, of its enterprise software solutions for the lease and finance industry. The Company offers its software using the same underlying technology via two models: a traditional on-premises licensing model and a subscription model. The on-premises model involves the sale or license of software on a perpetual basis to customers who take possession of the software and install and maintain the software on their own hardware. Under the subscription delivery model, the Company provides access to its software on a hosted basis as a service and customers generally do not have the contractual right to take possession of the software.\nNon-Core Revenue\nThe Company generates its non-core revenue by providing business process outsourcing (\u201cBPO\u201d), other IT services and internet services.\nPerformance Obligations\nA performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer and is the unit of account under Topic 606. The transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied by transferring the promised good or service to the customer. The Company identifies and tracks the performance obligations at contract inception so that the Company can monitor and account for the performance obligations over the life of the contract.\nThe Company\u2019s contracts which contain multiple performance obligations generally consist of the initial purchase of subscription or licenses and a professional services engagement. License purchases generally have multiple performance obligations as customers purchase post contract support and services in addition to the licenses. The Company\u2019s single performance obligation arrangements are typically post contract support renewals, subscription renewals and services engagements.\nFor contracts with multiple performance obligations where the contracted price differs from the standalone selling price (\u201cSSP\u201d) for any distinct good or service, the Company may be required to allocate the contract\u2019s transaction price to each performance obligation using its best estimate for the SSP.\nSubscription\nSubscription revenue is recognized ratably over the initial subscription period committed to by the customer commencing when the product is made available to the customer. The initial subscription period is typically 12 to 60 months. The Company generally invoices its customers in advance in quarterly or annual installments and typical payment terms provide that customers make payment within 30 days of invoice.\nSoftware Licenses\nTransfer of control for software is considered to have occurred upon delivery of the product to the customer. The Company\u2019s typical payment terms tend to vary by region, but its standard payment terms are within 30 days of invoice.\nPost Contract Support\nRevenue from support services and product updates, referred to as subscription and support revenue, is recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance period, which in most instances is one year. Software license updates provide customers with rights to unspecified software product updates, maintenance releases and patches released during the term of the support period on a when-and-if available basis. The Company\u2019s customers purchase both product support and license updates when they acquire new software licenses. In addition, a majority of customers renew their support services contracts annually and typical payment terms provide that customers make payment within 30 days of invoice.\nProfessional Services\nRevenue from professional services is typically comprised of implementation, development, data migration, training or other consulting services. Consulting services are generally sold on a time-and-materials or fixed fee basis and can include services ranging from software installation to data conversion and building non-complex interfaces to allow the software to operate in integrated environments. The Company recognizes revenue for time-and-materials arrangements as the services are performed. In fixed fee arrangements, revenue is recognized as services are performed as measured by costs incurred to date, compared to total estimated costs to complete the services project. Management applies judgment when estimating project status and the costs necessary to complete the services projects. A number of internal and external factors can affect these estimates, including labor rates, utilization and efficiency variances and specification and testing requirement changes. Services are generally invoiced upon milestones in the contract or upon consumption of the hourly resources and payments are typically due 30 days after invoice.\nBPO and Internet Services\nRevenue from BPO services is recognized based on the stage of completion which is measured by reference to labor hours incurred to date as a percentage of total estimated labor hours for each contract. Internet services are invoiced either monthly, quarterly or half yearly in advance to the customers and revenue is recognized ratably overtime on a monthly basis.\nSignificant Judgments\nMore judgments and estimates are required under Topic 606 than were required under Topic 605. Due to the complexity of certain contracts, the actual revenue recognition treatment required under Topic 606 for the Company\u2019s arrangements may be dependent on contract-specific terms and may vary in some instances.\nJudgment is required to determine the SSP for each distinct performance obligation. The Company rarely licenses or sells products on a stand-alone basis, so the Company is required to estimate the range of SSPs for each performance obligation. In instances where SSP is not directly observable because the Company does not sell the license, product or service separately, the Company determines the SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. In making these judgments, the Company analyzes various factors, including its pricing methodology and consistency, size of the arrangement, length of term, customer demographics and overall market and economic conditions. Based on these results, the estimated SSP is set for each distinct product or service delivered to customers.\nThe most significant inputs involved in the Company\u2019s revenue recognition policies are: The (1) stand-alone selling prices of the Company\u2019s software license, and (2) the method of recognizing revenue for installation/customization, and other services.\nThe stand-alone selling price of the licenses was measured primarily through an analysis of pricing that management evaluated when quoting prices to customers. Although the Company has no history of selling its software separately from post contract support and other services, the Company does have historical experience with amending contracts with customers to provide additional modules of its software or providing those modules at an optional price. This information guides the Company in assessing the stand-alone selling price of the Company\u2019s software, since the Company can observe instances where a customer had a particular component of the Company\u2019s software that was essentially priced separate from other goods and services that the Company delivered to that customer.\nThe Company recognizes revenue from implementation and customization services using the percentage of estimated \u201cman-days\u201d that the work requires. The Company believes the level of effort to complete the services is best measured by the amount of time (measured as an employee working for one day on implementation/customization work) that is required to complete the implementation or customization work. The Company reviews its estimate of man-days required to complete implementation and customization services each reporting period.\nRevenue is recognized over time for the Company\u2019s subscription, post contract support and fixed fee professional services that are separate performance obligations. For the Company\u2019s professional services, revenue is recognized over time, generally using costs incurred or hours expended to measure progress. Judgment is required in estimating project status and the costs necessary to complete projects. A number of internal and external factors can affect these estimates, including labor rates, utilization, specification variances and testing requirement changes.\nIf a group of agreements are entered at or near the same time and so closely related that they are, in effect, part of a single arrangement, such agreements are deemed to be combined as one arrangement for revenue recognition purposes. The Company exercises significant judgment to evaluate the relevant facts and circumstances in determining whether agreements should be accounted for separately or as a single arrangement. The Company\u2019s judgments about whether a group of contracts comprise a single arrangement can affect the allocation of consideration to the distinct performance obligations, which could have an effect on results of operations for the periods involved.\nIf a contract includes variable consideration, the Company exercises judgment in estimating the amount of consideration to which the entity will be entitled in exchange for transferring the promised goods or services to a customer. When estimating variable consideration, the Company will consider all relevant facts and circumstances. Variable consideration will be estimated and included in the contract price only when it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of revenue recognized will not occur.\nContract Balances\nThe timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to customers and these timing differences result in receivables, contract assets (revenues in excess of billings), or contract liabilities (deferred revenue) on the Company\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company records revenues in excess of billings when the Company has transferred goods or services but does not yet have the right to consideration. The Company records deferred revenue when the Company has received or has the right to receive consideration but has not yet transferred goods or services to the customer.\nUnearned Revenue\nThe Company typically invoices its customers for subscription and support fees in advance on a quarterly or annual basis, with payment due at the start of the subscription or support term. Unpaid invoice amounts for non-cancellable license and services starting in future periods are included in accounts receivable and unearned revenue.\nPractical Expedients and Exemptions\nThere are several practical expedients and exemptions allowed under Topic 606 that impact timing of revenue recognition and the Company\u2019s disclosures. The Company has applied the following practical expedients:\n\u25cf The Company does not evaluate a contract for a significant financing component if payment is expected within one year or less from the transfer of the promised items to the customer.\n\u25cf The Company generally expenses sales commissions and sales agent fees when incurred when the amortization period would have been one year or less or the commissions are based on cashed received. These costs are recorded within sales and marketing expense in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.\n\u25cf The Company does not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for contracts for which the Company recognizes revenue at the amount to which it has the right to invoice for services performed (applies to time-and-material engagements).\nCosts to Obtain a Contract\nThe Company does not have a material amount of costs to obtain a contract capitalized at any balance sheet date. In general, we incur few direct incremental costs of obtaining new customer contracts. We rarely incur incremental costs to review or otherwise enter into contractual arrangements with customers. In addition, our sales personnel receive fees that we refer to as commissions, but that are based on more than simply signing up new customers. Our sales personnel are required to perform additional duties beyond new customer contract inception dates, including fulfillment duties and collections efforts.\nINTANGIBLE ASSETS\nIntangible assets consist of product licenses, renewals, enhancements, copyrights, trademarks, trade names, and customer lists. Intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over the estimated useful life and are evaluated for impairment at least on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. We assess recoverability by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through the undiscounted expected future cash flows. If the future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of these assets, we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets.\nSOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS\nCosts incurred to internally develop computer software products or to enhance an existing product are recorded as research and development costs and expensed when incurred until technological feasibility for the respective product is established. Thereafter, all software development costs are capitalized and reported at the lower of unamortized cost or net realizable value. Capitalization ceases when the product or enhancement is available for general release to customers.\nThe Company makes on-going evaluations of the recoverability of its capitalized software projects by comparing the amount capitalized for each product to the estimated net realizable value of the product. If such evaluations indicate that the unamortized software development costs exceed the net realizable value, the Company writes off the amount which the unamortized software development costs exceed net realizable value. Capitalized and purchased computer software development costs are being amortized ratably based on the projected revenue associated with the related software or on a straight-line basis.\nSTOCK-BASED COMPENSATION\nOur stock-based compensation expense is estimated at the grant date based on the award\u2019s fair value as calculated by the Black-Scholes-Merton (BSM) option pricing model and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period. The BSM model requires various highly judgmental assumptions including expected volatility and expected term. If any of the assumptions used in the BSM model changes significantly, stock-based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period. In addition, we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest. We estimate the forfeiture rate based on historical experience and our expectations regarding future pre-vesting termination behavior of employees. To the extent our actual forfeiture rate is different from our estimate; stock-based compensation expense is adjusted accordingly.\nGOODWILL\nGoodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired in a purchase business combination. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill may be impaired. In conducting its annual impairment test, the Company first reviews qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If factors indicate that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the Company performs a quantitative assessment and the fair value of the reporting unit is determined by analyzing the expected present value of future cash flows. If the carrying value of the reporting unit continues to exceed its fair value, the fair value of the reporting unit\u2019s goodwill is calculated and an impairment loss equal to the excess is recorded.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncement\nSee Note 2 \u201cSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements, including the expected dates of adoption.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nTHE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2021 COMPARED TO THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2020\nThe following table sets forth the items in our consolidated statement of operations for the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020 as a percentage of revenues.\nFor the Years\nEnded June 30,\n% %\nNet Revenues:\nLicense fees $ 6,249,924 11.4 % $ 3,260,891 5.8 %\nSubscription and support 22,173,745 40.4 % 20,254,917 35.9 %\nServices 26,448,171 48.2 % 32,555,690 57.8 %\nServices - related party 48,775 0.1 % 300,821 0.5 %\nTotal net revenues 54,920,615 100.0 % 56,372,319 100.0 %\nCost of revenues:\nSalaries and consultants 20,969,298 38.2 % 18,821,738 33.4 %\nTravel 663,403 1.2 % 4,181,742 7.4 %\nDepreciation and amortization 2,990,689 5.4 % 2,897,371 5.1 %\nOther 3,944,197 7.2 % 3,508,098 6.2 %\nTotal cost of revenues 28,567,587 52.0 % 29,408,949 52.2 %\nGross profit 26,353,028 48.0 % 26,963,370 47.8 %\nOperating expenses:\nSelling and marketing 6,555,004 11.9 % 6,450,663 11.4 %\nDepreciation and amortization 965,625 1.8 % 834,583 1.5 %\nGeneral and administrative 15,437,382 28.1 % 17,138,832 30.4 %\nResearch and development cost 674,168 1.2 % 1,468,954 2.6 %\nTotal operating expenses 23,632,179 43.0 % 25,893,032 45.9 %\nIncome from operations 2,720,849 5.0 % 1,070,338 1.9 %\nOther income and (expenses)\nGain (loss) on sale of assets (191,935 ) -0.3 % 23,103 0.0 %\nInterest expense (394,289 ) -0.7 % (346,856 ) -0.6 %\nInterest income 1,017,432 1.9 % 1,569,536 2.8 %\nGain (loss) on foreign currency exchange transactions (597,433 ) -1.1 % 398,610 0.7 %\nShare of net loss from equity investment (253,819 ) -0.5 % (605,864 ) -1.1 %\nOther income 987,444 1.8 % 224,224 0.4 %\nTotal other income (expenses) 567,400 1.0 % 1,262,753 2.2 %\nNet income before income taxes 3,288,249 6.0 % 2,333,091 4.1 %\nIncome tax provision (1,026,617 ) -1.9 % (1,141,068 ) -2.0 %\nNet income 2,261,632 4.1 % 1,192,023 2.1 %\nNon-controlling interest (483,375 ) -0.9 % (254,942 ) -0.5 %\nNet income attributable to NetSol $ 1,778,257 3.2 % $ 937,081 1.7 %\nA significant portion of our business is conducted in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We operate in several geographical regions as described in Note 21 \u201cSegment Information and Geographic Areas\u201d within the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Weakening of the value of the U.S. dollar compared to foreign currency exchange rates generally has the effect of increasing our revenues but also increasing our expenses denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Similarly, strengthening of the U.S. dollar compared to foreign currency exchange rates generally has the effect of reducing our revenues but also reducing our expenses denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We plan our business accordingly by deploying additional resources to areas of expansion, while continuing to monitor our overall expenditures given the economic uncertainties of our target markets. In order to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations, we compare the changes in results from one period to another period using constant currency. In order to calculate our constant currency results, we apply the current period results to the prior period foreign currency exchange rates. In the table below, we present the change based on actual results in reported currency and in constant currency.\nFavorable Favorable Total\n(Unfavorable) (Unfavorable) Favorable\nFor the Years Change in Change due (Unfavorable)\nEnded June 30, Constant to Currency Change as\n% % Currency Fluctuation Reported\nNet Revenues: $ 54,920,615 100.0 % $ 56,372,319 100.0 % $ (2,351,850 ) $ 900,146 $ (1,451,704 )\nCost of revenues: 28,567,587 52.0 % 29,408,949 52.2 % 1,039,764 (198,402 ) 841,362\nGross profit 26,353,028 48.0 % 26,963,370 47.8 % (1,312,086 ) 701,744 (610,342 )\nOperating expenses: 23,632,179 43.0 % 25,893,032 45.9 % 2,298,574 (37,721 ) 2,260,853\nIncome (loss) from operations $ 2,720,849 5.0 % $ 1,070,338 1.9 % $ 986,488 $ 664,023 $ 1,650,511\nNet revenues for the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020 by segment are as follows:\nRevenue % Revenue %\nNorth America $ 3,724,547 6.8 % $ 4,444,862 7.9 %\nEurope 11,283,499 20.5 % 11,914,071 21.1 %\nAsia-Pacific 39,912,569 72.7 % 40,013,386 71.0 %\nTotal $ 54,920,615 100.0 % $ 56,372,319 100.0 %\nRevenues\nLicense Fees\nLicense fees for the year ended June 30, 2021 were $6,249,924 compared to $3,260,891 for the year ended June 30, 2020 reflecting an increase of $2,989,033 with a change in constant currency of $2,633,782. The increase in license revenue for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021 compared to 2020 is primarily due to the increase in license revenue recognized for the GAC, TIL and BMW contracts to implement our NFS Ascent\u00ae Retail Platform. In the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, we recorded $2,400,000 of license revenue for the GAC NFS Ascent\u00ae contract, $2,100,000 for the TIL NFS Ascent\u00ae contract, and $1,400,000 for the BMW NFS Ascent\u00ae contract. In fiscal year ended June 30, 2020, we recorded $2,500,000 of license revenue for the DFS, 12 country NFS Ascent\u00ae contract, $470,000 for an NFS Ascent\u00ae contract in the U.K., and $1,540,000 from license revenues through sales of our regional offerings in China, Australia, the U.S. and the U.K.\nSubscription and Support\nSubscription and support fees for the year ended June 30, 2021, were $22,173,745 compared to $20,254,917 for the year ended June 30, 2020 reflecting an increase of $1,918,828 with a change in constant currency of $1,754,369. The increase in subscription and support fees is due to going live with several markets related to the DFS contract and going live with the BMW contract. Subscription and support fees begin once a customer has \u201cgone live\u201d with our product. Subscription and support fees are recurring in nature, and we anticipate these fees to gradually increase as we implement both our NFS legacy products and NFS Ascent\u00ae.\nServices\nServices income for the year ended June 30, 2021, was $26,448,171 compared to $32,555,690 for the year ended June 30, 2020, reflecting a decrease of $6,107,519 with a decrease in constant currency of $6,485,196. The decrease in services revenue is due to the decrease in implementation revenue associated with customers who have gone live with our products. Services revenue is derived from services provided to both current customers as well as services provided to new customers as part of the implementation process.\nServices - Related Party\nServices income from related party for the year ended June 30, 2021 was $48,775 compared to $300,821 for the year ended June 30, 2020 reflecting a decrease of $252,046 with a decrease in constant currency of $254,805. The decrease in related party service revenue is due to a decrease in revenue due to less services performed for WRLD3D.\nGross Profit\nThe gross profit was $26,353,028 for the year ended June 30, 2021 as compared with $26,963,370 for the year ended June 30, 2020. This is a decrease of $610,342 with a decrease in constant currency of $1,312,086. The gross profit percentage for the year ended June 30, 2021 increased to 48.0% from 47.8% for the year ended June 30, 2020. The cost of sales was $28,567,587 for the year ended June 30, 2021 compared to $29,408,949 for the year ended June 30, 2020 for a decrease of $841,362 and on a constant currency basis a decrease of $1,039,764. As a percentage of sales, cost of sales decreased from 52.2% for the year ended June 30, 2020 to 52.0% for the year ended June 30, 2021.\nSalaries and consultant fees increased by $2,147,560 from $18,821,738 for the year ended June 30, 2020 to $20,969,298 for the year ended June 30, 2021 and on a constant currency basis increased by $1,984,188. The increase in salaries is due to the increase in the number of technical employees and the annual increase in salaries and wages. We had 932, 1,009, and 1,036 technical employees as of June 30, 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively. As a percentage of sales, salaries and consultant expense increased from 33.4% for the year ended June 30, 2020 to 38.2% for the year ended June 30, 2021.\nTravel decreased by $3,518,339 from $4,181,742 for the year ended June 30, 2020 to $663,403 for the year ended June 30, 2021 and on a constant currency basis decreased by $3,558,950. The decrease in travel is due to the COVID-19 Pandemic. As a percentage of sales, travel expense decreased from 7.4% for year ended June 30, 2020 to 1.2% for the year ended June 30, 2021.\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased to $2,990,689 compared to $2,897,371 for the year ended June 30, 2020 or an increase of $93,318 and on a constant currency basis an increase of $123,117.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses were $23,632,179 for the year ended June 30, 2021 compared to $25,893,032, for the year ended June 30, 2020 for a decrease of 8.7% or $2,260,853 and on a constant currency basis a decrease of 9.0% or $2,298,574. As a percentage of sales, it decreased from 45.9% to 43.0%. The decrease in operating expenses was primarily due to decreases in general and administrative expenses and research and development cost offset by an increase in selling and marketing expenses, salaries and wages and depreciation expense.\nSelling and marketing expenses increased $104,341 or 1.6% and on a constant currency basis an increase of $42,010 or 0.7%. The increase in selling and marketing expenses is due to increase in our salaries and commissions, and business development costs to market and sell NFS Ascent\u00ae globally.\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $15,437,382 for the year ended June 30, 2021 compared to $17,138,832 at June 30, 2020 or a decrease of $1,701,450 or 9.9% and on a constant currency basis a decrease of $1,641,828 or 9.6%. The decrease is primarily due to a reduction of approximately $795,000 related to a withholding tax on dividends and by customers, approximately $395,000 of reduced travel expenses, approximately $56,000 of reduced professional services, approximately $517,000 related to the decrease in the provision for doubtful accounts and approximately $157,000 reduction in rent expense offset by an increase in salaries of approximately $402,000.\nResearch and development costs were $674,168 for the year ended June 30, 2021 compared to $1,468,954 at June 30, 2020 or a decrease of $794,786 or 54.1% and on constant currency basis a decrease of $799,928 or 54.5%. The decrease in research and development costs is due to less spending on our innovation initiatives with Blockchain, AI, and IoT.\nIncome/Loss from Operations\nIncome from operations was $2,720,849 for the year ended June 30, 2021 compared to $1,070,338 for the year ended June 30, 2020. This represents an increase of $1,650,511 with an increase of $986,488 on a constant currency basis for the year ended June 30, 2021 compared with the year ended June 30, 2020. As a percentage of sales, income from operations was 5.0% for the year ended June 30, 2021 compared to 1.9% for the year ended June 30, 2020.\nOther Income and Expense\nOther income was $567,400 for the year ended June 30, 2021 compared to $1,262,753 for the year ended June 30, 2020. This represents a decrease of $695,353 with a decrease of $893,154 on a constant currency basis. The decrease is primarily due to the interest income and foreign currency exchange transactions. Interest income was $1,017,432 for the year ended June 30, 2021 compared to $1,569,536 for the period ended June 30, 2020. This represent a decrease of $552,104 or a change of $557,829 on constant currency basis. We did not accrue any interest income on the convertible notes receivable for the year ended June 30, 2021 compared to $372,314 for the year ended June 30, 2020. The majority of the contracts with NetSol PK are either in U.S. dollars or Euros; therefore, the currency fluctuations will lead to foreign currency exchange gains or losses depending on the value of the PKR compared to the U.S. Dollar and the Euro. During the year ended June 30, 2021, we recognized a loss of $597,433 in foreign currency exchange transactions compared to a gain of $398,610 for the year ended June 30, 2020. During the year ended June 30, 2021, the value of the U.S. dollar and the Euro decreased 5.9% and 0.5%, respectively, compared to the PKR. During the year ended June 30, 2020, the value of the U.S. dollar and the Euro increased 3.1% and 1.8%, respectively, compared to the PKR.\nNon-controlling Interest\nFor the year ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, the net income attributable to non-controlling interest was $483,375 and $254,942, respectively. The increase in non-controlling interest is primarily due to the increase in net income of NetSol PK.\nNet Income/Loss Attributable to NetSol\nNet income was $1,778,257 for the year ended June 30, 2021 compared to $937,081 for the year ended June 30, 2020. This is an increase of $841,176 with a decrease of $9,399 on a constant currency basis, compared to the prior year. For the year ended June 30, 2021, net income per share was $0.15 for basic and diluted shares. For the year ended June 30, 2020, net income per share was $0.08 for basic and diluted shares.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nRegulation S-K Item 10(e), \u201cUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures in Commission Filings,\u201d defines and prescribes the conditions for use of non-GAAP financial information. Our measures of adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA per basic and diluted share meet the definition of a non-GAAP financial measure.\nWe define the non-GAAP measures as follows:\n\u25cf EBITDA is GAAP net income before net interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization.\n\u25cf Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA is EBITDA plus stock-based compensation expense.\n\u25cf Adjusted EBITDA per basic and diluted share - Adjusted EBITDA allocated to common stock divided by the weighted average shares outstanding and diluted shares outstanding.\nWe use non-GAAP measures internally to evaluate the business and believe that presenting non-GAAP measures provides useful information to investors regarding the underlying business trends and performance of our ongoing operations as well as useful metrics for monitoring our performance and evaluating it against industry peers. The non-GAAP financial measures presented should be used in addition to, and in conjunction with, results presented in accordance with GAAP, and should not be relied upon to the exclusion of GAAP financial measures. Management strongly encourages investors to review our consolidated financial statements in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure in evaluating the Company.\nThe non-GAAP measures reflect adjustments based on the following items:\nEBITDA: We report EBITDA as a non-GAAP metric by excluding the effect of net interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization from net income because doing so makes internal comparisons to our historical operating results more consistent. In addition, we believe providing an EBITDA calculation is a more useful comparison of our operating results to the operating results of our peers.\nStock-based compensation expense: We have excluded the effect of stock-based compensation expense from the non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA per basic and diluted share calculations. Although stock-based compensation expense is calculated in accordance with current GAAP and constitutes an ongoing and recurring expense, such expense is excluded from non-GAAP results because it is not an expense which generally requires cash settlement by NetSol, and therefore is not used by us to assess the profitability of our operations. We also believe the exclusion of stock-based compensation expense provides a more useful comparison of our operating results to the operating results of our peers.\nNon-controlling interest: We add back the non-controlling interest in calculating gross adjusted EBITDA and then subtract out the income taxes, depreciation and amortization and net interest expense attributable to the non-controlling interest to arrive at a net adjusted EBITDA.\nOur reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures of adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP earnings per basic and diluted share to the most comparable GAAP measures for the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020 are as follows:\nFor the Year Ended For the Year Ended\nJune 30, 2021 June 30, 2020\nNet Income (loss) attributable to NetSol $ 1,778,257 $ 937,081\nNon-controlling interest 483,375 254,942\nIncome taxes 1,026,617 1,141,068\nDepreciation and amortization 3,956,314 3,731,954\nInterest expense 394,289 346,856\nInterest (income) (1,017,432 ) (1,569,536 )\nEBITDA $ 6,621,420 $ 4,842,365\nAdd back:\nNon-cash stock-based compensation 342,153 808,616\nAdjusted EBITDA, gross $ 6,963,573 $ 5,650,981\nLess non-controlling interest (a) (1,588,701 ) (1,330,352 )\nAdjusted EBITDA, net $ 5,374,872 $ 4,320,629\nWeighted Average number of shares outstanding\nBasic 11,499,983 11,734,648\nDiluted 11,499,983 11,784,414\nBasic adjusted EBITDA $ 0.47 $ 0.37\nDiluted adjusted EBITDA $ 0.47 $ 0.37\n(a) The reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA of non-controlling interest to net income attributable to non-controlling interest is as follows\nNet Income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interest $ 483,375 $ 254,942\nIncome Taxes 147,688 223,675\nDepreciation and amortization 1,115,734 1,060,605\nInterest expense 121,740 100,373\nInterest (income) (319,674 ) (391,644 )\nEBITDA $ 1,548,863 $ 1,247,951\nAdd back:\nNon-cash stock-based compensation 39,838 82,401\nAdjusted EBITDA of non-controlling interest $ 1,588,701 $ 1,330,352\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nOur cash position was $33,705,154 at June 30, 2021, compared to $20,166,830 at June 30, 2020.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $15,725,923 for the year ended June 30, 2021 compared to $3,972,426 for the year ended June 30, 2020. At June 30, 2021, we had current assets of $55,578,774 and current liabilities of $23,476,561. We had accounts receivable of $4,184,096 at June 30, 2021 compared to $11,414,257 at June 30, 2020. We had revenues in excess of billings of $15,637,734 at June 30, 2021 compared to $18,506,733 at June 30, 2020 of which $957,603 and $1,300,289 are shown as long term as of June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The long-term portion was discounted by $66,779 and $41,286 at June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, using the discounted cash flow method with interest rates ranging from 4.65% to 6.25% and 4.35%, for the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. During the year ended June 30, 2021, our revenues in excess of billings were reclassified to accounts receivable pursuant to billing requirements detailed in each contract. The combined totals for accounts receivable and revenues in excess of billings decreased by $10,099,160 from $29,920,990 at June 30, 2020 to $19,821,830 at June 30, 2021. Accounts payable and accrued expenses, and current portions of loans and lease obligations amounted to $6,696,035 and $11,366,171, respectively at June 30, 2021. The average days sales outstanding for the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020 were 165 and 200 days respectively. The days sales outstanding have been calculated by taking into consideration the average combined balances of accounts receivable and revenue in excess of billings.\nNet cash used by investing activities amounted to $2,518,550 for the year ended June 30, 2021, compared to $2,054,890 for the year ended June 30, 2020. We had net purchases of property and equipment of $2,363,050 compared to $1,270,965 for the comparable period last fiscal year. We did not invest in short-term convertible notes for the year ended June 30, 2021, compared to $600,000, for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020. For the year ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, we invested $155,500 and $94,500, respectively, in DriveMate.\nNet cash used in financing activities was $1,165,565 compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $1,700,293, for the years ended June 30, 2021, and 2020, respectively. During the year ended June 30, 2021, we purchased 669,018 shares of our common stock from the open market for $2,364,781 compared to zero shares of common stock for the year ended June 30, 2020. The year ended June 30, 2021, included cash inflow of $1,898,013 from bank proceeds compared to $4,221,203 for the same period last year. During the year ended June 30, 2021, we had net payments for bank loans and capital leases of $698,797 compared to $611,913 for the year ended June 30, 2020. We are operating in various geographical regions of the world through our various subsidiaries. Those subsidiaries have financial arrangements from various financial institutions to meet both their short and long-term funding requirements. These loans will become due at different maturity dates as described in Note 15 of the financial statements. We are in compliance with the covenants of the financial arrangements and there is no default which may lead to early payment of these obligations. We anticipate paying back all these obligations on their respective due dates.\nWe typically fund the cash requirements for our operations in the U.S. through our license, services, and maintenance agreements, intercompany charges for corporate services, and through the exercise of options. As of June 30, 2021, we had approximately $33.7 million of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of which approximately $31.7 million is held by our foreign subsidiaries. As of June 30, 2020, we have approximately $20.2 million of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of which approximately $18.2 million is held by our foreign subsidiaries.\nWe remain open to strategic relationships that would provide value added benefits. The focus will remain on continuously improving cash reserves internally and reduced reliance on external capital raise.\nAs a growing company, we have on-going capital expenditure needs based on our short term and long-term business plans. Although our requirements for capital expenses vary from time to time, for the next 12 months, we anticipate needing working capital of $2 to $3 million for APAC, U.S. and European new business development activities and infrastructure enhancements.\nWhile there is no guarantee that any of these methods will result in raising sufficient funds to meet our capital needs or that even if available will be on terms acceptable to us, we will be very cautious and prudent about any new capital raise given the global market uncertainties. However, we are very conscious of the dilutive effect and price pressures in raising equity-based capital.\nFinancial Covenants\nOur UK based subsidiary, NTE, has an approved overdraft facility of \u00a3300,000 ($416,667) which requires that the aggregate amount of invoiced trade debtors (net of provisions for bad and doubtful debts and excluding intra-group debtors) of NTE, not exceeding 90 days old, will not be less than an amount equal to 200% of the facility. The Pakistani subsidiary, NetSol PK has an approved facility for export refinance from Askari Bank Limited amounting to Rupees 500 million ($3,162,555) and a running finance facility of Rupees 75 million ($474,383). NetSol PK has an approved facility for export refinance from Habib Metro Bank Limited amounting to Rupees 900 million ($5,692,600). These facilities require NetSol PK to maintain a long-term debt equity ratio of 60:40 and the current ratio of 1:1. NetSol PK also has an approved export refinance facility of Rs. 380 million ($2,403,542) and a running finance facility of Rs. 120 million ($759,013) from Samba Bank Limited. During the tenure of loan, these two facilities require NetSol PK to maintain at a minimum a current ratio of 1:1, an interest coverage ratio of 4 times, a leverage ratio of 2 times, and a debt service coverage ratio of 4 times.\nAs of the date of this report, we are in compliance with the financial covenants associated with our borrowings. The maturity dates of the borrowings of respective subsidiaries may accelerate if they do not comply with these covenants. In case of any change in control in subsidiaries, they may have to repay their respective credit facilities.\nDividends and Redemption\nIt has been our policy to invest earnings in growth rather than distribute earnings as common stock dividends. This policy, under which common stock dividends have not been paid since our inception is expected to continue but is subject to regular review by the Board of Directors.\nContractual Obligations\nOur contractual obligations are as follows:\nPayment due by period\nContractual Obligation Total 0 - 1 year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years More than 5 years\nDebt Obligations\nD&O Insurance $ 73,143 $ 73,143 $ - $ - $ -\nTerm Finance Facility 1,648,818 1,090,259 558,559\n-\nLoan Payable Bank - Export Refinance 3,162,555 3,162,555 - - -\nLoan Payable Bank - Export Refinance II 2,403,542 2,403,542 - - -\nLoan Payable Bank - Export Refinance III 4,427,578 4,427,578 - - -\nTerm Finance Facility 55,182 19,644 35,538 - -\nSale and Leaseback Financing 85,313 28,183 57,130 - -\nInsurance financing 41,774 41,774 - - -\nSubsidiary Finance Leases 168,107 119,493 48,614 - -\nOperating Lease Obligations 1,421,986 867,279 550,736 1,589 2,382\nTotal $ 13,487,998 $ 12,233,450 $ 1,250,577 $ 1,589 $ 2,382\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not maintain any off-balance sheet arrangements, transactions, obligations or other relationships with unconsolidated entities that would be expected to have a material current or future effect upon our financial condition or results of operations.",

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nWe are exposed to financial market risks, including changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates.\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk\nEconomic Exposure\nWe transact business in various foreign currencies and have significant international revenues, as well as costs denominated in foreign currencies. This exposes us to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Since the majority of the Company\u2019s operations are based in the Asia Pacific region where the Pakistan Rupee is continuously losing its value against the US Dollar and we don\u2019t have any imports; therefore, we believe it is counter-productive to hedge this exposure. The devaluation of the Pakistan Rupee results in a foreign exchange gain to the Company.\nTransaction Exposure\nOur exposure to foreign currency transaction gains and losses is the result of certain net receivables due from our foreign subsidiaries and customers being denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the subsidiary, primarily the Euro, Yuan, Baht and the Pakistan Rupee. Our foreign subsidiaries conduct their businesses in local currency.

    "item_11": "ITEM 11 - EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION\nIntroduction\nOur Compensation Committee is responsible for establishing and overseeing compensation programs that comply with NetSol\u2019s executive compensation philosophy. As described in this Compensation Discussion and Analysis (\u201cCD&A\u201d), the Compensation Committee follows a disciplined process for setting executive compensation. This process involves analyzing factors such as company performance, individual performance, strategic goals and competitive market data to arrive at each element of compensation. The Compensation Committee approves compensation decisions for all executive officers. An independent compensation consultant helps the Compensation Committee by providing advice, information, and an objective opinion. This CD&A will focus on the compensation awarded to NetSol\u2019s \u201cnamed executive officers\u201d-the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and General Counsel, Corporate Secretary. You can find more complete information about all elements of compensation for the named executive officers in the following discussion and in the Summary Compensation table that appears on page 45.\nFiscal 2021 Executive Compensation Highlights and Governance\nThis section identifies the most significant decisions and changes made regarding NETSOL\u2019s executive compensation in fiscal year 2021.\nShareholder Approval of Compensation\nAt the last annual general meeting held on June 14, 2021, shareholders expressed support for our executive compensation programs, with 95.72% of votes cast at the meeting voting to ratify the compensation of our named executive officers. Although the advisory shareholder vote on executive compensation is non-binding, the Compensation Committee has considered, and will continue to consider, the outcome of the vote and the sentiments of our shareholders when making future compensation decisions for the named executive officers. Based on the results from our last annual general meeting, the Compensation Committee believes shareholders support the Company\u2019s executive compensation philosophy and the compensation paid to the named executive officers.\nTaking into account the marked increase in support of this plan at the June 14, 2021 Annual Shareholders Meeting, the Compensation Committee believes the compensation program meaningfully explains the Compensation Committee\u2019s compensation decisions and its determination to tie long term incentives of the Chief Executive Officer to performance criteria. The Compensation Committee continues to reach out to its shareholders regarding their positions on the Company\u2019s compensation program. In connection with the proxy solicitations, the executive compensation was discussed with certain of our top shareholders and their general acceptance of the compensation structure is reflected in the proxy vote results. Accordingly, the Compensation Committee will continue to provide the CEO with a bonus criterion that is based on total revenues and income from operations on a graduated basis. Bonuses would be paid 60% in cash and 40% in stock valued at the share price on June 30th of the fiscal year in which it was earned.\nBased on the 2016 Annual Meeting of Shareholders vote on the Frequency of Say on Pay voting, we will continue to provide our stockholders with an annual opportunity to cast an advisory vote on the compensation programs for our named executive officers and as always, the stockholders are welcome to contact Investor Relations with any questions.\nGovernance and Evolving Compensation Practices\nThe Compensation Committee and the Board are aware of evolving practices in executive compensation and corporate governance. In response, we have adopted and/or maintained certain policies and practices that are in keeping with \u201cbest practices\u201d in many areas. For example:\n\u25cf The Compensation Committee engages an independent compensation consultant to evaluate our chief executive officer\u2019s executive compensation practices in comparison to a peer group.\n\u25cf We do not provide excessive executive perquisites to our named executive officers.\n\u25cf Our incentive plans expressly prohibit repricing of options (directly or indirectly) without prior shareholder approval.\n\u25cf Our policy on the prevention of insider trading prohibits various types of transactions involving Company stock or securities, including short sales, options trading, hedging, margin purchases and pledges.\n\u25cf Our stock ownership guidelines require our executive officers to align their long-term interests with those of our stockholders.\n\u25cf Our policy prohibits the named executive officers from selling any newly issued shares for a period of three months, in an open market transaction.\n\u25cf Beginning with our fiscal year 2018 to current, we modified our compensation practices for our CEO to tie a significant portion to financial results both on a top line and bottom-line basis.\nGeneral Compensation Overview\nFor 2021, compensation designed for our executive officers consisted of:\n\u25cf Base Salary\n\u25cf Cash awards at the discretion of the Compensation Committee\n\u25cf Long term equity in the form of time-based restricted stock; and\n\u25cf Ability to participate generally in all group health and welfare benefit programs and tax-qualified retirement plans on the same basis as applicable to all of our employees.\nIn response to discussions we have had with certain shareholders and given the percentage voting in favor of our executive compensation, beginning with the 2019 fiscal year, Chief Executive Officer compensation shall consist of:\n\u25cf Base Salary\n\u25cf Short-term cash awards conditioned upon achieving objective performance targets\n\u25cf Long-term equity in the form of time and objective performance targets; and\n\u25cf Ability to participate generally in all group health and welfare benefit programs and tax-qualified retirement plans on the same basis as applicable to all of our employees.\nThe Compensation Committee administers the cash and non-cash compensation programs applicable to our executive officers. The Compensation Committee makes all decisions about executive officer compensation for the Chief Executive Officer and the remaining named executives after discussion with our Chief Executive Officer about his direct reports. The Compensation Committee has often refined the direct reports\u2019 compensation recommendations made by the Chief Executive Officer. Our Chief Executive Officer\u2019s compensation is determined solely by the Compensation Committee, which, consistent with NASDAQ requirements, is comprised exclusively of independent directors, and the Chief Executive Officer does not participate in Committee decisions surrounding his compensation.\nIndependent Compensation Consultant\nThe Compensation Committee retained Compensation Resources, Inc. as its independent compensation consultant. Compensation Resources provided chief executive officer and director compensation consulting services to the Compensation Committee, including a competitive market analysis of peers and the base salary, total cash compensation and total direct compensation. Interactions with Compensation Resources was limited to the Compensation Committee Chair and interaction with executives was generally limited to discussions as required to compile information at the Compensation Committee\u2019s direction. During fiscal year 2021, Compensation Resources did not provide services to the Company. Based on these factors and its own evaluation of Compensation Resources independence pursuant to the requirements approved and adopted by the SEC, the Compensation Committee has determined that the work performed by Compensation Resources does not raise any conflicts of interest.\nCompensation Philosophy and Objectives\nOur executive compensation philosophy calls for competitive total compensation that will reward executives for achieving individual and corporate performance objectives and will attract, motivate and retain leaders who will drive the creation of shareholder value. It incorporates elements that create shareholder value by driving financial performance, retaining a high-performing and talented executive team, and aligning the interests of the executive team with the interests of shareholders. The Compensation Committee reviews the compensation and benefit programs for executive officers, including the named executive officers, and performs an annual assessment of the Company\u2019s executive compensation policy. In determining total compensation, the Compensation Committee considers the objectives and attributes described below.\nExecutive Compensation Principles\nShareholder Alignment \u25cf Our executive compensation programs are designed to create shareholder value.\n\u25cf Long-term incentive awards, delivered in the form of equity, make up a portion of our executives\u2019 total compensation and closely align the interests of executives with the long-term interests of our shareholders. Our policy prohibits the named executive officers from selling any newly issued shares for a period of three months, on an open market transaction.\nPerformance based \u25cf Long-term incentive awards are designed to reward our executive officers for creating long-term shareholder value. Long-term incentive awards are granted primarily in the form of stock options and/or shares.\nAppropriate Risk \u25cf Our executive compensation programs are designed to encourage executive officers to take appropriate risks in managing their businesses to achieve optimal performance.\nCompetitive with external talent markets \u25cf Our executive compensation programs are designed to be competitive within the relevant markets.\nSimple and transparent \u25cf Our executive compensation programs are designed to be readily understood by our executives, and transparent to our investors.\nCompensation Analysis Peer Group\nAfter consideration of business models, company revenue and market capitalization of other companies in the Company\u2019s technology industry segment, and with the input from Compensation Resources, Inc., the compensation consultant used by the Company at the time the study was last conducted, the Compensation Committee established the following list of peer companies to provide a comparative framework for use in setting executive compensation:\nAmber Road, Inc. B Square Corp.\nCass Information Systems Data Watch Corp.\nDigital Turbine, Inc. Everbridge, Inc.\nMitek Systems, Inc. SPS Commerce Inc.\nUSA Technologies, Inc. Zix Corp.\nExecutive Officer Base Salaries and Compensation Comparisons\nCompensation plans are developed by utilizing publicly available compensation data in the information technology and software services industries. We believe that the practices of these groups of companies provide us with appropriate compensation benchmarks, because these groups of companies are in similar businesses and tend to compete with us for executives and other employees. For benchmarking executive compensation, we typically review the compensation data we have collected from these groups of companies, as well as a subset of the data from those companies that have a similar number of employees as the Company. The Compensation Committee has determined to utilize the services of a consultant for purposes of comparing our compensation program with similarly situated companies in like industries. The recommendations of these consultants will be utilized by the Compensation Committee in determining the appropriate compensation packages in addition to taking into account the unique global scale of the Company\u2019s business. While these consultants may make general recommendations about the size and components of compensation, we anticipate our philosophy to continue on the basis of a pay-for-performance philosophy.\nIn establishing the compensation of our named Chief Executive Officer, we based the amounts primarily on the market data and advice provided by Compensation Resources, Inc. with respect to the compensation paid to individuals who perform substantially similar functions within the peer group companies. In connection with the other named executive officers, we also relied on the recommendations of the Chief Executive Officer\u2019s analysis relative to those individuals\u2019 performance and compensation. We also examined the outstanding stock options and equity grants held by the executive officers for the purpose of considering the retention value of any additional equity awards.\nAs a general guideline, for our named executive officers, we aim to set base salary, cash compensation and total compensation at approximately the mean market range. Our analysis determined that the base salary of our Chief Executive officer was slightly above the mean, cash compensation was generally within the mean, but the total direct compensation was below the mean. As such, it was determined to develop a long-term, performance-based element of the compensation that brought the total direct compensation within the mean.\nExecutive Compensation Components\nBase Salary\nAn executive\u2019s base salary is a fixed element of the executive\u2019s compensation intended to attract and retain executives. It is evaluated together with components of the executive\u2019s other compensation to ensure that the executive\u2019s total compensation is consistent with our overall compensation philosophy. Base salaries are adjusted annually by the Compensation Committee.\nThe base salaries were established in arms-length negotiations between the executive and the Company, considering their extensive experience, knowledge of the industry, track record, and achievements on behalf of the Company. The Company expects each named executive officer to contribute to the Company\u2019s overall success as a member of the executive team rather than focus solely on specific objectives within the officer\u2019s area of responsibility.\nWe provided a 3% increase in base salary for Ms. McGlasson in fiscal 2020. Due to the effects of COVID-19, the Company reduced her base salary by 13%. We provided a 4% increase in base salary for Mr. Almond in fiscal 2020. Due to the effects of COVID-19, the Company reduced his salary by 13%. In fiscal year 2020, Mr. Ghauri\u2019s base salary did not increase. Due to the effects of COVID-19, Mr. Ghauri\u2019s base salary was reduced by 4.7%. Mr. Ghauri\u2019s perquisites were reduced by 8% for a total compensation reduction of 5.4%. The Compensation Committee determined that salary alone was an adequate basis for short term compensation, and that equity incentives would be used for the long-term elements of incentive programs for Ms. McGlasson and Mr. Almond.\nAnnual Bonus\nOur compensation program includes eligibility for bonuses as rewarded by the Compensation Committee. All executives are eligible for annual performance-based cash bonuses in accordance with Company policies. The Compensation Committee takes into consideration the executive\u2019s performance during the previous year to determine eligibility for discretionary bonuses. Further, the compensation committee will review, if applicable, the performance criteria set forth in an executive\u2019s previous year\u2019s agreement and will determine if the executive has met such criteria in order to achieve the bonus. The Company\u2019s bonus criteria at the executive management level, is typically based on a gross revenue and income from operations targets. Cash bonuses, if any for 2021 are reflected in the summary of compensation discussed below starting on page 43. For 2021, based on structured KPI\u2019s by the compensation committee, Mr. Ghauri earned a bonus of $67,500. See bonus structure as discussed below on page 41. The Compensation Committee determined that Gross Revenue and Income from Operations structure used in fiscal 2021 continues to be a proper measure for measuring Mr. Ghauri\u2019s performance in that it encourages his participation in revenue generating activities and continues to incentivize him to monitor and maximize cost efficiency.\nLong-Term Equity Incentive Compensation\nWe believe that long-term performance is achieved through an ownership culture that encourages long-term participation by our executives in equity-based awards. Because base salary and equity awards are such basic elements of compensation within our industry, as well as the high technology and software industries in general, and are generally expected by employees, we believe that these components must be included in our compensation mix in order for us to compete effectively for talented executives. We award time based vested stock from our Equity Incentive Plans for several reasons. First, such awards facilitate retention of our executives. Restricted stock generally vests only if the executive remains employed by the Company. Second, time-based stock awards align executive compensation with the interests of our shareholders and thereby focuses executives on increasing value for the shareholders. Time vested stock generally only provides a superior return if the stock price appreciates, and results in materially less dilution to the shareholders than options while frequently providing equivalent value to the employee at less cost to the Company than options. In determining the number of shares to be granted to executives, we take into account the individual\u2019s position, scope of responsibility, ability to affect profits and shareholder value, past and recent performance, and the estimated value of shares at the time of grant. Assuming individual performance at a level satisfactory to the Compensation Committee, the size of total equity compensation is generally targeted at the 50th percentile for the peer group. As indicated above, market data, including compensation percentiles, were among several factors the committee reviewed in determining compensation.\nEquity incentives provided to executives are determined by the Fair Market Value of our common stock on the grant date. Each executive\u2019s stock award was based on an analysis of the Compensation Committee of an appropriate overall cash compensation for each individual taking into account their position and compensation at similarly situated companies. Each executive\u2019s stock award was based on a desired overall compensation cash value less the base salary as approved by the Compensation Committee.\nIn fiscal year 2020, Ms. McGlasson and Mr. Almond received a grant of 7,500 and 10,000 shares of common stock, respectively, vesting quarterly over a two-year period.\nMr. Najeeb Ghauri is eligible to receive grants of shares based on the performance criteria connected to gross revenues and net income from operations as discussed below. The total compensation including equity grants is designed to bring the Chief Executive Officer to the mean market average.\nMr. Najeeb Ghauri\u2019s bonus for fiscal year 2021 is based on the total revenues and income from operations on a graduated basis. The following table demonstrates the graduated percentage of bonus that Mr. Ghauri will be eligible to earn based on the percentage of the goal achieved. Bonuses will be paid 60% in cash and 40% in shares of common stock valued on June 30, 2021. Total net revenues and income from operations are based on those values reported for the year ending June 30, 2021 excluding any adjustments relating to changes in revenue recognition policy.\nAllocated\nBonus % % of Bonus 25 % 50 % 100 % 125 % 150 % 175 % 200 %\nNet revenues 55 % Increase in revenues 5 % 10 % 15 % 20 % 25 % 30 % 35 %\nBonus Earned\n82,500 165,000 330,000 412,500 495,000 577,500 660,000\n% of Bonus 25 % 50 % 100 % 125 % 150 % 175 % 200 %\nIncome from Operations 45 % Income from Operations % 5.0 % 7.5 % 10.0 % 12.5 % 15.0 % 17.5 % 20.0 %\nBonus Earned\n67,500 135,000 270,000 337,500 405,000 472,500 540,000\nTotal Bonus\n150,000 300,000 600,000 750,000 900,000 1,050,000 1,200,000\nMr. Ghauri\u2019s bonus for the fiscal year 2022 will be based on the same criteria stated above.\nPerquisites and Other Personal Benefits\nWe provide named executive officers with perquisites and other personal benefits that we believe are reasonable and consistent with our overall compensation program to better enable the Company to attract and retain superior employees for key positions. The Compensation Committee periodically reviews the level of perquisites and other personal benefits provided to NETSOL\u2019s executive officers.\nWe maintain benefits and perquisites that are offered to all employees, including health and dental insurance. Benefits and perquisites may vary in different country locations and are consistent with local practices and regulations.\nTermination Based Compensation\nUpon termination of employment, all executive officers with a written employment agreement are entitled to receive severance payments under their employment agreements. In determining whether to approve, and as part of the process of setting the terms of, such severance arrangements, the Compensation Committee recognizes that executives and officers often face challenges securing new employment following termination. Further, the Committee recognizes that many of the named executives and officers have participated in the Company since its founding and that this participation has not resulted in a return on their investments. Termination and Change in Control Payments considered both the risk and the dedication of these executives\u2019 service to the Company.\nOur Chief Executive Officer has an employment agreement that provides, if his employment is terminated without cause or if the executive terminates the agreement with Good Reason, he is entitled to (a) all remaining salary to the end of the date of termination, plus salary from the end of the employment term through the end of the fourth anniversary of the date of termination, and (b) the continuation by the Company of medical and dental insurance coverage for him and his family until the end of the employment term and through the end of the fourth anniversary of the date of termination. Provided, however, if such benefits cannot be continued for this extended period, the Executive shall receive cash (including a tax-equivalency payment for Federal, state and local income and payroll taxes assuming Executive is in the maximum tax bracket for all such purposes) where such benefits may not be continued. These agreements further provide for vesting of all options and restrictive stock grants, if any.\nOur Chief Financial Officer has an employment agreement that provides, if his employment is terminated without cause or if the executive terminates the agreement with Good Reason, he is entitled to (a) all remaining salary to the end of the date of termination, plus salary from the end of the employment term through the end of the first anniversary of the date of termination, and (b) the continuation by the Company of medical and dental insurance coverage for him and his family until the end of the employment term and through the end of the first anniversary from the date of termination. Provided, however, if such benefits cannot be continued for this extended period, the Executive shall receive cash (including a tax-equivalency payment for Federal, state and local income and payroll taxes assuming Executive is in the maximum tax bracket for all such purposes) where such benefits may not be continued. These agreements further provide for vesting of all options and restrictive stock grants, if any.\nThe Secretary of the Company has an employment agreement that provides, if she is terminated without cause or if the executive terminates the agreement with Good Reason, she is entitled to (a) all remaining salary to the end of the date of termination, plus salary from the end of the employment term through the end of the second anniversary of the date of termination, and (b) the continuation by the Company of medical and dental insurance coverage for her and her family until the end of the employment term and through the end of the second anniversary of the date of termination. Provided, however, if such benefits cannot be continued for this extended period, the Executive shall receive cash (including a tax-equivalency payment for Federal, state and local income and payroll taxes assuming Executive is in the maximum tax bracket for all such purposes) where such benefits may not be continued. These agreements further provide for vesting of all options and restrictive stock grants, if any.\nThese agreements were designed to assist in the retention of the services of our named executives and to determine in advance the rights and remedies of the parties in connection with any termination. The types and amounts of compensation and the triggering events set forth in these agreements were based on a review of the terms and conditions of normal and customary agreements in our competitive marketplace.\nTax and Accounting Implications\nDeductibility of Executive Compensation\nAs part of its role, the Compensation Committee reviews and considers the deductibility of executive compensation under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, which provides that we may not deduct compensation of more than $1,000,000 that is paid to certain individuals. The Compensation Committee is aware of the limitations imposed by Section 162(m) and considers the issue of deductibility when and if circumstances warrant. The committee reviews proposed compensation plans in light of applicable tax deductions, and generally seeks to maximize the deductibility for tax purposes of all elements of compensation. However, the committee may approve compensation that does not qualify for deductibility, including stock option and time-based restricted stock awards, if and when the committee deems it to be in the best interests of the Company and our shareholders.\nAccounting for Stock-Based Compensation\nCommencing on July 1, 2006, we began accounting for stock-based payments, including awards under our Employee Stock Option Plans, in accordance with the of Financial Accounting Standards Board\u2019s Accounting Standards Codification Topic 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation.\nSummary Compensation\nThe following table shows the compensation for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, 2020, and 2019, earned by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, our Chief Financial Officer who is our Principal Financial and Accounting Officer, and others considered to be executive officers of the Company.\nName and Principle Position Fiscal Year Ended Salary ($) Bonus ($) Stock Awards ($) (1) Option Awards ($) All Other Compensation ($) Total ($)\nNajeeb Ghauri $ 667,000 $ 67,500 (2) $ - $ - $ 180,383 (4) $ 914,883\nCEO & Chairman $ 689,000 $ - $ - $ - $ 156,586 (4) $ 845,586\n$ 675,000 $ 432,488 (2) $ - $ 21,598 (3) $ 200,000 (4) $ 1,329,086\nNaeem Ghauri\nPresident $ 767,768 (5) $ - $ - $ - $ 77,045 (6) $ 844,813\nRoger K Almond $ 186,515 $ - $ - $ - $ 32,872 (7) $ 219,387\nChief Financial Officer $ 217,111 $ 20,000 $ 56,900 $ - $ 10,639 (7) $ 304,650\n$ 221,520 $ 20,000 $ 55,500 $ - $ 10,191 (7) $ 307,211\nPatti L.

The Audit Committee maintains a policy for the engagement of the independent auditors that is intended to maintain the independent auditor\u2019s independence from NetSol. In adopting the policy, the Audit Committee considered the various services that the independent auditors have historically performed or may be needed to perform in the future. The policy, which is to be reviewed and re-adopted at least annually by the Audit Committee:\n(i) Approves the performance by the independent auditors of certain types of service (principally audit-related and tax), subject to restrictions in some cases, based on the Committee\u2019s determination that this would not be likely to impair the independent auditors\u2019 independence from NetSol;\n(ii) Requires that management obtain the specific prior approval of the Audit Committee for each engagement of the independent auditors to perform other types of permitted services; and\n(iii) Prohibits the performance by the independent auditors of certain types of services due to the likelihood that their independence would be impaired.\nAny approval required under the policy must be given by the Audit Committee, by the Chairman of the Committee in office at the time, or by any other Committee member to whom the Committee has delegated that authority. The Audit Committee does not delegate its responsibilities to approve services performed by the independent auditors to any member of management.\nThe standard applied by the Audit Committee in determining whether to grant approval of an engagement of the independent auditors is whether the services to be performed, the compensation to be paid therefore and other related factors are consistent with the independent auditors\u2019 independence under guidelines of the Securities and Exchange Commission and applicable professional standards. Relevant considerations include, but are not limited to, whether the work product is likely to be subject to, or implicated in, audit procedures during the audit of NetSol\u2019s financial statements; whether the independent auditors would be functioning in the role of management or in an advocacy role; whether performance of the service by the independent auditors would enhance NetSol\u2019s ability to manage or control risk or improve audit quality; whether performance of the service by the independent auditors would increase efficiency because of their familiarity with NetSol\u2019s business, personnel, culture, systems, risk profile and other factors; and whether the amount of fees involved, or the proportion of the total fees payable to the independent auditors in the period that is for tax and other non-audit services, would tend to reduce the independent auditors\u2019 ability to exercise independent judgment in performing the audit.\nPART IV",

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial positions of NetSol Technologies, Inc. and subsidiaries as of June 30, 2021 and 2020 and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the period then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company\u2019s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nRevenue recognition - identification of contractual terms in certain customer arrangements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nAs described in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, management assesses relevant contractual terms in its customer arrangements to determine the transaction price and recognizes revenue upon transfer of control of the promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for those products or services. Management applies judgment in determining the transaction price which is dependent on the contractual terms. In order to determine the transaction price, management may be required to estimate variable consideration when determining the amount and timing of revenue recognition.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the identification of contractual terms in customer arrangements to determine the transaction price is a critical audit matter are there was significant judgment by management in identifying contractual terms due to the volume and customized nature of the Company\u2019s customer arrangements. This in turn led to significant effort in performing our audit procedures which were designed to evaluate whether the contractual terms used in the determination of the transaction price and the timing of revenue recognition were appropriately identified and determined by management and to evaluate the reasonableness of management\u2019s estimates.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the revenue recognition process, including those related to the identification of contractual terms in customer arrangements that impact the determination of the transaction price and revenue recognition. These procedures also included, among others, (i) testing the completeness and accuracy of management\u2019s identification of the contractual terms by examining customer arrangements on a test basis, and (ii) testing management\u2019s process for determining the appropriate amount and timing of revenue recognition based on the contractual terms identified in the customer arrangements.\nGoodwill and Intangible asset- Refer to Note 12 and Note 13 to the financial statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nThe Company tests goodwill and intangible assets for impairment annually (in the fourth quarter), or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit has declined below its carrying value. The Company utilizes a discounted cash flow methodology to calculate the fair value of its reporting units, which requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions related to projected revenue growth rates, discount rates, and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (\u201cEBITDA\u201d). Changes in these assumptions could have a significant impact on the fair value of the reporting unit and the amount of any goodwill impairment charge. As of June 30, 2021, the Company has four reporting units, but only three of which have goodwill.\nGiven the significant judgments made by management to estimate the fair value of the reporting units, performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management\u2019s estimates and assumptions related to projected revenue growth rates, discount rates, EBITDA and EBITDA margin required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the assistance of our fair value specialists.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\n\u25cf Our audit procedures related to management\u2019s estimates and assumptions related to projected revenue growth rates, discount rates, EBITDA and EBITDA margin for the reporting units included the following, among other procedures:\n\u25cf We tested the effectiveness of internal controls over the goodwill impairment evaluation, including controls over the selection of the discount rates and over forecasts of future revenue growth rates, EBITDA, and EBITDA margin.\n\u25cf We performed a retrospective review comparing actual revenue and EBITDA results of the reporting unit for 2021 to the forecasted results from 2020.\n\u25cf We performed a retrospective review comparing management\u2019s estimates and assumptions relating to revenue, EBITDA, and EBITDA margin projections for the reporting unit used for the purpose of current year\u2019s annual impairment test to the projections previously used in connection with the prior year annual impairment test.\n\u25cf We evaluated the consistency of estimates and assumptions relating to revenue and EBITDA growth inherent in the discounted cash flow model for the reporting unit to those used by management in other annual forecasting activities.\n\u25cf With the assistance of our fair value specialists, we performed a benchmarking exercise comparing management\u2019s estimates and assumptions related to revenue growth, EBITDA and EBITDA margin for the reporting unit as of the measurement date to the revenue growth, EBITDA and EBITDA margins of a peer group of public companies for the most recent three years and the projection period.\n\u25cf With the assistance of our fair value specialists, we evaluated (1) the valuation methodology used and (2) the projections of long-term revenue growth and the discount rates by testing the underlying source information, and by developing a range of independent estimates and comparing those to the rates selected by management.\n/s/ BF Borgers CPA PC.\nCERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS\nWe have served as the Company\u2019s auditor since 2020.\nLakewood, CO\nSeptember 28, 2021\nNETSOL TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

Below is the table of reclassified amounts:\nFor the Years ended\nJune 30, 2020\nOriginally reported Reclassified\nREVENUES\nLicense fees $ 4,564,560 $ 3,260,891\nSubscription and support 19,019,646 20,254,917\nServices 32,487,292 32,555,690\nServices - related party 300,821 300,821\nTotal net revenues $ 56,372,319 $ 56,372,319\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\u201cUS GAAP\u201d) and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d).\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The areas requiring significant estimates are provision for doubtful accounts, provision for taxation, useful life of depreciable assets, useful life of intangible assets, contingencies, and estimated contract costs. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents include all highly liquid debt instruments with original maturities of three months or less which are not securing any corporate obligations.\nConcentration of Credit Risk\nCash includes cash on hand and demand deposits in accounts maintained within the United States as well as in foreign countries. Certain financial instruments, which subject the Company to concentration of credit risk, consist of cash and restricted cash. The Company maintains balances at financial institutions which, from time to time, may exceed Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insured limits for the banks located in the United States. Balances at financial institutions within certain foreign countries are not covered by insurance, except balances maintained in China are insured for RMB500,000 ($77,399) in each bank and in the UK for GBP 85,000 ($118,056) in each bank. The Company maintains two bank accounts in China and six bank accounts in the UK. As of June 30, 2021 and 2020, the Company had uninsured deposits related to cash deposits in accounts maintained within foreign entities of approximately $31,662,035 and $18,210,378, respectively. The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts.\nNETSOL TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nJune 30, 2021 and 2020\nThe Company\u2019s operations are carried out globally. Accordingly, the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations may be influenced by the political, economic and legal environments of each country and by the general state of the country\u2019s economy. The Company\u2019s operations in each foreign country are subject to specific considerations and significant risks not typically associated with companies in economically developed nations. These include risks associated with, among others, the political, economic and legal environments and foreign currency exchange. The Company\u2019s results may be adversely affected by changes in governmental policies with respect to laws and regulations, anti-inflationary measures, currency conversion and remittance abroad, and rates and methods of taxation, among other things.\nAccounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts\nAccounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and are non-interest bearing. The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses inherent in its accounts receivable portfolio. In establishing the required allowance, management regularly reviews the composition of accounts receivable and analyzes customer credit worthiness, customer concentrations, current economic trends and changes in customer payment patterns. Reserves are recorded primarily on a specific identification basis. Account balances are charged off against the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote.\nNotes Receivable\nNotes Receivable that management has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future or until maturity or payoff are reported at the principal balance outstanding, net of purchase premiums and discounts, deferred loan fees and costs, and an allowance for loan losses. Interest income is accrued on the unpaid principal balance. Loan origination fees, net of certain direct origination costs, are deferred and recognized in interest income.\nRevenues in Excess of Billings\nRevenues in excess of billings represent the total of the project to be billed to the customer for revenues recognized per US GAAP. As the customers are billed under the terms of their contract, the corresponding amount is transferred from this account to \u201cAccounts Receivable.\u201d\nInvestments\nThe Company uses the equity investment without readily determinable fair value method to account for investments in businesses that are not publicly traded and for which the Company does not control or have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies. In accordance with this method, these investments are recorded at lower of cost or fair value, as appropriate, and are classified as long-term.\nInvestments held by the Company in businesses that are not publicly traded and for which the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial management are accounted for under the equity method. In accordance with the equity method, these investments are originally recorded at cost and are adjusted for the Company\u2019s proportionate share of earnings, losses and distributions. These investments are classified as long-term.\nThe Company assesses and records impairment losses when events and circumstances indicate the investments might be impaired. Gains and losses are recognized when realized and recorded in other income (expense) in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nNETSOL TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nJune 30, 2021 and 2020\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to earnings as incurred; additions, renewals and betterments are capitalized. When property and equipment are retired or otherwise disposed of, the related cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the respective accounts, and any gain or loss is included in operations. Depreciation is computed using various methods over the estimated useful lives of the assets, ranging from three to twenty years. Following is the summary of estimated useful lives of the assets:\nCategory Estimated Useful Life\nComputer equipment and software 3 to 5 Years\nOffice furniture and equipment 5 to 10 Years\nBuilding 20 Years\nAutos 5 Years\nAssets under capital leases 3 to 10 Years\nImprovements 5 to 10 Years\nThe Company capitalizes costs of materials, consultants, and payroll and payroll-related costs for employees incurred in developing internal-use computer software. These costs are included with \u201cComputer equipment and software.\u201d\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nThe Company tests long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable through the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets. Whenever any such impairment exists, an impairment loss will be recognized for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value.\nIntangible Assets\nIntangible assets consist of product licenses, renewals, enhancements, copyrights, trademarks, trade names, and customer lists. Intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over the estimated useful life and are evaluated for impairment at least on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. The Company assesses recoverability by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through the discounted expected future cash flows. If the future discounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of these assets, the Company recognizes an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets.\nSoftware Development Costs\nCosts incurred to internally develop computer software products or to enhance an existing product are recorded as research and development costs and expensed when incurred until technological feasibility for the respective product is established. Thereafter, all software development costs are capitalized and reported at the lower of unamortized cost or net realizable value. Capitalization ceases when the product or enhancement is available for general release to customers.\nThe Company makes on-going evaluations of the recoverability of its capitalized software projects by comparing the amount capitalized for each product to the estimated present value of expected future net income from the product. If such evaluations indicate that the unamortized software development costs exceed the present value of expected future net income, the Company writes off the amount which the unamortized software development costs exceed such present value. Capitalized and purchased computer software development costs are being amortized ratably based on the projected revenue associated with the related software or on a straight-line basis.\nNETSOL TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nJune 30, 2021 and 2020\nResearch and Development Costs\nResearch and development expenses are comprised of salaries, benefits and overhead expenses of employees involved in software product enhancement and development, cost of outside contractors engaged to perform quality assurance, software product enhancement and development (if any). Development costs are expensed as incurred.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired in a purchase business combination. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill may be impaired. In conducting its annual impairment test, the Company first reviews qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If factors indicate that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the Company performs a quantitative assessment and the fair value of the reporting unit is determined by analyzing the expected present value of future cash flows. If the carrying value of the reporting unit continues to exceed its fair value, the fair value of the reporting unit\u2019s goodwill is calculated and an impairment loss equal to the excess is recorded.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe Company applies the provisions of ASC 820-10, \u201cFair Value Measurements and Disclosures.\u201d ASC 820-10 defines fair value and establishes a three-level valuation hierarchy for disclosures of fair value measurement that enhances disclosure requirements for fair value measures. For certain financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and short-term debt, the carrying amounts approximate fair value due to their relatively short maturities. The carrying amounts of the convertible notes receivable and long-term debt approximate their fair values based on current interest rates for instruments with similar characteristics.\nThe three levels of valuation hierarchy are defined as follows:\nLevel 1: Valuations consist of unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities and has the highest priority.\nLevel 2: Valuations rely on quoted prices in markets that are not active or observable inputs over the full term of the asset or liability.\nLevel 3: Valuations are based on prices or third party or internal valuation models that require inputs that are significant to the fair value measurement and are less observable and thus have the lowest priority.\nNETSOL TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nJune 30, 2021 and 2020\nOur financial assets that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of June 30, 2021 are as follows:\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Assets\nRevenues in excess of billings - long term $ - $ - $ 957,603 $ 957,603\nTotal $ - $ - $ 957,603 $ 957,603\nOur financial assets that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of June 30, 2020, are as follows:\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Assets\nRevenues in excess of billings - long term $ - $ - $ 1,300,289 $ 1,300,289\nTotal $ - $ - $ 1,300,289 $ 1,300,289\nThe reconciliation for the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020 is as follows:\nRevenues in excess of billings - long term Fair value discount Total\nBalance at June 30, 2019 $ 1,380,631 $ (99,139 ) $ 1,281,492\nAmortization during the period - 55,344 55,344\nEffect of Translation Adjustment (39,056 ) 2,509 (36,547 )\nBalance at June 30, 2020 $ 1,341,575 $ (41,286 ) $ 1,300,289\nAdditions 1,023,634 (78,124 ) 945,510\nAmortization during the period - 53,119 53,119\nTransfers to short term (1,341,575 ) - (1,341,575 )\nEffect of Translation Adjustment (488 )\nBalance at June 30, 2021 $ 1,024,382 $ (66,779 ) $ 957,603\nThe Company used the discounted cash flow method with interest rates ranging from 4.65% to 6.25% and 4.35% for the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nManagement analyzes all financial instruments with features of both liabilities and equity under ASC 480, \u201cDistinguishing Liabilities From Equity\u201d and ASC 815, \u201cDerivatives and Hedging.\u201d Derivative liabilities are adjusted to reflect fair value at each period end, with any increase or decrease in the fair value being recorded in results of operations as adjustments to fair value of derivatives. The effects of interactions between embedded derivatives are calculated and accounted for in arriving at the overall fair value of the financial instruments. In addition, the fair values of freestanding derivative instruments such as warrants and option derivatives are valued using the Black-Scholes model.\nUnearned Revenue\nUnearned revenue represents billings in excess of revenue earned on contracts and are recognized on a pro-rata basis over the life of the contract. Unearned revenue was $4,556,626 and $4,095,472 at June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nCost of Revenues\nCost of revenues includes salaries and benefits for technical employees, consultant costs, amortization of capitalized computer software development costs, depreciation of computer and equipment, travel costs, and indirect costs such as rent and insurance.\nNETSOL TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nJune 30, 2021 and 2020\nAdvertising Costs\nThe Company expenses the cost of advertising as incurred. Advertising costs for the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020 were $224,933 and $285,964, respectively.\nShare-Based Compensation\nThe Company records stock compensation in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation. ASC 718 requires companies to measure compensation cost for stock employee compensation at fair value at the grant date and recognize the expense over the employee\u2019s requisite service period. The Company recognizes forfeitures as they occur. The Company recognizes in the statement of operations the grant-date fair value of stock options and other equity-based compensation issued to employees and non-employees.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not these items will either expire before the Company is able to realize their benefits, or that future deductibility is uncertain.\nWhen tax returns are filed, it is highly certain that some positions taken would be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, while others are subject to uncertainty about the merits of the position taken or the amount of the position that would be ultimately sustained. The benefit of a tax position is recognized in the financial statements in the period during which, based on all available evidence, management believes it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes, if any. Tax positions taken are not offset or aggregated with other positions. Tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement with the applicable taxing authority. The portion of the benefits associated with tax positions taken that exceeds the amount measured as described above is reflected as a liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the balance sheets along with any associated interest and penalties that would be payable to the taxing authorities upon examination. Applicable interest and penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefits are classified as additional income taxes in the statements of operations.\nForeign Currency Translation\nThe Company transacts business in various foreign currencies. The accounts of NetSol UK, NTE, AEL, VLSH and VLS use the British Pound; VLSIL uses the Euro; NetSol PK, Connect, Omni and NetSol Innovation use Pakistan Rupees; NTPK Thailand, NetSol Thai and OTOZ Thai use Thai Baht; NetSol Australia uses the Australian dollar; and NetSol Beijing uses the Chinese Yuan as the functional currencies. NetSol Technologies, Inc., and its subsidiaries, NTA and OTOZ, use the U.S. dollar as the functional currency. Consequently, revenues and expenses of operations outside the United States are translated into U.S. Dollars using average exchange rates while assets and liabilities of operations outside the United States are translated into U.S. Dollars using exchange rates at the balance sheet date. The effects of foreign currency translation adjustments are recorded to other comprehensive income.\nNETSOL TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nJune 30, 2021 and 2020\nStatement of Cash Flows\nThe Company\u2019s cash flows from operations are calculated based upon the local currencies. As a result, amounts related to assets and liabilities reported on the statement of cash flows will not necessarily agree with changes in the corresponding balances on the consolidated balance sheet.\nSegment Reporting\nThe Company defines operating segments as components about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performances. The Company allocates its resources and assesses the performance of its sales activities based on the geographic locations of its subsidiaries. (See Note 21 \u201cSegment Information and Geographic Areas\u201d)\nRecent Accounting Standards Adopted by the Company:\nIn January 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) issued ASU 2017-04, Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment. Under the new standard, goodwill impairment would be measured as the amount by which a reporting unit\u2019s carrying value exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying value of goodwill. This ASU eliminates existing guidance that requires an entity to determine goodwill impairment by calculating the implied fair value of goodwill by hypothetically assigning the fair value of a reporting unit to all of its assets and liabilities as if that reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination. This update is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those periods. Early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment test performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017. The Company adopted this standard on July 1, 2020 and the adoption did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. ASU 2016-13 introduced a new forward-looking approach, based on expected losses, to estimate credit losses on certain types of financial instruments, including trade receivables, contract assets and held-to-maturity debt securities, which requires the Company to incorporate considerations of historical information, current information and reasonable and supportable forecasts. ASU 2016-13 also expands disclosure requirements.\nThe Company adopted the standard on July 1, 2020 using the modified retrospective approach. The adoption of ASU 2016-13 resulted in changes to the Company\u2019s accounting policies for trade and other receivables, contract assets and convertible notes receivable. Based on the results of the Company\u2019s evaluation, the adoption of ASU 2016-13 resulted in a one-time cumulative-effect adjustment through retained earnings of $6,784,300 to increase its allowance for credit losses related to the convertible notes receivable, interest receivable, accounts receivable, revenues in excess of billings, and other receivables.\nThe following table presents the impact of adopting ASC Topic 326 as of July 1, 2020:\nAdjustment\nto Adopt\nAsset Classification ASC Topic 326\nAllowance for credit losses - accounts receivable $ 109,486\nAllowance for credit losses - accounts receivable - related party 1,282,505\nAllowance for credit losses - revenue in excess of billings - related party 8,163\nAllowance for credit losses - convertible notes receivable - related party 4,250,000\nAllowance for credit losses - other current assets 1,134,146\n$ 6,784,300\nAccounts receivable includes trade accounts receivables from the Company\u2019s customers, net of an allowance for credit risk. Accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. In establishing the required allowance, management regularly reviews the composition of accounts receivable and analyzes customer credit worthiness, customer concentrations, current economic trends and changes in customer payment patterns. Account balances are charged off against the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote.\nNETSOL TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nJune 30, 2021 and 2020\nRevenue in excess of billings, relates to services performed which were not billed, net of an allowance for credit risk. As customers are billed under the terms of the contract, the corresponding amount is transferred to accounts receivable. In establishing the required allowance, management regularly reviews the composition of and analyzes customer credit worthiness, customer concentrations, current economic trends, changes in customer payment patterns, the project status and assesses individual unbilled contract assets over a specific aging and amount. Account balances are charged off against the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote.\nThe convertible notes receivable represents loans provided to WRLD3D. The allowance for credit risk for the convertible notes is established based on various quantitative and qualitative factors including customer credit worthiness, current economic trends and changes in payment patterns. Account balances are charged off against the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote.\nAccounting Standards Recently Issued but Not Yet Adopted by the Company:\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-12, \u201cIncome Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes\u201d (\u201cASU 2019-12\u201d). ASU 2019-12 removes certain exceptions for recognizing deferred taxes for investments, performing intraperiod allocation and calculating income taxes in interim periods. The ASU also adds guidance to reduce complexity in certain areas, including recognizing deferred taxes for tax goodwill and allocating taxes to members of a consolidated group. This ASU is effective for fiscal years (and interim periods within those fiscal years) beginning after December 15, 2020, which for the Company is the first quarter of fiscal 2022. Early adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect this update to have a material impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn August 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-06, \u201cDebt-Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging-Contracts in Entity\u2019s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity\u2019s Own Equity\u201d (\u201cASU 2020-06\u201d). ASU 2020-06 reduces the number of accounting models for convertible debt instruments and convertible preferred stock and results in fewer instruments with embedded conversion features being separately recognized from the host contract as compared with current standards. Those instruments that do not have a separately recognized embedded conversion feature will no longer recognize a debt issuance discount related to such a conversion feature and would recognize less interest expense on a periodic basis. Additionally, the ASU amends the calculation of the share dilution impact related to a conversion feature and eliminates the treasury method as an option. For instruments that do not have a component mandatorily settled in cash, the change will likely result in a higher amount of share dilution in the calculation of earnings per share. This ASU is effective for fiscal years (and interim periods within those fiscal years) beginning after December 15, 2021, which for the Company is the first quarter of fiscal 2023, with early adoption permitted beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. The Company is currently assessing the impact and timing of adoption of this ASU.\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting, which provides practical expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. The elective amendments provide expedients to contract modification, affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. The expedients and exceptions provided by this guidance apply only to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions that reference the London interbank offered rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) or another reference rate expected to be discontinued as a result of reference rate reform. This guidance is not applicable to contract modifications made and hedging relationships entered into or evaluated after December 31, 2022. The guidance can be applied immediately through December 31, 2022. The Company will adopt this standard when LIBOR is discontinued and does not expect a material impact to its financial condition, results of operations or disclosures based on the current debt portfolio and capital structure.\nAll other newly issued accounting pronouncements not yet effective have been deemed either immaterial or not applicable.\nNETSOL TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nJune 30, 2021 and 2020\nNOTE 3 - REVENUE RECOGNITION\nThe Company determines revenue recognition through the following steps:\n\u25cf Identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer;\n\u25cf Identification of the performance obligations in the contract;\n\u25cf Determination of the transaction price;\n\u25cf Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and\n\u25cf Recognition of revenue when, or as, the Company satisfies a performance obligation.\nThe Company records the amount of revenue and related costs by considering whether the entity is a principal (gross presentation) or an agent (net presentation) by evaluating the nature of its promise to the customer. Revenue is presented net of sales, value-added and other taxes collected from customers and remitted to government authorities.\nThe Company has two primary revenue streams: core revenue and non-core revenue.\nCore Revenue\nThe Company generates its core revenue from the following sources: (1) software licenses, (2) services, which include implementation and consulting services, and (3) subscription and support, which includes post contract support, of its enterprise software solutions for the lease and finance industry. The Company offers its software using the same underlying technology via two models: a traditional on-premises licensing model and a subscription model. The on-premises model involves the sale or license of software on a perpetual basis to customers who take possession of the software and install and maintain the software on their own hardware. Under the subscription delivery model, the Company provides access to its software on a hosted basis as a service and customers generally do not have the contractual right to take possession of the software.\nNon-Core Revenue\nThe Company generates its non-core revenue by providing business process outsourcing (\u201cBPO\u201d), other IT services and internet services.\nPerformance Obligations\nA performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer and is the unit of account under Topic 606. The transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied by transferring the promised good or service to the customer. The Company identifies and tracks the performance obligations at contract inception so that the Company can monitor and account for the performance obligations over the life of the contract.\nThe Company\u2019s contracts which contain multiple performance obligations generally consist of the initial purchase of subscription or licenses and a professional services engagement. License purchases generally have multiple performance obligations as customers purchase post contract support and services in addition to the licenses. The Company\u2019s single performance obligation arrangements are typically post contract support renewals, subscription renewals and services engagements.\nFor contracts with multiple performance obligations where the contracted price differs from the standalone selling price (\u201cSSP\u201d) for any distinct good or service, the Company may be required to allocate the contract\u2019s transaction price to each performance obligation using its best estimate for the SSP.\nSoftware Licenses\nTransfer of control for software is considered to have occurred upon delivery of the product to the customer. The Company\u2019s typical payment terms tend to vary by region, but its standard payment terms are within 30 days of invoice.\nNETSOL TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nJune 30, 2021 and 2020\nSubscription\nSubscription revenue is recognized ratably over the initial subscription period committed to by the customer commencing when the product is made available to the customer. The initial subscription period is typically 12 to 60 months. The Company generally invoices its customers in advance in quarterly or annual installments and typical payment terms provide that customers make payment within 30 days of invoice.\nPost Contract Support\nRevenue from support services and product updates, referred to as subscription and support revenue, is recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance period, which in most instances is one year. Software license updates provide customers with rights to unspecified software product updates and patches released during the term of the support period on a when-and-if available basis. The Company\u2019s customers purchase both product support and license updates when they acquire new software licenses. In addition, a majority of customers renew their support services contracts annually and typical payment terms provide that customers make payment within 30 days of invoice.\nProfessional Services\nRevenue from professional services is typically comprised of implementation, development, data migration, training or other consulting services. Consulting services are generally sold on a time-and-materials or fixed fee basis and can include services ranging from software installation to data conversion and building non-complex interfaces to allow the software to operate in integrated environments. The Company recognizes revenue for time-and-materials arrangements as the services are performed. In fixed fee arrangements, revenue is recognized as services are performed as measured by costs incurred to date, compared to total estimated costs to complete the services project. Management applies judgment when estimating project status and the costs necessary to complete the services projects. A number of internal and external factors can affect these estimates, including labor rates, utilization and efficiency variances and specification and testing requirement changes. Services are generally invoiced upon milestones in the contract or upon consumption of the hourly resources and payments are typically due 30 days after invoice.\nBPO and Internet Services\nRevenue from BPO services is recognized based on the stage of completion which is measured by reference to labor hours incurred to date as a percentage of total estimated labor hours for each contract. Internet services are invoiced either monthly, quarterly or half yearly in advance to the customers and revenue is recognized ratably overtime on a monthly basis.\nDisaggregated Revenue\nThe Company disaggregates revenue from contracts with customers by category - core and non-core, as it believes it best depicts how the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors.\nNETSOL TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nJune 30, 2021 and 2020\nThe Company\u2019s disaggregated revenue by category is as follows:\nFor the Years\nEnded June 30,\nCore:\nLicense $ 6,249,924 $ 3,260,891\nSubscription and support 22,173,745 20,254,917\nServices 20,139,320 25,713,554\nServices - related party 48,775 300,821\nTotal core revenue, net 48,611,764 49,530,183\nNon-Core:\nServices 6,308,851 6,842,136\nTotal non-core revenue, net 6,308,851 6,842,136\nTotal net revenue $ 54,920,615 $ 56,372,319\nSignificant Judgments\nMore judgments and estimates are required under Topic 606 than were required under Topic 605. Due to the complexity of certain contracts, the actual revenue recognition treatment required under Topic 606 for the Company\u2019s arrangements may be dependent on contract-specific terms and may vary in some instances.\nJudgment is required to determine the SSP for each distinct performance obligation. The Company rarely licenses or sells products on a stand-alone basis, so the Company is required to estimate the range of SSPs for each performance obligation. In instances where SSP is not directly observable because the Company does not sell the license, product or service separately, the Company determines the SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. In making these judgments, the Company analyzes various factors, including its pricing methodology and consistency, size of the arrangement, length of term, customer demographics and overall market and economic conditions. Based on these results, the estimated SSP is set for each distinct product or service delivered to customers.\nThe most significant inputs involved in the Company\u2019s revenue recognition policies are: The (1) stand-alone selling prices of the Company\u2019s software license, and the (2) the method of recognizing revenue for installation/customization, and other services.\nThe stand-alone selling price of the licenses was measured primarily through an analysis of pricing that management evaluated when quoting prices to customers. Although the Company has no history of selling its software separately from post contract support and other services, the Company does have historical experience with amending contracts with customers to provide additional modules of its software or providing those modules at an optional price. This information guides the Company in assessing the stand-alone selling price of the Company\u2019s software, since the Company can observe instances where a customer had a particular component of the Company\u2019s software that was essentially priced separate from other goods and services that the Company delivered to that customer.\nThe Company recognizes revenue from implementation and customization services using the percentage of estimated \u201cman-days\u201d that the work requires. The Company believes the level of effort to complete the services is best measured by the amount of time (measured as an employee working for one day on implementation/customization work) that is required to complete the implementation or customization work. The Company reviews its estimate of man-days required to complete implementation and customization services each reporting period.\nNETSOL TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nJune 30, 2021 and 2020\nRevenue is recognized over time for the Company\u2019s subscription, post contract support and fixed fee professional services that are separate performance obligations. For the Company\u2019s professional services, revenue is recognized over time, generally using costs incurred or hours expended to measure progress. Judgment is required in estimating project status and the costs necessary to complete projects. A number of internal and external factors can affect these estimates, including labor rates, utilization, specification variances and testing requirement changes.\nIf a group of agreements are entered at or near the same time and so closely related that they are, in effect, part of a single arrangement, such agreements are deemed to be combined as one arrangement for revenue recognition purposes. The Company exercises significant judgment to evaluate the relevant facts and circumstances in determining whether agreements should be accounted for separately or as a single arrangement. The Company\u2019s judgments about whether a group of contracts comprise a single arrangement can affect the allocation of consideration to the distinct performance obligations, which could have an effect on results of operations for the periods involved.\nIf a contract includes variable consideration, the Company exercises judgment in estimating the amount of consideration to which the entity will be entitled in exchange for transferring the promised goods or services to a customer. When estimating variable consideration, the Company will consider all relevant facts and circumstances. Variable consideration will be estimated and included in the contract price only when it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of revenue recognized will not occur.\nContract Balances\nThe timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to customers and these timing differences result in receivables, contract assets (revenues in excess of billings), or contract liabilities (deferred revenue) on the Company\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company records revenues in excess of billings when the Company has transferred goods or services but does not yet have the right to consideration. The Company records deferred revenue when the Company has received or has the right to receive consideration but has not yet transferred goods or services to the customer.\nThe revenues in excess of billings are transferred to receivables when the rights to consideration become unconditional, usually upon completion of a milestone.\nThe Company\u2019s revenues in excess of billings and unearned revenue are as follows:\nAs of As of\nJune 30, 2021 June 30, 2020\nRevenues in excess of billings $ 15,637,734 $ 18,506,733\nUnearned revenue $ 4,556,626 $ 4,095,472\nDuring the year ended June 30, 2021, the Company recognized revenue of $4,087,373, which was included in the deferred revenue balance at the beginning of the period. All other activity in deferred revenue is due to the timing of invoicing in relation to the timing of revenue recognition.\nNETSOL TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nJune 30, 2021 and 2020\nRevenue allocated to remaining performance obligations represents the transaction price allocated to the performance obligations that are unsatisfied, or partially unsatisfied, which includes unearned revenue and amounts that will be invoiced and recognized as revenue in future periods. Contracted but unsatisfied performance obligations were approximately $48,314,683 as of June 30, 2021, of which the Company estimates to recognize approximately $15,603,135 in revenue over the next 12 months and the remainder over an estimated 6 years thereafter. Actual revenue recognition depends in part on the timing of software modules installed at various customer sites. Accordingly, some factors that affect the Company\u2019s revenue, such as the availability and demand for modules within customer geographic locations, is not entirely within the Company\u2019s control. In instances where the timing of revenue recognition differs from the timing of invoicing, the Company has determined that its contracts generally do not include a significant financing component. The primary purpose of invoicing terms is to provide customers with simplified and predictable ways of purchasing the Company\u2019s products and services, and not to facilitate financing arrangements.\nUnearned Revenue\nThe Company typically invoices its customers for subscription and support fees in advance on a quarterly or annual basis, with payment due at the start of the subscription or support term. Unpaid invoice amounts for non-cancelable license and services starting in future periods are included in accounts receivable and unearned revenue.\nPractical Expedients and Exemptions\nThere are several practical expedients and exemptions allowed under Topic 606 that impact timing of revenue recognition and the Company\u2019s disclosures. The Company has applied the following practical expedients:\n\u25cf The Company does not evaluate a contract for a significant financing component if payment is expected within one year or less from the transfer of the promised items to the customer.\n\u25cf The Company generally expenses sales commissions and sales agent fees when incurred when the amortization period would have been one year or less or the commissions are based on cashed received. These costs are recorded within sales and marketing expense in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.\n\u25cf The Company does not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for contracts for which the Company recognizes revenue at the amount to which it has the right to invoice for services performed (applies to time-and-material engagements).\nCosts to Obtain a Contract\nThe Company does not have a material amount of costs to obtain a contract capitalized at any balance sheet date. In general, the Company incurs few direct incremental costs of obtaining new customer contracts. The Company rarely incurs incremental costs to review or otherwise enter into contractual arrangements with customers. In addition, the Company\u2019s sales personnel receive fees that are referred to as commissions, but that are based on more than simply signing up new customers. The Company\u2019s sales personnel are required to perform additional duties beyond new customer contract inception dates, including fulfillment duties and collections efforts.\nNETSOL TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nJune 30, 2021 and 2020\nNOTE 4 - EARNINGS PER SHARE\nBasic earnings per share are computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period.

For certain leases, the Company has options to extend the lease term for additional periods ranging from one year to 10 years.\nThe Company treats a contract as a lease when the contract conveys the right to use a physically distinct asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration, or the Company directs the use of the asset and obtains substantially all the economic benefits of the asset. These leases are recorded as right-of-use (\u201cROU\u201d) assets and lease obligation liabilities for leases with terms greater than 12 months. ROU assets represent the Company\u2019s right to use an underlying asset for the entirety of the lease term. Lease liabilities represent the Company\u2019s obligation to make payments over the life of the lease. A ROU asset and a lease liability are recognized at commencement of the lease based on the present value of the lease payments over the life of the lease. Initial direct costs are included as part of the ROU asset upon commencement of the lease. Since the interest rate implicit in a lease is generally not readily determinable for the operating leases, the Company uses an incremental borrowing rate to determine the present value of the lease payments. The incremental borrowing rate represents the rate of interest the Company would have to pay to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar lease term to obtain an asset of similar value. The Company used the incremental borrowing rate on July 1, 2019 for all leases that commenced prior to that date. For finance leases, the Company used the incremental borrowing rate implicit in the lease.\nThe Company reviews the impairment of ROU assets consistent with the approach applied for the Company\u2019s other long-lived assets. The Company reviews the recoverability of long-lived assets when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. The assessment of possible impairment is based on the Company\u2019s ability to recover the carrying value of the asset from the expected undiscounted future pre-tax cash flows of the related operations.\nThe Company elected the practical expedient to exclude short-term leases (leases with original terms of 12 months or less) from ROU asset and lease liability accounts.\nLease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term, while variable lease payments are expensed as incurred. Variable payments change due to facts or circumstances occurring after the commencement date, other than the passage of time, and do not result in a re-measurement of lease liabilities. The Company\u2019s variable lease payments include payments for finance leases that are adjusted based on a change in the Karachi Inter Bank Offer Rate. The Company\u2019s lease agreements do not contain any significant residual value guarantees or restrictive covenants.\nSupplemental balance sheet information related to leases was as follows:\nAs of As of\nJune 30, 2021 June 30, 2020\nAssets\nOperating lease assets, net $ 1,345,869 $ 2,360,129\nLiabilities\nCurrent\nOperating $ 857,729 $ 1,111,912\nNon-current\nOperating 564,257 1,339,965\nTotal Lease Liabilities $ 1,421,986 $ 2,451,877\nNETSOL TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nJune 30, 2021 and 2020\nThe components of lease cost were as follows:\nFor the Years\nEnded June 30,\nAmortization of finance lease assets $ 186,721 $ 253,071\nInterest on finance lease obligation 32,675 81,907\nOperating lease cost 1,271,947 1,258,102\nShort term lease cost 91,705 282,806\nSub lease income (35,740 ) (33,426 )\nTotal lease cost $ 1,547,308 $ 1,842,460\nLease term and discount rate were as follows:\nAs of As of\nJune 30, 2021 June 30, 2020\nWeighted average remaining lease term - Operating leases 1.78 Years 2.45 Years\nWeighted average discount rate - Operating leases 5.7 % 5.6 %\nSupplemental disclosures of cash flow information related to leases were as follows:\nFor the Years\nEnded June 30\nCash flows related to lease liabilities\nOperating cash flows related to operating leases $ 1,182,028 $ 1,263,089\nOperating cash flows from finance leases $ 25,338 $ 72,999\nFinancing cash flows from finance leases $ 334,939 $ 324,723\nNETSOL TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nJune 30, 2021 and 2020\nMaturities of operating lease liabilities were as follows as of June 30, 2021:\nAmount\nWithin year 1 $ 911,760\nWithin year 2 496,700\nWithin year 3 82,282\nWithin year 4\nWithin year 5\nThereafter 2,505\nTotal Lease Payments 1,494,917\nLess: Imputed interest (72,931 )\nPresent Value of lease liabilities 1,421,986\nLess: Current portion (857,729 )\nNon-Current portion $ 564,257\nThe Company is a lessor for certain office space leased by the Company and sub-leased to others under non-cancelable leases.

Options granted under these Plans to an employee of the Company become exercisable over a period of no longer than ten (10) years and no less than twenty percent (20%) of the shares are exercisable annually. Options are not exercisable, in whole or in part, prior to one (1) year from the date of grant unless the Board of Directors specifically determines otherwise, as provided.\nTwo types of options may be granted under these Plans: (1) Incentive Stock Options (also known as Qualified Stock Options) which may only be issued to employees of the Company and whereby the exercise price of the option is not less than the fair market value of the common stock on the date it was reserved for issuance under the Plan; and (2) Non-statutory Stock Options which may be issued to either employees or consultants of the Company and whereby the exercise price of the option may be less than the fair market value of the common stock on the date it was reserved for issuance under the plan. Grants of options may be made to employees and consultants without regard to any performance measures. All options issued pursuant to the Plan are nontransferable and subject to forfeiture.\nThe Plans provide for the grant of equity-based awards, including options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock awards or performance share awards or any other right or interest relating to shares or cash, to eligible participants. The Plans contemplate the issuance of common stock upon exercise of options or other awards granted to eligible persons under the Plans. Shares issued under the Plans may be both authorized and unissued shares or previously issued shares acquired by the Company. Upon termination or expiration of an unexercised option, stock appreciation right or other stock-based award under the Plans, in whole or in part, the number of shares of common stock subject to such award again becomes available for grant under the Plans. Any shares of restricted stock forfeited as described below will become available for grant. The maximum number of shares that may be granted to any one participant in any calendar year may not exceed 50,000 shares. All options issued pursuant to the Plan are nontransferable and subject to forfeiture.\nOptions granted under the Plans are not generally transferable and must be exercised within 10 years, subject to earlier termination upon termination of the option holder\u2019s employment, but in no event later than the expiration of the option\u2019s term. The exercise price of each option may not be less than the fair market value of a share of the Company\u2019s common stock on the date of grant (except in connection with the assumption or substitution for another option in a manner qualifying under Section 424(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.\nNETSOL TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nJune 30, 2021 and 2020\nIncentive stock options granted to any participant who owns 10% or more of the Company\u2019s outstanding common stock (a \u201cTen Percent Shareholder\u201d) must have an exercise price equal to or exceeding 110% of the fair market value of a share of our common stock on the date of the grant and must not be exercisable for longer than five years. Options become vested and exercisable at such times or upon such events and subject to such terms, conditions, performance criteria or restrictions as specified by the Board of Directors. The maximum term of any option granted under the 2015 Plan is ten years, provided that an incentive stock option granted to a Ten Percent Shareholder must have a term not exceeding five years.\nUnder the Plans, a participant may also be awarded a \u201cperformance award,\u201d which means that the participant may receive cash, stock or other awards contingent upon achieving performance goals established by the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors may also make \u201cdeferred share\u201d awards, which entitle the participant to receive the Company\u2019s stock in the future for services performed between the date of the award and the date the participant may receive the stock. The vesting of deferred share awards may be based on performance criteria and/or continued service with the Company. A participant who is granted a \u201cstock appreciation right\u201d under the Plan has the right to receive all or a percentage of the fair market value of a share of stock on the date of exercise of the stock appreciation right minus the grant price of the stock appreciation right determined by the Board of Directors (but in no event less than the fair market value of the stock on the date of grant). Finally, the Board of Directors may make \u201crestricted stock\u201d awards under the Plans, which are subject to such terms and conditions as the Board of Directors determines and as are set forth in the award agreement related to the restricted stock.

The Company defends itself vigorously against any such claims. When (i) it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and (ii) the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated, the Company records the estimated loss. The Company provides disclosure in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for loss contingencies that do not meet both conditions if there is a reasonable possibility that a loss may have been incurred that would be material to the financial statements. Significant judgment is required to determine the probability that a liability has been incurred and whether such liability is reasonably estimable. The Company bases accruals on the best information available at the time, which can be highly subjective. The final outcome of these matters could vary significantly from the amounts included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nNETSOL TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nJune 30, 2021 and 2020\nNOTE 20 - RETIREMENT PLANS\nThe Company and its subsidiaries have varying defined contribution plans based on country specific laws.

The reportable segments are business units located in different global regions.
