We wish to caution readers that certain important factors may have affected and could in the future affect our actual results and could cause actual results to differ significantly from those expressed in any forward-looking statement. The following is a summary of our principal risks, as set forth in the section entitled \u201c",
    "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nBusiness Risks\nWe may not be able to continue as a going concern.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of $248.7 million, cash and cash equivalents of $9.3 million, current liabilities of $24.9 million and generated a net loss of $17.3 million. We have incurred losses since inception and expect to continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future. As of December 31, 2020, our cash and cash equivalents balance is not sufficient to fund our planned operations for at least a year beyond the date of the financial statements included in this report. These factors raise doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern and therefore it may be more difficult for us to attract investors. The ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to obtain the necessary financing to meet our obligations and repay our liabilities arising from normal business operations when they become due. Despite our ability to secure capital in the past, we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain additional debt or equity financing on favorable terms, if at all. Furthermore, if we raise additional equity financing, our shareholders may experience significant dilution of their ownership interests. If we engage in debt financing, we may be required to accept terms that restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness, force us to maintain specified liquidity or other ratios or restrict our ability to pay dividends or make acquisitions.\nWe have a history of losses and may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability.\nWe have a history of incurring net losses, including net losses of $17.3 million and $18.0 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively. As a result, we had an accumulated deficit of $248.7 million as of December 31, 2020. Achieving profitability will require us to increase revenue, manage our cost structure, and avoid unanticipated liabilities. We have made and expect to continue to make significant expenditures to develop and expand our business and we do not expect to be profitable in the near term. Revenue growth may slow or revenue may decline for a number of possible reasons, including slowing demand for our solutions, increasing competition, expense reductions, a decrease in the growth of our overall market, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, or if we fail for any reason to continue to capitalize on growth opportunities. Any failure by us to obtain and sustain profitability, or to continue our revenue growth, could cause the price of our ordinary shares to decline significantly.\nOur indebtedness may have an adverse effect on our business or limit our ability to take advantage of business, strategic or financing opportunities; our debt instruments contain certain events of default which, if triggered, may result in acceleration of our debt.\nOn March 19, 2020, we issued $10.25 million aggregate principal amount of our 5.75% convertible debentures due March 19, 2024 (the \u201cConvertible Debentures\u201d). On December 5, 2018, we issued $10.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.75% convertible notes due December 5, 2021 (the \u201cConvertible Notes\u201d). Our Convertible Debentures and Convertible Notes contain certain covenants with which we must comply and events of default which, if triggered, may result in the Convertible Debentures and/or Convertible Notes becoming immediately due and payable. These events of default include, but are not limited to, failure to pay interest and principal when due, failure to perform any term, covenant or agreement contained in the Convertible Debentures or Convertible Notes, certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization, and certain defaults on our obligations under other debt instruments. In addition, as long as the Convertible Debentures and Convertible Notes are outstanding, we must obtain consent of the holders in order to take the following actions as required by the respective debt instruments:\n\u25cf incur certain additional indebtedness or guarantee indebtedness;\n\u25cf create certain liens;\n\u25cf sell certain assets;\n\u25cf make certain amendments to our charter documents;\n\u25cf repay, repurchase, or acquire ordinary shares or indebtedness except under certain circumstances;\n\u25cf pay cash dividends or distributions on any equity securities; or\n\u25cf enter into transactions with affiliates, with certain exceptions.\nThese consent requirements could restrict us from taking any of the above actions that we believe to be in our best interests and could adversely affect our ability to obtain additional financing, engage in certain business activities, take advantage of business opportunities, or otherwise execute our business strategies. In addition, our ability to comply with the terms of the Convertible Debentures and the Convertible Notes may be affected by general economic conditions, industry conditions, and other events beyond our control. As a result, we cannot assure you that we will be able to comply with these terms. Failure to comply with the terms of the Convertible Debentures or the Convertible Notes could result in a default under these debt instruments, upon which the outstanding debt would become immediately due and payable. This could have serious consequences to our financial condition and results of operations. We cannot assure you that our assets or cash flow would be sufficient to repay our obligations under the Convertible Debentures or the Convertible Notes if accelerated upon an event of default, or that we would be able to borrow sufficient funds to refinance these debt instruments.\nWe do not anticipate that we will have sufficient funds to pay the principal of the Convertible Notes on their maturity date in December 2021, and the inability to restructure or refinance the Convertible Notes on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nThe Convertible Notes ($10.0 million aggregate principal amount) mature in December 2021. We do not anticipate that we will have sufficient funds to pay the principal of the Convertible Notes on their maturity date. The inability to restructure or borrow sufficient funds to refinance the Convertible Notes on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, would have serious consequences to our financial condition and results of operations.\nIf the internet security market does not accept our cloud-based product offerings, our sales will not grow as quickly as anticipated, or at all, and our business, results of operations and financial condition would be harmed.\nOur success will depend to a substantial extent on the willingness of enterprises to increase their acceptance and use of cloud computing services. The market for email security solutions delivered as a service is still at an early stage relative to on-premise solutions, and these applications may not achieve and sustain high levels of demand and market acceptance. In particular, there is no assurance that our recently released Cyren Inbox Security will generate a high level of demand or achieve market acceptance.\nHistorically, companies have used appliance-based security products, such as firewalls, intrusion prevention systems, or IPS, anti-virus, or AV, and web and messaging gateways, for their IT security. These enterprises may be hesitant to purchase our cloud-based security offering if they believe that signature-based products, or our competitors\u2019 products, are more cost-effective, provide substantially the same functionality or otherwise provide a sufficient level of IT security. Many enterprises have invested substantial personnel and financial resources to integrate traditional enterprise software or hardware appliances for these applications into their businesses, and currently, most enterprises have not allocated a fixed portion of their budgets to protect against next-generation advanced cyber attacks. As a result, to expand our customer base, we need to convince potential customers to allocate a portion of their discretionary budgets to purchase our products and services. If we do not succeed in convincing customers that our offerings should be an integral part of their overall approach to IT security, our sales will not grow as quickly as anticipated, or at all, which would have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, many enterprises may be reluctant or unwilling to use cloud computing services because they have concerns regarding the risks associated with its reliability and security, among other things, of this delivery model, or its ability to help them comply with applicable laws and regulations. If enterprises do not perceive the benefits of this delivery model, then the market for our services and our sales would not grow as quickly as we anticipate or at all and our business, results of operations and financial condition would be harmed.\nIf the market does not continue to respond favorably to our traditional Threat Intelligence Service security solutions, including our Threat Detection Services and Threat Intelligence Feeds, or future services do not gain acceptance, we will fail to generate sufficient revenues.\nOur success depends on the continued acceptance and use of our Threat Intelligence Service security solutions by current and new businesses, Original Equipment Manufacturers (\u201cOEMs\u201d), and service provider customers, plus the interest of such customers in our newest offerings. As the markets for email, antivirus and web security products continue to mature and consolidate, we are seeing increasing competitive pressures and demands for even higher quality products at lower prices. This increasing demand comes at a time when internet security threats are more varied and intensive, challenging top end solutions to keep their performance at an industry-acceptable level of accuracy. If our solutions do not continue to evolve to meet market demand, or newer products on the market prove more effective, our business could fail. Also, if growth in the markets for these solutions begins to slow, our business, results of operations and financial condition will suffer dramatically.\nIf we are unable to effectively integrate future investments and acquisitions, our business operations and financial results will suffer.\nOur success will depend, in part, on our ability to expand our service and product offerings and grow our business in response to changing technologies, customer demands and competitive pressures. In some circumstances, we may decide to do so through the acquisition of complementary businesses and technologies rather than through internal development, including, for example, our 2012 acquisition of the antivirus business of the Icelandic company, Frisk Software International (\u201cFrisk\u201d) and the German internet security company eleven GmbH (\u201celeven\u201d).\nIf we encounter further difficulties or unforeseen expenditures in integrating the business, technologies, products, personnel, or operations of any company that we acquire, the revenue and operating results of the combined company could be adversely affected. The risks we face in connection with acquisitions include:\n\u25cf disruption of our ongoing business, diversion of resources, increased expenses, and distraction of our management from operating our business to addressing acquisition integration challenges;\n\u25cf additional legal and regulatory compliance;\n\u25cf cultural challenges associated with integrating employees from the acquired companies into our organization;\n\u25cf inability to retain key employees from the acquired companies;\n\u25cf inability to strengthen our competitive position, achieve our strategic goals, generate sufficient financial return to offset acquisition costs or realize the expected benefits of the acquisition;\n\u25cf failure to identify significant problems or liabilities, including liabilities resulting from the acquired companies\u2019 pre-acquisition failure to comply with applicable laws, during our pre-acquisition due diligence;\n\u25cf difficulties related to our entry into geographic or business markets in which we have little or no prior experience or where competitors have stronger market positions;\n\u25cf difficulties in, or inability to, successfully sell any acquired products or services;\n\u25cf difficulties with the coordination of research and development, sales and marketing, accounting, human resources, and other general and administrative systems;\n\u25cf changes in relationships with strategic partners as a result of product acquisitions or strategic positioning resulting from the acquisitions;\n\u25cf liability for activities of the acquired companies before the acquisition, including intellectual property infringement claims, violations of laws, commercial disputes, tax liabilities and litigation; and\n\u25cf unanticipated write-offs or charges.\nThe occurrence of any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business operations and financial results.\nWe face intense competition and could lose market share to our competitors, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe market for security products and services is intensely competitive and characterized by rapid changes in technology, customer requirements, industry standards and frequent new product introductions and improvements. We anticipate continued challenges from current competitors as well as by new entrants into the industry. If we are unable to anticipate or effectively react to these competitive challenges, our competitive position could weaken, and we could experience a decline in our revenue that could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nMany of our existing competitors have, and some of our potential competitors could have, substantial competitive advantages such as:\n\u25cf greater name recognition and larger customer bases;\n\u25cf larger sales and marketing budgets and resources;\n\u25cf broader distribution and established relationships with channel and distribution partners and customers;\n\u25cf greater customer support resources;\n\u25cf lower labor and research and development costs; and\n\u25cf substantially greater financial, technical, and other resources.\nIn addition, some of our larger competitors have substantially broader product offerings and may be able to leverage their relationships with distribution partners and customers based on other products or incorporate functionality into existing products to gain business in a manner that may discourage users from purchasing our products, subscriptions and services, including by selling at zero or negative margins, product bundling or offering closed technology platforms.\nPotential customers may also prefer to purchase from their existing suppliers rather than a new supplier regardless of product performance or features. As a result, even if the features of our offerings are superior, customers may not purchase our services or products. In addition, innovative start-up companies, and larger companies that are making significant investments in research and development, may invent similar or superior products and technologies that compete with our product and services. Our current and potential competitors may also establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties that may further enhance their resources. If we are unable to compete successfully, or if competing successfully requires us to take costly actions in response to the actions of our competitors, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nSome of our competitors have acquired businesses that may allow them to offer more directly competitive and comprehensive solutions than they had previously offered. As a result of such acquisitions, our current or potential competitors might be able to adapt more quickly to new technologies and end user needs, devote greater resources to the promotion or sale of their products and services, initiate or withstand substantial price competition, take advantage of acquisitions or other opportunities more readily, or develop and expand their product and service offerings more quickly than we can. Due to various reasons, organizations may be more willing to incrementally add solutions to their existing security infrastructure from competitors than to replace it with our solutions. These competitive pressures in our market or our failure to compete effectively may result in price reductions, fewer orders, reduced revenue and gross margins, and loss of market share. Any failure to meet and address these factors could seriously harm our business and operating results.\nAlso, many of our smaller competitors that specialize in providing protection from a single type of business security threat may deliver these specialized business security products to the market more quickly than we can or may introduce innovative new products or enhancements before we do. Conditions in our markets could change rapidly and significantly as a result of technological advancements.\nIf we are unable to enhance our existing solutions and develop new solutions, our growth will be impeded.\nOur ability to attract new customers and increase revenue from existing customers will depend in large part on our ability to enhance and improve our existing solutions and to introduce new solutions. The success of any enhancement or new solution depends on several factors, including the timely completion, introduction and market acceptance of the enhancement or solution. Any enhancement or solution we develop or acquire may not be introduced in a timely or cost-effective manner and may not achieve the broad market acceptance necessary to generate significant revenue. If we are unable to successfully develop or acquire new solutions or enhance our existing solutions to meet customer requirements, we may not grow as expected.\nWe cannot be certain that our development activities will be successful or that we will not incur delays or cost overruns. Furthermore, we may not have sufficient financial resources to identify and develop new technologies and bring enhancements or new solutions to market in a timely and cost-effective manner. New technologies and enhancements could be delayed or cost more than we expect, and we cannot ensure that any of these solutions will be commercially successful if and when they are introduced.\nA loss of any of our large customers could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn the year ended December 31, 2020, our three largest customers accounted for approximately 34% of our annual revenues (including our largest customer that accounted for approximately 23% of total revenue). A significant reduction in revenue in the future from these major customers could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. In the fourth quarter of 2020, we received notification that our largest customer will renew one of their contracts for another three years through the first quarter of 2024, but that it does not intend to renew its largest contract with the Company beginning April 2021. As a result, we anticipate that quarterly revenues from this customer will drop from over 20% currently to approximately 14% of quarterly revenue beginning in the second quarter of 2021. In addition, if one or more of our major customers were to develop its own competing technology or to experience economic difficulties, changes in purchasing policies or difficulties in fulfilling their obligations to us, our financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nAdverse conditions in the national and global financial markets could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nOur financial performance depends, in part, on the state of the economy, which may deteriorate in the future including, as a result of the spread or fear of spread of contagious diseases (such as the COVID-19 pandemic). Challenging economic conditions worldwide have from time to time contributed, and may continue to contribute, to slowdowns in the information technology industry, resulting in reduced demand for our solutions as a result of continued constraints on IT-related capital spending by our customers and increased price competition for our solutions. Additionally, concerns regarding the effects of the \u201cBrexit\u201d decision, uncertainties related to changes in public policies such as domestic and international regulations, taxes or international trade agreements as well as geopolitical turmoil and other disruptions to global and regional economies and markets in many parts of the world, have and may continue to put pressure on global economic conditions and overall spending on IT security.\nIf the economies of countries in which our customers and potential customers are located weaken, our customers may reduce or postpone their spending significantly. This could result in reductions in sales of our services and longer sales cycles, slower adoption of new technologies and increased price competition. In addition, weakness in the end user market could negatively affect the cash flow of our OEM and service provider partners, distributors and resellers who could, in turn, delay paying their obligations to us. This would increase our credit risk exposure and cause delays in our recognition of revenues on future sales to these customers. Specific economic trends, such as declines in the demand for PCs, servers, and other computing devices, or weakness in corporate information technology spending, could have a more direct impact on our business. Any of these events would likely harm our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nThe outbreak of COVID-19 and its international spread has affected how we operate our business, and the duration and the extent to which it will impact future results of operations and overall financial performance is unknown.\nPandemics and epidemics such as the current COVID-19 outbreak or other widespread public health problems could negatively impact our business. The current outbreak of COVID-19 has had widespread impacts on the overall economy, buying patterns of partners and potential customers, and business operations and continues to present concerns that may dramatically affect our ability to conduct our business effectively, including, but not limited to, our inability to travel to various destinations due to travel restrictions and quarantine requirements, attend certain industry-related conferences and effectively maintain ongoing sales operations. For employees continuing critical on-site work, we have implemented additional safety measures such as limiting the number of people present each day on-site, social distancing, use of face masks, and frequent disinfection of shared spaces. Any additional precautionary measures may negatively impact our sales, operating results and business.\nA significant reduction in global economic activity may result in reduced IT budgets, including for cyber security software. While the ultimate impact of the COVID-19 outbreak is highly uncertain and subject to change, a significant duration of the COVID-19 outbreak and related government actions will impact many aspects of our business. Additionally, if the COVID-19 pandemic has had or continues to have a substantial impact on our partners and customers, our overall financial performance and operations may be negatively impacted. If a significant percentage of our workforce is unable to work, either because of illness or travel or government restrictions in connection with the COVID-19 outbreak, our operations may be negatively impacted.\nIf the perceived general level of advanced cyber attacks declines, demand for our solutions may decrease, our cost of doing business may increase and our business could be harmed.\nOur business is substantially dependent on enterprises recognizing that advanced cyber attacks are pervasive and are not effectively prevented by legacy security solutions. High visibility attacks on prominent enterprises and governments have increased market awareness of the problem of advanced cyber attacks and help to provide an impetus for enterprises to devote resources to protecting against advanced cyber attacks, such as purchasing our services and products and broadly deploying our services and products within their organizations. If advanced cyber attacks were to decline, or enterprises perceived that the general level of advanced cyber attacks have declined, our ability to attract new customers and expand our offerings within existing customers could be materially and adversely affected and harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, various state legislatures have enacted laws aimed at regulating the distribution of unsolicited email. These and similar legal measures, both in the United States and worldwide, may have the effect of reducing the amount of unsolicited email and malicious software that is distributed and hence diminish the need for our internet security solutions. Any such developments would have an adverse impact on our revenues.\nWe depend upon our OEM customers for the majority of our revenue and if our OEM customers do not renew existing subscriptions or buy additional services, our operating results will be harmed.\nWe expect to continue to be dependent upon OEM partners and service providers for a significant portion of our revenues.\nOur operating results and financial condition may be materially adversely affected if:\n\u25cf anticipated orders or payments from these partners fail to materialize;\n\u25cf our partners cease the promotion of our business or begin to promote solutions other than ours;\n\u25cf our partners are acquired by larger companies who may have other relationships or technologies that lead to the displacement or termination of Cyren contracts;\n\u25cf our partners do not live up to their contractual agreements or fail to pay for services rendered; or\n\u25cf our partners\u2019 businesses fail.\nWe regularly have discussions with our customers regarding the renewal of their contracts and the renegotiation of the terms of such contracts at the time of renewal. In the fourth quarter of 2020, we received notification that our largest customer will renew one of their contracts for another three years through the first quarter of 2024, but that it does not intend to renew its largest contract with the Company beginning April 2021. As a result, we anticipate that quarterly revenues from this customer will drop from over 20% currently to approximately 14% of quarterly revenue beginning in the second quarter of 2021. For additional information, please refer to Note 11b of the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nOur quarterly operating results may fluctuate, which could adversely affect our share price.\nOur revenues and operating results could vary significantly from period to period as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control. As a result, comparing our revenues and operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful, and shareholders should not rely on our past results as an indication of our future performance. We may not be able to accurately predict our future revenues or results of operations. We base our current and future expense levels on our operating plans and sales forecasts, and our operating costs are relatively fixed in the short-term. As a result, we may not be able to reduce our costs sufficiently to compensate for an unexpected shortfall in revenues, and even a small shortfall in revenues could disproportionately and adversely affect financial results for that quarter. If our revenues or operating results fall below the expectations of investors or any securities analysts that cover our stock, our share price could decline substantially.\nA number of factors, many of which are enumerated in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section, are likely to cause fluctuations in our operating results or cause our share price to decline. These factors include:\n\u25cf our ability to successfully market both our traditional email, antivirus and web security solutions and our newer cloud-based internet security solutions in new markets, both domestic and international;\n\u25cf our ability to successfully develop and market new, modified or upgraded solutions, as may be needed;\n\u25cf demand for, and the continued acceptance of our solutions by our current partners and customer base and the level of perceived urgency regarding security threats and compliance requirements;\n\u25cf our ability to expand our workforce with qualified personnel, as may be needed;\n\u25cf unanticipated bugs or other problems affecting the delivery of our solutions to customers;\n\u25cf the success of our partners\u2019 sales efforts to their customer base;\n\u25cf the solvency of our partners and their ability to allocate sufficient resources towards the marketing of our products;\n\u25cf our partners\u2019 ability to effectively integrate our solutions into their product offerings;\n\u25cf the substantial decrease in information technology spending;\n\u25cf the pricing of our products;\n\u25cf our ability to timely collect fees owed by our customers and partners;\n\u25cf general economic conditions, including a global slowdown (for example, as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak);\n\u25cf sudden, dramatic fluctuations in exchange rates of currencies covering the fees we collect from our foreign customers versus the currencies utilized in our business (namely, the Israeli Shekel (\u201cILS\u201d), the U.S. Dollar (\u201cUSD\u201d), the Euro (\u201cEUR\u201d) and the British Pound (\u201cGBP\u201d);\n\u25cf our ability to add cost-effective space and equipment to our current data centers in a timely and effective manner to match the rate of growth in our business, plus our ability to build new, cost-effective data centers as worldwide demand for our products may require;\n\u25cf the effectiveness of our end user support, whether provided by our customers or directly by Cyren;\n\u25cf customer budgeting cycles and seasonal buying patterns;\n\u25cf the extent to which customers subscribe for additional solutions or increase the number of users;\n\u25cf any disruption in our sales channels or termination of our relationship with strategic channel partners;\n\u25cf insolvency or credit difficulties confronting our customers, affecting their ability to purchase or pay for our solutions; and\n\u25cf price competition or any changes in the competitive landscape of our industry, including consolidation among our competitors, customers, partners, or resellers.\nOur ability to continue to increase our revenues will depend on our ability to successfully execute our sales and business development plan.\nThe complexity of the underlying technological base of email, antivirus and web security solutions, and the current landscape of the markets, require highly trained sales and business development personnel to educate prospective distributors, resellers, OEM and service provider partners and customers regarding the use and benefits of our solutions. We continue to be substantially dependent on our sales force to obtain new customers and to drive additional use cases and adoption among our existing customers. We believe that there is significant competition for sales personnel with the skills and technical knowledge that we require. Our ability to achieve significant revenue growth will depend, in large part, on our success in recruiting, training, and retaining sufficient numbers of sales personnel to support our growth. New hires require significant training and may take significant time before they achieve full productivity. Our recent hires and planned hires may not become productive as quickly as we expect, and we may be unable to hire or retain sufficient numbers of qualified individuals in the markets where we do business or plan to do business.\nOur future success depends on our ability to sell additional solutions to our customers, such as our CIS solution which was made generally available for purchase in the second quarter of 2020. This may require increasingly sophisticated and costly sales efforts and may not result in additional sales. In addition, the rate at which our customers purchase additional solutions depends on a number of factors, including the perceived need for additional solutions, growth in the number of end users, and general economic conditions. If our efforts to sell additional solutions to our customers are not successful, our business, financial condition and/or results of operations may suffer.\nWe rely on our management team and other key employees and will need additional personnel to grow our business, and the loss of one or more key employees or our inability to attract and retain qualified personnel could harm our business.\nOur success is substantially dependent on our ability to attract, retain and motivate the members of our management team and other key employees throughout our organization. Competition for highly skilled personnel is intense in Israel, Germany, Iceland, the United Kingdom, Sunnyvale, Austin, and the Washington D.C. metro area, where we have offices and a need for highly skilled personnel. We may not be successful in attracting qualified personnel to fulfill our current or future needs. Our competitors may be successful in recruiting and hiring members of our management team or other key employees, and it may be difficult for us to find suitable replacements on a timely basis, on competitive terms, or at all. Also, to the extent we hire employees from mature public companies with significant financial resources, we may be subject to allegations that such employees have been improperly solicited, that they have divulged proprietary or other confidential information or that their former employers own such employees\u2019 inventions or other work product.\nIn addition, we believe that it is important to establish and maintain a corporate culture that facilitates the maintenance and transfer of institutional knowledge within our organization and also fosters innovation, teamwork, a passion for customers and a focus on execution.\nThe loss of our software developers or senior operations personnel may also adversely affect the continued development and support of both our current messaging, antivirus and web security solutions and future solutions presently included in our roadmap for development, thereby causing our operating results to suffer and the value of your investment to decline.\nWe do not have employment agreements inclusive of set periods of employment with any of our key personnel. We cannot prevent them from leaving at any time. We do not maintain key-person life insurance policies, listing us as a beneficiary, on any of our employees. If one or more of our key employees resigns or otherwise ceases to provide us with their service, our business, financial condition and/or results of operations could be harmed.\nOur business and operating results could suffer if we do not successfully address potential risks inherent in doing business overseas.\nWe market and sell our products worldwide and have personnel in many parts of the world. In addition, we have sales offices and research and development facilities outside the United States, and we conduct, and expect to continue to conduct, a significant amount of our business with companies that are located outside the United States, particularly in Europe, Israel, and Asia. We also enter into strategic distributor and reseller relationships with companies in certain international markets where we do not have a local presence. If we are not able to maintain successful strategic distributor relationships internationally or recruit additional companies to enter into strategic distributor relationships, our future success in these international markets could be limited. Business practices and regulations in the international markets that we serve differ from those in the United States and Israel and periodically require us to include terms other than our standard terms in customer contracts. To the extent that we enter into customer contracts that include non-standard terms related to payment, warranties, or performance obligations, our operating results may be adversely impacted.\nAdditionally, our international sales and operations are subject to a number of risks, including the following:\n\u25cf greater difficulty in enforcing contracts and accounts receivable collection and longer collection periods;\n\u25cf the uncertainty of protection for intellectual property rights in some countries;\n\u25cf greater risk of changes in regulatory practices, tariffs, and tax laws and treaties;\n\u25cf risks associated with trade restrictions and foreign legal requirements, including the importation, certification, and localization of our products required in foreign countries;\n\u25cf the potential that our operations in Israel and the U.S. may limit the acceptability of our products to some foreign governments, and vice versa;\n\u25cf greater risk of a failure of foreign employees, partners, distributors, and resellers to comply with both U.S. and foreign laws, including antitrust regulations, and any trade regulations ensuring fair trade practices;\n\u25cf heightened risk of unfair or corrupt business practices in certain geographies and of improper or fraudulent sales arrangements that may impact financial results and result in restatements of, or irregularities in, financial statements;\n\u25cf the potential for acts of terrorism, hostilities, or war;\n\u25cf the impact of COVID-19 on the economic conditions in these foreign markets and the travel restrictions in and between various geographic regions;\n\u25cf increased expenses incurred in establishing and maintaining office space and equipment for our multinational operations;\n\u25cf greater difficulty in recruiting local experienced personnel, and the costs and expenses associated with such activities;\n\u25cf management communication and integration problems resulting from cultural and geographic dispersion;\n\u25cf fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. Dollar, Shekel, Euro, Pound, and other foreign currencies in markets where we do business; and\n\u25cf general economic and political conditions and uncertainties in these foreign markets.\nThese factors and other factors could harm our ability to gain future international revenues and, consequently, materially impact our business, operating results, and financial condition. The expansion of our existing international operations and entry into additional international markets will require significant management attention and financial resources.\nChanges in the tax treatment of companies engaged in internet commerce may adversely affect the commercial use of our services and our financial results.\nDue to the global nature of the internet and the global reach of our network, it is possible that various states or countries might attempt to regulate our transmissions or levy sales, income, consumption, use or other taxes relating to our services or activities, or impose obligations on us to collect such taxes. Tax authorities in many jurisdictions are currently reviewing the appropriate treatment of companies engaged in internet commerce such as the provision of cloud computing services and other online services. The imposition of new or revised tax laws or regulations may subject us to additional sales, income, consumption, use or other taxes. We cannot predict the effect of current attempts to impose such taxes on commerce over the internet. New or revised taxes and, in particular, sales, use or consumption taxes, the Value Added Tax and similar taxes would likely increase the cost of doing business online. New taxes could also create significant increases in internal costs necessary to capture data, and collect and remit taxes. Any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nThe application of tax laws is subject to interpretation and if tax authorities challenge our methodologies or our analysis of our tax rates it could result in an increase to our worldwide effective tax rate and cause us to change the way we operate our business.\nThe application of the tax laws of various jurisdictions to our international business activities is subject to interpretation and also depends on our ability to operate our business in a manner consistent with our corporate structure and intercompany arrangements. The tax authorities of the jurisdictions in which we operate may challenge our methodologies for valuing developed technology or intercompany arrangements, including our transfer pricing, or determine that the manner in which we operate our business does not achieve the expected tax consequences, which could increase our worldwide effective tax rate and adversely affect our financial position and results of operations.\nA certain degree of judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. In the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. For example, our effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates, by changes in foreign currency exchange rates or by changes in the relevant tax, accounting and other laws, regulations, principles and interpretations. As we operate in numerous taxing jurisdictions, the application of tax laws can be subject to diverging and sometimes conflicting interpretations by tax authorities of these jurisdictions. It is not uncommon for tax authorities in different countries to have conflicting views, for instance, with respect to, among other things, the manner in which the arm\u2019s length standard is applied for transfer pricing purposes, or with respect to the valuation of intellectual property. In addition, tax laws are dynamic and subject to change as new laws are passed and new regulations or interpretations of the law are issued or applied. For example, the work being carried out by the OECD on base erosion and profit shifting as a response to increasing globalization of trade could result in changes in tax treaties or the introduction of new legislation that could impose an additional tax on businesses. As a result of changes to laws or interpretations, our tax positions could be challenged, and our income tax expenses could increase in the future.\nFor instance, if tax authorities in any of the countries in which we operate were to successfully challenge our transfer prices, they could require us to reallocate our income (or part of our income) to reflect transfer pricing adjustments, which could result in an increased tax liability to us. In addition, if the country from which the income was reallocated did not agree with the reallocation asserted by the first country, we could become subject to tax on the same income in both countries, resulting in double taxation. If tax authorities were to allocate income to a higher tax jurisdiction, subject our income to double taxation or assess interest and penalties, it could increase our tax liability, which could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations.\nWe are subject to privacy and data protection laws and regulations in various jurisdictions, including the EU General Data Protection Regulation, as well as contractual privacy and data protection obligations, which may limit the use and adoption of, or require modification of, our products and services and could affect our marketing activities. Our failure to comply with such laws, regulations or obligations could subject us to liability and could harm our reputation and business. In addition, the invalidation of the EU-US Privacy Shield by the European Court of Justice (\u201cCJEU\u201d), which we had previously relied on in part as a mechanisms to transfer personal data from the EU to the U.S and the uncertainty regarding reliance on the EU Standard Contractual Clauses (\u201cSCCs\u201d) may have an adverse effect on the manner in which we provide our services which could harm our financial results.\nMany federal, state, and foreign government bodies and agencies have adopted, or are adopting, laws and regulations regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information. Some of our solutions process customer data which may contain the personal information of end users, and any failure to adequately address privacy concerns, or to otherwise comply with applicable privacy laws and regulations could result in liability, damage to our reputation, loss of sales, or further harm our business. Privacy concerns, whether or not valid, may inhibit market adoption of our solutions. The costs of compliance with such laws and regulations that apply to our customers\u2019 business may in turn limit their use and adoption of our products and services and therefore reduce overall demand for them.\nWe are subject to the privacy and data protection laws and regulations adopted by Israel, Europe and the United States and potentially other jurisdictions. Where the local data protection and privacy laws of a jurisdiction apply, we may be required to register our operations in that jurisdiction or make changes to our business so that registered users\u2019 data is only collected and processed in accordance with applicable local law. The proliferation of such laws within the jurisdictions in which we operate may result in conflicting and contradictory requirements, particularly in relation to evolving technologies such as cloud computing. Any failure to successfully navigate the changing regulatory landscape could result in legal liability or impairment to our reputation in the marketplace, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn particular, the European Union has imposed greater obligations under their privacy and data protection laws. For example, the European Union adopted the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) which took effect on May 25, 2018 and is wide ranging in scope. GDPR replaced, to a large extent, the data protection laws of each European Union member state and imposed stringent requirements for data processors and controllers. Such requirements include more fulsome disclosures about the processing of personal information, data retention limits and deletion requirements, mandatory notification in the case of a data breach and heightened standards regarding valid consent in some specific cases of data processing. The GDPR also includes substantially higher penalties for failure to comply (a fine up to 20 million Euro or up to 4% of the annual worldwide turnover, whichever is greater, can be imposed). Given the breadth of the GDPR, compliance with its requirements is likely to continue to require significant expenditure of resources on an ongoing basis, and there can be no assurance that the measures we have taken for the purposes of compliance will be successful in preventing a violation of the GDPR. Given the potential fines, liabilities, and damage to our reputation in the event of an actual or perceived violation of the GDPR, such a violation may have an adverse effect on our business and operations.\nSimilarly, California recently enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d), which, among other things, requires covered companies to provide new disclosures to California consumers and afford such consumers new rights to opt-out of the sale of their personal information. In addition, other states (e.g., Virginia) have enacted or proposed legislation that regulates the collection, use, and sale of personal information, and such regimes might not be compatible with either the GDPR or the CCPA or may require us to undertake additional practices. We cannot yet predict the impact of the CCPA or impending legislation on our business or operations, but it may require us to further modify our data processing practices and policies and incur substantial costs and expenses in an effort to comply; non-compliance could potentially subject us to regulatory fines and/or civil lawsuits.\nFurther, \u201cBrexit\u201d (described below) could lead to further legislative and regulatory changes. The United Kingdom Data Protection Act that substantially implements the GDPR became law in May 2018 and was subject to statutory amendments in 2019 that further align it with the GDPR. Post-Brexit, the United Kingdom has enacted its own version of the GDPR. On December 24, 2020, the European Commission announced a bridge period permitting data transfers from the EEA to the United Kingdom while the European Commission determines whether it will recognize the United Kingdom as an adequate country for the purposes of permitting international data transfers of EU personal data. The development of United Kingdom data protection laws or regulations and regulation of data transfers to and from the United Kingdom in the medium to longer term, however, remains unclear.\nEven the perception of privacy, data protection or information security concerns, whether or not valid, may harm our reputation, inhibit adoption of our products by current and future customers, or adversely impact our ability to hire and retain workforce talent. If our security measures are or are believed to be inadequate or breached as a result of third-party action, employee negligence, error or malfeasance, product defects, social engineering techniques or otherwise, and this results in, or is believed to result in, the disruption of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of our systems or networks or any data we process or maintain, or the loss, destruction or corruption of such data, or our privacy practices are or are perceived to be inadequate, we could incur significant liability, we could face a loss of revenues, and our business may suffer and our reputation and competitive position may be damaged.\nIf any of our customers or prospective customers decide not to purchase our products or services because of regulatory uncertainty, our revenues could decline and our business could suffer. Any inability by us, or a third-party contractor, to adequately address privacy concerns, whether valid or not, or to comply with applicable privacy or data protection laws, regulations and privacy standards, could result in additional cost and liability to us, damage our reputation, inhibit sales of our solutions and harm our business.\nUncertainty regarding the effects of Brexit could adversely affect our future results.\nThe United Kingdom (\u201cUK\u201d) left the European Union (\u201cEU\u201d) on January 31, 2020 (\u201cBrexit\u201d). There was a transitional period, during which EU laws, including pharmaceutical laws, continued to apply in the UK, however this ended on December 31, 2020. The UK and EU have signed an EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement, which became provisionally applicable on January 1, 2021 and will become formally applicable once ratified by both the UK and the EU. This agreement provides details on how some aspects of the UK and EU\u2019s relationship will operate, however there are still many uncertainties. The unavoidable uncertainties related to Brexit and the new relationship between the UK and EU, which continues to be defined, could cause volatility in currency exchange rates, in interest rates, and in EU, UK or worldwide political, regulatory, economic or market conditions; and could contribute to instability in political institutions, regulatory agencies, and financial markets. Any of these effects of Brexit, and others that cannot be anticipated, could adversely affect our future results.\nTechnology Risks\nWe may not have the resources or skills required to adapt to the changing technological requirements and shifting preferences of our customers and their users.\nThe email, antimalware and web security industries are characterized by difficult technological challenges, sophisticated distributors of internet security threats, multiple-variant viruses, advanced persistent threats, unique phishing scams and constantly evolving malevolent software distribution practices and targets that could render our solutions and proprietary technology ineffective. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to continually enhance our existing messaging, antimalware and web security solutions and to develop new solutions, functions and technology that address the potential needs of prospective and current customers and their users.\nMany of our end users operate in markets characterized by rapidly changing technologies and business plans, which require them to adapt to increasingly complex IT networks, incorporating a variety of hardware, software applications, operating systems, and networking protocols. As their technologies and business plans grow more complex, we expect these customers to face new and increasingly sophisticated methods of attack. We face significant challenges in ensuring that our solutions effectively identify and respond to these advanced and evolving attacks without disrupting our customers\u2019 network performance. As a result of the continued rapid innovations in the technology industry, including the rapid growth of smart phones, tablets and other devices and the trend of \u201cbring your own device\u201d in enterprises, we expect the networks of our end users to continue to change rapidly and become more complex.\nWe have identified and implemented a number of new products and enhancements to our platform that we believe are important to our continued success in the IT security market. Going forward, we may not be successful in developing and marketing, on a timely basis, such new products or enhancements or our new products or enhancements may not adequately address the changing needs of the marketplace. In addition, some of our new products and enhancements may require us to develop new architectures that involve complex, expensive, and time-consuming research and development processes. Although the market expects rapid introduction of new products and enhancements to respond to new threats, the development of these products and enhancements is difficult and the timetable for commercial release and availability is uncertain, as there can be significant time lags between initial beta releases and the commercial availability of new products and enhancements. We may experience unanticipated delays in the availability of new products and enhancements to our platform and fail to meet customer expectations with respect to the timing of such availability. If we do not quickly respond to the rapidly changing and rigorous needs of our customers by developing, releasing and making available on a timely basis new products and enhancements to our services and products that can adequately respond to advanced threats and our customers\u2019 needs, our competitive position and business prospects will be harmed. Furthermore, from time to time, we, or our competitors, may announce new products with capabilities or technologies that could have the potential to replace or shorten the life cycles of our existing services products. Announcements of new products could cause customers to defer purchasing our existing services or products.\nAdditionally, the process of developing new technology is expensive, complex, and uncertain. The success of new products and enhancements depends on several factors, including appropriate component costs, timely completion and introduction, differentiation of new products and services from those of our competitors, and market acceptance. To maintain our competitive position, we must continue to commit significant resources to developing new products or services before knowing whether these investments will be cost-effective or achieve the intended results. We may not be able to successfully identify new product opportunities, develop and bring new products or services to market in a timely manner, or achieve market acceptance of our platform. Products and technologies developed by others may render our offerings obsolete or noncompetitive. If we expend significant resources on researching and developing products or services and such products and services are not successful, our business, financial position and results of operations may be adversely affected. We may not be able to use new technologies effectively or adapt to OEM, service provider, customer or end user requirements or emerging industry standards.\nOur solutions may be adversely affected by defects or denial of service attacks, which could cause our OEM and service provider partners, customers, or end users to stop using our solutions.\nOur email, antimalware and web security products are based in part upon new and complex software and highly advanced computer systems. Complex software and computer systems can contain defects, particularly when first introduced or when new versions are released, and are possible targets for denial of service attacks instigated by \u201chackers\u201d. Although we conduct extensive testing and implement internet security processes, we may not discover defects or vulnerabilities in our software or systems that affect our new or current solutions or enhancements until after they are delivered. Although we have not experienced any material defects or vulnerabilities to date in our messaging, antimalware, and web security offerings, it is possible that, despite testing by us, defects or vulnerabilities may exist in the solutions we provide. These defects or vulnerabilities could cause or lead to interruptions for customers of our solutions, resulting in damage to our reputation, legal risks, loss of revenue, delays in market acceptance and diversion of our development resources, any of which could cause our business, financial condition and/or results of operations to suffer.\nReal or perceived defects, errors or vulnerabilities in our services or the failure of our services to block malware or prevent a cyber-attack or security breach could harm our reputation and adversely impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nBecause our products and services are complex, they have contained and may contain design or manufacturing defects or errors that are not detected until after their commercial release and deployment by our end users. For example, from time to time, certain of our end users have reported defects in our products related to performance, scalability and compatibility that were not detected before offering the service. Additionally, defects may cause our products or services to be vulnerable to security attacks, cause them to fail to help secure networks or temporarily interrupt end users\u2019 networking traffic. Because the techniques used by computer hackers to access or sabotage networks change frequently and may not be recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques and provide a solution in time to protect our end users\u2019 networks.\nFurthermore, as a well-known provider of internet security solutions, our networks, products, and services could be targeted by attacks specifically designed to disrupt our business and harm our reputation. In addition, our data centers, which are located in various locations worldwide, and networks may experience technical failures and downtime, may fail to distribute appropriate updates, or may fail to meet the increased requirements of a growing end user base, any of which could temporarily or permanently expose our end users\u2019 networks, leaving their networks unprotected against the latest security threats.\nAny real or perceived defects, errors or vulnerabilities in our services, or any other failure of our services to detect an advanced threat, could result in certain events, including:\n\u25cf a loss of existing or potential customers or channel partners;\n\u25cf delayed or lost revenue;\n\u25cf a delay in attaining, or the failure to attain, market acceptance;\n\u25cf the expenditure of significant financial and product development resources in efforts to analyze, correct, eliminate, or work around errors or defects, to address and eliminate vulnerabilities, or to identify and ramp up production with alternative third-party manufacturers;\n\u25cf an increase in service level availability or warranty claims, or an increase in the cost of servicing such claims, either of which would adversely affect our revenue and gross margins;\n\u25cf negative publicity, which could harm to our reputation or brand;\n\u25cf lost market share;\n\u25cf loss of our proprietary technology;\n\u25cf our solutions being susceptible to hacking or electronic break-ins or otherwise failing to secure data;\n\u25cf loss or disclosure of our customers\u2019 confidential information, or the inability to access such information; and\n\u25cf litigation, regulatory inquiries, or investigations that may be costly to address and further harm our reputation.\nData thieves are sophisticated, often affiliated with organized crime and operate large scale and complex automated attacks. In addition, their techniques change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target. If we fail to identify and respond to new and complex methods of attack and to update our services to detect or prevent such threats in time to protect our end users\u2019 systems, our business and reputation will suffer.\nAn actual or perceived security breach or theft of the sensitive data of one of our end users, regardless of whether the breach is attributable to the failure of our products or services, could adversely affect the market\u2019s perception of our security offerings. Despite our best efforts, there is no guarantee that our products and services will be free of flaws or vulnerabilities, and even if we discover these weaknesses, we may not be able to correct them promptly, if at all. A breach of our systems could also result in the disclosure of sensitive and confidential information as well as information regarding our customers, end users and partners. Our end user customers may also misuse our products and services, which could result in a breach or theft of business data.\nIf the delivery of our services to our customers is interrupted or delayed for any reason, our business could suffer.\nAny interruption or delay in the delivery of our services will negatively impact our customers. Our solutions are deployed via the internet, and our customers\u2019 internet traffic is routed through our cloud platform. Our customers depend on the continuous availability of our services, and our services are designed to operate in accordance with applicable service level commitments. The adverse effects of any service interruptions on our reputation and financial condition may be disproportionately heightened due to the nature of our business and the fact that our customers expect continuous and uninterrupted service and have a low tolerance for interruptions of any duration.\nThe following factors, many of which are beyond our control, can affect the delivery and availability of our services and the performance of our cloud:\n\u25cf the development and maintenance of the infrastructure of the internet;\n\u25cf the performance and availability of third-party telecommunications services with the necessary speed, data capacity and security for providing reliable internet access and services;\n\u25cf decisions by the owners and operators of the data centers where our cloud infrastructure is deployed or by global telecommunications service provider partners who provide us with network bandwidth to terminate our contracts, discontinue services to us, shut down operations or facilities, increase prices, change service levels, limit bandwidth, declare bankruptcy or prioritize the traffic of other parties;\n\u25cf the occurrence of earthquakes, floods, fires, power loss, system failures, physical or electronic break-ins, acts of war or terrorism, human error, or interference (including by disgruntled employees, former employees, or contractors) and other catastrophic events;\n\u25cf failure by us to maintain and update our cloud infrastructure to meet our traffic capacity requirements;\n\u25cf errors, defects, or performance problems in our software, including third-party software incorporated in our software;\n\u25cf improper deployment or configuration of our services; and\n\u25cf the failure of our redundancy systems, in the event of a service disruption at one of our data centers, to provide failover to other data centers in our data center network.\nThe occurrence of any of these factors, or if we are unable to efficiently and cost-effectively fix such errors or other problems that may be identified, could damage our reputation, negatively impact our relationship with our customers or otherwise materially harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur email, antimalware and web security products may be adversely affected if we are not able to receive a sufficient sampling of internet traffic or our data centers were to become unavailable.\nOur messaging, antimalware and web security solutions are dependent, in part, on the ability of our data centers to analyze, in an automated fashion, live feeds of internet and web related traffic received through our services to customers and other contractual arrangements. If we were to suffer an unanticipated, substantial decrease in such traffic or our multiple data centers become unavailable for any significant period, the effectiveness of our technologies would drop, our product offerings would become less attractive to customers/potential customers and revenues could decline.\nFalse detection of applications, viruses, malware, spyware, vulnerability exploits, data patterns or URL categories could adversely affect our business.\nOur classifications of application type, virus, malware, spyware, vulnerability exploits, data, or URL categories may falsely detect applications, content or threats that do not actually exist. This risk is heightened by the inclusion of a \u201cheuristics\u201d feature in our products, which attempts to identify applications and other threats not based on any known signatures but based on characteristics or anomalies which indicate that a particular item may be a threat. These \u201cfalse positives\u201d, while typical in our industry, may impair the perceived reliability of our products and may therefore adversely impact market acceptance of our services and products. If our services and products restrict important files or applications based on falsely identifying them as malware or some other item that should be restricted, this could adversely affect end users\u2019 systems and cause material system failures. Any such false identification of important files or applications could result in damage to our reputation, negative publicity, loss of end users and sales, increased costs to remedy any problem, and costly litigation.\nOur cloud-based enterprise SaaS security offerings include newer service offerings, so we may not see the customer traction in these offerings that we anticipate.\nDuring 2019, Cyren revised its enterprise product strategy to focus primarily on email security and began to de-emphasize legacy solutions due to lack of significant customer traction. We made Cyren Inbox Security generally available for purchase in the second quarter of 2020. The solutions we are promoting and will promote to this market enable us to offer internet security solutions directly to our Enterprise customers or through our channel partners. If we fall short of our expectations, and especially given the significant resources invested by us in bringing new offerings to market, our financial results will suffer and the value of shareholder investments will decline.\nIf we fail to promote, develop, or protect our Cyren brand name, our business may be harmed.\nDeveloping and maintaining awareness and integrity of our company and our new brand are important to achieving widespread acceptance of our existing and future offerings and are important elements in attracting new customers. The importance of brand recognition will increase as competition in our market further intensifies. Successful promotion of our brand will depend on the effectiveness of our marketing efforts and on our ability to provide reliable and useful solutions at competitive prices. We plan to continue investing substantial resources to promote our brand, both domestically and internationally, but there is no guarantee that our brand development strategies will enhance the recognition of our brand. Some of our existing and potential competitors have well-established brands with greater recognition than we have. If our efforts to promote and maintain our brand are not successful, our operating results and our ability to attract and retain customers may be adversely affected. In addition, even if our brand recognition and loyalty increases, this may not result in increased use of our solutions or higher revenue.\nOur use of open source technology could impose limitations on our ability to commercialize our solutions.\nWe use open source software in certain of our solutions, and although we monitor our use of open source software to avoid subjecting our solutions to conditions we do not intend, the terms of many open source licenses have not been interpreted by U.S. or foreign courts. As a result, there is a risk that these licenses could be construed in a way that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our solutions. From time to time, we may face claims from third parties claiming ownership of, or demanding release of, the open source software or derivative works that we have developed using such software or otherwise seeking to enforce the terms of the applicable open source license. In such an event, we could be required to seek licenses from third parties to continue offering our solutions, to make our proprietary code generally available in source code form, to re-engineer our solutions or to discontinue the sale of our solutions if re-engineering could not be accomplished on a timely basis, any of which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nRisks Related to our Ordinary Shares\nWe may not be able to comply with all applicable listing requirements or standards of the Nasdaq Capital Market and Nasdaq could delist our ordinary shares.\nOur ordinary shares are currently listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market. To maintain that listing, we must satisfy minimum financial and other continued listing requirements and standards. One such requirement is that we maintain a minimum bid price of at least $1.00 per ordinary share. On April 24, 2020, we received written notice from the Listing Qualifications Department of the Nasdaq Stock Market informing us that because the closing bid price for our ordinary shares listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market was below $1.00 per share for 30 consecutive business days prior to the date of the Notice, we did not meet the minimum closing bid requirement for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market set forth in Rule 5550(a)(2) of the Nasdaq Listing Rules.\nAlthough we regained compliance with the Nasdaq Listing Rules in 2020, our ordinary share price is currently below $1.00 and has been below $1.00 for 22 consecutive business days. There can be no assurance that we will regain compliance with the $1.00 minimum bid price requirement or comply with Nasdaq\u2019s other continued listing standards in the future. In the event that our ordinary shares are not eligible for continued listing on Nasdaq or another national securities exchange, trading of our ordinary shares could be conducted in the over-the-counter market or on an electronic bulletin board established for unlisted securities such as the Pink Sheets or the OTC Bulletin Board. In such event, it could become more difficult to dispose of, or obtain accurate price quotations for, our ordinary shares, and there would likely also be a reduction in our coverage by security analysts and the news media, which could cause the price of our ordinary shares to decline further. Also, it may be difficult for us to raise additional capital if we are not listed on a major exchange.\nThe issuance of additional shares in connection with financings, acquisitions, investments, our equity incentive plans, conversion of our convertible notes and debentures or otherwise will dilute other shareholders. In addition, our failure in the future to raise additional capital or generate the significant capital necessary to expand our operations and invest in new services and products could reduce our ability to compete and could harm our business. The ability to increase the authorized share count could limit our options for continuing to support the business.\nWe have made, and intend to continue to make, investments to support our business growth and may require additional funds to respond to business challenges, including the need to develop new features to enhance our services and products, improve our operating infrastructure or acquire complementary businesses and technologies. Accordingly, we may need to engage in equity or debt financings to secure additional funds. For example, in December 2018, we issued $10 million aggregate principal amount of Convertible Notes to an existing minority investor in a private placement which have a maturity of December 2021. In November 2019, we closed our rights offering, pursuant to which we issued 4,635,584 ordinary shares at $1.73 per share, including 4,624,277 shares issued to Warburg Pincus. In addition, in March 2020, we issued $10.25 million aggregate principal amount of our Convertible Debentures to accredited investors in a private placement and in February 2021, we issued 12 million shares at a price of $1.15 per share in a registered direct offering and warrants to purchase 720,000 shares.\nOur shareholders have experienced dilution of their equity interests as a result of these issuances and prior issuances. Furthermore, we do not anticipate that we will have sufficient funds to pay the principal of the Convertible Notes when they mature in December 2021 and as a result, we will seek to refinance or restructure the Convertible Notes, including by issuing additional shares. We may also elect to satisfy interest payments on the Convertible Notes and Convertible Debentures by the issuance of ordinary shares based on the market price at the time of the interest payment.\nWe evaluate financing opportunities from time to time, and our ability to obtain financing will depend, among other things, on our development efforts, business plans and operating performance and the condition of the capital markets, and available authorized shares at the time we seek financing. If we raise additional equity or convertible debt financing, our shareholders may experience further significant dilution of their ownership interests and the per share value of our ordinary shares could decline. Furthermore, if we engage in debt financing, the holders of debt would have priority over the holders of our ordinary shares, and we may be required to accept terms that restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness or that otherwise restrict our ability to operate our business. We may also be required to take other actions that would otherwise be in the interests of the debt holders and force us to maintain specified liquidity or other ratios, any of which could harm our business, operating results, and financial condition. We may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us, if at all. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when we require it, our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges could be significantly impaired, and our business may be adversely affected.\nWarburg Pincus holds 43% of our outstanding shares and is able to exercise significant influence over many matters requiring the approval of our Board and/or shareholders; Warburg Pincus\u2019 interest in our business may be different from yours.\nWarburg Pincus holds approximately 43% of our outstanding ordinary shares as of February 28, 2021, and has the right to nominate the number of directors proportional to its holdings of our outstanding shares. Currently, four directors nominated by Warburg Pincus serve on our Board. Warburg Pincus is able to exercise significant influence over many matters requiring the approval of our Board and/or shareholders, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions. In addition, our other directors and our executive officers that are not related to Warburg Pincus (together known as \u201caffiliated entities\u201d), beneficially own, in the aggregate, approximately 5% of our outstanding ordinary shares as of February 28, 2021. If they vote together (especially if they were to exercise all vested options into shares entitled to voting rights in the Company), these shareholders will be able to exercise influence over matters requiring a special majority vote of our shareholders, including the compensation of directors and approval of certain significant corporate transactions. In this regard, we know of no shareholders or voting agreement between major shareholders or between such shareholders and directors or officers.\nIn addition, conflicts of interest may arise as a consequence of the control by Warburg Pincus, including:\n\u25cf conflicts between Warburg Pincus and our other shareholders whose interests may differ with respect to, among other things, our strategic direction, or significant corporate transactions;\n\u25cf conflicts related to corporate opportunities that could be pursued by us, on the one hand, or by Warburg Pincus, on the other hand; or\n\u25cf conflicts related to existing or new contractual relationships between us, on the one hand, and Warburg Pincus, on the other hand.\nU.S. holders of our shares could be subject to material adverse tax consequences if we are considered a \u201cpassive foreign investment company\u201d for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nWe do not believe that we are a passive foreign investment company, and we do not expect to become a passive foreign investment company. However, our status in any taxable year will depend on our assets, income and activities in each year, and because this is a factual determination made annually after the end of each taxable year, there can be no assurance that we will not be considered a passive foreign investment company for the current taxable year or any future taxable years. If we were a passive foreign investment company for any taxable year while a taxable U.S. holder held our shares, such U.S. holder could face adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences, including having gains realized on the sale of our ordinary shares classified as ordinary income, rather than as capital gain, the loss of the preferential rate applicable to dividends received on our ordinary shares by individuals who are U.S. holders, and having interest charges apply to distributions by us and the proceeds of share sales.\nU.S. holders that own 10% or more of the vote or value of our ordinary shares may suffer adverse tax consequences because we and/or any of our non-U.S. subsidiaries are expected to be characterized as a \u201ccontrolled foreign corporation,\u201d or a CFC, under Section 957(a) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code.\nA non-U.S. corporation is considered a CFC if more than 50% of (1) the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of such corporation entitled to vote, or (2) the total value of the stock of such corporation, is owned, or is considered as owned by applying certain constructive ownership rules, by United States shareholders (U.S. persons who own stock representing 10% or more of the vote or 10% or more of the value) on any day during the taxable year of such non-U.S. corporation. Certain United States shareholders of a CFC generally are required to include currently in gross income such shareholders\u2019 share of the CFC\u2019s \u201cSubpart F income,\u201d a portion of the CFC\u2019s earnings to the extent the CFC holds certain U.S. property, and a portion of the CFC\u2019s \u201cglobal intangible low-taxed income\u201d (as defined under Section 951A of the Code). Such United States shareholders are subject to current U.S. federal income tax with respect to such items, even if the CFC has not made an actual distribution to such shareholders. \u201cSubpart F income\u201d includes, among other things, certain passive income (such as income from dividends, interests, royalties, rents and annuities or gain from the sale of property that produces such types of income) and certain sales and services income arising in connection with transactions between the CFC and a person related to the CFC. \u201cGlobal intangible low-taxed income\u201d may include most of the remainder of a CFC\u2019s income over a deemed return on its tangible assets.\nAs a result of certain changes in the U.S. tax law introduced by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, we believe that we and our non-U.S. subsidiaries would be classified as CFCs in the current taxable year. For U.S. holders who hold 10% or more of the vote or value of our ordinary shares, this may result in adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences, such as current U.S. taxation of Subpart F income and of any such shareholder\u2019s share of our accumulated non-U.S. earnings and profits (regardless of whether we make any distributions), taxation of amounts treated as global intangible low-taxed income under Section 951A of the Code with respect to such shareholder, and being subject to certain reporting requirements with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, or the IRS. Any such U.S. holder who is an individual generally would not be allowed certain tax deductions or foreign tax credits that would be allowed to a U.S. corporation. If you are a U.S. holder who holds 10% or more of the vote or value of our ordinary shares, you should consult your own tax advisors regarding the U.S. tax consequences of acquiring, owning, or disposing our ordinary shares and the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, especially the changes to the rules relating to CFCs.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared or paid any dividends on our ordinary shares. We intend to retain any earnings to finance the operation and expansion of our business, and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the future. As a result, you may only receive a return on your investment in our ordinary shares if the market price of our ordinary shares increases.\nIntellectual Property Risks\nIf we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or face a claim of intellectual property infringement by a third party, we could lose our intellectual property rights or be liable for significant damages.\nWe regard our patented and patent pending technology, copyrights, service marks, trademarks, trade secrets and similar intellectual property as critical to our success, and rely on patent, trademark and copyright law, trade secret protection and confidentiality or license agreements with our employees and customers to protect our proprietary rights. See Item 1. Business, Intellectual Property for information pertaining to our patent activities. We may seek to patent certain additional software or other technology in the future. Any such patent applications might not result in patents issued within the scope of the claims we seek, or at all.\nDespite our precautions, unauthorized third parties may copy certain portions of our technology, reverse engineer or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary or otherwise infringe or misappropriate our patent or our patent pending technology, trade secrets, copyrights, trademarks, and similar proprietary rights. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. Thus, our means of protecting our proprietary rights in the United States or abroad, as well as our financial resources, may not be adequate, and competitors may independently develop similar technology. Given the cost, effort, risks, and downside of obtaining patent protection, including the requirement to ultimately disclose the invention to the public, we may not choose to seek patent protection for certain innovations. However, such patent protection could later prove to be important to our business. Even if issued, there can be no assurance that any patents will have the coverage originally sought or adequately protect our intellectual property, as the legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability, and scope of protection of patent and other intellectual property rights are uncertain. Any patents that are issued may be invalidated or otherwise limited, or may lapse or may be abandoned, enabling other companies to better develop products that compete with our solutions, which could adversely affect our competitive business position, business prospects and financial condition.\nWe cannot be certain that our security solutions do not infringe issued patents in certain parts of the world. Therefore, other parties, whether in the United States or elsewhere, may assert infringement claims against us. We may also be subject to legal proceedings and claims from time to time in the ordinary course of our business, including claims of alleged infringement of copyrights, trademarks, and other intellectual property rights of third parties by ourselves and our customers. Our customer agreements typically include indemnity provisions, so we may be obligated to defend against third party intellectual property rights infringement claims on behalf of our customers. Such claims, even if not meritorious, could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources. We may not have the proper resources in order to adequately defend against such claims.\nRisks Relating to Operations in Israel\nConditions in Israel may limit our ability to develop and sell our products, resulting in a decline in revenues.\nWe are incorporated under the laws of the State of Israel. Our principal research and development facilities are located in Israel. Since the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948, a number of armed conflicts have taken place between Israel and its neighboring countries, as well as incidents of civil unrest, and a number of state and non-state actors have publicly committed to its destruction. Political, economic, and military conditions in Israel could directly affect our operations. We could be adversely affected by any major hostilities involving Israel, including acts of terrorism or any other hostilities involving or threatening Israel, the interruption or curtailment of trade between Israel and its trading partners, a significant increase in inflation or a significant downturn in the economic or financial condition of Israel. Any on-going or future violence between Israel and the Palestinians, armed conflicts, terrorist activities, tension along the Israeli borders or with other countries in the region, including Iran, or political instability in the region could disrupt international trading activities in Israel and may materially and negatively affect our business and could harm our results of operations.\nCertain countries, as well as certain companies and organizations, continue to participate in a boycott of Israeli firms, firms with large Israeli operations and others doing business with Israel and Israeli companies. In addition, such boycott, restrictive laws, policies, or practices may change over time in unpredictable ways, and could, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business in the future. Should the BDS Movement, the movement for boycotting, divesting and sanctioning Israel and Israeli institutions (including universities) and products become increasingly influential in the United States, Europe and around the world, this may also adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nSome of our employees in Israel, including some of our executive officers, are obligated to perform annual military reserve duty in the Israel Defense Forces, depending on their age and position in the armed forces. Furthermore, they may be called to active reserve duty at any time under emergency circumstances for extended periods of time. Our operations could be disrupted by the absence, for a significant period, of one or more of our executive officers or key employees due to military service, and any significant disruption in our operations could harm our business.\nBecause a substantial portion of our revenues historically have been generated in U.S. dollars (USD) and the Euro (EUR), and a significant portion of our expenses have been incurred in Israeli Shekel (ILS), British Pound (GBP) and Icelandic Krona (ISK), our results of operations may be adversely affected by currency fluctuations.\nWe have generated a substantial portion of our revenues in USD and EUR, and incurred a substantial portion of our expenses, principally salaries and related personnel expenses, office rent and other outside services, in currencies other than USD. Those expenses incurred in Israel are denominated in Shekels, those incurred in the United Kingdom are denominated in GBP and those incurred in Iceland are denominated in ISK. We anticipate that a significant portion of our expenses will continue to be denominated in these currencies. As a result, we are exposed to risk to the extent that the value of the USD depreciates against the ILS, GBP, and ISK or to the extent that the value of the USD appreciates against the EUR. In those events, the USD cost of Cyren\u2019s operations will increase and the USD value of Cyren\u2019s revenues will decrease, respectively, and the Company\u2019s USD measured results of operations will be adversely affected. During 2020, the USD value of operating costs denominated in ILS and GBP increased due to the depreciation of the USD vs. all such currencies, while the USD value of operating costs denominated in ISK decreased due to the appreciation of the USD, and the USD value of revenues denominated in EUR increased due to the depreciation of the USD vs the EUR. During 2019, the USD value of operating costs denominated in ILS and GBP increased due to the depreciation of the USD vs. all such currencies, while the USD value of operating costs denominated in ISK decreased due to the appreciation of the USD, and the USD value of revenues denominated in EUR decreased due to the appreciation of the USD vs the EUR.\nWe cannot predict the trend for future years. Our operations also could be adversely affected if we are unable to guard against currency fluctuations in the future. To date, we have not engaged in any significant hedging transactions. In the future, we may enter into currency hedging transactions to decrease the risk of financial exposure from fluctuations in the exchange rate of the dollar against the ILS. Foreign currency fluctuations, and our attempts to mitigate the risks caused by such fluctuations, could have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe government programs and benefits which we previously received require us to meet several conditions and may be terminated or reduced in the future.\nWe received grants from the Government of Israel through a program with the Israel Innovation Authority, or the IIA (formerly known as the Office of the Chief Scientist of the Israeli Ministry of Economy and Industry), pursuant to the Israeli Law for the Encouragement of Industrial Research Development and Technological Innovation, 1984, and related regulations (the \u201cR&D Law\u201d), to finance a significant portion of our research and development expenditures in Israel.\nIn order to meet specified conditions in connection with grants and programs of the IIA, we have made representations to the Israel government about our Israeli operations. One of the grants requires a minimum commitment of three years and we are required to share information with other companies and academics. From time to time, the conduct of our Israeli operations has deviated from our forecasts. If we fail to meet the conditions of the grants, including the maintenance of a material presence in Israel, or if there is any material deviation from the representations made by us to the Israeli government, we could be required to refund the grants previously received (together with an adjustment based on the Israeli consumer price index and an interest factor) and would likely be ineligible to receive IIA grants in the future.\nIn addition, the terms of our IIA grants and programs prohibit the manufacture outside of Israel of the product developed in accordance with the program without the prior consent of the Research Committee. Such approval is generally subject to an increase in the total amount to be repaid to the IIA to between 120% and 300% of the amount granted, depending on the extent of the manufacturing that is conducted outside of Israel. In addition, the R&D Law provides that know-how from the research and development and any derivatives thereof, cannot be transferred or licensed to Israeli third parties without the approval of the Research Committee. The R&D Law stresses that it is not just transfer of know-how that is prohibited, but also transfer of any rights in such know-how. Approval of the transfer and/or license may be granted only if the Israeli transferee undertakes to abide by all of the provisions of the R&D Law and regulations promulgated thereunder, including the restrictions on the transfer of know-how and the obligation to pay royalties, if applicable.\nThe know-how from the research and development and any derivatives thereof, cannot be transferred or licensed to non-Israeli third parties without the approval of the Research Committee, which approval is generally contingent on payment of a significant penalty of up to six times the grant amount plus LIBOR and minus any royalties paid.\nYou may have difficulties enforcing a U.S. judgment against us and our executive officers and directors or asserting U.S. securities laws claims in Israel.\nCyren Ltd. is organized under the laws of Israel, and we maintain significant operations in Israel. In addition, a significant portion of our assets are located outside the United States. Service of process upon our non-U.S. resident directors and enforcement of judgments obtained in the United States against them and Cyren Ltd. may be difficult to obtain within the United States. It may be difficult to enforce civil causes of actions under U.S. securities law in original actions instituted in Israel. Israeli courts may refuse to hear a claim based on a violation of U.S. securities laws because Israel is not the most appropriate forum in which to bring such a claim. In addition, even if an Israeli court agrees to hear a claim, it may determine that Israeli law and not U.S. law is applicable to the claim. If U.S. law is found to be applicable, the substance of the applicable U.S. law must be proved as a fact, which can be a time-consuming and costly process. Certain matters of procedure will also be governed by Israeli law. Furthermore, there is little binding case law in Israel addressing these matters.\nIsraeli courts might not enforce judgments rendered outside Israel which may make it difficult to collect on judgments rendered against us. Subject to certain time limitations, an Israeli court may declare a foreign civil judgment enforceable only if it finds that (a) the judgment was rendered by a court which was, according to the laws of the state of the court, competent to render the judgment; (b) the judgment may no longer be appealed; (c) the obligation imposed by the judgment is enforceable according to the rules relating to the enforceability of judgments in Israel and the substance of the judgment is not contrary to public policy; and (d) the judgment is executory in the state in which it was given.\nEven if these conditions are satisfied, an Israeli court will not enforce a foreign judgment if it was given in a state whose laws do not provide for the enforcement of judgments of Israeli courts (subject to exceptional cases) or if its enforcement is likely to prejudice the sovereignty or security of the State of Israel. An Israeli court also will not declare a foreign judgment enforceable if (i) the judgment was obtained by fraud; (ii) there is a finding of lack of due process; (iii) the judgment was rendered by a court not competent to render it according to the laws of private international law in Israel; (iv) the judgment is at variance with another judgment that was given in the same matter between the same parties and that is still valid; or (v) at the time the action was brought in the foreign court, a suit in the same matter and between the same parties was pending before a court or tribunal in Israel.\nIn addition, if a foreign judgment is enforced by an Israeli court, it generally will be payable in ILS, which can then be converted into foreign currency at the rate of exchange of such foreign currency on the date of payment. Pending collection, the amount of the judgment of an Israeli court stated in ILS (without any linkage to a foreign currency) ordinarily will be linked to the Israeli consumer price index plus interest at the annual statutory rate prevailing at such time. Judgment creditors bear the risk of unfavorable exchange rates.\nProvisions of Israeli law may delay, prevent, or make difficult an acquisition of Cyren Ltd., which could prevent a change of control and therefore depress the price of our shares.\nIsraeli corporate law regulates mergers and acquisitions of shares through tender offers, requires special approvals for transactions involving officers, directors or significant shareholders and regulates other matters that may be relevant to these types of transactions. Furthermore, Israeli tax considerations may make potential transactions unappealing to us or to our shareholders whose country of residence does not have a tax treaty with Israel exempting such shareholders from Israeli tax. For example, Israeli tax law does not recognize tax-free share exchanges to the same extent as U.S. tax law. With respect to mergers, Israeli tax law allows for tax deferral in certain circumstances but makes the deferral contingent on the fulfillment of a number of conditions, including a holding period of two years from the date of the transaction during which sales and dispositions of shares of the participating companies are subject to certain restrictions. Moreover, with respect to certain share swap transactions, the tax deferral is limited in time, and when such time expires, the tax becomes payable even if no disposition of the shares has occurred. These and other similar provisions could delay, prevent, or impede an acquisition of our company or our merger with another company, even if such an acquisition or merger would be beneficial to us or to our shareholders.\nYour rights and responsibilities as a shareholder will be governed by Israeli law which differs in some respects from the rights and responsibilities of shareholders of U.S. companies.\nWe are incorporated under Israeli law. The rights and responsibilities of the holders of our ordinary shares are governed by our Articles of Association and Israeli law. These rights and responsibilities differ in some respects from the rights and responsibilities of shareholders in typical U.S.-based corporations. In particular, a shareholder of an Israeli company has a duty to act in good faith toward the company and other shareholders and to refrain from abusing its power in the company, including, among other things, in voting at the general meeting of shareholders on matters such as amendments to a company\u2019s articles of association, increases in a company\u2019s authorized share capital, mergers and acquisitions and interested party transactions requiring shareholder approval. In addition, a controlling shareholder, a shareholder who knows that it possesses the power to determine the outcome of a shareholder vote or to appoint or prevent the appointment of a director or executive officer in the company, has a duty of fairness toward the company. There is limited case law available to assist us in understanding the implications of these provisions that govern shareholders\u2019 actions. These provisions may be interpreted to impose additional obligations and liabilities on holders of our ordinary shares that are not typically imposed on shareholders of U.S. corporations.\nWe are no longer a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of the Nasdaq Listing Rules. However, we will continue to qualify for, and may rely on during a one-year transition period, exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements that would otherwise provide protection to our shareholders.\nAs a result of the sale of our ordinary shares in the registered direct offering in February 2021, Warburg Pincus no longer controls a majority of our ordinary shares. As a result, we are no longer a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of the Nasdaq Listing Rules. Under these rules, a company of which more than 50% of the voting power for the election of directors is held by an individual, a group or another company is a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d and may elect not to comply with certain Nasdaq corporate governance requirements, including, without limitation (i) the requirement that a majority of the board of directors consist of independent directors, (ii) the requirement that the compensation of our officers be determined or recommended to our board of directors by a compensation committee that is comprised solely of independent directors, and (iii) the requirement that director nominees be selected or recommended to the board of directors by a majority of independent directors or a nominating committee comprised solely of independent directors. We nevertheless have a Compensation Committee comprised of all independent directors. However, at present, only five out of ten directors on our board are independent. In addition, our Nominating and Governance Committee, is not comprised solely of independent directors, although a majority of the directors on the Nominating and Governance Committee are independent directors. Even though we are not a \u201ccontrolled company,\u201d we will continue to qualify for, and may rely on, exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements that would otherwise provide protection to shareholders of other companies during a one-year transition period. The Nasdaq rules require that our board be composed of a majority of \u201cindependent directors,\u201d and that our Nominating and Governance Committee consist entirely of independent directors by February 2021. In addition, we may have difficulty complying with the requirements listed above and while we intend to do so, we cannot assure you that we will be able to comply with such requirements before the end of the phase-in period for compliance.",

As of March 15, 2021, there were 30 record holders of our ordinary shares.\nDividends\nIf the Company decides to distribute a cash dividend, Israeli residents who are individuals are generally subject to Israeli income tax at a rate of either 25% or 30%, if the recipient of such dividend is a \u201csubstantial shareholder\u201d at the time of distribution or at any time during the preceding 12-month period, unless the cash dividend is paid out of income that has been tax exempt due to an \u201capproved enterprise\u201d status under the Law for the Encouragement of Capital Investments, 5719-1959, in which case the Company will be subject to corporate tax at a rate then in effect under Israeli law on the amount of cash dividend and in addition, an Israeli shareholder, corporation or individual, will be subject to a tax rate of 20% on such cash dividend distribution. In addition, Israeli resident corporations are generally exempt from Israeli corporate tax for dividends paid on our ordinary shares. Pursuant to the Convention Between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of Israel with Respect to Taxes on Income, as amended (the \u201cU.S.-Israel Tax Treaty\u201d), the maximum tax on dividends paid to a holder of our ordinary shares who qualifies as a resident of the United States within the meaning of the U.S.-Israel Tax Treaty is 25% or 15% in case of dividends paid out of the profits of an \u201capproved enterprise\u201d, subject to certain conditions. Furthermore, dividends not generated by an \u201capproved enterprise\u201d paid to a U.S. corporation holding at least 10% of our issued voting power during the part of the tax year which precedes the date of payment of the dividend and during the whole of its prior tax year (if any), are generally taxed at a rate of 12.5%, subject to certain conditions. The Company has never declared or paid cash dividends on its ordinary shares. However, the Company has not adopted a policy not to pay cash dividends and therefore may declare a dividend in the future. The actual amount, timing, and frequency of future dividends, if any, will be at the sole discretion of the board of directors and will be declared based upon various factors, many of which are beyond our control. The Company\u2019s current plans are to retain future earnings primarily to finance the development of its business and for other corporate purposes.\nEquity Compensation Plan Information\nSee \u201cItem 12.

MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the information contained in our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto. The following discussion and analysis includes forward-looking statements that involve certain risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those described in Item 1A. Risk Factors. Our actual results may differ materially from those discussed below. See \u201cSpecial Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nOverview\nPurpose built for the cloud, Cyren was an early pioneer and leading innovator of cloud delivered Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) cybersecurity solutions that protect businesses, their employees, and customers against threats from email, files, and the web.\nCyren\u2019s cloud-based approach to cybersecurity sets us apart from other vendors in the market. Our security solutions are architected around the fundamental belief that cybersecurity is a race against time - and the cloud best enables the speed, sophistication and advanced automation needed to detect and block threats as they emerge on the internet around the globe. As more and more businesses move their data and applications to the cloud, they need a security provider that is able to keep pace.\nSecurity threats are more prevalent and stealthier than ever. As cybercrime has become more sophisticated, every malware, phishing and ransomware variant is unique, making it more difficult to detect attacks. While organizations have traditionally protected their users with gateway security appliances at their network perimeter, more frequent and evasive attacks combined with a more distributed workforce are reducing the effectiveness of this approach. Traditional appliances lack the real-time threat intelligence and processing power to detect emerging threats, and the growth of mobile devices and an increasingly distributed workforce mean that more and more business is conducted outside of the traditional network perimeter. As a result, when new attacks appear in a matter of seconds, legacy cybersecurity products can leave companies vulnerable for hours, days or even weeks.\nCyren\u2019s cloud security products and services fall into three categories:\n\u25cf Cyren Threat Detection Services - these services detect a variety of threats in email and from the web, and are embedded into products from the world\u2019s leading technology and security vendors. Cyren Threat Detection Services include our Email Security Detection Engine, Malware Detection Engine, Web Security Engine, and Threat Analysis Service.\n\u25cf Cyren Threat Intelligence Data - Cyren\u2019s Threat Intelligence Data provide valuable threat intelligence data that can be used by enterprise or OEM customers to support threat detection, threat hunting and incident response. Cyren\u2019s Threat Intelligence Data offerings include IP Reputation Intelligence, Phishing Intelligence, Malware Intelligence and Zombie Intelligence.\n\u25cf Cyren Enterprise Email Security Products - these include cloud-based solutions designed for enterprise customers, and are sold either directly or through channel partners. Cyren Enterprise Email Security products include Cyren Email Security, a cloud-based secure email gateway and Cyren Inbox Security, an anti-phishing product for Office 365.\nKey Opportunities and Challenges\nThreat Landscape\nThe last several years have possibly experienced the greatest amount of dramatic global incidents directly related to malware and cyber threats since the advent of the internet. From election hacks to global ransomware attacks, malware threats are at an all-time high. Phishing attacks have become increasingly common, and no company, large or small seems immune to these threats. Hackers have become more successful at monetizing these attacks, and as long as these activities prove lucrative, we expect these incidents to continue.\nCloud and Mobility\nBusinesses are going through a massive change in their IT strategies as they look to drive more business value, agility, and better customer experiences, while cloud and mobility are becoming increasingly important, as evidenced by the following trends:\n\u25cf Business internet traffic continues to increase every year;\n\u25cf Data and applications are increasingly moving to the cloud;\n\u25cf More and more users are working remotely;\n\u25cf Buyers continue to move away from traditional on-premise solutions;\n\u25cf Mature and legacy on premise deployments are reaching end of life and are increasingly being replaced by cloud and SaaS alternatives;\n\u25cf IT security staffing shortages;\n\u25cf Increasingly fast, sophisticated, expensive, and high-profile attacks target organizations of all sizes;\n\u25cf Compliance and regulatory mandates;\n\u25cf Heightened cybercrime activity among commercial enterprises and nation states;\n\u25cf Automation is increasingly considered critical to accelerating detection and protection;\n\u25cf The need to simplify operations through vendor consolidation.\nThese are some of the reasons why we believe Cyren\u2019s vision for 100% cloud security is compelling to IT security teams looking to protect their businesses in today\u2019s cloud-centric mobile-first world.\nInvestments in Operations, Research and Development and Sales and Marketing\nOur cost of revenues, research and development expenses, and sales and marketing expenses are all significant contributing factors to our operating losses. Over time, we expect that our utilization of our cloud infrastructure will increase and provide the opportunity for improved gross margins. Our investments in research and development are required in order to enhance and improve our solutions. In the future, we expect to lower the rate of R&D investment as a percentage of revenue. The return on our sales and marketing investment is tied to attracting new customers and enhancing our business with existing customers, thereby lowering the overall sales and marketing costs as a percent of revenues. During 2020 we reduced our overall headcount in order to reduce expenses, and we believe managing future headcount and expense growth will be key in improving our gross and operating margins over time.\nGrowing Our Enterprise Business\nAlthough all of our services are subscription services, our Enterprise offerings are typically invoiced up front for an annual contract amount, or the full multi-year contract amount, at the start of the term. As a result, this business is expected to provide a larger immediate contribution to cash flow and better return on investment. As this enterprise business grows as a portion of our overall revenues, we expect to increase deferred revenue and our operating results and cash flow to improve, which will make us less reliant on other sources of capital in the future.\nComponents of our Operating Results\nRevenue\nWe derive revenues from the sale of real-time cloud-based services for each of Cyren\u2019s email security, web security, antimalware, and advanced threat protection offerings.\nWe sell all of our solutions as subscription services, either to OEMs and service providers or directly or indirectly to enterprises.\nCost of Revenue\nPersonnel costs, which consist of salaries, benefits, bonuses, and stock-based compensation for employees that operate our network and provide support services to our customers, as well as data center costs, are the most significant components of our cost of revenues. Other costs include third party contractors, royalties for use of third-party technologies, amortization of intangibles and depreciation of data center equipment. We expect these costs may increase in absolute dollars as we continue to optimize our cloud infrastructure and our support services, but should reduce as a percentage of overall revenue.\nOperating Expenses\nOur operating expenses consist of research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses. Personnel costs, which consist of salaries, benefits, bonuses, and stock-based compensation, are the most significant component of our operating expenses. Operating expenses also include allocated overhead costs for facilities, IT, and depreciation. We expect operating expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to grow.\nResearch and Development. Research and development expenses consists primarily of personnel costs, outsourced engineering, and threat analysis services. We believe these investments are crucial for our ability to continue to enhance the functionality of our services, as well as to develop and introduce new services to the market. We expect research and development expenses may increase in 2021 as we support newly released products in 2020. Development costs related to internal use technology that supports our security services are capitalized on the balance sheet, while other development costs are expensed as they are incurred.\nSales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses primarily include personnel costs, sales commissions, marketing activities, and travel associated with sales and marketing. We market and sell our services worldwide through our sales organization and distribution channels. We capitalize sales commissions paid to internal sales personnel and amortize these expenses over an estimated period of benefit that reflects the expected future revenue streams. We reduced sales and marketing expense in 2020 but anticipate that we may need to increase investment in these areas related to new products launched in 2020 and enhance our sales and marketing efforts to support our further growth. Our sales personnel are typically not immediately productive, and therefore the increase in expenses we incur when adding personnel is not immediately accompanied by increased revenue and in some cases may not result in increased revenue if these new sales personnel are unsuccessful in becoming productive.\nGeneral and Administrative. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs, audit fees, legal expenses, recruiting expenses and other general operating costs. We expect our general and administrative expenses to continue to grow in absolute dollars as we continue our operational growth.\nOther Income (Expense), net\nOther income (expense), net consists generally of capital gain or loss from the sale of assets. However, in the first quarter of 2019, we reached a financial settlement with the former shareholders of eleven related to the legal dispute regarding the amount and timing of the earn-out payments related to the acquisition of eleven (the \u201celeven settlement\u201d). Since the financial settlement was less than the accrued interest and the unpaid earn-out consideration on the Company\u2019s balance sheet, the difference was reflected as other income during the period.\nFinancial Expenses, net\nFinancial expenses, net consist mainly of foreign exchange gains and losses, interest expense on our outstanding debt and interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents. In 2019 and 2020, these expenses also included income related to the accounting for a multi-year arrangement where a customer paid upfront the full contract value. This has been deemed a significant financing component under ASC 606.\nTax Benefit\nOur tax benefit is derived primarily from income taxes in foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct business. We estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. This process involves determining income tax expense together with calculating the deferred income tax expense related to temporary differences resulting from the differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. These temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included net as applicable within our balance sheets. For most of our recent years, we have incurred operating losses in Israel and the U.S., where we have recorded a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets in those jurisdictions.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth financial data for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 (in thousands):\nYear ended\nDecember 31,\nRevenues $ 36,388 $ 38,391\nCost of revenues 14,786 15,557\nGross profit 21,602 22,834\nOperating expenses:\nResearch and development, net 16,083 15,801\nSales and marketing 11,678 13,825\nGeneral and administrative 9,583 10,877\nTotal operating expenses 37,344 40,503\nOperating loss (15,742 ) (17,669 )\nOther income, net\nFinancial expenses, net ($590 and $567 attributable to related parties, respectively) (1,647 ) (727 )\nLoss before taxes on income (17,384 ) (18,130 )\nTax benefit\nNet loss $ (17,263 ) $ (18,018 )\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019\nRevenues. 2020 revenues of $36.4 million decreased by $2.0 million from $38.4 million in 2019, which represents a 5% year-over-year decrease. Revenues for the fourth quarter included a one-time reduction of $0.7 million as a result of a multi-year customer contract that was restructured. Additionally, the decrease was driven by renewals of customer contracts at lower values, expiration of a small number of customer contracts in the Threat Intelligence business, and the end of life of several legacy Enterprise products during 2020. In the second half of 2020, the Company released the newest Enterprise products, Cyren Inbox Security (launched in April 2020) and Threat InDepth (launched in June 2020). Since the product launch, the Company has signed several new customer contracts representing over $0.8 million of revenue, but due to the timing and ratable nature of the contracts, there was not a material amount recognized in 2020.\nCost of Revenues. Cost of revenues for 2020 totaling $14.8 million decreased by $0.8 million from $15.6 million in 2019, which represents an 5% decrease year-over-year. Datacenter costs increased by $0.3 million and associated fixed asset depreciation increased by $0.4 million during 2020 compared to 2019. These increases are required as a foundation for the continued growth of the business. Headcount associated with cost of revenues throughout the year decreased from 39 to 36 employees during 2020. Payroll and related expenses decreased by $0.3 million driven by lower salaries and costs associated with employee benefits. Intangible amortization expenses decreased by $0.8 million in 2020 compared to 2019, which includes a $0.2 million decrease due to additional expense in 2019 associated with recording an intangible asset impairment. No impairment was recorded in 2020. Outside services decreased $0.4 million in 2020 compared to 2019 due to efforts to reduce reliance upon outside vendors for certain services.\nResearch and Development, Net. Research and development expenses, net for 2020 totaling $16.1 million increased by $0.3 million from $15.8 million in 2019, which represents an 2% increase year-over-year. Payroll and related expenses decreased by approximately $1.5 million primarily driven by lower headcount. R&D headcount during 2020 decreased from 132 to 117 employees. Capitalization of technology development, which reduces expenses, decreased from $3.7 million in 2019 to $1.5 million in 2020, which as a result, increased expense by $2.2 million. Included within the $2.2 million increase was a one-time write-off of $0.7 million in Q3 2020 of a previously capitalized R&D project expense from prior periods that was terminated in Q3 2020. Overall, the change in capitalization of technology development was driven by higher capitalization in 2019 and early 2020 in advance of a new product launch in April 2020. Outside services and outsourced engineering expenses associated with our increased investment in R&D decreased by $0.5 million.\nSales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses for 2020 totaling $11.7 million decreased by $2.1 million, compared to $13.8 million in 2019. The change is mainly due to a $1.4 million decrease in payroll and related expenses due to lower headcount. Sales and Marketing headcount during 2020 decreased from 45 to 37 employees. Travel related costs decreased in 2020 by $0.4 million, the use of outside services associated with marketing activities decreased by $0.1 million and allocated costs from the Corp & IT department due to lower headcount in 2020 decreased by $0.2 million in 2020.\nGeneral and Administrative. General and administrative expenses for 2020 of $9.6 million decrease by $1.3 million, compared to $10.9 million in 2019, which represents a 12% decrease. Salary and related compensation costs increased by $0.5 million primarily driven by higher salary costs and ASC 718 (stock compensation) expense related to RSUs issued in 2020 with a 1-year vesting period offset by lower bonus and severance expense in 2020. Travel and related expenses decreased by $0.2 million driven by COVID-19 pandemic and related travel restrictions. Outside services decreased by $1.3 million due to higher legal expenses in 2019 associated with the litigation settlement of approximately $1.1 million as outlined in Note 7 of the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. Employee recruitment decreased in 2020 by $0.3 million primarily driven by employee searches in 2019 that did not occur in 2020. G&A headcount during 2020 decreased from 32 to 31 employees.\nOther Income (Expense), Net. Other income, net for 2020 was $0.0 million, compared to an income of $0.2 million for corresponding periods last year. During the first quarter of 2019, we reached a financial settlement with the former shareholders of eleven related to the legal dispute regarding the amount and timing of the earn-out payments related to the acquisition of eleven (the \u201celeven settlement\u201d). Since the financial settlement was less than the accrued interest and the unpaid earn-out consideration on the Company\u2019s balance sheet, the difference was reflected as other income during the period. For additional information, please refer to Note 7.b(i) of the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (the \u201cAnnual Report\u201d).\nFinancial Expense, Net. Financial expenses, net, for 2020 of $1.6 million increased by $0.9 million, compared to $0.7 million in 2019.\nFinancial expense, net is primarily made up of interest associated with the Convertible Debentures issued in March 2020 and the Convertible Notes issued in December 2018. For additional information, please refer to Note 9 of the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nInterest expense associated with the Convertible Notes and Debentures increased by $0.6 million in 2020 due to the Convertible Debentures issued in March 2020.\nInterest capitalized as a part of R&D capitalization, and is an offset to interest expense, decreased by $0.1 million in 2020 due to fewer projects capitalized in 2020.\nThe impact of foreign exchange fluctuation increased expense in 2020 by $0.2 million.\nEffective Corporate Tax Rates\nCorporate tax rates and real capital gains tax in Israel were 23% in 2020 and 2019. There has been no change to date in 2021.\nThe Company\u2019s German subsidiary is subject to German tax at a consolidated rate of approximately 30%.\nOther non-Israeli subsidiaries are taxed according to the tax laws in their respective countries of residence.\nWe do not provide deferred tax liabilities when we intend to reinvest earnings of foreign subsidiaries indefinitely. As of December 31, 2020, there are no undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries.\nWe may currently qualify as an \u201cindustrial company\u201d within the definition of the Law for the Encouragement of Industry (Taxation), as such, we may be eligible for certain tax benefits, including, inter alia, special depreciation rates for machinery, equipment and buildings, amortization of patents, certain other intangible property rights and deduction of share issuance expenses.\nNet Operating Loss Carry-Forwards\nAs of December 31, 2020, Cyren Ltd.\u2019s net operating loss carryforwards for tax purposes amounted to $108.6 million and capital loss carryforwards of $17.8 million which may be carried forward and offset against taxable income in the future, for an indefinite period.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the U.S. subsidiary had net operating loss carryforwards of $40.7 million for federal tax purposes and $10.6 million for state tax purposes. These losses may offset any future U.S. taxable income of the U.S. subsidiary and will expire in the years 2021 through 2040.\nManagement currently believes that based upon its estimations for future taxable income, it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets regarding the loss carryforwards will not be utilized in the foreseeable future. Thus, a valuation allowance was provided to reduce deferred tax assets to their realizable value.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe Company intends to finance operating costs over the next twelve months through a combination of existing cash on hand, reducing operating spend, potentially divesting non-core assets and future issuances of equity and/or debt securities. As of December 31, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of $248.7 million, cash and cash equivalents of $9.3 million, and generated a net loss of $17.3 million. We have incurred losses since inception and expect to continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future. Current assets amounted to approximately $12.0 million with current liabilities of approximately $24.9 million, resulting in negative working capital (defined as current assets minus current liabilities) of approximately $12.9 million. The current cash balance and historical trend of cash used in operations along with the maturity of the Convertible Notes in December 2021, which we are currently trying to restructure, and lack of certainty regarding a future capital raise and our ability to renegotiate the term of the Convertible Notes, raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for the next twelve months from the date of issuance of these financial statements. We do not anticipate that we will have sufficient funds to pay the principal of the Convertible Notes on their maturity date. The inability to restructure or borrow sufficient funds to refinance the Convertible Notes on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, would have serious consequences to our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to our growth, market acceptance of our offerings, the timing and extent of spending to support our efforts to develop our platform and the expansion of sales and marketing activities. We may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. In the event that additional financing is required from outside sources, we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we issue additional equity securities in order to raise additional funds, further dilution to existing stockholders may occur. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nPlease see the Financings section below for more details on the Company\u2019s recent efforts to fund operating activities.\nOutlook\nThe Company intends to finance operating costs over the next twelve months through a combination of existing cash on hand, reducing operating spend, potentially divesting non-core assets and future issuances of equity and/or debt securities. Over the past several years, the Company has devoted most of its effort to research and development, new product development and increasing revenues through additional investments in sales and marketing. The Company generated a loss of $17.3 million and a negative cash flow of $8.4 million from operating activities in the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2020. However, the Company has incurred losses since inception and expects to continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future. The Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company obtaining the necessary financing to meet its obligations, repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they become due and the repayment of the Convertible Notes that mature in December 2021. The Company is currently negotiating the restructuring of the Convertible Notes with the Note holders and at this time we are uncertain as to the outcome. For additional information, please refer to Note 2c of the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nWe regularly have discussions with our customers regarding the renewal of their contracts and the renegotiation of the terms of such contracts at the time of renewal. In the fourth quarter of 2020, we received notification that our largest customer will renew one of their contracts for another three years through the first quarter of 2024, but that it does not intend to renew its largest contract with the Company beginning April 2021. As a result, we anticipate that quarterly revenues from this customer will drop from over 20% currently to approximately 14% of quarterly revenue beginning in the second quarter of 2021. For additional information, please refer to Note 11b of the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nIn 2020, net cash used in operating activities was $8.4 million and was primarily due to a net loss of $17.3 million adjusted for non-cash activity of $2.8 million amortization of intangible assets, $2.3 million depreciation of property and equipment, $2.4 million stock-based compensation expenses, $1.5 million amortization of deferred commissions, $2.1 million in amortization of operating lease right-of-use assets associated with the adoption of ASC 842 effective January 1, 2019, a $1.3 million increase in trade receivables, net and offset by a $1.9 million decrease in deferred revenues, a decrease in deferred commissions of $1.1 million, a decrease in trade payables of $0.4, and a decrease in operating lease liabilities of $1.6 million.\nIn 2019, net cash used in operating activities was $6.9 million and was primarily due to a net loss of $18.0 million adjusted for non-cash activity of $3.8 million amortization of intangible assets, $1.9 million depreciation of property and equipment, $2.4 million stock-based compensation expenses, $1.2 million amortization of deferred commissions, $1.3 million in amortization of operating lease right-of-use assets associated with the adoption of ASC 842 effective January 1, 2019, $2.9 million increase in deferred revenues, $1.5 million increase in trade receivables, net and offset by a decrease in deferred commissions of $1.0 million, a decrease in trade payables of $0.7 and a decrease of $1.0 in employee and payroll accruals, accrued expenses and other liabilities and a decrease in operating lease liabilities of $1.2 million.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nIn 2020, net cash used in investing activities consisted of $1.5 million for capitalization of technology and $1.8 million used to purchase property and equipment.\nIn 2019, net cash used in investing activities consisted of $3.7 million for capitalization of technology and $1.5 million used to purchase property and equipment.\nOur capital expenditures over the last three years consisted primarily of continued investment in R&D and also purchases of property and equipment to modernize and expand our data centers and to invest in our infrastructure in order to support new products and facilitate the growth of the Company.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nIn 2020, net cash generated by financing activities was $9.4 million attributable to the issuance of Convertible Debentures in March 2020 with gross proceeds of $10.2 million, offset by the payment of debt issuance costs of $0.8 million.\nIn 2019, net cash generated by financing activities was $6.0 million and was due to net proceeds of $8.0 million from the rights offering, $0.7 million proceeds from exercise of options, and offset by $2.7 million payment of earn-out consideration.\nWorking Capital\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had negative working capital of $12.9 million and as of December 31, 2019, we had positive working capital of $0.6 million.\nFinancings\nOn December 5, 2018, the Company issued $10.0 million aggregate principal amount of Convertible Notes in a private placement to affiliates of an existing minority institutional shareholder. The Convertible Notes are unsecured, unsubordinated obligations of Cyren and carry a 5.75% interest rate, payable semi-annually in (i) 50% cash and (ii) 50% cash or ordinary shares at Cyren\u2019s election. The notes have a 3-year term and mature in December 2021, unless converted in accordance with their terms prior to maturity. The notes were issued with a conversion price of $3.90 per share which was subject to adjustment using a weighted average ratchet mechanism based on the size and price of future equity offerings and the total shares outstanding. We are currently negotiating the restructuring of the Convertible Notes with the Note holders to postpone the final repayment date by several months under certain terms, although there is no assurance that we will be able to do so on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nOn November 7, 2019 we completed a rights offering that raised gross proceeds of $8.0 million. As a result of this offering, the conversion price of the Convertible Notes was adjusted to $3.73. In addition, the Convertible Notes are subject to immediate conversion upon any change in control in the Company (or subject to repayment if the price in the change in control transaction is less than the conversion price).\nOn March 19, 2020, we issued $10.25 million aggregate principal amount of Convertible Debentures in a private placement to certain investors. The Convertible Debentures are secured by a guarantee by two of our subsidiaries and carry a 5.75% interest rate, payable semi-annually in cash or, subject to the satisfaction of certain equity conditions, in ordinary shares. The Convertible Debentures mature in March 2024, unless converted in accordance with their terms prior to maturity. The Convertible Debentures have an initial conversion price of $0.75 per share, subject to adjustments. If the closing bid price of our ordinary shares has been at least $2.25 (subject to adjustment) for at least 20 trading days during any 30 consecutive trading day period, and certain conditions are satisfied, we may force a conversion of all or any part of the outstanding principal amount of the Convertible Debentures, accrued and unpaid interest and any other amounts then owing, subject to certain conditions.\nOn February 16, 2021, we issued to several institutional investors in a registered direct offering (the \u201cOffering\u201d), 12,000,000 of our ordinary shares at a purchase price of $1.15 per share for net proceeds of approximately $12.5 million. We intend to use the proceeds from this offering for working capital and general corporate purposes.\nWe also issued to the placement agent or its designees warrants (\u201cPlacement Agent Warrants\u201d) to purchase up to 720,000 ordinary shares (the \u201cWarrant Shares\u201d), representing 6% of the aggregate number of Ordinary Shares sold in the Offering. The Placement Agent Warrants have an exercise price equal to $1.4375, or 125% of the Offering price, per ordinary share and will be exercisable commencing on August 16, 2021 for five years from the effective date of the Offering.\nEarn-Out Consideration\nIn conjunction with the 2012 acquisition of eleven, the Company entered into an earn-out agreement with the former shareholders that would pay additional consideration based on the revenue performance for the years ending 2012-2015. Subsequently in 2014 the Company had a legal dispute regarding the amount and timing of the earn-out payments and had entered into arbitral proceedings with the former shareholders of eleven. On March 9, 2017, the Company received the arbitral judgement. Pursuant to the judgement, the earn-out consideration balance was increased to reflect additional legal expenses and interest expenses covering the period up to December 31, 2016. During 2017 and 2018, the Company continued to accrue interest on the unpaid earn-out consideration balance. Such interest is reflected in the consolidated statements of operations under financial expenses, net. In May 2018, the Company made a partial payment of the earn-out consideration to five of the six former shareholders, in an amount of $604 thousand. The earn-out consideration balance presented on the Company\u2019s balance sheet as of December 31, 2018 reflects the complete remaining liability relating to the earn-out, including accrued interest. Subsequent to the reporting period, in February 2019, the parties agreed to resolve all pending claims, and on February 28, 2019 the Company paid approximately $2.7 million to settle the earn-out consideration in full. For additional information, please refer to Note 7b(i) of the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nRegistration Statements\nIn connection with our private placement to Warburg Pincus in November 2017, in which we issued approximately 10.6 million ordinary shares for $1.85 per share, we and Warburg Pincus entered into a registration rights agreement, which, among other things, provides Warburg Pincus with three demand registration rights, piggyback and shelf registration rights. The demand registration rights may be exercised starting August 6, 2018, subject to certain customary blackout periods.\nIn connection with issuance of the Convertible Debentures, we entered into a registration rights agreement with the purchasers. Pursuant to that agreement, we filed a registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC covering the resale of our ordinary shares that are issuable to the purchasers upon any conversion of the Convertible Debentures or as interest payments.\nOn September 21, 2018, we filed a shelf registration statement on Form with the SEC, which we converted to a Form S-3 on August 16, 2019. This registration statement enables us to issue debt securities, ordinary shares, warrants or subscription rights up to an aggregate amount of $50 million. Under the rules governing shelf registration statements, we will file a prospectus supplement with the SEC which describes the amount and type of securities being offered each time we issue securities under this registration statement. No securities were issued under the registration statement on Form. In November 2019, we issued shares as part of our rights offerings and in February 2021, we issued shares in the registered direct offering using our Form S-3 as described above.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nNot applicable.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThis section is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d). The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates, judgements and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. On an ongoing basis, the Company\u2019s management evaluates estimates, including those related to fair value and useful lives of intangible assets, fair value of earn-out liabilities, valuation allowance on deferred tax assets, income tax uncertainties, fair values of stock-based awards, other contingent liabilities and estimates used in applying the revenue recognition policy. Such estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.\nThe critical accounting policies requiring estimates, assumptions, and judgements that we believe have the most significant impact on our consolidated financial statements are described below.\nIntangible Assets\nIntangible assets that are not considered to have an indefinite useful life are amortized over their estimated useful lives, which range from 1 to 20 years. Acquired customer contracts and relationships are amortized over their estimated useful lives in proportion to the economic benefits realized. This accounting policy results in accelerated amortization of such customer contracts and relationships arrangements as compared to the straight-line method. Technology, intellectual property, and trademarks are amortized over their estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nThe Company\u2019s long-lived assets and identifiable intangibles are reviewed for impairment in accordance with ASC 360 \u201cProperty, Plant and Equipment\u201d, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.\nRecoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of each asset group to the future undiscounted cash flows the asset group is expected to generate. If the asset is considered to be impaired, the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset.\nThe Company did not record an impairment related to year-ended December 31, 2020.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2019, we have recognized an impairment loss of $0.2 related to R&D, an acquired intangible asset from a prior acquisition. We have determined that the benefit of the acquired R&D would not be realized. This amount was recognized in cost of revenue. While this was a non-cash charge, it is expected to reduce amortization expense by $0.1 on an annualized basis.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price in a business combination over the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized, but rather is subject to an impairment test.\nThe Company performs an annual impairment test at December 31, of each fiscal year, or more frequently if impairment indicators are present. The Company operates in one operating segment, and this segment comprises its only reporting unit.\nASC 350 prescribes a two-phase process for impairment testing of goodwill. The first phase screens for impairment, while the second phase (if necessary) measures impairment. Goodwill impairment is deemed to exist if the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value determined using market capitalization. In such case, the second phase is then performed, and the Company measures impairment by comparing the carrying amount of the reporting unit\u2019s goodwill to the implied fair value of that goodwill. An impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess. ASC 350 allows an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test. An entity is not required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines, based on a qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount. Alternatively, ASC 350 permits an entity to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit and proceed directly to performing the first step of the goodwill impairment test. Accordingly, the Company elected to proceed directly to the first step of the quantitative goodwill impairment test and compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying value.\nFor each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2020, no impairment losses have been identified.\nFair Value Measurements\nThe carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, prepaid expenses, other receivables, and trade payables, approximate their fair values due to the short-term maturities of such financial instruments.\nFair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or a liability. A three-tiered fair value hierarchy is established as a basis for considering such assumptions and for inputs used in the valuation methodologies in measuring fair value:\nLevel 1 - Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company can access at the measurement date.\nLevel 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.\nLevel 3 - Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.\nThe availability of observable inputs can vary from instrument to instrument and is affected by a wide variety of factors, including, for example, the type of instrument, the liquidity of markets and other characteristics particular to the transaction. To the extent that valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market, the determination of fair value requires more judgment and the instruments are categorized as Level 3.\nThe fair value hierarchy also requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.\nRevenue Recognition\nEffective January 1, 2018, the Company adopted the requirements of ASC 606 under the modified retrospective method of transition which was applied to all customer contracts that were not completed on the effective date of ASC 606. The Company implemented internal controls and key system functionality to enable the preparation of financial information on adoption. The adoption of ASC 606 resulted in changes to the Company\u2019s accounting policies for revenue recognition previously recognized under ASC 605 as detailed below.\nRevenue Recognition Policy\nThe Company derives its revenues from the sale of real-time cloud-based services for each of Cyren\u2019s email security, web security, antimalware, and advanced threat protection offerings.\nThe Company sells all of its solutions as subscription services, either through OEMs, which are considered end-users, or as complete security services directly, or via our partners, to enterprises.\nThe Company recognizes revenue under the core principle that transfer of control to the Company\u2019s customers should be depicted in an amount reflecting the consideration the Company expects to receive in revenue.\nSubscription Service Revenue - Subscription service revenue is derived from a subscription-based licensing model with contract terms typically ranging from one to three years, and consists of (1) subscription fees from the licensing of the Company\u2019s Enterprise or Threat Intelligence Services and (2) subscription fees for real-time threat updates and software with support and related future updates where the software updates are critical to the customers\u2019 ability to derive benefit from the software due to the fast changing nature of the technology. These function together as one performance obligation. The hosted on-demand service arrangements do not provide customers with the right to take possession of the software supporting the hosted services. Support revenue is derived from ongoing security updates, upgrades, bug fixes, and maintenance. A time-elapsed method is used to measure progress because the Company transfers control evenly over the contractual period. Accordingly, the fixed consideration related to subscription service revenue is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the contract term beginning on the date access is provided, as long as other revenue recognition criteria have been met. Most of the company\u2019s contracts are non-cancelable over the contract term. Customers typically have the right to terminate their contract for cause if the Company fails to perform in accordance with the contractual terms. Some of the Company\u2019s customers have the option to purchase additional subscription services at a stated price. These options are evaluated on a case-by-case basis but generally do not provide a material right as they are priced at or above the Company\u2019s standalone selling price and, as such, would not result in a separate performance obligation.\nVariable Consideration - Revenue from sales is recorded at the net sales price, which is the transaction price, and includes estimates of variable consideration. The amount of variable consideration that is included in the transaction price is constrained and is included in the net sales price only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of the cumulative revenue will not occur when the uncertainty is resolved. If the Company\u2019s services or products do not meet certain service level commitments, the Company\u2019s customers are entitled to receive service credits representing a form of variable consideration. The Company has not historically experienced any significant incidents affecting the defined levels of reliability and performance as required by the Company\u2019s subscription contracts. Accordingly, there are no estimated refunds related to these contracts in the consolidated financial statements during the periods presented.\nDeferred Commissions\nThe Company capitalizes sales commissions paid to internal sales personnel that are generally incremental to the acquisition of customer contracts. These costs are recorded as deferred commissions on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company determines whether costs should be deferred based on its sales compensation plans if the commissions are incremental and would not have occurred absent the customer contract. Sales commissions for renewal of a subscription contract are not considered commensurate with the commissions paid for the acquisition of the initial subscription contract given the substantive difference in commission rate between new and renewal contracts. Commissions paid upon the initial acquisition of a contract are amortized over an estimated period of benefit while commissions paid related to renewal contracts are amortized over a contractual renewal period. Amortization is recognized based on the expected future revenue streams under the customer contracts. Amortization of deferred sales commissions is included in sales and marketing expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. The Company determines the period of benefit for commissions paid for the acquisition of the initial subscription contract by taking into consideration factors such as peer estimates of technology lives and customer lives as well as the Company\u2019s own historical data. The Company classifies deferred commissions as current or long-term based on the timing of when the Company expects to recognize the expense. The Company periodically reviews these deferred commission costs to determine whether events or changes in circumstances have occurred that could impact the period of benefit of these deferred contract acquisition costs. There were no material impairment losses recorded during the periods presented.\nCapitalized Technology\nThe Company capitalizes development costs incurred during the application development stage which are related to internal-use technology that supports its security services. Costs related to preliminary project activities and post implementation activities are expensed as incurred as research and development costs on the statements of operations. Capitalized internal-use technology is included in intangible assets on the balance sheet and is amortized on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life, which is generally one to three years. Amortization expenses are recognized under cost of goods sold. Management evaluates the useful lives of these assets on an annual basis and tests for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets.\nAccounting for Stock-Based Compensation\nASC 718 - \u201cCompensation-stock Compensation\u201d- (\u201cASC 718\u201d) requires companies to estimate the fair value of equity-based payment awards on the date of grant using an option-pricing model. The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as an expense over the requisite service periods in the Company\u2019s consolidated statements of operations.\nThe Company recognizes compensation expense for the value of its awards on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of each of the awards, net of estimated forfeitures. Estimated forfeitures are based on actual historical pre-vesting forfeitures. ASC 718 requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Estimated forfeitures are based on actual historical pre-vesting forfeitures (pursuant to the adoption of ASU 2016-09, the Company made a policy election to estimate the number of awards that are expected to vest).\nThe Company estimates the fair value of stock options granted using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The option-pricing model requires a number of assumptions, of which the most significant are the expected stock price volatility and the expected option term. Expected volatility was calculated based upon actual historical stock price movements over the most recent periods ending on the grant date, equal to the expected term of the options. The expected term of options granted represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding, based upon historical experience. The risk-free interest rate is based on the yield from U.S. treasury bonds with an equivalent term. The Company has historically not paid dividends and has no foreseeable plans to pay dividends.\nThe Company applies ASC 718, and ASC 505-50, \u201cEquity Based Payments to Non-Employees\u201d (\u201cASC 505-50\u201d), with respect to options issued to non-employees.\nThe fair value for options granted in 2020 and 2019 is estimated at the date of grant using a Black-Scholes options pricing model with the following assumptions:\nYear ended\nDecember 31,\nStock options\nVolatility 47% - 60 % 46% - 50 %\nRisk-free interest rate 0.23% - 1.40 % 1.5% - 2.5 %\nDividend yield 0 % 0 %\nExpected life (years) 3.9-4.1 3.7-4.0\nAccounting for Income Tax\nThe Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740, \u201cIncome Taxes\u201d (\u201cASC 740\u201d). ASC 740 prescribes the use of the liability method whereby deferred tax asset and liability account balances are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. The Company provides a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to amounts more likely than not to be realized.\nASC 740 contains a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring a liability for uncertain tax positions. The first step is to evaluate the tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that, on an evaluation of the technical merits, the tax position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% (cumulative basis) likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement.\nLoss Contingencies\nWe are subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business. We consider the likelihood of loss or impairment of an asset, or the incurrence of a liability, as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss, in determining loss contingencies. An estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. If we determine that a loss is possible and the range of the loss can be reasonably determined, then we disclose the range of the possible loss. We regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether an accrual is required, an accrual should be adjusted or a range of possible loss should be disclosed.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nRefer to Note 2 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on form 10-K for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nNot applicable.",

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures\nAs of December 31, 2020, we performed an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act). Our management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and our management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective as of December 31, 2020, to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed in filings and submissions under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC\u2019s rules and forms, and that such information related to us and our consolidated subsidiary is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions about required disclosure.\nManagement\u2019s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting system was designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.\nA company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements and even when determined to be effective can only provide reasonable assurance with respect to financial statements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nOur management assessed our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020. Our management based its assessment on criteria established in Internal Control- Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organization of the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment, our management has concluded that, as of December 31, 2020, our internal control over financial reporting is effective.\nThis Annual Report does not include an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management\u2019s report was not subject to attestation by our independent registered public accounting firm pursuant to a provision under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act which grants a permanent exemption for non-accelerated filers from complying with Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.\nDuring the quarter ended December 31, 2020, there were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nPART III",

The audit committee\u2019s duties include providing assistance to the Board in fulfilling its legal and fiduciary obligations in matters involving our accounting, auditing, financial reporting, internal control, and legal compliance functions. In this respect the audit committee approves the services performed by our independent registered public accounting firm and reviews their reports regarding our accounting practices and systems of internal accounting controls. The audit committee also oversees the audits conducted by our independent registered public accounting firm and takes those actions as it deems necessary to confirm that the accountants are independent of management. Under the Companies Law, the responsibilities of the audit committee include identifying irregularities in the management of our business and approving related party transactions as required by law, classifying company transactions as extraordinary transactions or non-extraordinary transactions and as material or non-material transactions in which an officer has an interest (which will have the effect of determining the kind of corporate approvals required for such transaction), assessing the proper function of the company\u2019s internal audit regime and determining whether its internal auditor has the requisite tools and resources required to perform his role and to regulate the company\u2019s rules on employee complaints, reviewing the scope of work of the company\u2019s independent accountants and their fees, and implementing a whistleblower protection plan with respect to employee complaints of business irregularities. The responsibilities of the audit committee under the Companies Law also include the following matters: (i) to establish procedures to be followed in respect of related party transactions with a controlling shareholder (where such are not extraordinary transactions), which may include, where applicable, the establishment of a competitive process for such transaction, under the supervision of the audit committee, or individual, or other committee or body selected by the audit committee, in accordance with criteria determined by the audit committee; and (ii) to determine procedures for approving certain related party transactions with a controlling shareholder, which were determined by the audit committee not to be extraordinary transactions, but which were also determined by the audit committee not to be negligible transactions.\nUnder the Nasdaq Listing Rules, an audit committee must consist of at least three directors meeting the independence standards under Nasdaq Listing Rules. The audit committee consists of David Earhart (chairman), Todd Thomson and John Becker. The Board has determined that each member of the audit committee meets the independence requirements under the Nasdaq Listing Rules and the enhanced independence standards for audit committee members required by the SEC. In addition, the Board has determined that Todd Thomson meets the requirements of an audit committee financial expert under SEC rules.\nCompensation Committee\nThe compensation committee is responsible for (i) proposing executive officer compensation policy, including compensation for our NEOs, to the Board, (ii) proposing necessary revisions to the compensation policy and examining its implementation, (iii) determining whether to approve transactions with respect to compensation of officers, and (iv) determining, in accordance with our compensation policy, whether to exempt the compensation terms with an unaffiliated nominee for the position of chief executive officer from requiring shareholders\u2019 approval, provided such terms meet with the Company\u2019s compensation policy. The compensation committee is also responsible for administering the Company\u2019s various stock option plans, including the issuance of option grants to employees of the Company and its subsidiaries.\nThe compensation committee consists of John Becker (chair), Hila Karah and David Earhart. The Board has determined that each member of the compensation committee meets the independence requirements under Rule 5605(a)(2) of the Nasdaq Listing Rules.\nNominating and Governance Committee\nThe nominating and governance committee\u2019s responsibilities include identifying individuals qualified to become board members and recommending director nominees to the board.\nThe nominating and governance committee consists of Hila Karah (chair), David Earhart, James Hamilton, and Brian Chang. The Board has determined that each member of the nominating and governance meets the independence requirements under Rule 5605(a)(2) of the Nasdaq Listing Rules, except Brian Chang.\nProcess for Shareholder Nominations\nPursuant to the provisions of the Companies Law and our Articles of Association, as amended, directors (other than External Directors (as defined in the Companies Law)) are elected by shareholders at the annual general meeting of the shareholders and hold office until the next annual general meeting following the annual general meeting at which such director is elected and until a successor is elected, or until the director is removed. An annual general meeting must be held at least once in every calendar year, but not more than 15 months after the preceding annual general meeting. Directors may be removed and other directors may be elected in their place or to fill vacancies in the Board at any time by the holders of a majority of the voting power at a general meeting of the shareholders. Until a vacancy is filled by the shareholders, the Board may appoint new directors temporarily to fill vacancies on the Board. Our Articles of Association authorize the shareholders to determine, from time to time, the number of directors.\nDelinquent Section 16(a) Reports\nSection 16(a) of the Exchange Act and the rules thereunder require our directors and executive officers and persons who beneficially own more than 10% of a registered class of our equity securities, to file reports with the SEC relating to their share ownership and changes in such ownership. Based on a review of our records and certain written representations received from our executive officers and directors, we believe that during the year ended December 31, 2020, all Section 16(a) filing requirements applicable to directors, executive officers and greater than 10% shareholders were complied with on a timely basis.",

The Policy includes, among other matters prescribed by the Companies Law, a framework for establishing the terms of office and employment of the directors and officers and guidelines with respect to the structure of the variable pay of officers.\nThe Policy provides that the compensation package for officers shall generally consist of some or all of the following items:\n\u25cf Fixed base salary;\n\u25cf Performance-based rewards (Annual, Special and Signing Bonuses);\n\u25cf Equity-based compensation;\n\u25cf Social benefits; and\n\u25cf Retirement and termination payment.\nIn particular, the Policy, (i) sets an annual cap of US$450,000 for the annual base salary for officers (including the CEO); (ii) sets an annual cap of 600% of the annual base salary on equity based compensation to current officers or a one-time grant of up to 5% of outstanding shares of the Company at the date of grant for new executive hires; and (iii) sets an annual cap of 200% of the annual base salary for performance based cash awards (which may include any combination of annual bonus, special bonus in recognition of outstanding contributions and/or signing bonus for new hires).\nWith respect to bonuses, the calculation for each officer is a product of the Company\u2019s performance and individual performance and the Policy further provides that the majority of any cash bonus must be based on measurable criteria (i.e. financial measures or individual performance criteria while a smaller portion may be discretionary. Equity based compensation may be granted in any form permitted under our equity incentive plans, as in effect from time to time (collectively, the \u201cEquity Incentive Plans\u201d), including stock options and restricted stock units. Equity grants to officers shall be made in accordance with the terms of the Equity Incentive Plans.\nThe Policy also includes a claw back provision which provides that officers will be required to refund any part of the annual performance-based bonuses paid based on financial results that are proven to be inaccurate and which are restated in the financial statements during the three years following the actual payment of the annual bonus, provided the officer is still employed by the Company upon publication of the restated financial statements.\nThe Company may indemnify, insure, and exculpate the officers to the full extent permitted by applicable law from time to time, including by entering into indemnification, insurance, and exculpation agreements, subject to the requisite approvals under applicable law.\nFinally, the Policy provides that non-employee directors may be compensated up to the maximum pay allowable under Israeli law unless the Company\u2019s shareholders approve higher compensation from time to time.\nOur compensation committee will periodically review the Policy and monitor its implementation, and recommend to our Board and shareholders to amend the Policy as it deems necessary from time to time. The term of the Policy is three years as of the date of its adoption, during which, the Board is required to examine the Policy and revise it from time to time if the circumstances under which it had been adopted have materially changed.

This means these awards are subject to accelerated vesting immediately upon a Change in Control if an officer\u2019s employment is Involuntarily Terminated as a result of the Change in Control and not otherwise for Cause, or on the termination date if such Involuntary Termination occurs within twelve months following such Change in Control.\nIf the acquiring company assumes or substitutes the options in connection with the Change in Control, and the officer remains employed, 50% of the officer\u2019s options will immediately vest and the remaining 50% will vest upon the earlier of (i) the one year anniversary of the Change in Control, provided the officer remains employed with the acquiring company; (ii) the original vesting date of the option; or (iii) an Involuntary Termination of the officer\u2019s employment prior to such one year anniversary.\n\u201cInvoluntary Termination\u201d means termination by reason of the officer\u2019s (i) involuntary dismissal or discharge by us other than for Cause or (ii) voluntary resignation following (a) a change in the officer\u2019s position with us which materially reduces the officer\u2019s duties and responsibility; (b) a reduction in the officer\u2019s level of compensation by more than 10%; or (c) a relocation of the officer\u2019s place of employment by more than 50 kilometers, provided and only if such change, reduction or relocation is effected without the officer\u2019s consent.\n\u201cCause\u201d means the officer\u2019s (i) theft, dishonesty, willful misconduct, breach of fiduciary duty for personal profit, or falsification of any Participating Company (as defined in the 2016 Equity Incentive Plan) documents or records; (ii) material failure to abide by a Participating Company\u2019s code of conduct or other policies; (iii) unauthorized use, misappropriation, destruction or diversion of any tangible or intangible asset or corporate opportunity of a Participating Company; (iv) intentional act which has a material detrimental effect on the Participating Company\u2019s reputation or business; (v) repeated failure to perform any reasonable assigned duties after written notice from a Participating Company of, and a reasonable opportunity to cure, such failure; (vi) material breach of any employment, service, non-disclosure, non-competition, non-solicitation or other similar agreement between the officer and a Participating Company, which is not cured; or (vii) conviction (including any plea of guilty or nolo contendere) of any criminal act involving fraud, dishonesty, misappropriation or moral turpitude, or which impairs the officer\u2019s ability to perform his or her duties with a Participating Company.\n\u201cChange in Control\u201d means the occurrence of any one or a combination of the following: (i) any person becomes the beneficial owner of 50% or more of the total fair market value or total combined voting power of our then-outstanding securities; provided, however, that a Change in Control shall not be deemed to have occurred if such beneficial ownership results from any of the following: (A) an acquisition by any person who on December 22, 2016 was the beneficial owner of more than fifty percent (50%) of such voting power, (B) any acquisition directly from us, including pursuant to or in connection with a public offering of securities, (C) any acquisition by us, (D) any acquisition by a trustee or other fiduciary under an employee benefit plan of a participating company or (E) any acquisition by an entity owned directly or indirectly by our stockholders in substantially the same proportions as their ownership of our voting securities; or (ii) (A) the direct or indirect sale or exchange by our stockholders of more than fifty percent (50%) of the total combined voting power of our then outstanding securities in a single or series of related transactions; (B) a merger or consolidation in which we are a party; or (C) the sale, exchange, or transfer of all or substantially all of our assets (other than a sale, exchange or transfer to one or more of our subsidiaries) (collectively, a \u201cTransaction\u201d) in which our stockholders immediately before the Transaction do not retain immediately after the Transaction direct or indirect beneficial ownership of more than fifty percent (50%) of the total combined voting power of our outstanding securities or the entity to which the assets of the Company were transferred, as the case may be; or (iii) a date specified by the compensation committee following approval by the stockholders of a plan of complete liquidation or dissolution of the Company; provided, however, that a Change in Control shall not include a transaction in which a majority of the members of the Board of the continuing, surviving or successor entity, or parent thereof, immediately after such transaction is comprised of incumbent directors. An incumbent director means a director who either (A) was a member of the Board on December 22, 2016, or (B) is elected, or nominated for election, to the Board with the affirmative votes of at least a majority of the incumbent directors at the time of such election or nomination.\nRetirement or Similar Benefit Plans\nIsraeli law generally requires Cyren to make contributions to employees\u2019 pensions and the payment of severance pay upon the retirement or death of an employee or upon termination of employment by the employer or, in certain circumstances, by the employee. Additionally, a general practice in Israel followed by Cyren, although not legally required, is the contribution of funds on behalf of certain employees to an individual insurance policy known as \u201cManagers\u2019 Insurance.\u201d This policy provides a combination of savings plan, insurance and severance pay benefits to the insured employee. It provides for payments to the employee upon retirement or death and secures a substantial portion of the severance pay, if any, to which the employee is legally entitled upon termination of employment. Each participating employee contributes an amount equal to 6% of such employee\u2019s base salary, and we contribute between 12.5% and 14.83% of the employee\u2019s base salary.\nIn the United States, Cyren offers employees the option to participate in the Company\u2019s 401(k) program, which provides partial Company matching up to certain annual contribution limits. Employees can contribute up to the maximum IRS annual contribution limit, and the Company will provide a 50% matching contribution up to a maximum of 3% of an employee\u2019s annual salary. The Company match portion is subject to a 4-year vesting period.\nEmployee Equity Incentive Plan\nEmployees, including executive officers and other management employees, participate in the Company\u2019s employee option plans. On December 22, 2016, our shareholders approved a new stock option plan - the 2016 Equity Incentive Plan (the \u201cEmployee Plan\u201d). This plan replaced all prior employee stock option plans which terminated.\nThe Employee Plan allows for the issuance of RSUs, as well as options. The options and RSUs generally vest over a period of four years but may have shorter vesting periods under certain circumstances. Options granted under the Employee Plan generally expire after six years from the date of grant. Options and RSUs cease vesting upon termination of the optionee\u2019s employment or other relationship with the Company. The per share exercise price for options shall be no less than 100% of the fair market value per ordinary share on the date of grant. Any options and RSUs that are canceled or not exercised within the option term become available for future grant.\nAll employee stock option plans are administered by the compensation committee. Subject to the provisions of the equity plans and applicable law, the compensation committee has the authority to determine, among other things, to whom options may be granted; the number of ordinary shares to which an option may relate; the exercise price for each share; the vesting period of the option and the terms, conditions and restrictions thereof, including accelerated vesting on change in control provisions; to amend provisions relating to such plans; and to make all other determinations deemed necessary or advisable for the administration of such plans.\nNon-Employee Director Equity Incentive Plan\nOn December 22, 2016, our shareholders approved the 2016 Non-Employee Director Equity Incentive Plan (the \u201cNon-Employee Plan\u201d). This plan replaced all previous non-employee stock option plans which terminated. The Non-Employee Plan allows for the issuance of RSUs, as well as options. Each option and RSU granted under the Non-Employee Plan generally vests over a period of four years. Each option has an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the ordinary shares on the grant date of such option. Options granted under the Non-Employee Plan generally expire after six years from the date of grant. Options and RSUs cease vesting upon termination of the relationship with the Company, unless the terminated relationship is with a director who has served the Company for at least three years, and he has not resigned voluntarily or was not removed from the Board due to a failure to perform any of his/her duties to the Company, in which case all unvested options or RSUs would be subject to full accelerated vesting.\nOutstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal Year-End\nThe following table sets forth the outstanding equity awards at fiscal year-end, or December 31, 2020, for our named executive officers.\nOption Awards\nStock Awards\nNumber of\nSecurities Underlying\nUnexercised Options Option\nExercise Option\nExpiration\nNumber of\nShares or\nUnits of\nStock That\nHave Not Market\nValue of\nShares or\nUnits of\nStock That\nHave Not\nName Exercisable Unexercisable Price Date\nVested Vested(1)\nBrett Jackson 427,500 652,500 (4) 2.09 05/06/2025\n1,407,500 (5) 1,449,725\nChief Executive Officer(2)\nJ.

    "item_13": "ITEM 13. CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS, AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE\nCertain Relationships and Related Transactions\nUnder applicable Nasdaq Listing Rules, all related person transactions must be approved by our audit committee or another independent body of the Board. Current SEC rules define transactions with related persons to include any transaction, arrangement or relationship (i) in which the company is a participant, (ii) in which the amount involved exceeds $120,000 (or, in the case of a smaller reporting company, the lesser of $120,000 or one percent of the average of the company\u2019s total assets at year-end for the last two completed fiscal years), and (iii) in which any executive officer, director, director nominee, beneficial owner of more than 5% of the company\u2019s ordinary shares, or any immediate family member of such persons has or will have a direct or indirect material interest. All directors must recuse themselves from any discussion or decision in which they may have a conflict (i.e. matters affecting their personal, business, or professional interests). In addition, pursuant to the Companies Law, certain related party transactions, including (i) engagements with our officers, (ii) engagements with our controlling shareholder, and (iii) substantial private placements, require the approval of our audit or compensation committee, board of directors and shareholders.\nExcept as set forth below, since January 1, 2018, we have not had any relationships or transactions with any of our executive officers, directors, beneficial owners of more than 5% of our ordinary shares or any immediate family member of such persons that were required to be reported pursuant to Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K.\nOn November 6, 2017, Warburg Pincus, our controlling shareholder, purchased 10.6 million ordinary shares from us for $1.85 per share, representing gross proceeds of approximately $19.6 million. In connection with the private placement, we entered into a registration rights agreement with Warburg Pincus with respect to such ordinary shares.\nOn December 5, 2018, the Company issued $10.0 million aggregate principal amount of Convertible Notes in a private placement to affiliates of Yelin Lapidot Holdings Management Ltd., which holds more than 5% of the Company\u2019s securities. For more information regarding the Convertible Notes, see \u201cFinancings\u201d above.\nOn November 7, 2019, following the closing of the Rights Offering, we issued 4,624,277 ordinary shares to Warburg Pincus, our controlling shareholder, upon exercise of its basic and over-subscription rights in the Rights Offering. The ordinary shares were issued at $1.73 per share, for a total of approximately $8 million of gross proceeds to the Company. For more information regarding the Rights Offering, see \u201cFinancings\u201d above.\nOn March 19, 2020, our CEO, Brett Jackson, participated in our offering of Convertible Debentures, in which he purchased from the Company a Convertible Debenture in the principal amount of $250,000 pursuant to a purchase agreement. We also entered into a registration rights agreement with Mr. Jackson and the other purchasers pursuant to which we agreed to, among other things, file one or more registration statements with the SEC within sixty days of the date of the registration rights agreement upon any conversion of the Convertible Debentures or as interest payments. For more information regarding the Convertible Debentures, see \u201cFinancings\u201d above.\nExit From Controlled Company Status\nAs a result of the sale of our ordinary shares in the registered direct offering in February 2021, Warburg Pincus no longer controls a majority of our ordinary shares. As a result, we are no longer a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of the Nasdaq Listing Rules. These rules require that (i) a majority of the members of our board be independent directors by February 2021, (ii) the compensation of our officers be determined or recommended to our board of directors by a compensation committee that is comprised solely of independent directors, which we currently satisfy, and (iii) director nominees be selected or recommended to the board of directors by a majority of independent directors or a nominating committee comprised solely of independent directors by February 2021. At present, only five out of ten directors on our board are independent. In addition, our Nominating and Governance Committee, while not comprised solely of independent directors, is comprised of a majority of independent directors, as more fully described below. We expect to satisfy the independence requirements during the one-year transition period. During this transition period, we will continue to qualify for and may continue to utilize the available exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements as permitted by Nasdaq Listing Rules.\nDirector Independence\nEach year, the Board undertakes a review of director independence, which includes a review of each director\u2019s responses to questionnaires asking about any relationships with us. This review is designed to identify and evaluate any transactions or relationships between a director or any member of his or her immediate family and us, or members of our senior management or other members of our Board, and all relevant facts and circumstances regarding any such transactions or relationships. Consistent with these considerations, our Board has affirmatively determined that all of our non-employee directors, who are listed below, are \u201cindependent directors\u201d pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5605(a)(2):\n\u25cf Hila Karah\n\u25cf Todd Thomson\n\u25cf James Hamilton\n\u25cf David Earhart\n\u25cf John Becker\nThe Companies Law requires Israeli companies with shares that have been offered to the public in or outside of Israel to appoint at least two External Directors, unless certain conditions are met by the company pursuant to the Israeli Companies Regulations (Relief for Companies Whose Shares are Registered for Trading Outside of Israel) - 2000 (the \u201cRelief Regulations\u201d), as further detailed below. According to the Companies Law, no person may be appointed as an External Director if the person or the person\u2019s relative, partner, employer or any entity under the person\u2019s control has or had, on or within the two years preceding the date of the person\u2019s appointment to serve as External Director, any affiliation with the company or any entity controlling, controlled by or under common control with the company. The External Directors are John Becker and David Earhart. The term affiliation includes:\n\u25cf an employment relationship;\n\u25cf a business or professional relationship maintained on a regular basis;\n\u25cf control; and\n\u25cf service as an officer or director.\nThe Israeli Minister of Justice, in consultation with the Israeli Securities Authority, may determine that certain matters will not constitute an affiliation, and has issued certain regulations with respect thereof. In addition, pursuant to provisions of the Companies Law, a business or professional relationship maintained on a regular basis will not constitute affiliation if the relationship commenced after the appointment of the External Director for office, the company and the External Director consider the relationship to be negligible and the audit committee approved, based on information presented to it, that the relationship is negligible, and the External Director declared that he did not know and could not have reasonably known about the formation of the relationship and has no control over their existence or termination.\nIf the company does not have a controlling shareholder or a shareholder who holds company shares entitling him to vote at least 25% of the votes in a shareholders meeting, then the company may not appoint as an External Director any person or such person\u2019s relative, partner, employer or any entity under the person\u2019s control, who has or had, on or within the two years preceding the date of the person\u2019s appointment to serve as External Director, any affiliation with the Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer, a substantial shareholder who holds at least 5% of the issued and outstanding shares of the company or voting rights which entitle him to vote at least 5% of the votes in a shareholders meeting, or the Chief Financial Officer.\nNo person may serve as an External Director if the person\u2019s position or other business activities create, or may create, a conflict of interest with the person\u2019s responsibilities as an External Director or may otherwise interfere with the person\u2019s ability to serve as an External Director. Additionally, no person may serve as an External Director if the person, the person\u2019s relative, spouse, employer or any entity controlling or controlled by the person, has a business or professional relationship with someone with whom affiliation is prohibited, even if such relationship is not maintained on a regular basis, excepting negligible relationships, or if such person received from the company any compensation as an External Director in excess of what is permitted by the Companies Law. If, at the time External Directors are to be appointed, all current members of the Board who are not controlling shareholders or relatives of such shareholders are of the same gender, then at least one External Director must be of the other gender. Under the Companies law, at least one of the External Directors is required to have \u201cfinancial and accounting expertise,\u201d, and the other External Director or Directors are required to have either \u201cprofessional expertise,\u201d or \u201cfinancial and accounting expertise\u201d, all as defined under the Companies Law. However, if at least one of our other directors (i) meets the independence requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or (ii) meets the standards of the Nasdaq Listing Rules for membership on the audit committee, and (iii) has accounting and financial expertise as defined under Israeli law, then neither of our External Directors is required to possess accounting and financial expertise as long as both possess other requisite \u201cprofessional expertise\u201d.\nA director can satisfy the requirements of having \u201cfinancial and accounting expertise\u201d if due to his or her education, experience and qualifications he or she has acquired expertise and understanding in business and accounting matters and financial statements, in a manner that allows him or her to understand, in depth, the company\u2019s financial statements and to spur a discussion regarding the manner in which the financial data is presented.\nA public company\u2019s board of directors must evaluate the proposed External Director\u2019s expertise in finance and accounting, by considering, among other things, such candidate\u2019s education, experience and knowledge in the following: (i) accounting and auditing issues typical to the field in which the company operates and to companies of a size and complexity similar to such company; (ii) the company\u2019s independent public accountant\u2019s duties and obligations; (iii) preparation of the company\u2019s consolidated financial statements and their approval in accordance with the Companies Law and the Israeli Securities Law - 1968.\nA director is deemed to have \u201cprofessional expertise\u201d if he or she meets any of the following criteria: (i) has an academic degree in any of the following professions: economics, business administration, accounting, law or public administration; (ii) has a different academic degree or has completed higher education in a field that is the company\u2019s main field of operations, or a field relevant to his or her position; or (iii) has at least five years\u2019 experience in any of the following, or has at least a cumulative total of at least five years\u2019 experience in any two of the following: (A) a senior position in the business management of a corporation with a significant extent of business, (B) a senior public position or a senior position in public service, or (C) a senior position in the company\u2019s main field of operations. As with a candidate\u2019s expertise in finance and accounting, the board of directors here too must evaluate the proposed External Director\u2019s \u201cprofessional qualification\u201d in accordance with the criteria set forth above.\nThe declaration required by law to be signed by a candidate to serve as External Director must include a statement by such candidate concerning his or her education and experience, if relevant, in order that the Board may properly evaluate whether such candidate meets the requirements of having \u201cfinancial and accounting expertise\u201d or having \u201cprofessional expertise\u201d as set forth in the regulations. Additionally, the candidate should submit documents and certificates that support the statements set forth in the declaration.\nExternal Directors are to be elected by a majority vote at a shareholders\u2019 meeting, provided that either:\n\u25cf such majority includes a majority of the shares held by non-controlling shareholders and shareholders who have no personal interest in the election of the External Directors (excluding a personal interest that is not related to a relationship with the controlling shareholders) who are present and voting at the meeting; or\n\u25cf the total number of shares held by non-controlling shareholders and disinterested shareholders voting against the election of the director at the meeting does not exceed two percent of the aggregate voting rights in the company.\nThe initial term of an External Director is three years and may be extended for up to two additional periods of three years each. However, under regulations promulgated pursuant to the Companies law, companies whose shares are listed for trading on specified exchanges outside of Israel, including the Nasdaq Global Select, Global and Capital markets, may propose that an External Director be reelected by the shareholders for such additional periods, beyond the initial three terms, of up to three years each only if (1) the audit committee and the Board, in nominating the External Director, confirms that, in light of the External Director\u2019s expertise and special contribution to the work of the board of directors and its committees, the reelection for such additional period(s) is beneficial to the company, (2) the election was approved by the majority of shareholders required to appoint External Directors for their initial term and (3) the term during which the nominee has served as an external director and the reasons given by the audit committee and board of directors for extending his or her term of office having been presented to the shareholders prior to their approval.\nExternal Directors may be re-elected for additional terms of three years each as set forth above, provided that with respect to the appointment for each such additional three-year term, one of the following has occurred: (i) the reappointment of the External Director has been proposed by one or more shareholders holding together 1% or more of the aggregate voting rights in the company and the appointment was approved at the general meeting of the shareholders by a simple majority, provided that: (1)(x) in calculating the majority, votes of controlling shareholders or shareholders having a personal interest in the appointment as a result of an affiliation with a controlling shareholder and abstentions are disregarded and (y) the total number of shares of shareholders who do not have a personal interest in the appointment as a result of an affiliation with a controlling shareholder and/or who are not controlling shareholders, present and voting in favor of the appointment exceed 2% of the aggregate voting rights in the company, and (2) the External Director who has been nominated in such fashion is not a linked or competing shareholder, and does not have or has not had, on or within the two years preceding the date of such person\u2019s appointment to serve as another term as External Director, any affiliation with a linked or competing shareholder. The term \u201clinked or competing shareholder\u201d means either the shareholder(s) who nominated the external director for reappointment or a material shareholder of the company holding more than 5% of the shares in the company, provided that at the time of the reappointment, such shareholder(s) of the company, the controlling shareholder of such shareholder(s) of the company, or a company under such shareholder(s) of the company\u2019s control, has a business relationship with the company or are competitors of the company; the Israeli Minister of Justice, in consultation with the Israeli Securities Authority, may determine that certain matters will not constitute a business relationship or competition with the company; (ii) the reappointment of the External Director has been proposed by the board of directors and the appointment was approved by the majority of shareholders required for the initial appointment of an External Director or (iii) the External Director has proposed himself for reappointment and the appointment was approved by the majority of shareholders required under Section (i) above.\nExternal Directors may be removed only by the same percentage of shareholders as is required for their election, or by a court, and then only if the External Director ceases to meet the statutory qualifications for their appointment or if they violate their fiduciary duty to the company. Each committee of a company\u2019s board of directors which has been granted any authority normally reserved for the board of directors must include at least one External Director provided, however that each of the audit committee and the compensation committee, which are statutorily required under the Companies Law, must include all External Directors.\nAn External Director is entitled to compensation as provided in the regulations adopted under the Companies Law and is otherwise prohibited from receiving any other compensation, directly or indirectly, in connection with service provided as an External Director.",

The audit committee oversees the appointment, compensation, and oversight of the Company\u2019s independent registered public accounting firm engaged to prepare or issue an audit report on the financial statements of the Company. The audit committee\u2019s specific responsibilities in carrying out its oversight role include the approval of all audit and non-audit services to be provided by the external auditor, the quarterly review of the firm\u2019s non-audit services and related fees and the potential impact of such services on auditor independence. These services may include audit services, audit-related services, tax services and other services, as described above. It is the policy of the audit committee to approve in advance the particular services or categories of services to be provided to the Company periodically. Additional services may be pre-approved by the audit committee on an individual basis during the year. The audit committee did not avail itself of section (c)(7)(i)(C) of Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X during 2020, which allows for an exemption from the pre-approval process under certain limited circumstances. Consistent with these policies and procedures, the audit committee approved all of the services rendered by Kost, Forer, Gabbay & Kasierer, a member of EY Global, and other members of EY Global during fiscal year 2020, as described above.\nPART IV",

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2020, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nThe Company\u2019s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company has suffered recurring losses from operations, has a working capital deficiency, and has stated that substantial doubt exists about the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern. Management\u2019s evaluation of the events and conditions and management\u2019s plans regarding these matters are also described in Note 1. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company\u2019s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCYREN LTD. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES\nCritical audit matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nLiquidity and Capital resources\nDescription of the matter\nAs discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has incurred losses since inception, and expects to continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future. At December 31, 2020, the Company\u2019s cash and cash equivalents position is not sufficient to fund the Company\u2019s planned operations for at least a year beyond the date of the issuance of the consolidated financial statements. Those factors raise substantial doubt about the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern\nWe determined the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern is a critical audit matter due to the estimation and execution uncertainty regarding the Company\u2019s future cash flows and the risk of bias in management\u2019s judgments and assumptions in estimating these cash flows to conclude the Company would have sufficient liquidity to sustain itself for at least a year beyond the date of the issuance of the consolidated financial statements. This in turn led to a high degree of auditor subjectivity and judgment to evaluate the audit evidence supporting the liquidity conclusions.\nHow we addressed the matter in our audit\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. Our audit procedures included, among others, testing the reasonableness of the forecasted revenue, operating expenses, and uses and sources of cash used in management\u2019s assessment of whether the Company has sufficient liquidity to fund operations for at least one year from the consolidated financial statement issuance date. This testing included inquiries with management, comparison of prior period forecasts to actual results, consideration of positive and negative evidence impacting management\u2019s forecasts, the Company\u2019s financing arrangements in place as of the report date, market and industry factors, we compared the terms and conditions of the financing arrangements with those of the Company\u2019s existing loans and evaluated management\u2019s analysis of their impact on the forecasted cash flows.\nWe assessed the adequacy of the Company\u2019s going concern disclosures included in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.\n/s/ Kost Forer Gabbay & Kasierer\na Member of Ernst & Young Global\nWe have served as the Company\u2019s auditor since at least 1997, but we are unable to determine this specific year.\nTel-Aviv, Israel\nMarch 30, 2021\nCYREN LTD.

AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(in thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share data)\nNOTE 1: GENERAL\na. Cyren Ltd. (henceforth \u201cCyren\u201d) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Israel on February 10, 1991 and its legal form is a company limited by shares. Cyren listed its shares to the public on July 15, 1999 under the name Commtouch Software Ltd. and changed its legal name to Cyren Ltd. in January 2014. Cyren and its subsidiaries, unless otherwise indicated will be referred to in these consolidated financial statements as the \u201cCompany\u201d.\nThe Company is engaged in developing and marketing information security solutions for protecting web, email, and mobile transactions. The Company sells its cloud-based solutions worldwide, in both embedded and Security-as-a-Service models, to Original Equipment Manufacturers (\u201cOEMs\u201d), service providers and enterprises. The Company operates in one reportable segment, which constitutes its reporting unit.\nb. Over the past several years, the Company has devoted substantially most of its effort to research and development, product development and increasing revenues through additional investments in sales & marketing. The Company has incurred losses since inception and expects to continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future. At December 31, 2020, the Company\u2019s cash and cash equivalents position is not sufficient to fund the Company\u2019s planned operations for at least a year beyond the date of the filing date of the consolidated financial statements. Those factors raise substantial doubt about the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern. The ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company obtaining the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they become due.\nThe Company intends to finance operating costs over the next twelve months through a combination of actions that may include existing cash on hand, reducing operating spend, divesting non-core assets and future issuances of equity and/or debt securities. On February 11, 2021, the Company entered into securities purchase agreements with several institutional investors for the purchase and sale, in a registered direct offering, of 12,000,000 of the Company\u2019s ordinary shares at a purchase price of $1.15 per share for net proceeds of approx. $12,500. For additional information, please refer to Note 14.\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business.\nThe consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from uncertainty related to the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern.\nNOTE 2: SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d).\na. Use of estimates:\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates, judgments, and assumptions. The Company\u2019s management believes that the estimates, judgments, and assumptions used are reasonable based upon information available at the time they are made. These estimates, judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nCYREN LTD. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(in thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share data)\nNOTE 2: SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Cont.)\nb. Financial statements in U.S. dollars:\nCyren\u2019s revenues, and certain of its subsidiary\u2019s revenues, are generated mainly in U.S. dollars. In addition, most of their costs are incurred in U.S. dollars. The Company\u2019s management believes that the U.S. dollar is the primary currency of the economic environment in which Cyren and certain of its subsidiaries operate. Thus, the functional and reporting currency of Cyren and certain of its subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar.\nCyren and certain subsidiaries\u2019 transactions and balances denominated in U.S. dollars are presented at their original amounts. Non-dollar transactions and balances have been re-measured to U.S. dollars in accordance with ASC 830, \u201cForeign Currency Matters\u201d. All transaction gains and losses from re-measurement of monetary balance sheet items denominated in non-dollar currencies are reflected in the statements of operations as financial income or expenses, as appropriate.\nFor those subsidiaries whose functional currency has been determined to be their local currency, assets and liabilities are translated at year-end exchange rates and statements of operations items are translated at average exchange rates prevailing during the year. Such translation adjustments are recorded as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in shareholders\u2019 equity.\nc. Principles of consolidation:\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Cyren and its subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated upon consolidation.\nd. Going Concern\nThe accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business.\nU.S. GAAP requires an evaluation of whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about an entity\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date the financial statements are issued. Initially, this evaluation does not consider the potential mitigating effect of management\u2019s plans that have not been fully implemented. When substantial doubt exists, management evaluates the mitigating effect of its plans if it is probable that (1) the plans will be effectively implemented within one year after the date the financial statements are issued, and (2) when implemented, the plans will mitigate the relevant conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the entity\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date the financial statements are issued or prior to the conditions or events that create the going concern risk.\nThe consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2020 do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from uncertainty related to the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern.\ne. Cash equivalents:\nCash equivalents are short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to cash with original maturities of three months or less at acquisition.\nCYREN LTD. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(in thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share data)\nNOTE 2: SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Cont.)\nf. Restricted deposits:\nThe Company maintains certain deposits amounts restricted as to withdrawal or use. On December 31, 2020, the Company maintained a balance of $618 which is restricted and is held as collateral for a bank guarantee and a letter of credit provided to the lessors of two of the Company\u2019s offices. The balance is presented on the balance sheets within the long-term restricted lease deposits balance.\ng. Property and equipment:\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. Depreciation of leasehold improvements is computed using the straight-line method over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful life of the asset or improvement. Cost of maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets as outlined below:\nUseful Life\n(In Years)\nCost:\nComputers and peripheral equipment 3-7\nOffice furniture and equipment 5-14\nLeasehold improvements 3-10\nh. Leases:\nThe Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Contracts containing a lease are further evaluated for classification as an operating or finance lease. In determining the leases classification the Company assesses among other criteria: (i) 75% or more of the remaining economic life of the underlying asset is a major part of the remaining economic life of that underlying asset; and (ii) 90% or more of the fair value of the underlying asset comprises substantially all of the fair value of the underlying asset. Operating leases are included in operating lease right-of-use (\u201cROU\u201d) assets, other current liabilities, and long-term operating lease liabilities in the Company\u2019s consolidated balance sheets. Finance leases are included in property, plant and equipment, net, other current liabilities, and long-term finance lease liabilities in the Company\u2019s consolidated balance sheets. ROU assets represent the right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Company\u2019s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. For leases with terms greater than 12 months, the Company records the ROU asset and liability at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments according to their term.\nThe Company uses incremental borrowing rates based on the estimated rate of interest for collateralized borrowing over a similar term of the lease payments at commencement date. The ROU asset also includes any lease payments made and excludes lease incentives. Lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. Lease expenses are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term or the useful life of the leased asset.\nIn addition, the carrying amount of the ROU and lease liabilities are remeasured if there is a modification, a change in the lease term, a change in the in-substance fixed lease payments or a change in the assessment to purchase the underlying asset.\nCYREN LTD. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(in thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share data)\nNOTE 2: SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Cont.)\ni. Intangible assets:\nIntangible assets that are not considered to have an indefinite useful life are amortized over their estimated useful lives, which range from 1 to 20 years. Acquired customer contracts and relationships are amortized over their estimated useful lives in proportion to the economic benefits realized. This accounting policy results in accelerated amortization of such customer contracts and relationships arrangements as compared to the straight-line method. Technology, Intellectual Property and Trademark are amortized over their estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis.\nj. Impairment of long-lived assets:\nThe Company\u2019s long-lived assets (assets group) to be held or used, including right-of-use assets and identifiable intangibles are reviewed for impairment in accordance with ASC 360 \u201cProperty, Plant and Equipment\u201d, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.\nRecoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of each asset group to the future undiscounted cash flows the asset group is expected to generate. If the asset is considered to be impaired, the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2019, we have recognized an impairment loss of $224 related to, an acquired intangible asset from a prior acquisition. We have determined that the benefit of the acquired R&D would not be realized. This amount has been recognized in cost of revenue.\nThe Company did not record an impairment related to the year-ended December 31, 2020.\nk. Goodwill:\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price in a business combination over the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized, but is evaluated for impairment annually, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. The Company has determined that there is a single reporting unit for the purpose of conducting this goodwill impairment assessment. For purposes of assessing potential impairment, the Company estimates the fair value of the reporting unit, based on the Company\u2019s market capitalization, and compares this amount to the carrying value of the reporting unit. If the Company determines that the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge would be required. The Company performs an annual impairment test at December 31, of each fiscal year, or more frequently if impairment indicators are present.\nFor each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2020, no impairment losses have been identified.\nl. Fair value measurements:\nThe carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, prepaid expenses, other receivables, trade payables and other payables, approximate their fair values due to the short-term maturities of such financial instruments.\nCYREN LTD. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(in thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share data)\nNOTE 2: SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Cont.)\nFair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or a liability. A three-tiered fair value hierarchy is established as a basis for considering such assumptions and for inputs used in the valuation methodologies in measuring fair value:\nLevel 1 - Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company can access at the measurement date.\nLevel 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.\nLevel 3 - Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.\nThe availability of observable inputs can vary from instrument to instrument and is affected by a wide variety of factors, including, for example, the type of instrument, the liquidity of markets and other characteristics particular to the transaction. To the extent that valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market, the determination of fair value requires more judgment and the instruments are categorized as Level 3.\nThe fair value hierarchy also requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.\nm. Derivative financial instruments:\nThe Company accounts for derivatives based on ASC 815 (\u201cDerivatives and Hedging\u201d). ASC 815 requires the Company to recognize all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value.\nUnder these standards, the Company separately accounts for the liability and derivative component as an implicit or explicit term that affects some or all of the cash flows or the value of other exchanges required by a contract in a manner similar to a derivative instrument. The derivative component at issuance is recognized at fair value, based on the fair value of a similar instrument that does not have a conversion feature. The liability component is presented at its discounted value based on the excess of the principal amount of the debentures over the fair value of the derivative component, after adjusting for an allocation of debt issuance costs. The effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported in the consolidated statements of operations under financial expenses, net.\nn. Revenue recognition:\nThe Company derives its revenues in accordance with ASC 606 from the sale of real-time cloud-based services for each of Cyren\u2019s email security, web security, anti-malware, and advanced threat protection offerings.\nThe Company sells all of its solutions as subscription services, either through OEMs, which are considered end-users, or as complete security services directly to enterprises.\nCYREN LTD. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(in thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share data)\nNOTE 2: SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Cont.)\nThe Company recognizes revenue under the core principle that transfer of control to the Company\u2019s customers should be depicted in an amount reflecting the consideration the Company expects to receive in revenue. In order to achieve that core principle, the Company applies the following five-step approach:\n1) Identification of the contract, or contracts, with the customer - The Company considers the terms and conditions of the contract and its customary business practice in identifying its contracts under ASC 606. The Company determines it has a contract with a customer when the contract is approved, the Company can identify each party\u2019s rights regarding the services and products to be transferred, the Company can identify the payment terms for the services and products, the Company has determined the customer has the ability and intent to pay and the contract has commercial substance. At contract inception, the Company evaluates whether two or more contracts should be combined and accounted for as a single contract and whether the combined contract or single contract includes more than one performance obligation. The Company applies judgment in determining the customer\u2019s ability and intent to pay, which is based on a variety of factors, including the customer\u2019s historical payment experience or, in the case of a new customer, credit and financial information pertaining to the customer.\n2) Identification of the performance obligation in the contract - Performance obligations promised in a contract are identified based on the services or products that will be transferred to the customer that are both i) capable of being distinct, whereby the customer can benefit from the service or product either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available from third parties or from the Company, and ii) distinct in the context of the contract, whereby the transfer of the services or products is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. To the extent a contract includes multiple promised services or products, the Company applies judgment to determine whether promised services or products are capable of being distinct and distinct in the context of the contract. If these criteria are not met the promised services or products are accounted for as a combined performance obligation.\n3) Determination of the transaction price - The transaction price is determined based on the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring services and products to the customer. Variable consideration is included in the transaction price if, in the Company\u2019s judgment, it is probable that a significant future reversal of cumulative revenue under the contract will not occur. Generally, the Company does not provide price protection, stock rotation, rebates, or right of return. In 2019, one contract contained a significant financing component.\nVariable Consideration - Revenue from sales is recorded at the net sales price, which is the transaction price, and includes estimates of variable consideration. The amount of variable consideration that is included in the transaction price is constrained and is included in the net sales price only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of the cumulative revenue will not occur when the uncertainty is resolved. If the Company\u2019s services or products do not meet certain service level commitments, the Company\u2019s customers are entitled to receive service credits representing a form of variable consideration. The Company has not historically experienced any significant incidents affecting the defined levels of reliability and performance as required by the Company\u2019s subscription contracts. Accordingly, there are no estimated refunds related to these contracts in the consolidated financial statements during the periods presented.\n4) Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract - If the contract contains a single performance obligation, the entire transaction price is allocated to the single performance obligation. Contracts that contain multiple performance obligations require an allocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation based on a relative standalone selling price (\u201cSSP\u201d) basis.\nCYREN LTD. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(in thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share data)\nNOTE 2: SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Cont.)\n5) Recognition of revenue when, or as, the Company satisfies a performance obligation - The Company recognizes revenue when control of the services or products are transferred to the customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those services or products. The Company records its revenue net of any value added or sales tax.\nSubscription Service Revenue - Subscription service revenue is derived from a subscription-based licensing model with contract terms typically ranging from one to three years, and consists of (1) subscription fees from the licensing of the Company\u2019s security-as-a-service platform or Threat Intelligence Services and (2) subscription fees for software with support and related future updates where the software updates are critical to the customers\u2019 ability to derive benefit from the software due to the fast changing nature of the technology. These function together as one performance obligation. The hosted on-demand service arrangements do not provide customers with the right to take possession of the software supporting the hosted services. Support revenue is derived from ongoing security updates, upgrades, bug fixes, and maintenance. A time-elapsed method is used to measure progress because the Company transfers control evenly over the contractual period. Accordingly, the fixed consideration related to subscription service revenue is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the contract term beginning on the date access is provided, as long as other revenue recognition criteria have been met. Most of the company\u2019s contracts are non-cancelable over the contract term. Customers typically have the right to terminate their contract for cause if the Company fails to perform in accordance with the contractual terms. Some of the Company\u2019s customers have the option to purchase additional subscription services at a stated price. These options are evaluated on a case-by-case basis but generally do not provide a material right as they are priced at or above the Company\u2019s SSP and, as such, would not result in a separate performance obligation.\nDeferred Revenue - The Company records deferred revenue when cash payments are received, or invoices are issued in advance of the Company\u2019s performance and recognizes revenue over the contractual term.\nIn the event cash payments were not received in advance and the issuance of the invoice resulted only in entry to trade receivables and deferred revenue, these amounts would not be reflected on the balance sheet.\nDeferred commissions\nThe Company capitalizes sales commissions paid to internal sales personnel that are generally incremental to the acquisition of customer contracts. These costs are recorded as deferred commissions on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company determines whether costs should be deferred based on its sales compensation plans if the commissions are incremental and would not have occurred absent the customer contract. Sales commissions for renewal of a subscription contract are not considered commensurate with the commissions paid for the acquisition of the initial subscription contract given the substantive difference in commission rate between new and renewal contracts. Commissions paid upon the initial acquisition of a contract are amortized over an estimated period of benefit while commissions paid related to renewal contracts are amortized over a contractual renewal period. Amortization is recognized based on the expected future revenue streams under the customer contracts. Amortization of deferred sales commissions is included in sales and marketing expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. The Company determines the period of benefit for commissions paid for the acquisition of the initial subscription contract by taking into consideration factors such as peer estimates of technology lives, and customer lives as well as the Company\u2019s own historical data. The Company classifies deferred commissions as current or long-term based on the timing of when the Company expects to recognize the expense. The Company periodically reviews these deferred commission costs to determine whether events or changes in circumstances have occurred that could impact the period of benefit of these deferred contract acquisition costs. There were no material impairment losses recorded during the periods presented.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company capitalized $1,095 and $961 of commission costs, respectively, and amortized $1,517 and 1,199, respectively.\nCYREN LTD. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(in thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share data)\nNOTE 2: SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Cont.)\no. Research and development costs, net:\nResearch and development costs are charged to statements of operations as incurred, except for capitalized technology.\np. Capitalized technology:\nThe Company capitalizes development costs incurred during the application development stage which are related to internal-use technology that supports its security services. Costs related to preliminary project activities and post implementation activities are expensed as incurred as research and development costs on the statements of operations. Capitalized internal-use technology is included in intangible assets on the balance sheet and is amortized on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life, which is generally one to three years. Amortization expenses are recognized under cost of goods sold. Management evaluates the useful lives of these assets on an annual basis and tests for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets.\nq. Concentrations of credit risk:\nThe Company has no significant off-balance-sheet concentration of credit risk.\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents and trade receivables. The majority of the Company\u2019s cash and cash equivalents are invested in dollars and are deposited in major banks in the United States, Germany, Iceland, UK, and Israel. Such investments in the United States may be in excess of insured limits and are not insured in other jurisdictions. Management believes that the financial institutions that hold the Company\u2019s investments are institutions with high credit standing, and accordingly, minimal credit risk exists with respect to these investments.\nThe trade receivables of the Company are derived from transactions with companies located primarily in North America, Europe, Israel, and Asia. A provision for credit loss account is determined based on historical collection experience, customer creditworthiness, current and future economic conditions and market conditions with respect to those amounts that the Company has determined to be doubtful of collection. The provision for credit loss amounted $201 and $129 at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Bad debt benefit for December 31, 2020 was $5 and an expense of $138 for December 31, 2019.\nr. Accounting for stock-based compensation:\nASC 718 - \u201cCompensation-stock Compensation\u201d- (\u201cASC 718\u201d) requires companies to estimate the fair value of equity-based payment awards on the date of grant using an option-pricing model. The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as an expense over the requisite service periods in the Company\u2019s consolidated statements of operations.\nThe Company recognizes compensation expense for the value of its awards on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of each of the awards, net of estimated forfeitures. Estimated forfeitures are based on actual historical pre-vesting forfeitures. ASC 718 requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Estimated forfeitures are based on actual historical pre-vesting forfeitures (pursuant to the adoption of ASU 2016-09, the Company made a policy election to estimate the number of awards that are expected to vest).\nCYREN LTD. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(in thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share data)\nNOTE 2: SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Cont.)\nThe Company estimates the fair value of stock options granted using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The option-pricing model requires a number of assumptions, of which the most significant are the expected stock price volatility and the expected option term. Expected volatility was calculated based upon actual historical stock price movements over the most recent periods ending on the grant date, equal to the expected term of the options. The expected term of options granted represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding, based upon historical experience. The risk-free interest rate is based on the yield from U.S. treasury bonds with an equivalent term. The Company has historically not paid dividends and has no foreseeable plans to pay dividends.\nThe fair value for options granted in 2020 and 2019 is estimated at the date of grant using a Black-Scholes options pricing model with the following assumptions:\nYear ended December 31,\nStock options\nVolatility 47% - 60 % 46% - 50 %\nRisk-free interest rate 0.23% - 1.40 % 1.5% - 2.5 %\nDividend yield 0 % 0 %\nExpected term (years) 4.10 3.7-4.0\ns. Basic and diluted net loss per share:\nBasic net loss per share has been computed using the weighted-average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year. Diluted net loss per share is computed based on the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during each year, plus the weighted average number of dilutive potential ordinary shares considered outstanding during the year.\nIn 2020 and 2019 there is no difference between the denominator of basic and diluted net loss per share. In periods where the Company reports a net loss, the effect of anti-dilutive stock options, restricted stock units, Convertible Notes, Convertible Debentures, and warrants are excluded and diluted net loss per share is equal to basic loss per share. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, 23,803,669 and 11,352,573 ordinary shares were excluded from the calculation of diluted net EPS due to their anti-dilutive effect, respectively.\nt. Severance pay:\nThe Company\u2019s liability for severance pay in Israel is calculated pursuant to Israel\u2019s Severance Pay Law based on the most recent salary of the employees multiplied by the number of years of employment as of the balance sheet date. Employees are entitled to one month\u2019s salary for each year of employment or a portion thereof. The Company\u2019s obligation for all of its Israeli employees is fully provided by monthly deposits with severance pay funds and insurance policies, and by an accrual. The value of those funds and policies is recorded as an asset in the Company\u2019s balance sheet.\nThe deposited funds include profits and losses accumulated up to the balance sheet date. The deposited funds may be withdrawn only upon the fulfillment of the obligation pursuant to Israel\u2019s Severance Pay Law or labor agreements. The value of the deposited funds is based on the cash surrendered value of these policies.\nCYREN LTD. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(in thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share data)\nNOTE 2: SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Cont.)\nEffective October 2014, the Company\u2019s agreements with new employees in Israel, are under Section 14 of the Severance Pay Law, 1963. The Company\u2019s contributions for severance pay have replaced its severance obligation. Upon contribution of the full amount of the employee\u2019s monthly salary for each year of service, no additional calculations are conducted between the parties regarding the matter of severance pay and no additional payment is made by the Company to the employee. Further, the related obligation and amounts deposited on behalf of the employee for such obligation are not stated on the balance sheet, as the Company is legally released from the obligation to employees once the deposit amounts have been paid.\nSeverance benefit for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $40 and the Severance expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $47.\nu. Income taxes:\nThe Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740, \u201cIncome Taxes\u201d (\u201cASC 740\u201d). ASC 740 prescribes the use of the liability method whereby deferred tax asset and liability account balances are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. The Company provides a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to amounts more likely than not to be realized.\nASC 740 contains a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring a liability for uncertain tax positions. The first step is to evaluate the tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that, on an evaluation of the technical merits, the tax position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% (cumulative basis) likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement.\nv. Comprehensive loss:\nThe Company accounts for comprehensive loss in accordance with ASC No. 220, \u201cComprehensive Income\u201d. Comprehensive loss generally represents all changes in shareholders\u2019 equity during the period except those resulting from investments by, or distributions to, shareholders. The Company determined that its items of other comprehensive income (loss) relate to gains and losses from functional currency translation adjustments on behalf of subsidiaries whose functional currency has been determined to be their local currency.\nw. Recently issued and adopted pronouncements:\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-15, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other-Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer\u2019s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That Is a Service Contract (\u201cASU 2018-15\u201d). ASU 2018-15 aligns the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software. The update to the standard is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted. Entities can choose to adopt the ASU 2018-15 prospectively or retrospectively. The adoption of the standard did not have a material impact on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment. ASU 2017-04 eliminates step two of the goodwill impairment test and specifies that goodwill impairment should be measured by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. Additionally, the amount of goodwill allocated to each reporting unit with a zero or negative carrying amount of net assets should be disclosed. ASU 2017-04 is effective for annual or interim goodwill impairment tests performed in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and early adoption is permitted. The adoption of the standard did not have a material impact on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements.\nCYREN LTD. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(in thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share data)\nNOTE 2: SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Cont.)\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. ASU 2016-13 amends the impairment model to utilize an expected loss methodology in place of the currently used incurred loss methodology, which will result in the more timely recognition of losses. This standard requires entities to estimate an expected lifetime credit loss on financial assets ranging from short-term trade accounts receivable to long-term financings and report credit losses using an expected losses model rather than the incurred losses model that was previously used. The new accounting standard was effective for the fiscal year beginning on January 1, 2020, including interim periods within that year. The adoption of the standard did not have a material impact on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements.\nx. New accounting pronouncements not yet adopted:\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes (\u201cASU 2019-12\u201d). ASU 2019-12 removes certain exceptions related to the approach for intraperiod tax allocation, the methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period and the recognition of deferred tax liabilities for outside basis differences. ASU 2019-12 also amends other aspects of the guidance to help simplify and promote consistent application of GAAP. The guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2020, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently assessing the impact that the adoption of ASU 2019-12 will have on its consolidated financial statements.\nIn August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, ASC Subtopic 470-20 \u201cDebt-Debt with \u201cConversion and Other Options\u201d and ASC subtopic 815-40 \u201cHedging-Contracts in Entity\u2019s Own Equity\u201d. The standard reduced the number of accounting models for convertible debt instruments and convertible preferred stock. Convertible instruments that continue to be subject to separation models are (1) those with embedded conversion features that are not clearly and closely related to the host contract, that meet the definition of a derivative, and that do not qualify for a scope exception from derivative accounting and (2) convertible debt instruments issued with substantial premiums for which the premiums are recorded as paid-in capital. The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, but no earlier than fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently assessing the impact of the adoption of this standard on its consolidated financial statements.\nNOTE 3: PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT, NET\nDecember 31\nCost:\nComputers and peripheral equipment $ 13,080 $ 12,965\nOffice furniture and equipment\nLeasehold improvements\n14,816 14,754\nLess accumulated depreciation (10,868 ) (10,344 )\nProperty and equipment, net $ 3,948 $ 4,410\nDepreciation expense amounted to $2,349 and $1,946 in 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nCYREN LTD.

We have determined that the benefit of the acquired R&D would not be realized. This amount has been recognized in cost of revenue.\nIn the third quarter of 2020, the Company wrote-off in-process R&D as it was determined that the accumulated costs associated with a project would not materialize into a saleable product. As a result, $696 of expense has been recognized in operating expenses and $49 associated with capitalized interest, included within financial expenses, net.\nb.

Subsequently in 2014, the Company had a legal dispute regarding the amount and timing of the earn-out payments and had entered into arbitral proceedings with the former shareholders of eleven. On March 9, 2017, the Company received the arbitral judgement. Pursuant to the judgement, the earn-out consideration balance was increased to reflect additional legal expenses and interest expenses covering the period up to December 31, 2016. During 2017 and 2018, the Company continued to accrue interest on the unpaid earn-out consideration balance. Such interest is reflected in the consolidated statements of operations under financial expenses, net. In May 2018, the Company made a partial payment of the earn-out consideration to five of the six former shareholders, in an amount of $0.6 million. The earn-out consideration balance presented on our balance sheet as of December 31, 2019 reflected the complete remaining liability relating to the earn-out, including accrued interest. In February 2019, the parties agreed to resolve all pending claims, and on February 28, 2019, the Company paid approximately $2.7 million to settle the earn-out consideration in full. As of December 31, 2020, the balance of the earn-out liability is zero. For additional information, please refer to Note 7b.\nCYREN LTD.

Cyren Ltd., which was incorporated in Israel, partially financed its research and development expenditures under programs sponsored by the Israel Innovation Authority (\u201cIIA\u201d) for the support of certain research and development activities conducted in Israel.\nIn connection with specific research and development, the Company received $3,699 of participation payments from the IIA through December 31, 2020, but no grants since 2018. In return for the IIA\u2019s participation in this program, the Company is committed to pay royalties at a rate of 3% of the program\u2019s developed product sales, up to 100% of the amount of grants received plus interest at annual LIBOR rate. The Company\u2019s total commitment for royalties payable with respect to future sales, based on IIA participations received, net of royalties paid or accrued, totaled $2,714 and $2,765 as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, $137 and $186, respectively, were recorded as cost of revenues with respect to royalties due to the IIA.\nb. Litigations:\ni. Between 2014 and 2015 the Company entered into arbitral proceedings with the former shareholders of eleven regarding an escrow account and the earn-out consideration related to the purchase agreement of former eleven. With respect to these claims, on March 9, 2017, the arbitrational panel provided their ruling in which it accepted the claims submitted by the former eleven shareholders with respect to the escrow amount and the 2013 earn-out liability. The arbitrational panel also ruled that Cyren pay legal expenses and interest on the claimed amounts, which were reflected in the year ending December 31, 2016 on the Company\u2019s balance sheet and in the consolidated statements of operations under adjustment to earn-out consideration.\nThe escrow account has been released to the former shareholders. The arbitrational award related to the 2013 earn-out consideration was declared enforceable by the applicable courts in Germany. Accordingly, on May 30, 2018, the Company paid the portion of the earn-out consideration in the amount of $604 that was declared enforceable by the German district court. The Company did not pay the remainder of the earn-out consideration, including accrued legal and interest, which appear on the Company\u2019s consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2019, and has filed an appeal to the German Federal Supreme Court challenging the enforceability of the remaining amounts.\nIn February 2019, the parties signed a settlement agreement to resolve all pending claims, and on February 28, 2019 the Company paid $2,680 to settle the earn-out consideration in full. The total amount paid to resolve all claims was $256 less than the accrued liability, which generated \u201cother income\u201d as previously reflected in the consolidated statement of operations for the period ending December 31, 2019.\nii. On June 28, 2017 a vendor filed a Statement of Claim in the Tel Aviv District Court (the \u201cSOC\u201d). According to the vendor\u2019s SOC, the Company entered into an agreement with the vendor for receipt of services, based on a database developed by the vendor. In September 2015, the Company terminated the agreement with the vendor, effective as of December 31, 2015. The vendor claims that the Company continues to make use of the vendor\u2019s database post termination thus breaching the agreement, infringing on the vendor\u2019s rights and commercial secrets, and being unjustly enriched.\nThe vendor claimed license fees of approximately $3,150 and an injunction relief ordering the Company and/or its customers to delete any remaining data and to cease from utilizing such data.\nThe Company denied all claims and filed a Statement of Defense on November 15, 2017. Pretrial was scheduled for May 15, 2018. In accordance with the court\u2019s recommendation from November 28, 2017, the parties agreed to examine a non-binding mediation process and have appointed a mediator. The parties agreed to conduct a third-party audit of the Company\u2019s databases in the scope of the mediation and the audit is currently being conducted.\nCYREN LTD.

The vendor alleged that the clients misappropriated the vendor\u2019s trade secrets and sought injunctive relief and monetary damages in an amount to be determined. Both customers contended that the allegations relate to the services they receive from the Company, and the Company agreed to indemnify both clients against these claims. On September 30, 2019, the court dismissed one of the lawsuits in its entirety for lack of personal jurisdiction and, in the second lawsuit, dismissed part of the claims with prejudice but granted the vendor the right to amend its other claims. On October 31, 2019, the vendor filed an amended complaint. In December 2019, the Company reached a settlement with the vendor. As a part of the settlement, the Company agreed to pay $750; $375 in December 2019 and the remaining portion in January 2020. As of December 31, 2019, the $375 was accrued in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet and the amount was paid in January 2020.
