    "item_1": "ITEM 1. BUSINESS\nCurrent Operations\nDigital Turbine, Inc., through its subsidiaries, simplifies content discovery and delivers it directly to mobile devices. Its on-device media platform powers frictionless application and content discovery, user acquisition and engagement, operational efficiency, and monetization opportunities. Through March 31, 2021, Digital Turbine's technology platform has been adopted by over 35 mobile operators and device original equipment manufacturers (\"OEMs\") and has delivered more than 5.3 billion application preloads for tens of thousands of advertising campaigns. The Company operates this business as one operating and reportable segment - Media Distribution, which was previously referred to as the operating segment O&O (which refers to operators and OEMs) and the reportable segment Advertising.\nAs the Company's suite of product offerings expands, both organically and through acquisitions, we believe that this renaming of our reporting and operating segment better reflects the way management views the business. There are no changes or historical differences to product offerings and financial information that were referred to as the Advertising segment in prior periods. While advertising, in general, remains a focus of our Media Distribution segment, we feel that this change in name more accurately conveys to the reader what we do for our customers and partners.\nThe Company's Media Distribution business consists of products and services that simplify the discovery and delivery of mobile applications and content media for consumers.\n\u2022Application Media represents the portion of the business where our platform delivers apps to end users through partnerships with carrier networks and OEMs. Application Media optimizes revenues by using developed technology to streamline, track, and manage app install demand from hundreds of application developers across various publishers, carriers, OEMs, and devices.\n\u2022Content Media represents the portion of the business where our platform presents news, weather, sports, and other content directly within the native device experience (e.g., as the start page in the mobile browser, a widget, on unlock, etc.) through partnerships with carrier networks and OEMs. Content Media optimizes revenue by a combination of:\n\u25e6Programmatic Ad Partner Revenue - advertising within the content media that\u2019s sold on an ad exchange at a market rate (CPM - Cost Per Thousand);\n\u25e6Sponsored Content - sponsored content media from 3rd party content providers, presented similarly to an ad, that is monetized when a recommended story is viewed (CPC - Cost Per Click);\n\u25e6Editorial Content - owned or licensed media, presented similarly to an ad, that is monetized when the media is clicked on (CPC - Cost Per Click).\nWith global headquarters in Austin, Texas and offices in Durham, North Carolina; San Francisco, California; Arlington, Virginia; S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil; Mexico City, Mexico; Mumbai, India; Singapore; and Tel Aviv, Israel, Digital Turbine\u2019s solutions are available worldwide. For additional information, please visit www.digitalturbine.com.\nAcquisitions\nThe Company recently completed the below-described acquisitions of Appreciate, AdColony, and Fyber in order to help execute on its expressed strategy of becoming a leading end-to-end solution for mobile brand acquisition, advertising, and monetization.\nMobile Posse, Inc. On February 28, 2020, the Company completed the acquisition of Mobile Posse. The acquisition of Mobile Posse is consistent with the Company's strategy to provide a comprehensive media and advertising solution for operator and OEM partners while enriching the mobile experience for end users by delivering relevant media rich content to their fingertips. The addition of Mobile Posse's offerings will provide synergies and options for our partners and advertisers. The Company's suite of offerings continue to focus on promoting higher user engagement and boosting advertising revenue for mobile operators and OEMs. See Note \u201cAcquisitions\u201d to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report for more information.\nAppreciate. On March 1, 2021, DT EMEA entered into a Share Purchase Agreement with Triapodi Ltd., an Israeli company (d/b/a Appreciate), the stockholder representative, and the stockholders of Appreciate pursuant to which DT EMEA acquired, on March 2, 2021, all of the outstanding capital stock of Appreciate in exchange for total consideration of $20.0 million in cash. In connection with the acquisition, under the terms of the Purchase Agreement, DT EMEA entered into bonus arrangements to pay up to $6.0 million in retention bonuses and performance bonuses to the founders and certain other employees of Appreciate. Appreciate is a programmatic mobile advertising demand-side platform (\"DSP\") company headquartered in Israel. Appreciate\u2019s platform collaborates closely with mobile measurement partners (\u201cMMPs\u201d), exchanges, advertisers, and other partners to programmatically provide a transparent ecosystem designed to optimize user acquisition and ROI for the mobile advertisers utilizing its platform. Deploying Appreciate's technology expertise across Digital Turbine\u2019s global scale and reach should further benefit partners and advertisers that are a part of the combined Company\u2019s platform.\nAdColony Holding AS. On April 29, 2021, DT Media completed the acquisition of AdColony Holding AS, a Norway company (\u201cAdColony\u201d), pursuant to a Share Purchase Agreement with AdColony and Otello Corporation ASA, a Norway company and the sole shareholder of AdColony (\u201cOtello\u201d). DT Media acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of AdColony in exchange for an estimated total consideration in the range of $350.0 million to $375.0 million, to be paid as follows: (1) $100.0 million in cash paid at closing (which was subject to customary closing purchase price adjustments), (2) $100.0 million in cash to be paid six months after closing, and (3) an estimated earn-out in the range of $150.0 million to $175.0 million, to be paid in cash, based on AdColony achieving certain future target net revenues, less associated cost of goods sold, over a twelve-month period ending on December 31, 2021 (the \u201cEarn-Out Period\u201d). Under the terms of the earn-out, DT Media would pay Otello a certain percentage of actual net revenues (less associated cost of goods sold) of AdColony depending on the extent to which AdColony achieves certain target net revenues (less associated cost of goods sold) over the Earn-Out Period. The earn-out payment will be made following the expiration of the Earn-Out Period. The Company paid the closing amount and intends to pay the remainder of the purchase price with a combination of available cash on hand and borrowings under its existing senior credit facility along with future capital financing. AdColony is a leading mobile advertising platform servicing advertisers and publishers with a reach of more than 1.5 billion monthly global users. AdColony\u2019s proprietary video technologies and rich media formats are widely viewed as a best-in-class technology delivering third-party verified viewability rates for well-known global brands.\nFyber, N.V. On May 25, 2021, the Company and DT Media completed the initial closing of the acquisition of 523,553,108 shares, representing approximately 95.1% of the outstanding voting shares (the \u201cMajority Fyber Shares\u201d) of Fyber N.V., a public limited liability company registered with the Netherlands Chamber of Commerce Business Register (\u201cFyber\u201d), pursuant to a Sale and Purchase Agreement between Tennor Holding B.V., Advert Finance B.V., and Lars Windhorst (collectively, the \u201cSeller\u201d), the Company, and DT Luxembourg. The Seller transferred and delivered 400,000,000 shares of the Majority Fyber Shares to DT Media on the closing date and will deliver the remaining 123,553,108 shares of the Majority Fyber Shares to DT Media in June 2021. The remaining approximately 4.9% of the shares in Fyber (the \u201cMinority Fyber Shares\u201d) are widely held by other shareholders of Fyber (the \u201cMinority Fyber Shareholders\u201d).\nDT Media acquired the Majority Fyber Shares in exchange for an estimated aggregate consideration of up to $600.0 million, consisting of (i) $150.0 million in cash, which was subject to adjustments for certain items including the amount of cash consideration to be paid to the Minority Fyber Shareholders for the Minority Fyber Shares, paid at the closing of the acquisition, (ii) 3,216,935 newly issued shares of common stock of the Company equal in value to $235.0 million (based on the volume-weighted average price of the common stock on NASDAQ during the 30-day period prior to the closing date), issued at the closing of the acquisition, (iii) 2,599,653 newly issued shares of common stock of the Company equal in value to $165.0 million (based on the volume-weighted average price of the common stock on NASDAQ during the 30-day period prior to the closing date), to be issued in June 2021 after the receipt by the Company of a tax exemption certificate from the Israel Tax Authority, and (iv) contingent upon Fyber\u2019s net revenues being equal or higher than $100.0 million for the 12-month earn-out period ending on March 31, 2022, as determined in the manner set forth in the Sale and Purchase Agreement, a certain number of shares of Company common stock, which will be newly-issued to the Seller at the end of the earn-out period, and under certain circumstances, an amount of cash, which value of such shares and cash in aggregate will not exceed $50.0 million (subject to set-off against certain potential indemnification claims against the Seller). The Company paid the cash closing amount on the closing date, and intends to pay the remainder of the cash consideration for the acquisition with a combination of available cash on hand, borrowings under the Company\u2019s senior credit facility, and proceeds from future capital financings.\nFyber is a leading mobile advertising monetization platform empowering global app developers to optimize profitability through quality advertising. Fyber\u2019s proprietary technology platform and expertise in mediation, real-time bidding, advanced analytics tools, and video combine to deliver publishers and advertisers a highly valuable app monetization solution.\nPursuant to certain German law on public takeovers, following the closing, the Company is obligated to make a public tender offer to the Minority Fyber Shareholders to acquire from them the Minority Fyber Shares. The tender offer will be subject to certain minimum price rules under German law. The timing and the conditions of the tender offer, including the consideration offered to the Minority Fyber Shareholders in connection with the tender offer, will be subsequently determined by the Company pursuant to the applicable Dutch and German takeover laws. The Company anticipates completing the tender offer during the second fiscal quarter 2022.\nInformation about Discontinued Operations\nOn April 29, 2018, the Company entered into two distinct disposition agreements with respect to selected assets owned by our subsidiaries.\nDT APAC and DT Singapore (together, \u201cPay Seller\u201d), each wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company, entered into an Asset Purchase Pay Agreement (the \u201cPay Agreement\u201d), dated as of April 23, 2018, with Chargewave Ptd Ltd (\u201cPay Purchaser\u201d) to sell certain assets (the \u201cPay Assets\u201d) owned by the Pay Seller related to the Company\u2019s Direct Carrier Billing business. The Pay Purchaser is principally owned and controlled by Jon Mooney, an officer of the Pay Seller. At the closing of the asset sale, Mr. Mooney was no longer employed by the Company or Pay Seller. As consideration for this asset sale, Digital Turbine is entitled to receive certain license fees, profit sharing and equity participation rights as outlined in the Company\u2019s Form 8-K filed May 1, 2018 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\"). The transaction was completed in July 2018. With the sale of these assets, the Company exited the segment previously referred to as the Content business.\nDT Media (the \u201cA&P Seller\u201d), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the \u201cA&P Agreement\u201d), dated as of April 28, 2018, with Creative Clicks B.V. (the \u201cA&P Purchaser\u201d) to sell business relationships with various advertisers and publishers (the \u201cA&P Assets\u201d) related to the Company\u2019s Advertising and Publishing (\"A&P\") business. As consideration for this asset sale, we are entitled to receive a percentage of the gross profit, as defined by the A&P Agreement, derived from these customer agreements for a period of three years as outlined in the Company\u2019s Form 8-K filed May 1, 2018 with the SEC. The transaction was completed in June 2018. With the sale of these assets, the Company exited the segment of its Advertising business previously referred to as the A&P business.\nThese dispositions have allowed the Company to benefit from a streamlined business model, simplified operating structure, and enhanced management focus.\nAs a result of these dispositions, the results of operations from our Content reporting segment and A&P business within the Media Distribution reporting segment, previously referred to as the Advertising reporting segment, are reported as \u201cNet loss from discontinued operations, net of taxes\u201d and the related assets and liabilities are classified as \u201cheld for disposal\" in the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report. The Company has recast prior period amounts presented within this Annual Report to provide visibility and comparability. All discussion herein, unless otherwise noted, refers to our remaining operating segment after the dispositions, the Media Distribution business. See Note \u201cDiscontinued Operations\u201d to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report.\nInformation about Segment and Geographic Revenue\nAs a result of the dispositions, the Company now manages its business in one operating segment, the Media Distribution business, which is presented as one reportable segment: Media Distribution. Information about segment and geographic revenue is set forth in Note \"Segment and Geographic Information\" to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 of this Annual Report.\nMedia Distribution Business\nThe Company's Media Distribution business is an advertiser solution for unique and exclusive carrier and OEM inventory, which is comprised of our core platform and other recurring and life-cycle products, features, and professional services delivered on this platform.\nOur technology platform enables mobile operators and OEMs to control, manage, and monetize devices through application installation at the time of activation and over the life of a mobile device through a variety of offerings, allowing mobile operators to personalize the application activation experience for customers and monetize their home screens via revenue share agreements such as: Cost-Per-Install (CPI), Cost-Per-Placement (CPP), Cost-Per-Action (CPA) with third-party advertisers; or via Per-Device-License Fees (PDL) agreements which allow operators and OEMs to leverage the platform, products, and features for a structured fee. There are several different delivery methods available to operators and OEMs on first boot of the device: Wizard, Silent, or Software Development Kit (\"SDK\"). We also provide additional platform monetization options, outside of our core application delivery technology, that monetize user actions over the life-cycle of a device by delivering targeted media-rich advertising content to the end-user. Additional products and features are available throughout the life-cycle of the device that provide operators and OEMs an opportunity for additional revenue streams. The Company has launched its platform with mobile operators and OEMs in North America, Latin America, Europe, Asia Pacific, India and Israel.\nCompetition\nThe distribution of applications; media content; and the development, distribution and sale of mobile products and services is a highly competitive business. We compete for advertising partners on the basis of positioning, brand, quality and price. We compete for carrier and manufacturer placement based on these factors, as well as historical performance. We compete for platform deployment contracts with other media distribution platform companies. We also compete for experienced and talented employees.\nDigital Turbine has internally-developed solutions for operators and OEMs including device application management solutions, programmatic advertising and targeted media delivery, and other value added services. Our platform is a patent-pending media distribution solution that enables operators and OEMs to pre-install and manage applications from a single web interface as well as generate additional revenue streams over the life of a device.\nOur primary competition for traditional application distribution comes from the Google Play application store. Broadly, our media distribution platform faces competition from existing operator solutions built internally, as well as companies providing application and content media products and services, such as: Facebook, Snapchat, IronSource, WPP, Omnicom, Criteo, QuinStreet, InMobi, Cheetah Mobile, Baidu, Tremor International, Magnite, Brightcove, Applovin, and others. These companies can be both customers for Digital Turbine products, as well as competitors in certain cases. We compete with smaller competitors, but the more material competition is internally-developed operator solutions and specific media distribution solutions built in-house by OEMs and wireless operators. Some of our existing wireless operators could make a strategic decision to develop their own solutions rather than continue to use our suite of products, which could be a material source of competition. And finally, although we do not see any competition from larger Enterprise application players such as IBM, Citrix, Oracle, or MobileIron, it is possible they could decide to compete against our platform.\nProduct Development\nOur product development expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits for employees working on campaign management, creating, developing, editing, programming, performing quality assurance, obtaining carrier certification and deploying our products across various mobile phone carriers and on our internal platforms. We devote substantial resources to the development, technology support, and quality assurance of our products. Total product development costs incurred for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 were $20.1 million, $12.0 million, and $10.9 million, respectively.\nIntellectual Property\nWe consider our trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, patent and other intellectual property rights, including those in our know-how and the software code of our proprietary technology, to be, in the aggregate, material to our business. We protect our intellectual property rights by relying on federal and state statutory and common law rights, foreign laws where applicable, as well as contractual restrictions.\nAs of March 31, 2021, we have 6 U.S. patents and 3 U.S. patent applications related to different components of our platform. In addition, we own and use trademarks and service marks on or in connection with our proprietary technology and related services, including both unregistered common law marks and issued trademark registrations.\nWe design, test and update our products, services and websites regularly, and we have developed our proprietary solutions in-house. Our know-how is an important element of our intellectual property. The development and management of our platform requires sophisticated coordination among many specialized employees. We take steps to protect our know-how, trade secrets and other confidential information, in part, by entering into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, developers and vendors who have access to our confidential information, and generally limiting access to and distribution of our confidential information.\nWe intend to pursue additional intellectual property protection to the extent we believe it would advance our business objectives and maintain our competitive position.\nContracts with Customers\nWe have both exclusive and non-exclusive carrier and OEM agreements. Our agreements with advertisers are generally non-exclusive. Our carrier and OEM agreements for our Advertising business are multi-year agreements, with terms that are generally longer than one to two years. In addition, some carrier agreements provide that the carrier can terminate the agreement early and, in some instances, at any time without cause, which could give them the ability to renegotiate economic or other terms. The agreements generally do not obligate the carriers to market or distribute any of our products or services. In many of these agreements, we warrant that our products do not violate community standards, do not contain libelous content, do not contain material defects or viruses, and do not violate third-party intellectual property rights and we indemnify the carrier for any breach of a third-party\u2019s intellectual property. Most of our sales are made either directly to application developers, advertising agencies representing application developers or through advertising aggregators.\nWe generally have numerous advertisers who represent a significant level of business. Coupled with advertiser concentration, we distribute a significant level of advertising through one operator. If such advertising clients or this operator decided to materially reduce or discontinue its use of our platform, it could cause an immediate and significant decline in our revenue and negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWith respect to customer revenue concentration, during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, no single customer represented more than 10% of net revenues. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, one major customer, Oath Inc., a subsidiary of Verizon Communications, represented 15.3% of net revenues. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, one major customers, Oath Inc., a subsidiary of Verizon Communications, represented 28.6% of net revenues.\nWith respect to partner revenue concentration, the Company partners with mobile carriers and OEMs to deliver applications on our platform through the carrier network. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, T-Mobile US Inc., including Sprint and other subsidiaries, a carrier partner, generated 26.4%, AT&T Inc., including its Cricket subsidiary, a carrier partner, generated 22.3%, Verizon Wireless, a subsidiary of Verizon Communications, a carrier partner, generated 18.5%, and America Movil, primarily through its subsidiary Tracfone Wireless Inc., a carrier partner, generated 10.8% of our net revenues. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, Verizon Wireless, a subsidiary of Verizon Communications, a carrier partner, generated 37.3%, AT&T Inc., including its Cricket subsidiary, a carrier partner, generated 30.0%, and America Movil, primarily through its subsidiary Tracfone Wireless Inc., a carrier partner, generated 10.7% of our net revenues. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, Verizon Wireless, a subsidiary of Verizon Communications, a carrier partner, generated 45.9% and AT&T Inc., including its Cricket subsidiary, a carrier partner, generated 38.7% of our net revenues.\nBusiness Seasonality\nOur revenue, cash flow from operations, operating results and other key operating and financial measures may vary from quarter to quarter due to the seasonal nature of advertiser spending. For example, many advertisers (and their agencies) devote a disproportionate amount of their budgets to the fourth quarter of the calendar year to coincide with increased holiday spending. We expect our revenue, cash flow, operating results and other key operating and financial measures to fluctuate based on seasonal factors from period to period and expect these measures to be generally higher in the third and fourth fiscal quarters than in prior quarters.\nPeople and Culture\nWe believe the strength of our workforce is critical to our success as we strive to become a more inclusive and diverse technology company. As of March 31, 2021, we employed 280 full-time employees. Our key human capital management objectives are to attract, retain, and develop the talent we need to deliver on our commitment to offer and deliver exceptional products and services. Examples of our key programs and initiatives that are focused to achieve these objectives include:\nTotal Compensation and Benefits. Our guiding principles are anchored on the goals of being able to attract, incentivize, and retain talented employees. We believe in economic security for all employees and have adopted a living wage policy. All employees are eligible for performance bonuses of at least 10% of base salary, which can be paid out significantly higher based on performance. In addition, each employee receives a new-hire long-term incentive stock option grant and an annual long-term incentive stock option grant. We also provide our employees twelve weeks of paid short-term disability at 100% of base pay, which includes parental leave.\nInclusion and Diversity. We take great pride in our diversity and inclusion. We seek a diverse and inclusive work environment and transparently measure our progress to ensure that our employee populations are reflective of the communities in which we reside. We evaluate all of our people practices, particularly in talent acquisition and pay equity. We benchmark our demographics to our industry, both at an overall level and a professional category level (VPs and above, directors, managers, individual contributors, and administrative), and note that we are either at the high end or exceed the benchmark in every diversity category.\nCulture and Values. We have adopted our culture values of Hustle, Results, Accountability, Global, Freedom and Laugh to help create and foster a culture where every employee is empowered, engaged and trusted to be their best at work. We sponsor and support our Community Action Teams, which is an employee-led program designed to create purposeful action to build a stronger and better-connected team. The Community Action Teams have helped drive meaningful advancements in on-boarding, cross-functional understanding, a mentoring program, and a Digital Turbine Gives campaign where employees volunteer in the community over a six-week period on an annual basis.\nWorkplace Flexibility. As part of our \u201cFreedom\u201d value, and before the COVID-19 pandemic drove a shift to remote work, we established a workplace strategy to provide more flexible work options to enable employees to work from the location and with the schedule they desire. As a result, we had process, culture, and technology in place that allowed us to seamlessly pivot to a fully remote workforce following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result of the shift to fully remote work, we provided an allowance of up to one thousand dollars for each employee for home office set-up or personal expenses such as tutoring or caregiving services. We also re-purposed computers for employees who required more devices to support remote learning for dependents.\nGovernment Regulation\nWe are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States and abroad that involve matters central to our business. These laws and regulations involve matters including privacy, data use, data protection and personal information, rights of publicity, content, intellectual property, advertising, marketing, consumer protection, taxation, anti-corruption and political law compliance, and securities law compliance. In particular, we are subject to federal, state, and foreign laws regarding privacy and protection of people's data. Foreign data protection, privacy, and other laws and regulations can impose different obligations or be more restrictive than those in the United States. Refer to \u201c",

Additional risks and uncertainties of which we are not presently aware, or that we currently consider immaterial, may also affect our business operations.\nPast financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and current and potential investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods.\nRisk Factors Summary\nOur business operations are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including those outside our control, that could cause our business, financial condition, or operating results to be harmed, including risks regarding the following:\nGeneral Risks\n\u2022The markets for our products and services are rapidly evolving and may decline or experience limited growth.\n\u2022We may not achieve or sustain profitability in the future.\n\u2022We have a limited operating history for our current portfolio of assets.\n\u2022The failure to successfully integrate our recent acquisitions may adversely affect our future results.\n\u2022The failure to pay the future consideration due in the AdColony and Fyber acquisitions could have a material adverse effect.\n\u2022Growth may place significant demands on our management and our infrastructure.\n\u2022Our operations are global in scope, and we face added business, political, regulatory, operational, financial and economic risks as a result of our international operations.\n\u2022Our financial results could vary significantly from quarter to quarter and are difficult to predict.\n\u2022If we are unsuccessful in establishing and increasing awareness of our brand and recognition of our products and services, our operating results and financial condition could be harmed.\n\u2022Our business is dependent on the continued growth in usage of smartphones and other mobile connected devices.\n\u2022If mobile connected devices, their operating systems or content distribution channels develop in ways that prevent advertising or content from being delivered to their users, our ability to grow our business will be impaired.\n\u2022If we fail to deliver our products and services ahead of the commercial launch of new mobile handset models, our sales may suffer.\n\u2022We may be unable to develop and introduce in a timely way new products or services, and our products and services may have defects, which could harm our brand.\n\u2022If we fail to maintain and enhance our capabilities for our offerings to a broad array of mobile operating systems, our sales could suffer.\n\u2022We may be subject to legal liability associated with providing mobile and online services.\n\u2022Our business is dependent on our ability to maintain and scale our infrastructure, and any significant disruption in our service could damage our reputation, result in a potential loss of customers and adversely affect our financial results.\n\u2022Our products, services and systems rely on software that is highly technical, and if it contains undetected errors, our business could be adversely affected.\n\u2022We rely upon third-party data centers and providers of cloud-based infrastructure to host our platform. Any disruption in the operations of these third-party providers could adversely affect our business.\n\u2022Our business is highly dependent on decisions and developments in the mobile device industry.\n\u2022Our business may depend in part on our ability to collect and use location-based information about mobile connected device users.\n\u2022We do not have long-term agreements with advertiser clients, and we may be unable to retain key clients, attract new clients or replace departing clients with clients that can provide comparable revenue.\n\u2022Our business practices with respect to data could give rise to liabilities or reputational harm as a result of governmental regulation, legal requirements or industry standards relating to consumer privacy and data protection.\n\u2022Our business may involve the use, transmission and storage of confidential information, and the failure to properly safeguard such information could result in significant reputational harm and monetary damages.\n\u2022System security risks and cyber-attacks could disrupt our internal operations or information technology services provided to customers.\nAdvertising Risks\n\u2022Our revenues may fluctuate significantly based on mobile device sell-through, over which we have no control.\n\u2022Our growth and monetization on mobile devices depend upon effective operation with mobile operating systems, networks, and standards that we do not control as we are largely an Android-based technology provider.\n\u2022We currently rely on wireless carriers and OEMs to distribute our products and services and thus to generate much of our revenues. The loss of or a change in any of these significant carrier relationships could cause us to lose access to their subscribers and thus materially reduce our revenues.\n\u2022The mobile advertising business is an intensely competitive industry, and we may not be able to compete successfully.\n\u2022The Company\u2019s advertising business depends on our ability to collect and use data to deliver applications, and any limitation on the collection and use of this data could significantly diminish the value of the Company\u2019s services.\nRisks Related to Our Market\n\u2022If we fail to develop and publish new products and services that achieve market acceptance, our sales would suffer.\n\u2022The strategic direction of the Company's businesses is developing and not completely proven or certain.\nRisks Relating to Our Industry\n\u2022Wireless technologies are changing rapidly, and we may not be successful in working with these new technologies.\n\u2022The complexity of and incompatibilities among mobile handsets may require us to use additional resources for the development of our products and services.\n\u2022If wireless subscribers do not continue to use their mobile handsets to access mobile content and other applications, our business growth and future revenues may be adversely affected.\n\u2022A shift of technology platform by wireless carriers and mobile handset manufacturers could lengthen the development period for our offerings, increase our costs, and cause our offerings to be published later than anticipated.\n\u2022Our business depends on the growth and maintenance of wireless communications infrastructure.\n\u2022Actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in devices or wireless networks could adversely affect our revenues.\nRisks Related to Our Management, Employees, and Acquisitions\n\u2022Our business and growth may suffer if we are unable to hire and retain key talent, who are in high demand.\n\u2022The acquisition of other technologies could result in operating difficulties, dilution, and other harmful consequences.\n\u2022Changes to financial accounting standards could make it more expensive to issue stock options to employees, which would increase compensation costs and might cause us to change our business practices.\nRisks Related to Potential Liability, Our Intellectual Property, and Our Content\n\u2022If we do not adequately protect our intellectual property rights, it may be possible for third parties to obtain and improperly use our intellectual property and our competitive position may be adversely affected.\n\u2022Third parties may sue us for intellectual property infringement, which, if successful, may disrupt our business and could require us to pay significant damage awards.\n\u2022Our business in countries with a history of corruption and transactions with foreign governments, including with government owned or controlled wireless carriers, increase the risks associated with our international activities.\n\u2022Government regulation of our marketing methods could restrict our ability to adequately advertise and promote our content, products and services available in certain jurisdictions.\nRisks Relating to Our Common Stock and Capital Structure\n\u2022The Company has secured and unsecured indebtedness, which could limit our financial flexibility.\n\u2022To service our debt and fund our other capital requirements, we will require a significant amount of cash, and our ability to generate cash will depend on many factors beyond our control.\n\u2022The market price of our common stock is likely to be highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations, and you may be unable to resell your shares at or above the current price.\n\u2022The sale of securities by us in any equity or debt financing, or the issuance of new shares related to an acquisition, could lower the market price for our common stock.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nGeneral Risks\nThe markets for our products and services are rapidly evolving and may decline or experience limited growth.\nThe industry in which we operate is characterized by rapid technological change, new features, tools, solutions and strategies, evolving legal and regulatory requirements, changing customer needs and a dynamic competitive market. Our future success will depend in large part on the continued growth of our markets and our ability to improve and expand our products and services to respond quickly and effectively to this growth.\nThe opportunities provided by apps, mobile advertising and other engagement touchpoints in mobile devices are still relatively new, and our customers, which include advertisers, app developers, advertising networks, wireless carriers and OEMs, may not recognize the need for, or benefits of, some or all of our products and services. Moreover, they may decide to adopt alternative products and services to satisfy some portion of their business needs.\nIf we fail to deliver timely releases of products that are ready for use, release a new version, service, tool or update, or respond to new offerings by competitors, or if new technologies emerge that are able to deliver competitive products or services more efficiently, more conveniently or more securely than our products and services, then our position in our markets could be harmed, and we could lose customers, which would adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nFurther, we must be able to keep pace with rapid regulatory changes in order to compete successfully in our markets. Our revenue growth depends on our ability to respond to frequently changing data protection regulations, policies and user demands and expectations, which will require us to incur additional costs to implement. The regulatory landscape in this industry is rapidly shifting, and we may become subject to new regulations that restrict our operations or materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur ability to succeed within the markets that our products and services address and continue to be profitable in the future depends upon a number of factors, including the cost, performance and perceived value associated with our individual products and services. Significant time, resources and expertise are required in order to build the technology that can deliver automated, high-quality user growth and monetization, while meeting user expectations for tailored experiences and relevant advertising.\nThe markets for our products and services could fail to grow significantly or there could be a reduction in demand for our products or services as a result of a lack of customer acceptance, technological challenges, competing products and services, decreases in spending by current and prospective customers, weakening economic conditions and other causes. If our markets do not continue to experience growth or if the demand for our products and services decreases, then our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe have a history of net losses, may incur substantial net losses in the future, and may not achieve or sustain profitability in the future.\nWe expect to continue to increase expenses as we implement initiatives designed to continue to grow our business, including, among other things, the development and marketing of new products and services, further international and domestic expansion, expansion of our infrastructure, development of systems and processes, acquisition of content, and general and administrative expenses associated with being a public company. If our revenues do not increase at a level to offset these expected increases in operating expenses, we will incur losses and will not be profitable. Our revenue growth in past periods should not be considered indicative of our future performance. In fact, in future periods, our revenues could decline as they have in past years. Accordingly, we may not be able to achieve profitability in the future.\nIf there are delays in the distribution of our products or if we are unable to successfully negotiate with advertisers, application developers, carriers, mobile operators or OEMs or if these negotiations cannot occur on a timely basis, we may not be able to generate revenues sufficient to meet the needs of the business in the foreseeable future or at all.\nWe have a limited operating history for our current portfolio of assets, which may make it difficult to evaluate our business.\nEvaluation of our business and our prospects must be considered in light of our limited operating history and the risks and uncertainties encountered by companies in our stage of development. As a developing company in the emerging mobile application industry, we face increased risks, uncertainties, expenses and difficulties. To address these risks and uncertainties, we must do the following:\n\u2022maintain our current, and develop new, wireless carrier, OEM, application developer and advertiser relationships, in both international and domestic markets;\n\u2022retain or improve our current revenue-sharing arrangements;\n\u2022continue to develop new high-quality products and services that achieve significant market acceptance;\n\u2022continue to develop and upgrade our technology;\n\u2022continue to enhance our information processing systems;\n\u2022increase the number of end users of our products and services;\n\u2022execute our business and marketing strategies successfully;\n\u2022respond to competitive developments; and\n\u2022attract, integrate, retain and motivate qualified talent.\nWe may be unable to accomplish one or more of these objectives, which could cause our business to suffer. In addition, accomplishing many of these efforts may be very expensive, which could adversely impact our operating results and financial condition.\nThe failure to successfully integrate the business and operations of our recent acquisitions in the expected time frame may adversely affect our future results.\nWe recently completed the acquisitions of Triapodi Ltd. (d/b/a Appreciate) (\u201cAppreciate\u201d) on March 2, 2021 and AdColony Holding AS (\u201cAdColony\u201d) on April 29, 2021 and Fyber N.V. (\"Fyber\") on May 25, 2021. We believe the acquisitions of Appreciate, AdColony, and Fyber will result in certain benefits, including providing vertical integrations integral to achieving the Company's strategic goal of being a powerful, best-in-class, end-to-end solution for mobile brand acquisition, advertising, and monetization. To realize these anticipated benefits, however, the businesses of Appreciate, AdColony, and Fyber must be successfully integrated. The success of the acquisitions will depend on our ability to realize these anticipated benefits from integrating all three businesses. The acquisitions may fail to realize the anticipated benefits for a variety of reasons, including the following:\n\u2022failure to harmonize the full vertical operations;\n\u2022failure to successfully take advantage of revenue growth opportunities;\n\u2022failure to effectively coordinate sales and marketing efforts to communicate the capabilities of the complementary offerings;\n\u2022the burden of integrating three businesses simultaneously on talent and systems;\n\u2022potential difficulties integrating and harmonizing operations and other key functions;\n\u2022failure to successfully scale and grow human and system resources to meet the demands of a larger international organization;\n\u2022the loss of key employees; and\n\u2022failure to combine product offerings quickly and effectively.\nThe integration may result in additional and unforeseen expenses or delays. If we are unable to successfully integrate the business and operations of our recent acquisitions, or if there are delays in integrating the businesses, the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions may not be realized or may take longer to realize than expected.\nThe failure to pay the future consideration due in the AdColony and Fyber acquisitions could have a material adverse effect.\nUnder the terms of the Share Purchase Agreement for the acquisition of AdColony, we must pay $100.0 million in cash on or before October 29, 2021 and an earn-out payment estimated between $150.0 million to $175.0 million in cash following December 31, 2021. In addition, under the terms of the Sale and Purchase Agreement for the acquisition of Fyber, we must pay the tender offer consideration in cash and a potential earn-out payment of up to $50.0 million, which may be paid in shares of our common stock or, under certain circumstances, in cash. In order to fund the future cash payments due in respect of the AdColony and Fyber acquisitions, we will need to use cash flows from operations and borrowings under our existing revolving credit facility and may need to access the capital markets. If our cash flows and borrowings under our revolving credit facility are not available for any reason, we would be forced to seek funds from the capital markets. We may not be able to effect any such monies on commercially reasonable terms or at all and, even if successful, we might not raise sufficient funds to meet such payment obligations. Any such event would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and business.\nGrowth may place significant demands on our management and our infrastructure.\nIn recent years, we have significantly grown the scale of our business. In addition, we recently consummated the acquisitions of Appreciate, AdColony, and Fyber. The growth and expansion of our business places significant strain on our management and our operational and financial resources. As we expand our product and service offerings and the usage of our platform grows, we will need to devote additional resources to improving its capabilities, features and functionality, and scaling our business, IT, financial, operating and administrative systems. There can be no assurance that we will appropriately allocate our resources in a manner that results in increased revenue or other growth in our business. Any failure of or delay in these efforts could result in impaired performance and reduced customer satisfaction, which would hurt our revenue growth and our reputation. Additionally, we may encounter unforeseen operating expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other unknown factors that may result in losses in future periods. Even if we are successful in our expansion and integration efforts, they will be expensive and complex and require the dedication of significant management time and attention. We may also suffer inefficiencies or service disruptions as a result of our efforts to scale our internal infrastructure. We cannot be sure that the expansion and integration of and improvements to our internal infrastructure will be effectively implemented on a timely basis, if at all, and such failures could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur growth has placed, and may continue to place, significant demands on our management and our operational and financial infrastructure. Continued growth could strain our ability to:\n\u2022develop and improve our operational, financial and management controls;\n\u2022enhance our reporting systems and procedures;\n\u2022recruit, train and retain highly skilled talent;\n\u2022maintain our quality standards; and\n\u2022maintain branded content owner, wireless carrier and end-user satisfaction.\nManaging our growth will require significant expenditures and allocation of valuable management resources. If we fail to achieve the necessary level of efficiency in our organization as it grows, our business, operating results and financial condition would be harmed.\nOur operations are global in scope, and we face added business, political, regulatory, operational, financial, and economic risks as a result of our international operations and distribution, any of which could increase our costs and hinder our growth.\nOur operations are global in scope, with operations, sales presence and customers in multiple countries. We are continuing to adapt to and develop strategies to address global markets, but we cannot assure you that such efforts will be successful. We expect that our global activities will continue to grow for the foreseeable future as we continue to pursue opportunities in existing and new global industries, which will require the dedication of management attention and financial resources.\nWe expect international sales and growth to continue to be an important component of our revenues and operations. Risks affecting our international operations include:\n\u2022challenges caused by distance, language and cultural differences;\n\u2022multiple and conflicting laws and regulations, including complications due to unexpected changes in these laws and regulations;\n\u2022the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations;\n\u2022higher costs associated with doing business internationally;\n\u2022difficulties in staffing and managing international operations;\n\u2022greater fluctuations in sales to end users and through carriers in developing countries, including longer payment cycles and greater difficulty collecting accounts receivable;\n\u2022protectionist laws and business practices that favor local businesses in some countries;\n\u2022foreign tax consequences;\n\u2022foreign exchange controls that might prevent us from repatriating income earned in outside the United States;\n\u2022price controls;\n\u2022the servicing of regions by many different carriers;\n\u2022imposition of public sector controls;\n\u2022political, economic and social instability, including relating to the current European sovereign debt crisis;\n\u2022restrictions on the export or import of technology;\n\u2022trade and tariff restrictions;\n\u2022variations in tariffs, quotas, taxes and other market barriers; and\n\u2022difficulties in enforcing intellectual property rights in countries other than the United States.\nIn addition, developing user interfaces that are compatible with other languages or cultures can be expensive. As a result, our ongoing international expansion efforts may be more costly than we expect. Further, expansion into developing countries subjects us to the effects of regional instability, civil unrest and hostilities, and could adversely affect us by disrupting communications and making travel more difficult. These risks could harm our international expansion efforts, which, in turn, could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur financial results could vary significantly from quarter to quarter and are difficult to predict.\nOur revenues and operating results could vary significantly from quarter to quarter because of a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control. As a result, comparing our operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful. In addition, we are not able to predict our future revenues or results of operations. We base our current and future expense levels on our internal operating plans and sales forecasts, and our operating costs are to a large extent fixed. As a result, we may not be able to reduce our costs sufficiently to compensate for an unexpected shortfall in revenues, and even a small shortfall in revenues could disproportionately and adversely affect financial results for that quarter. Individual products and services, and carrier and OEM relationships, represent meaningful portions of our revenues and margins in any quarter.\nIn addition to other risk factors discussed in this section, factors that may contribute to the variability of our results include:\n\u2022the number of new products and services released by us and our competitors;\n\u2022the timing of release of new products and services by us and our competitors, particularly those that may represent a significant portion of revenues in a period;\n\u2022the popularity of new products and services, and products and services released in prior periods;\n\u2022changes in prominence of deck placement for our leading products and those of our competitors;\n\u2022the timing of charges related to impairments of goodwill, and intangible assets;\n\u2022changes in pricing policies by us, our competitors, our vendors or our carriers and other distributors;\n\u2022changes in the mix of direct versus indirect advertising sales, which have varying margin profiles;\n\u2022changes in the mix of CPI, CPP, CPA, and license fee sales, which have varying revenue and margin profiles;\n\u2022the seasonality of our industry;\n\u2022fluctuations in the size and rate of growth of overall consumer demand for mobile products and services;\n\u2022strategic decisions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions, divestitures, spin-offs, joint ventures, strategic investments or changes in business strategy;\n\u2022our success in entering new geographic markets;\n\u2022decisions by one or more of our partners and/or customers to terminate our business relationship(s);\n\u2022foreign exchange fluctuations;\n\u2022accounting rules governing recognition of revenue;\n\u2022general economic, political and market conditions and trends;\n\u2022the timing of compensation expense associated with equity compensation grants; and\n\u2022decisions by us to incur additional expenses for product and service development.\nAs a result of these and other factors, including seasonality attributable to the holiday seasons, our operating results may not meet the expectations of investors or public market analysts who choose to follow our company. Our failure to meet market expectations would likely result in decreases in the trading price of our common stock.\nPlacement of our products and services, or the failure of the market to accept our products and services, would likely adversely impact our revenues and thus our operating results and financial condition.\nWireless carriers provide a limited selection of products that are accessible to their subscribers through their mobile handsets. The inherent limitation on the volume of products available on the handset is a function of the screen size of handsets and carriers\u2019 perceptions of the depth of menus and numbers of choices end users will generally utilize. If carriers choose to give our products less favorable placement or reduce our slot count on the phone, our products may be less successful than we anticipate, our revenues may decline and our business, operating results and financial condition may be materially harmed. In addition, if carriers or other participants in the market favor another competitor\u2019s products over our products, or opt not to enable and implement our technology to unify operating systems, our future growth could suffer and our revenues could be negatively affected.\nIf we are unsuccessful in establishing and increasing awareness of our brand and recognition of our products and services or if we incur excessive expenses promoting and maintaining our brand or our products and services, our potential revenues could be limited, our costs could increase, and our operating results and financial condition could be harmed.\nWe believe that establishing and maintaining our brand is critical to retaining and expanding our existing relationships with wireless carriers, OEMs, application developers and advertisers as well as developing new relationships. Promotion of the Company\u2019s brands will depend on our success in providing high-quality products and services. Similarly, recognition of our products and services by users will depend on our ability to develop engaging products and quality services to maintain existing, and attract new, business relationships and users. However, our success will also depend, in part, on the services and efforts of third parties, over which we have little or no control. For instance, if our carriers fail to provide high levels of service, our end users\u2019 ability to access our products and services may be interrupted, which may adversely affect our brand. If end users, carriers, OEMs, advertisers and application developers do not perceive our offerings as high-quality or if we introduce new products and services that are not favorably received by our end users, carriers, OEMs, advertisers and application developers, then we may be unsuccessful in building brand recognition and brand loyalty in the marketplace. In addition, globalizing and extending our brand and recognition of our products and services will be costly and will involve extensive management time to execute successfully. Further, the markets in which we operate are highly competitive and some of our competitors already have substantially more brand name recognition and greater marketing resources than we do. If we fail to increase brand awareness and consumer recognition of our products and services, our potential revenues could be limited, our costs could increase and our business, operating results and financial condition could suffer.\nOur business is dependent on the continued growth in usage of smartphones, tablets, and other mobile connected devices.\nOur business depends on the continued proliferation of mobile connected devices, such as smartphones and tablets, which can connect to the Internet over a cellular, wireless or other network, as well as the increased consumption of content through those devices. Consumer usage of these mobile connected devices may be inhibited for a number of reasons, such as:\n\u2022inadequate network infrastructure to support advanced features beyond just mobile web access;\n\u2022users\u2019 concerns about the security of these devices;\n\u2022inconsistent quality of cellular or wireless connection;\n\u2022unavailability of cost-effective, high-speed Internet service;\n\u2022changes in network carrier pricing plans that charge device users based on the amount of data consumed; and\n\u2022new technology which is not compatible with our products and offerings.\nFor any of these reasons, users of mobile connected devices may limit the amount of time they spend on these devices and the number of applications or amount of content they download on these devices. If user adoption of mobile connected devices and consumer consumption of content on those devices do not continue to grow, our total addressable market size may be significantly limited, which could compromise our ability to increase our revenue and our ability to become profitable.\nIf mobile connected devices, their operating systems, or content distribution channels, including those controlled by our competitors, develop in ways that prevent advertising or content from being delivered to their users, our ability to grow our business will be impaired.\nA portion of our business model depends upon the continued demand for mobile advertising on connected devices, as well as the major operating systems that run on them and the number of applications that are downloaded onto them.\nThe design of mobile devices and operating systems is controlled by third parties, upon whom we do not have any influence. These parties frequently introduce new devices, and from time-to-time they may introduce new operating systems or modify existing ones. Network carriers may also affect the ability of users to download applications or access specified content on mobile devices.\nIn some cases, the parties that control the development of mobile connected devices and operating systems include companies that we regard as our competitors. For example, Google controls the Android\u2122 platform operating system. If our mobile software platform were unable to work on these operating systems, either because of technological constraints or because the developer of these operating systems wishes to impair our ability to provide ads on the operating system, our ability to generate revenue could be significantly harmed.\nIf we fail to deliver our products and services ahead of the commercial launch of new mobile handset models, our sales may suffer.\nOur business is dependent, in part, on the commercial sale of smartphone handsets. We do not control the timing of these handset launches. Some new handsets are sold by carriers with certain of our products and applications pre-loaded, and many end users who use our services do so after they purchase their new handsets to experience the new features of those handsets. Some of our products require handset manufacturers give us access to their handsets prior to commercial release. If one or more major handset manufacturers were to cease to provide us access to new handset models prior to commercial release, we might be unable to introduce compatible versions of our products and services for those handsets in coordination with their commercial release, and we might not be able to make compatible versions for a substantial period following their commercial release. If, because of launch delays, we miss the opportunity to sell products and services when new handsets are shipped or our end users upgrade to a new handset, or if we miss the key holiday selling period, either because the introduction of a new handset is delayed or we do not deploy our products and services in time for seasonal increases in handset sales, our revenues would likely decline and our business, operating results and financial condition would likely suffer.\nWe may be unable to develop and introduce in a timely way new products or services, and our products and services may have defects, which could harm our brand.\nThe planned timing and introduction of new products and services are subject to risks and uncertainties. Unexpected technical, operational, deployment, distribution or other problems could delay or prevent the introduction of new products and services, which could result in a loss of, or delay in, revenues or damage to our reputation and brand. If any of our products or services is introduced with defects, errors or failures, we could experience decreased sales, loss of end users, damage to our carrier relationships, damage to our advertiser and application developer relationships, and damage to our reputation and brand. In addition, new products and services may not achieve sufficient market acceptance to offset the costs of development, particularly when the introduction of a product or service is substantially later than a planned \u201cday-and-date\u201d launch, which could materially harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nIf we fail to maintain and enhance our capabilities for our offerings to a broad array of mobile operating systems, our attractiveness to wireless carriers, equipment manufacturers, advertisers, and application developers will be impaired and our sales could suffer.\nChanges to our design and development processes to address new features or functions of mobile operating systems or networks might cause inefficiencies that might result in more labor-intensive software integration processes. In addition, we anticipate that in the future we will be required to update existing and new products and applications to a broader array of mobile operating systems. If we utilize more labor intensive processes, our margins could be significantly reduced and it might take us longer to integrate our products and applications to additional mobile operating systems. This, in turn, could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nA majority of our revenues are currently being derived from a limited number of wireless carriers, advertisers, and application developers. If any one of these customers were to terminate their agreement with us or if they were unable to fulfill their payment obligations, our financial condition and results of operations would suffer.\nIf any of our primary customers were to terminate their commercial relationship with us or if they are unable to fulfill their payment obligations to us under our agreements with them, our revenues could decline significantly and our financial condition will be harmed.\nWe may be subject to legal liability associated with providing mobile and online services.\nWe provide a variety of products and services that enable carriers, manufacturers, application developers, advertisers, and users to engage in various mobile and online activities both domestically and internationally. The law relating to the liability of providers of these mobile and online services and products for such activities is still unsettled and constantly evolving in the U.S. and internationally. Claims have been threatened and have been brought against us in the past for breaches of contract, copyright or trademark infringement, tort or other theories based on the provision of these products and services. In addition, we are and have been and may again in the future be subject to domestic or international actions alleging that certain content we have generated or third-party content that we have made available within our services violates laws in domestic and international jurisdictions. We may be subject to claims concerning these products, services, or content by virtue of our involvement in marketing, branding, broadcasting, or providing access to them, even if we do not ourselves host, operate, provide, own, or license these products, services, or content. While we routinely insert indemnification provisions into our contracts with these parties, such indemnities to us, when obtainable, may not cover all damages and losses suffered by us and our customers from covered products and services. In addition, recorded reserves and/or insurance coverage may be exceeded by unexpected results from such claims which directly impacts profits. Defending such actions could be costly and involve significant time and attention of our management and other resources, may result in monetary liabilities or penalties, and may require us to change our business in an adverse manner.\nOur business is dependent on our ability to maintain and scale our infrastructure, including our employees and third parties, and any significant disruption in our service could damage our reputation, result in a potential loss of customers, and adversely affect our financial results.\nOur reputation and ability to attract, retain, and serve customers is dependent upon the reliable performance of our products and services and the underlying infrastructure, both internal and from third-party providers. Our systems may not be adequately designed with the necessary reliability and redundancy to avoid performance delays or outages that could be harmful to our business. If our products and services are unavailable, or if they do not load as quickly as expected, customers may not use our products as often in the future, or at all. If our customer base grows, we will need an increasing amount of infrastructure, including network capacity, to continue to satisfy the needs of our customers. It is possible that we may fail to effectively scale and grow our infrastructure to accommodate these increased demands. In addition, our business may be subject to interruptions, delays, or failures resulting from earthquakes, adverse weather conditions, other natural disasters, power loss, terrorism, ineffective business execution, epidemics, pandemics, or other catastrophic events.\nA substantial portion of our network infrastructure is provided by third parties. Any disruption or failure in the services we receive from these providers could harm our ability to handle existing or increased traffic and could significantly harm our business. Any financial or other difficulties these providers face may adversely affect our business, and we exercise little control over these providers, which increases our vulnerability to problems with the services they provide.\nOur products, services, and systems rely on software that is highly technical, and if it contains undetected errors, our business could be adversely affected.\nOur products, services and systems rely on software, including software developed or maintained internally and/or by third parties, that is highly technical and complex. In addition, our products, services and systems depend on the ability of such software to transfer, store, retrieve, process, and manage large amounts of data. The software on which we rely has contained, and may now or in the future contain, undetected errors, bugs, or vulnerabilities. Some errors may only be discovered after the code has been released for external or internal use. Errors or other design defects within the software on which we rely may result in a negative experience for customers and marketers who use our products, delay product introductions or enhancements, result in measurement or billing errors, or compromise our ability to protect the data of our users and/or our intellectual property. Any errors, bugs, or defects discovered in the software on which we rely could result in damage to our reputation, loss of users, loss of revenue, or liability for damages, any of which could adversely affect our business and financial results.\nWe rely upon third-party data centers and providers of cloud-based infrastructure to host our platform. Any disruption in the operations of these third-party providers, limitations on capacity, or interference with our use could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe currently serve our customers from data centers in the United States and other locations worldwide, which are operated by a third-party cloud hosting provider. We use various third-party cloud hosting providers, such as Amazon Web Services (\u201cAWS\u201d), to provide cloud infrastructure for our platform. Our platform relies on the operations of this infrastructure. Customers need to be able to access, send requests and receive communication from our platform at any time, without interruption or degradation of performance. In addition, our platform depends on the ability of these data centers and cloud infrastructure to allow for our customers\u2019 configuration, architecture, features and interconnection specifications and to secure the information stored in these data centers. Any limitation on the capacity of our data centers or cloud infrastructure could impede our ability to onboard new customers or expand the usage of our existing customers, host our platform or serve our customers, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, any incident affecting our data centers or cloud infrastructure that may be caused by cyber-attacks, natural disasters, fire, flood, severe storm, earthquake, power loss, outbreaks of contagious diseases, telecommunications failures, terrorist or other attacks and other similar events beyond our control could negatively affect the cloud-based portion of our platform. A prolonged service disruption affecting our data centers or cloud-based services for any of the foregoing reasons would negatively impact our ability to serve our customers and could damage our reputation with current and potential customers, expose us to liability, cause us to lose customers or incur additional costs under our customer and partner agreements or otherwise harm our business. We may also incur significant costs for using alternative providers or taking other actions in preparation for, or in response to, events that damage the third-party hosting services we use.\nIn the event that our service agreements relating to our data centers or cloud infrastructure are terminated or there is a lapse of service, elimination of services or features that we utilize, interruption of internet service provider connectivity or damage to such facilities, we could experience interruptions in access to our platform, loss of revenue from revenue-share and usage-based solutions, as well as significant delays and additional expense in arranging or creating new facilities and services or re-architecting our platform for deployment on a different data center provider or cloud infrastructure service provider, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s business is highly dependent on decisions and developments in the mobile device industry over which the Company has no control.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to maintain and grow its business will be impaired if mobile connected devices, mobile operating systems, networks, standards and content distribution channels, which are run by operating system providers and app stores including those controlled by the primary competitors of the Company, develop in ways that prevent the Company\u2019s products and services from being delivered to their users.\nThe Company\u2019s business model will depend upon the continued compatibility of its mobile advertising platform with most mobile connected devices, as well as the major operating systems that run on them and the thousands of apps that are downloaded onto them.\nThe design of mobile devices and operating systems is controlled by third parties. These parties frequently introduce new devices, and from time to time they may introduce new operating systems or modify existing ones. Network carriers, such as Verizon, AT&T, Sprint, as well as other domestic and global operators, as well as OEMs, such as Samsung, may also affect the ability of users to download apps or access specified content on mobile devices. The Company also has some relationships with various other mobile carriers with relationships that are specific and subject to contractual performance which may not be achieved.\nIn some cases, the parties that control the development of mobile connected devices and operating systems include companies that the Company would regard as its most significant competitors. For example, Apple controls two of the most popular mobile devices, the iPhone\u00ae and the iPad\u00ae, as well as the iOS operating system that runs on them. Apple also controls the App Store for downloading apps that run on Apple\u00ae mobile devices. Similarly, Google controls the Google Play and Android\u2122 platform operating system. If the Company\u2019s mobile advertising platform were unable to work on these devices or operating systems, either because of technological constraints or because a maker of these devices or developer of these operating systems wished to impair the Company\u2019s ability to place or provide ads on them or its ability to fulfill advertising space, or inventory, from developers whose apps are distributed through their controlled channels, the Company\u2019s ability to maintain and grow its business will be impaired, and the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected, perhaps materially.\nThe parties that control these operating systems frequently introduce new technology, and from time to time, they may introduce new operating systems or modify existing ones. Further, the Company and its customers are also subject to the policies, practices, guidelines, certifications and terms of service of such parties\u2019 platforms on which we and our customers create, run and monetize applications and content. These policies, guidelines and terms of service govern the promotion, distribution, content and operation generally of applications and content available through such parties. The parties that control the operating systems have broad discretion to change and interpret their terms of service, guidelines and policies, and those changes may have an adverse effect on us or our customers\u2019 ability to use our products and services. A party that controls the operating system may also change its fee structure, add fees associated with access to and use of its platform or app store, alter how customers are able to advertise and monetize on their platform, change how the personal or other information of its users is made available to application developers on their platform, limit the use of personal information and other data for advertising purposes or restrict how users can share information on their platform or across other platforms. If we or our customers were to violate a party\u2019s terms of service, guidelines, certifications or policies, or if a party were to believe that such a violation occurred, then that party could limit or discontinue our or our customers\u2019 access to its platform or app store. If our platform was unable to work effectively on these operating systems, this would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nParties that control operating systems, such as Apple or Google, could also change their technical requirements, guidelines or policies in a manner that materially and adversely impacts the way in which we or our customers collect, use and share data from user devices, including restricting our ability to use or read device identifiers, other tracking features or other device data. Our ability to provide our customers with our user growth and monetization solutions relies on access to and collection of certain data, including resettable device identifiers and interactions with advertisements served by our monetization solutions for purposes such as serving advertisements, limiting the number of advertisements served to a specific device, detecting and preventing advertisement fraud, creating reports for customers, providing support to customers and measuring the effectiveness of advertisements. Without such data, we may not be able to serve such advertisements effectively, provide our products and services to customers, improve our products and services and remain competitive. There also is the risk that a party that controls an operating system could limit or discontinue our access to its platform or app store if it establishes more favorable relationships with one or more of our competitors or it determines that it is in their business interests to do so, and we would have no recourse against any such party, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf any parties that control operating systems, including either Android or iOS, stop providing us with access to their platform or infrastructure, fail to provide reliable access, cease operations, modify or introduce new systems or otherwise terminate services, the delay caused by qualifying and switching to other operating systems could be time consuming and costly and could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Any limitation on or discontinuation of us or our customers\u2019 access to any mobile operating system platform or app store could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or otherwise require us to change the way we conduct business.\nThe Company\u2019s business may depend in part on its ability to collect and use location-based information about mobile connected device users.\nThe Company\u2019s business model will depend in part upon its ability to collect data about the location of mobile connected device users when they are interacting with their devices, and then to use that information to provide effective targeted advertising on behalf of its advertising clients. The Company\u2019s ability to either collect or use location-based data could be restricted by a number of factors, including new laws or regulations, technology or consumer choice. Limitations on its ability to either collect or use location data could impact the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s platform and its ability to target ads.\nThe Company does not have long-term agreements with its advertiser clients, and it may be unable to retain key clients, attract new clients, or replace departing clients with clients that can provide comparable revenue to the Company.\nAn important component of the Company\u2019s future success is to retain and expand our relationships with existing customers and attract new customers. In order for the Company to maintain or improve our results of operations, it is important that the Company maintain positive relationships with existing customers and that they are satisfied with the products and services we provide. Our customer retention rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, some of which may be outside our control, such as the performance and perceived value associated with our products and services, including their perception of our continued development of products and services that are important to them, the business strength or weakness of our customers, the success of our customers\u2019 apps and their ability to monetize, the entry and success of competitive products and overall general economic conditions in the geographic regions in which we operate. However, our efforts may not be successful despite the resources we devote to them, and our customers may choose to switch to one of our competitors or choose to replace our products with similar technology that the customer creates internally.\nThe Company\u2019s contracts with its advertiser clients do not generally include long-term obligations requiring them to purchase the Company\u2019s services and are cancelable upon short or no notice and without penalty. As a result, the Company may have limited visibility as to its future advertising revenue streams. The Company will not be able to provide assurance that its advertiser clients will continue to use its services or that it will be able to replace, in a timely or effective manner, departing clients with new clients that generate comparable revenue. If a major advertising client representing a significant portion of the Company\u2019s business decides to materially reduce its use of the Company\u2019s platform or to cease using the Company\u2019s platform altogether, it is possible that the Company may not have a sufficient supply of ads to fill its developers\u2019 advertising inventory, in which case the Company\u2019s revenue could be significantly reduced. Revenue derived from performance advertisers in particular is subject to fluctuation and competitive pressures. Such advertisers, which seek to drive app downloads, are less consistent with respect to their spending volume, and may decide to substantially increase or decrease their use of the Company\u2019s platform based on seasonality or popularity of a particular application.\nAdvertisers in general may shift their business to a competitor\u2019s platform because of new or more compelling offerings, strategic relationships, technological developments, pricing and other financial considerations, or a variety of other reasons. Any non-renewal, renegotiation, cancellation or deferral of large advertising contracts, or a number of contracts that in the aggregate account for a significant amount of revenue, could cause an immediate and significant decline in the Company\u2019s revenue and harm its business.\nThe Company\u2019s business practices with respect to data could give rise to liabilities or reputational harm as a result of governmental regulation, legal requirements, or industry standards relating to consumer privacy and data protection.\nIn the course of providing its services, the Company will transmit and store information related to mobile devices and the ads it places, which may include a device\u2019s geographic location for the purpose of delivering targeted location-based ads to the user of the device, with that user\u2019s consent. Federal, state and international laws and regulations govern the collection, use, retention, sharing and security of data that the Company will collect across its mobile advertising platform. The Company will strive to comply with all applicable laws, regulations, policies and legal obligations relating to privacy and data protection. However, it is possible that these requirements may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another and may conflict with other rules or its practices. Any failure, or perceived failure, by it to comply with U.S. federal, state, or international laws, including laws and regulations regulating privacy, data security, or consumer protection, could result in proceedings or actions against the Company by governmental entities or others. Any such proceedings could hurt the Company\u2019s reputation, force it to spend significant amounts in defense of these proceedings, distract its management, increase its costs of doing business, adversely affect the demand for its services and ultimately result in the imposition of monetary liability. The Company may also be contractually liable to indemnify and hold harmless its clients from the costs or consequences of inadvertent or unauthorized disclosure of data that it stores or handles as part of providing its services.\nThe regulatory framework for privacy issues worldwide is evolving, and various government and consumer agencies and public advocacy groups have called for new regulation and changes in industry practices, including some directed at the mobile industry in particular. For example, in early 2012, the State of California entered into an agreement with several major mobile application platforms under which the platforms have agreed to require mobile applications to meet specified standards to ensure consumer privacy. Subsequently, in January 2013, the State of California released a series of recommendations for privacy best practices for the mobile industry. In January 2014, a California law also became effective amending the required disclosures for online privacy policies. In addition, the state of California has enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, a privacy and cyber security law, which establishes strict data protection and privacy controls and reporting requirements and increases liabilities for non-compliance. In addition, other jurisdictions, including other states, have enacted, or may enact, their own privacy and cyber security laws. Any such laws may impact our operations and the California legislation underscores the increasing risk profile of our business to both cyber events and the emerging, strict, regulatory framework governing all businesses dealing in personal data. It is possible that new laws and regulations will be adopted in the United States and internationally, or existing laws and regulations may be interpreted in new ways, that would affect the Company\u2019s business, particularly with regard to location-based services, collection or use of data to target ads, and communication with consumers via mobile devices.\nThe U.S. government, including the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, and the Department of Commerce, is focused on the need for greater regulation of the collection of consumer information, including regulation aimed at restricting some targeted advertising practices. In December 2012, the FTC adopted revisions to the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act, or COPPA, that went into effect on July 1, 2013. COPPA imposes a number of obligations on operators of websites and online services including mobile applications, such as obtaining parental consent, if the operator collects specified information from users and either the site or service is directed to children under 13 years old or the site or service knows that a specific user is a child under 13 years old. The changes broaden the applicability of COPPA, including the types of information that are subject to these regulations, and may apply to information that the Company will collect through mobile devices or apps that, prior to the adoption of these new regulations, was not subject to COPPA. These revisions will impose new compliance burdens on the Company. In February 2013, the FTC issued a staff report containing recommendations for best practices with respect to consumer privacy for the mobile industry. To the extent that the Company or its clients choose to adopt these recommendations, or other regulatory or industry requirements become applicable to the Company, it may have greater compliance burdens.\nAs the Company expands its operations globally, compliance with regulations that differ from country to country also imposes substantial burdens on its business. In particular, the European Union (EU) has adopted a comprehensive overhaul of its data protection regime from the current national legislative approach to a single European Economic Area Privacy Regulation, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which became effective in 2018. The EU data protection regime extends the scope of the EU data protection law to all foreign companies processing data of EU residents. It imposes a strict data protection compliance regime with severe penalties of up to the greater of 4% of worldwide turnover and \u20ac20 million and includes new rights such as the \u201cportability\u201d of personal data. Although the GDPR will apply across the EU without a need for local implementing legislation, as has been the case under the current data protection regime, local data protection authorities (DPAs) will still have the ability to interpret the GDPR, which has the potential to create inconsistencies on a country-by-country basis. Complying with any new regulatory requirements could force us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner that could compromise our ability to effectively pursue our growth strategy.\nThe Company\u2019s business may involve the use, transmission, and storage of confidential information, and the failure to properly safeguard such information could result in significant reputational harm and monetary damages.\nThe Company may at times collect, store and transmit information of, or on behalf of, its clients that may include certain types of confidential information that may be considered personal or sensitive, and that are subject to laws that apply to data breaches. The Company intends to take reasonable steps to protect the security, integrity and confidentiality of the information it collects and stores, but there is no guarantee that inadvertent or unauthorized disclosure will not occur or that third parties will not gain unauthorized access to this information despite the Company\u2019s efforts to protect this information. If such unauthorized disclosure or access does occur, the Company may be required to notify persons whose information was disclosed or accessed. Most states have enacted data breach notification laws and, in addition to federal laws that apply to certain types of information, such as financial information, federal legislation has been proposed that would establish broader federal obligations with respect to data breaches. The Company may also be subject to claims of breach of contract for such disclosure, investigation and penalties by regulatory authorities and potential claims by persons whose information was disclosed. The unauthorized disclosure of information may result in the termination of one or more of its commercial relationships or a reduction in client confidence and usage of its services. The Company may also be subject to litigation alleging the improper use, transmission or storage of confidential information, which could damage its reputation among its current and potential clients, require significant expenditures of capital and other resources and cause it to lose business and revenue.\nSystem failures could significantly disrupt the Company\u2019s operations and cause it to lose advertiser clients or advertising inventory.\nThe Company\u2019s success will depend on the continuing and uninterrupted performance of its own internal systems, which the Company will utilize to bid and place ads, deliver applications and ads, monitor the performance of advertising campaigns and manage its inventory of advertising space. Its revenue will depend on the technological ability of its platforms to deliver applications and ads. Sustained or repeated system failures that interrupt its ability to provide services to clients, including technological failures affecting its ability to deliver applications and ads quickly and accurately and to process mobile device users\u2019 responses to applications and ads, could significantly reduce the attractiveness of its services to advertisers and reduce its revenue. The combined systems are vulnerable to damage from a variety of sources, including telecommunications failures, power outages, malicious human acts and natural disasters. In addition, any steps the Company takes to increase the reliability and redundancy of its systems may be expensive and may not ultimately be successful in preventing system failures.\nSystem security risks, data protection breaches, cyber-attacks, and systems integration issues could disrupt our internal operations or information technology services provided to customers, and any such disruption could reduce our expected revenue, increase our expenses, damage our reputation, and adversely affect our stock price.\nExperienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our network security and misappropriate or compromise our confidential information or that of third-parties, create system disruptions or cause shutdowns. Computer programmers and hackers also may be able to develop and deploy viruses, worms, and other malicious software programs that attack our products or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities of our products. In addition, sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that we produce or procure from third-parties may contain defects in design or manufacture, including \u2018\u2018bugs\u2019\u2019 and other problems that could unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the system. The costs to us to eliminate or alleviate cyber or other security problems, bugs, viruses, worms, malicious software programs and security vulnerabilities could be significant, and our efforts to address these problems may not be successful and could result in interruptions, delays, cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers that may impede our sales or other critical functions. We manage and store various proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data relating to our business. Breaches of our security measures or the accidental loss, inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us, our clients or customers, including the potential loss or disclosure of such information or data as a result of fraud, trickery or other forms of deception, could expose us, our customers or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, result in litigation and potential liability for us, damage our brand and reputation or otherwise harm our business. In addition, the cost and operational consequences of implementing further data protection measures could be significant. Portions of our IT infrastructure also may experience interruptions, delays or cessations of service or produce errors in connection with systems integration or migration work that takes place from time to time. We may not be successful in implementing new systems and transitioning data, which could cause business disruptions and be more expensive, time-consuming, disruptive and resource intensive. Such disruptions could adversely impact our ability to provide services and interrupt other processes. Delayed sales, lower margins, increased cost, or lost customers resulting from these disruptions could reduce our expected revenue, increase our expenses, damage our reputation and adversely affect our stock price.\nIf our goodwill becomes impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings.\nWe test goodwill for impairment at least annually or sooner if an indicator of impairment is present. If such goodwill is deemed impaired, an impairment loss would be recognized. We may be required to record a significant charge in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill is determined, which would negatively affect our results of operations.\nPublic health issues, such as a major epidemic or pandemic, could adversely affect our business or financial results.\nThe U.S. and other countries have experienced, and may experience in the future, outbreaks of contagious diseases that affect public health and public perception of health risk. In December 2019, a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) emerged and subsequently spread worldwide. The World Health Organization has declared COVID-19 a pandemic, resulting in foreign, federal, state, and local governments and private entities mandating various restrictions requiring closure of non-essential businesses and recommending people remain at home. Our results of operations are affected by economic conditions, including macroeconomic conditions, levels of business confidence, and consumer confidence. There is significant uncertainty regarding the extent to which and how long COVID-19 will disrupt the U.S. economy, consumer confidence, and the demand for our service offerings. The extent to which COVID-19 impacts our operational and financial performance will depend on future developments, including the duration and spread of the outbreak and the impact on carriers, OEMs, customers, and employees, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, which could include reductions in sales of smartphones, tablets, and other devices or reductions in discretionary spending by customers or disruptions in employee or Company performance. If COVID-19 has a significant negative impact on economic conditions over a prolonged period of time, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted. We are conducting business as usual, with some modifications to employee travel, employee work locations, and cancellation of certain marketing events, among other modifications. We have observed other companies taking precautionary and preemptive actions to address COVID-19 and companies may take further actions that alter their normal business operations. We will continue to actively monitor the situation and may take further actions that alter our business operations, as may be required by foreign, federal, state, or local authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, partners, suppliers, and stockholders.\nChanges to current accounting principles could have a significant effect on the Company\u2019s reported financial results or the way in which it conducts its business.\nWe prepare our financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which are subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d or the \u201cCommission\u201d) and various other bodies formed to interpret, recommend, and announce appropriate accounting principles, policies, and practices. A change in these principles could have a significant effect on our reported financial results and related financial disclosures, and may even retroactively affect the accounting for previously reported transactions. Our accounting policies that recently have been or may in the future be affected by changes in the accounting principles are as follows:\n\u2022business consolidations;\n\u2022revenue recognition;\n\u2022leases;\n\u2022stock-based compensation; and\n\u2022accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets.\nChanges in these or other rules may have a significant adverse effect on our reported financial results, disclosures, or in the way in which we conduct our business. See the discussion in \u201cSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d set forth in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Annual Report, for additional information about our accounting policies and estimates and associated risks.\nAdvertising Risks\nOur revenues may fluctuate significantly based on mobile device sell-through, over which we have no control.\nA significant portion of our revenue is impacted by the level of sell-through of mobile devices on which our software is installed. Demand for mobile devices sold by carriers and OEMs varies materially by device, and if our software is installed on devices for which demand is lower than our expectations -- a factor over which we have no control as we do not market mobile devices -- our revenues will be impacted negatively, and this impact may be significant. As our software is deployed on a diversified universe of devices, this risk will be somewhat mitigated, as the relative performance of one device over another device will have less impact on us, but until we achieve diversification in our device installations, we will continue to be subject to revenue fluctuations based on device sell-through, and such fluctuations can be material. Further, it is difficult to predict the level of demand for a particular device, making our revenue projections correspondingly difficult. These issues can be ameliorated as we gain more significant carrier and OEM relationships and conversely these issues can be exacerbated with, as presently, a limited number of such relationships.\nActivities of the Company\u2019s advertiser clients could damage the Company\u2019s reputation or give rise to legal claims against it.\nThe Company\u2019s advertiser clients\u2019 promotion of their products and services may not comply with foreign, federal, state and local laws, including, but not limited to, laws and regulations relating to mobile communications. Failure of its clients to comply with federal, state or local laws or its policies could damage its reputation and expose it to liability under these laws. The Company may also be liable to third parties for content in the ads it delivers if the artwork, text or other content involved violates copyrights, trademarks or other intellectual property rights of third parties or if the content is defamatory, unfair and deceptive, or otherwise in violation of applicable laws. Although the Company will generally receive assurance from its advertisers that their ads are lawful and that they have the right to use any copyrights, trademarks or other intellectual property included in an ad, and although it will normally be indemnified by the advertisers, a third-party or regulatory authority may still file a claim against the Company. Any such claims could be costly and time-consuming to defend and could also hurt the Company\u2019s reputation. Further, if it is exposed to legal liability as a result of the activities of its advertiser clients, the Company could be required to pay substantial fines or penalties, redesign its business methods, discontinue some of its services or otherwise expend significant resources.\nLoss or reduction of business from the Company\u2019s large advertiser clients could have a significant impact on the Company\u2019s revenues, results of operations, and overall financial condition.\nA significant portion of our revenue is impacted by the level of advertising spend. If advertising spend is lower than our expectations -- a factor over which we have no control as we do not determine our customers' advertising budgets -- our revenues will be impacted negatively, and this impact may be significant.\nFrom time-to-time, a limited number of the Company\u2019s advertiser clients will be expected to account for a significant share of its advertising revenue. This customer concentration increases the risk of quarterly fluctuations in the Company\u2019s revenues and operating results. The Company\u2019s advertiser clients may reduce or terminate their business with it at any time for any reason, including changes in their financial condition or other business circumstances. If a large advertising client representing a substantial portion of its business decided to materially reduce or discontinue its use of its platform, it could cause an immediate and significant decline in its revenue and negatively affect its results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company\u2019s customer concentration also increases the concentration of its accounts receivable and its exposure to payment defaults by key customers. The Company will generate significant accounts receivable for the services that it provides to its key advertiser clients, which could expose it to substantial and potentially unrecoverable costs if it does not receive payment from them.\nMobile applications and advertising are relatively new, as are our products, which are evolving, and growth in revenues from those areas is uncertain and changes in the industry may negatively affect our revenue and financial results.\nWhile we anticipate that mobile usage will continue to be the primary driver of revenues related to applications and advertising for the foreseeable future, there could be changes in the industry of mobile carriers and OEMs that could have a negative impact on these growth prospects for our business and our financial performance. Additionally, advertising cost per install (\u201cCPI\u201d) revenue realized could be negatively impacted by end user application \u201copen-rates\u201d. The open-rates realized on advertising campaigns in the marketplace today could vary compared to the open-rates realized for applications distributed via our products. Reduced open-rates could have a negative impact on the success of our products and our potential revenues earned from CPI. The mobile advertising market remains a new and evolving market and if we are unable to grow revenues or successfully monetize our customer and potential customer relationships, or if we incur excessive expenses in these efforts, our financial performance and ability to grow revenue would be negatively affected.\nOur growth and monetization on mobile devices depend upon effective operation with mobile operating systems, networks, and standards that we do not control as we are largely an Android-based technology provider.\nThere is no guarantee that mobile carriers and devices will use our products and services rather than competing products. We are dependent on the interoperability of our products and services with popular mobile operating systems that we do not control, such as Android, and any changes in such systems and terms of service that degrade our products\u2019 functionality, reduce or eliminate our ability to distribute applications, give preferential treatment to competitive products, limit our ability to target or measure the effectiveness of applications, or impose fees or other charges related to our delivery of applications could adversely affect our monetization on mobile devices. Currently, our product offerings are primarily compatible with Android only, and would require developmental modifications to support other operating platforms. Additionally, in order to deliver high quality user experience, it is important that our products and services work well with a range of mobile technologies, systems, networks, and standards that we do not control. We may not be successful in developing relationships with key participants in the mobile industry or in developing products that operate effectively with these technologies, systems, networks, or standards. In the event that our relationships with network operators, mobile operating systems or other business partners deteriorate, our growth and monetization could be adversely affected and our business could be harmed.\nWe currently rely on wireless carriers and OEMs to distribute our products and services and thus to generate much of our revenues. The loss of or a change in any of these significant carrier relationships could cause us to lose access to their subscribers and thus materially reduce our revenues.\nThe future success of our business is highly dependent upon maintaining successful relationships with the wireless carriers and OEMs with which we currently work and establishing new carrier and OEM relationships in geographies where we have not yet established a significant presence. A significant portion of our revenue is derived from a very limited number of carriers. We expect that we will continue to generate a substantial portion of our revenues, on a go-forward basis, through relationships with a limited number of carriers for the foreseeable future. Our failure to maintain our relationships with these carriers, establish relationships with new carriers, or a loss or change of terms would materially reduce our revenues and thus harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe have both exclusive and non-exclusive carrier and OEM agreements. Historically, our carrier and OEM agreements have had terms of one or two years with automatic renewal provisions upon expiration of the initial term, absent a contrary notice from either party, but going forward terms in carrier and OEM agreements may vary. In addition, some carrier and OEM agreements provide that the parties can terminate the agreement early and, in some instances, at any time without cause, which could give them the ability to renegotiate economic or other terms. The agreements generally do not obligate the carriers and OEMs to market or distribute any of our products or services. In many of these agreements, we warrant that our products do not violate community standards, do not contain libelous content, do not contain material defects or viruses, and do not violate third-party intellectual property rights and we indemnify the carrier for any breach of a third-party\u2019s intellectual property.\nMany other factors outside our control could impair our ability to generate revenues through a given carrier or OEM, including the following:\n\u2022the carrier or OEM's preference for our competitors\u2019 products and services rather than ours;\n\u2022the carrier or OEM's decision not to include or highlight our products and services on the deck of its mobile handsets;\n\u2022the carrier or OEM's decision to discontinue the sale of some or all of products and services;\n\u2022the carrier\u2019s decision to offer similar products and services to its subscribers without charge or at reduced prices;\n\u2022a failure of the carrier or OEM's merchandising, provisioning or billing systems;\n\u2022the carrier or OEM's decision to offer its own competing products and services;\n\u2022the carrier or OEM's decision to transition to different platforms and revenue models; and\n\u2022consolidation among carriers or OEMs.\nIf any of our carriers or OEMs decides not to market or distribute our products and services or decides to terminate, not renew or modify the terms of its agreement with us or if there is consolidation among carriers generally, we may be unable to replace the affected agreement with acceptable alternatives, causing us to lose access to that carrier\u2019s subscribers and the revenues they afford us, which could materially harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nThe mobile advertising business is an intensely competitive industry and we may not be able to compete successfully.\nThe mobile advertising market is highly competitive, with numerous companies providing mobile advertising services. The Company\u2019s mobile advertising platform will compete primarily with Facebook, Twitter, Snap, and Google, all of which are significantly larger than us and have far more capital to invest in their mobile advertising businesses. The Company will also compete with in-house solutions used by companies who choose to coordinate mobile advertising across their own properties. They, or other companies that offer competing mobile advertising solutions, may establish or strengthen cooperative relationships with their mobile operator partners, application developers or other parties, thereby limiting the Company\u2019s ability to promote its services and generate revenue. Competitors could also seek to gain market share from us by reducing the prices they charge to advertisers or by introducing new technology tools for developers. Moreover, increased competition for mobile advertising space from developers could result in an increase in the portion of advertiser revenue that we must pay to developers to acquire that advertising space. The Company\u2019s business will suffer to the extent that its developers and advertisers purchase and sell mobile advertising directly from each other or through other companies that are able to become intermediaries between developers and advertisers. For example, companies may have substantial existing platforms for developers who had previously not heavily used those platforms for mobile advertising campaigns. These companies could compete with us to the extent they expand into mobile advertising. Other companies, such as large application developers with a substantial mobile advertising business, may decide to directly monetize some or all of their advertising space without utilizing the Company\u2019s services. Other companies that offer analytics, mediation, exchange or other third-party services may also become intermediaries between mobile advertisers and developers and thereby compete with us. Any of these developments would make it more difficult for the Company to sell its services and could result in increased pricing pressure, reduced profit margins, increased sales and marketing expenses or the loss of market share.\nThe mobile advertising market may develop more slowly than expected, which could harm the business of the Company.\nAdvertisers have historically spent a smaller portion of their advertising budgets on mobile media as compared to traditional advertising methods, such as television, newspapers, radio and billboards, or online advertising over the internet, such as placing banner ads on websites. Future demand and market acceptance for mobile advertising is uncertain. Many advertisers still have limited experience with mobile advertising and may continue to devote larger portions of their advertising budgets to more traditional offline or online personal computer-based advertising, instead of shifting additional advertising resources to mobile advertising. If the market for mobile advertising deteriorates, or develops more slowly than we expect, the Company may not be able to increase its revenue.\nThe Company does not control the mobile networks over which it provides its advertising services.\nThe Company\u2019s mobile advertising platform is dependent on the reliability of network operators and carriers who maintain sophisticated and complex mobile networks, as well as its ability to deliver content on those networks at prices that enable it to realize a profit. Mobile networks have been subject to rapid growth and technological change, particularly in recent years. The Company does not control these networks.\nMobile networks could fail for a variety of reasons, including new technology incompatibility, the degradation of network performance under the strain of too many mobile consumers using the network, a general failure from natural disaster or a political or regulatory shut-down. Individuals and groups who develop and deploy viruses, worms and other malicious software programs could also attack mobile networks and the devices that run on those networks. Any actual or perceived security threat to mobile devices or any mobile network could lead existing and potential device users to reduce or refrain from mobile usage or reduce or refrain from responding to the services offered by the Company\u2019s advertising clients. If the network of a mobile operator should fail for any reason, the Company would not be able to effectively provide its services to its clients through that mobile network. This, in turn, could hurt the Company\u2019s reputation and cause it to lose significant revenue.\nMobile carriers may also increase restrictions on the amounts or types of data that can be transmitted over their networks. The Company anticipates generating different amounts of revenue from its advertiser clients based on the content the Company delivers. In most cases, the Company will be paid by advertisers on a CPI basis, when an install of an advertised application occurs. Different types of advertising content consume differing amounts of bandwidth and network capacity. If a network carrier were to restrict the amounts of data that can be delivered on that carrier\u2019s network, or otherwise control the kinds of content that may be downloaded to a device that operates on the network, it could negatively affect the Company\u2019s pricing practices and inhibit its ability to deliver targeted advertising to that carrier\u2019s users, both of which could impair the Company\u2019s ability to generate revenue. Mobile connected device users may choose not to allow advertising on their devices.\nThe success of the Company\u2019s advertising business model will depend on its ability to deliver targeted, highly relevant ads to consumers on their mobile connected devices. Targeted advertising is done primarily through analysis of data, much of which is collected on the basis of user-provided permissions. This data might include a device\u2019s location or data collected when device users view an ad or video or when they click on or otherwise engage with an ad. Users may elect not to allow data sharing for targeted advertising for a number of reasons, such as privacy concerns, or pricing mechanisms that may charge the user based upon the amount or types of data consumed on the device. Users may also elect to opt out of receiving targeted advertising from the Company\u2019s platform. In addition, the designers of mobile device operating systems are increasingly promoting features that allow device users to disable some of the functionality, which may impair or disable the delivery of ads on their devices, and device manufacturers may include these features as part of their standard device specifications. Although we are not aware of any such products that are widely used in the market today, as has occurred in the online advertising industry, companies may develop products that enable users to prevent ads from appearing on their mobile device screens. If any of these developments were to occur, the Company\u2019s ability to deliver effective advertising campaigns on behalf of its advertiser clients would suffer, which could hurt its ability to generate revenue and become profitable.\nThe Company may not be able to enhance its mobile advertising platform to keep pace with technological and market developments.\nThe market for mobile advertising services is characterized by rapid technological change, evolving industry standards and frequent new service introductions. To keep pace with technological developments, satisfy increasing advertiser and developer requirements, maintain the attractiveness and competitiveness of the Company\u2019s mobile advertising solutions and ensure compatibility with evolving industry standards and protocols, the Company will need to regularly enhance its current services and to develop and introduce new services on a timely basis. If the Company\u2019s platform is not attractive to its customers or is not able to compete with alternative mobile advertising solutions, the Company will not have access to as much advertising inventory and may experience increased pressure on margins.\nIn addition, advances in technology that allow developers to generate revenue from their apps without assistance from the Company could harm its relationships with developers and diminish its available advertising inventory within their apps. Similarly, technological developments that allow third parties to better mediate the delivery of ads between advertisers and developers by introducing an intermediate layer between the Company and its developers could impair its relationships with those developers. The Company\u2019s inability, for technological, business or other reasons, to enhance, develop, introduce and deliver compelling mobile advertising services in response to changing market conditions and technologies or evolving expectations of advertisers or mobile device users could hurt its ability to grow its business and could result in its mobile advertising platform becoming obsolete.\nThe Company will depend on publishers, developers and distribution partners for mobile advertising space to deliver its advertiser clients\u2019 advertising campaigns, and any decline in the supply of advertising inventory could hurt its business.\nThe Company will depend on publishers, developers and distribution partners to provide it with space within their applications, which we refer to as \u201cadvertising inventory,\u201d on which the Company will deliver ads. We anticipate that a significant portion of the Company\u2019s revenue will derive from the advertising inventory provided by a limited number of publishers, developers and distribution partners. The Company will have minimum or fixed commitments for advertising inventory with some but not all of its publishers, developers and distribution partners, including certain wireless carriers in the United States and internationally. The Company intends to expand the number of publishers, developers and distribution partners subject to minimum or fixed arrangements. Outside of those relationships however, the publishers, developers and distribution partners that will sell their advertising inventory to the Company are not required to provide any minimum amounts of advertising space to the Company, nor are they contractually bound to provide the Company with a consistent supply of advertising inventory. Such publishers, developers and distribution partners can change the amount of inventory they make available to the Company at any time. They may also change the price at which they offer inventory to the Company, or they may elect to make advertising space available to its competitors who offer ads to them on more favorable economic terms. In addition, publishers, developers and distribution partners may place significant restrictions on the Company\u2019s use of their advertising inventory. These restrictions may prohibit ads from specific advertisers or specific industries, or they could restrict the use of specified creative content or format. They may also use a fee-based or subscription-based business model to generate revenue from their content, in lieu of or to reduce their reliance on ads.\nIf publishers, developers and distribution partners decide not to make advertising inventory available to the Company for any of these reasons, decide to increase the price of inventory, or place significant restrictions on the Company\u2019s use of their advertising space, the Company may not be able to replace this with inventory from others that satisfy the Company\u2019s requirements in a timely and cost-effective manner. If this happens, the Company\u2019s revenue could decline or its cost of acquiring inventory could increase.\nThe Company\u2019s advertising business depends on its ability to collect and use data to deliver applications, and any limitation on the collection and use of this data could significantly diminish the value of the Company\u2019s services and cause it to lose clients and revenue.\nWhen the Company delivers an application to a mobile device, it will often be able to collect anonymous information about the interaction of the mobile device user with the application, such as whether the user opened the application. As the Company collects and aggregates this data provided by billions of ad impressions, it intends to analyze it in order to optimize the placement and scheduling of applications across the advertising inventory provided to it by developers. For example, the Company may use the collected information to provide an application to only certain types of mobile devices, or to provide a report to an advertiser client on the number of its applications that were engaged.\nAlthough the data the Company will collect is not personally identifiable information, its clients might decide not to allow it to collect some or all of this data or might limit its use of this data. For example, application developers may not agree to provide the Company with the data generated by interactions with the content on their applications, or device users may not consent to having information about their device usage provided to the developer. Any limitation on the Company\u2019s ability to collect data about user behavior and interaction with mobile device content could make it more difficult for the Company to deliver effective mobile advertising programs that meet the demands of its advertiser clients.\nAlthough the Company\u2019s contracts with advertisers will generally permit it to aggregate data from advertising campaigns, these clients might nonetheless request that the Company discontinue using data obtained from their campaigns that have already been aggregated with other clients\u2019 campaign data. It would be difficult, if not impossible, to comply with these requests, and responding to these kinds of requests could also cause the Company to spend significant amounts of resources. Interruptions, failures or defects in its data collection, mining, analysis and storage systems, as well as privacy concerns and regulatory restrictions regarding the collection of data, could also limit its ability to aggregate and analyze mobile device user data from its clients\u2019 advertising campaigns. If that happens, the Company may not be able to optimize the placement of advertising for the benefit of its advertiser clients, which could make its services less valuable, and, as a result, it may lose clients and its revenue may decline.\nThe Company\u2019s business depends on its ability to maintain the quality of its advertiser content.\nThe Company must be able to ensure that applications that are placed on devices are not unlawful or inappropriate. If the Company is unable to ensure that the quality of its advertiser content does not decline as the number of advertisers it works with continues to grow, then the Company\u2019s reputation and business may suffer.\nRisks Related to Our Market\nThe markets in which we operate are highly competitive, and many of our competitors have significantly greater resources than we do.\nThe distribution of applications, mobile advertising, development, distribution and sale of mobile products and services is a highly competitive business. We compete for advertisers primarily on the basis of positioning, performance, brand, quality and price. We compete for wireless carriers placement based on these factors, as well as historical performance, technical know-how, perception of sales potential and relationships with advertisers and other intellectual property. We compete for platform deployment contracts among other mobile platform companies. We also compete for experienced and talented employees.\nOur primary competition for application and content distribution comes from the traditional application store businesses of Apple and Google, existing operator solutions built internally, as well as companies providing app install products and services as offered by Facebook, Twitter, Snap, Yahoo, and other ad networks such such as: IronSource, WPP, Omnicom, Criteo, QuinStreet, InMobi, Cheetah Mobile, Baidu, Tremor International, Magnite, Brightcove, Applovin, and others. These companies can be both customers for Digital Turbine products, as well as competitors in certain cases. With our platform, we see some smaller competitors, such as IronSource, Wild Tangent, and Sweet Labs, but the more material competition is internally developed operator solutions and specific mobile application management solutions built in-house by OEMs and wireless operators. Some of our existing wireless operators could make a strategic decision to develop their own solutions rather than continue to use our products.\nSome of our competitors\u2019 and our potential competitors\u2019 advantages over us, either globally or in particular geographic markets, include the following:\n\u2022significantly greater revenues and financial resources;\n\u2022stronger brand and consumer recognition regionally or worldwide;\n\u2022the capacity to leverage their marketing expenditures across a broader portfolio of mobile and non-mobile products;\n\u2022more substantial intellectual property of their own from which they can develop products and services without having to pay royalties;\n\u2022pre-existing relationships with brand owners, advertisers, application developers, or carriers that afford them access to intellectual property while blocking the access of competitors to that same intellectual property;\n\u2022greater resources to make acquisitions;\n\u2022lower labor and development costs; and\n\u2022broader global distribution and presence.\nIf we are unable to compete effectively or we are not as successful as our competitors in our target markets, our sales could decline (or inhibit generation of sales), our margins could decline and we could lose market share (or fail to penetrate the market), any of which would materially harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nEnd user tastes are continually changing and are often unpredictable. If we fail to develop and publish new products and services that achieve market acceptance, our sales would suffer.\nOur business depends in part on deploying new products and services through wireless carriers and OEMs that end users buy. We must continue to invest significant resources in licensing efforts, product development, and regional expansion to enhance our offering of new products and services, and we must make decisions about these matters well in advance of product release in order to implement them in a timely manner. Our success depends, in part, on unpredictable and volatile factors beyond our control, including end-user preferences, competing products and services, and the availability of other entertainment activities. If our products and services are not responsive to the requirements of our advertisers, carriers or the entertainment preferences of end users, or are not brought to market in a timely and effective manner, our business, operating results, and financial condition would be harmed. Even if our products and services are successfully introduced, marketed effectively, and initially adopted, a subsequent shift in our advertisers, carriers, the entertainment, shopping, and mobile preferences of end users, or our relationship with third-party billing aggregators could cause a decline in the popularity of, or access to, our offerings and could materially reduce our revenues and harm our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nWe rely on the current state of the law in certain territories where we operate our business and any adverse change in such laws may significantly adversely impact our revenues and, consequently, our operating results and financial condition.\nDecisions that regulators or governing bodies make with regard to the provision and marketing of mobile applications, content and/or billing can have a significant impact on the revenues generated in that market. Although most of our markets are mature with regulation clearly defined and implemented, there remains the potential for regulatory changes that would have adverse consequences on the business and subsequently our revenue.\nWe rely on our current understanding of regional regulatory requirements pertaining to the marketing, advertising, and promotion of our products and services, and any adverse change in such regulations, or a finding that we did not properly understand such regulations, may significantly impact our ability to market, advertise, and promote our products and services and thereby adversely impact our revenues, our operating results, and our financial condition.\nSome portions of our business rely extensively on marketing, advertising and promoting our products and services requiring it to have an understanding of the local laws and regulations governing our business. Additionally, we rely on the policies and procedures of wireless carriers and should those change, there could be an adverse impact on our products. In the event that we have relied on inaccurate information or advice, and engage in marketing, advertising or promotional activities that are not permitted, we may be subject to penalties, restricted from engaging in further activities or altogether prohibited from offering our products and services in a particular territory, all or any of which will adversely impact our revenues and thus our operating results and financial condition.\nThe strategic direction of the Company's businesses is developing and not completely proven or certain.\nThe business model that the Company is pursuing, mobile advertising and application installations, is in development and not completely proven. There are many different types of models including, but not limited to, set-up fees, CPI, CPP, CPA, up-front fees (including licensing), revenue shares, per device license fees, as well as hybrids of each. Initial feedback from customers shows preference for different types of models. This could lead to risk in predicting future revenues and profits by individual customers. In particular, the \u2018free\u2019 download market is reliant upon mobile advertising, and the mobile advertising market is still in a nascent phase of monetization.\nIn addition, our strategy for the Company entails offering its platform to existing and new customers. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully market new services and offerings to existing and new customers. Moreover, in order to credibly offer our platform, we will need to achieve additional operational and technical achievements to further develop the product offering. Our platform is compatible with Android, and should the market shift to a different operating system there would need to be modifications to our products to adapt to such a change. While we remain optimistic about our ability to complete this change and build out, it will be subject to all of the risks attendant to these development efforts as well as the need to provide additional capital to the effort.\nRisks Relating to Our Industry\nWireless communications technologies are changing rapidly, and we may not be successful in working with these new technologies.\nWireless network and mobile handset technologies are undergoing rapid innovation. New handsets with more advanced processors and advanced programming languages continue to be introduced. In addition, networks that enable enhanced features are being developed and deployed. We have no control over the demand for, or success of, these products or technologies. If we fail to anticipate and adapt to these and other technological changes, the available channels for our products and services may be limited and our market share and operating results may suffer. Our future success will depend on our ability to adapt to rapidly changing technologies and develop products and services to accommodate evolving industry standards with improved performance and reliability. In addition, the widespread adoption of networking or telecommunications technologies or other technological changes could require substantial expenditures to modify or adapt our products and services.\nTechnology changes in the wireless industry require us to anticipate, sometimes years in advance, which technologies we must implement and take advantage of in order to make our products and services, and other mobile entertainment products, competitive in the market. Therefore, we usually start our product development with a range of technical development goals that we hope to be able to achieve. We may not be able to achieve these goals, or our competition may be able to achieve them more quickly and effectively than we can. In either case, our products and services may be technologically inferior to those of our competitors, less appealing to end users, or both. If we cannot achieve our technology goals within our original development schedule, then we may delay their release until these technology goals can be achieved, which may delay or reduce our revenues, increase our development expenses and harm our reputation. Alternatively, we may increase our product development resources in an attempt either to preserve our product launch schedule or to keep up with our competition. In either case, our business, operating results and financial condition could be materially harmed.\nThe complexity of and incompatibilities among mobile handsets may require us to use additional resources for the development of our products and services.\nTo reach large numbers of wireless subscribers, application developers, and wireless carriers, we must support numerous mobile handsets and technologies. However, keeping pace with the rapid innovation of handset technologies together with the continuous introduction of new, and often incompatible, handset models by wireless carriers requires us to make continuous investments in product development and maintenance, including talent, technologies, and equipment. In the future, we may be required to make substantial investments in our development if the number of different types of handset models continues to proliferate. In addition, as more advanced handsets are introduced that enable more complex, feature-rich products and services, we anticipate that our product development and maintenance costs will increase, which could increase the risks associated with one or more of our products or services and could materially harm our operating results and financial condition.\nIf wireless subscribers do not continue to use their mobile handsets to access mobile content and other applications, our business growth and future revenues may be adversely affected.\nWe operate in a developing industry. Our success depends on growth in the number of wireless subscribers who use their handsets to access data services we develop and distribute. New or different mobile content applications developed by our current or future competitors may be preferred by subscribers to our offerings. In addition, other mobile platforms may become widespread, and end users may choose to switch to these platforms. If the market for our products and services does not continue to grow or we are unable to acquire new end users, our business growth and future revenues could be adversely affected. If end users switch their entertainment spending away from the kinds of offerings that we publish, or switch to platforms or distribution where we do not have comparative strengths, our revenues would likely decline and our business, operating results and financial condition would suffer.\nOur industry is subject to risks generally associated with advertising content delivery, any of which could significantly harm our operating results.\nOur business is subject to risks that are generally associated with advertising content delivery, many of which are beyond our control. These risks could negatively impact our operating results and include: the popularity, price and timing of release of our offerings and mobile handsets on which they are accessed; economic conditions that adversely affect discretionary consumer spending; changes in consumer demographics; the availability and popularity of other forms of entertainment; and critical reviews and public tastes and preferences, which may change rapidly and cannot necessarily be predicted.\nA shift of technology platform by wireless carriers and mobile handset manufacturers could lengthen the development period for our offerings, increase our costs, and cause our offerings to be of lower quality or to be published later than anticipated.\nMobile handsets require multimedia capabilities enabled by operating systems capable of running applications, products and services such as ours. Our development resources are concentrated in today\u2019s most popular operating systems, and we have experience developing applications for these operating systems. Specifically, our products are currently compatible with the Android and iOS operating system. If this operating system falls out of favor with handset manufacturers and wireless carriers and there is a rapid shift to a new technology where we do not have development experience or resources, the development period for our products and services may be lengthened, increasing our costs, and the resulting products and services may be of lower quality, and may be published later than anticipated. In such an event, our reputation, business, operating results and financial condition might suffer.\nSystem or network failures could reduce our sales, increase costs, or result in a loss of end users of our products and services.\nMobile application developers rely on wireless carriers\u2019 networks to deliver products and services to end users and on their or other third parties\u2019 billing systems to track and account for the delivery of such offerings. In addition, certain products require access over the mobile Internet to our servers or third-party servers in order to enable certain features. Any failure of, or technical problem with, carriers\u2019, third parties\u2019 or our billing systems, delivery systems, information systems or communications networks could result in the inability of end users to use our products, prevent the completion of a billing transaction, or interfere with access to some aspects of our products. If any of these systems fail or if there is an interruption in the supply of power, an earthquake, fire, flood, epidemic, pandemic, or other natural disaster, or an act of war or terrorism, end users might be unable to access our offerings. For example, from time to time, our carriers have experienced failures with their billing and delivery systems and communication networks, including gateway failures that reduced the provisioning capacity of their branded e-commerce system. Any failure of, or technical problem with, the carriers\u2019, other third parties\u2019 or our systems could cause us to lose end users or revenues or incur substantial repair costs and distract management from operating our business. This, in turn, could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur business depends on the growth and maintenance of wireless communications infrastructure.\nOur success will depend on the continued growth and maintenance of wireless communications infrastructure in the United States and internationally. This includes deployment and maintenance of reliable next-generation digital networks with the speed, data capacity and security necessary to provide reliable wireless communications services. Wireless communications infrastructure may be unable to support the demands placed on it if the number of subscribers continues to increase, or if existing or future subscribers increase their bandwidth requirements. Wireless communications have experienced a variety of outages and other delays as a result of infrastructure and equipment failures, and could face outages and delays in the future. These outages and delays could reduce the level of wireless communications usage as well as our ability to distribute our products and services successfully. In addition, changes by a wireless carrier to network infrastructure may interfere with downloads and may cause end users to lose functionality. This could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nActual or perceived security vulnerabilities in mobile handsets or wireless networks could adversely affect our revenues.\nMaintaining the security of mobile handsets and wireless networks is critical for our business. There are individuals and groups who develop and deploy viruses, worms and other illicit code or malicious software programs that may attack wireless networks and handsets. Security experts have identified computer \u201cworm\u201d programs that target handsets running on certain operating systems. Although these worms have not been widely released and do not present an immediate risk to our business, we believe future threats could lead some end users to seek to reduce or delay future purchases of our products or reduce or delay the use of their handsets. Wireless carriers and handset manufacturers may also increase their expenditures on protecting their wireless networks and mobile phone products from attack, which could delay adoption of new handset models. Any of these activities could adversely affect our revenues and this could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nChanges in government regulation of the media and wireless communications industries may adversely affect our business.\nA number of laws and regulations have been and likely will continue to be adopted in the United States and elsewhere that could restrict the media and wireless communications industries, including laws and regulations regarding customer privacy, taxation, content suitability, copyright, distribution and antitrust. Furthermore, the growth and development of the market for electronic commerce may prompt calls for more stringent consumer protection laws that may impose additional burdens on companies such as ours conducting business through wireless carriers. We anticipate that regulation of our industry will increase and that we will be required to devote legal and other resources to address this regulation. Changes in current laws or regulations or the imposition of new laws and regulations in the United States or elsewhere regarding the media and wireless communications industries may lessen the growth of wireless communications services and may materially reduce our ability to increase or maintain sales of our products and services.\nA number of studies have examined the health effects of mobile phone use, and the results of some of the studies have been interpreted as evidence that mobile phone use causes adverse health effects. The establishment of a link between the use of mobile phone services and health problems, or any media reports suggesting such a link, could increase government regulation of, and reduce demand for, mobile phones and, accordingly, the demand for our products and services, and this could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Our Management, Employees, and Acquisitions\nOur business and growth may suffer if we are unable to hire and retain key talent who are in high demand.\nWe depend on the continued contributions of our domestic and international senior management and other key talent. The loss of the services of any of our executive officers or other key employees could harm our business. Because not all of our executive officers and key employees are under employment agreements or are under agreements with short terms, their future employment with the Company is uncertain. Additionally, our workforce is comprised of a relatively small number of employees operating in different countries around the globe who support our existing and potential customers. Given the size and geographic dispersion of our workforce, we could experience challenges with execution as our business matures and expands.\nOur future success also depends on our ability to identify, attract, and retain highly skilled technical, managerial, financial, marketing, and creative talent. We face intense competition for qualified individuals from numerous technology, marketing, and mobile entertainment companies. Further, we conduct international operations in Germany, Israel, India, South America, Singapore, and Turkey, areas that, similarly to our headquarters region, have high costs of living and consequently high compensation standards and/or intense demand for qualified individuals, which may require us to incur significant costs to attract them. We may be unable to attract and retain suitably qualified individuals who are capable of meeting our growing creative, operational, and managerial requirements, or may be required to pay increased compensation in order to do so. If we are unable to attract and retain the qualified talent we need to succeed, our business would suffer.\nVolatility or lack of performance in our stock price may also affect our ability to attract and retain our key employees. Some of our senior management and other key employees have become, or will soon become, vested in a substantial amount of stock or stock options. Employees may be more likely to leave us if the shares they own or the shares underlying their options have significantly appreciated in value relative to the original purchase prices of the shares or the exercise prices of the options, or if the exercise prices of the options they hold are significantly above the market price of our common stock. If we are unable to retain our employees, our business, operating results, and financial condition would be harmed.\nWe plan to continue to review opportunities and possibly make acquisitions, which could require significant management attention, disrupt our business, result in dilution to our stockholders, and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nAs part of our business strategy, we have made and intend to continue to review opportunities and possibly make acquisitions to add specialized employees and complementary companies, products, technologies, or distribution channels. In some cases, these acquisitions may be substantial and our ability to acquire and integrate such companies in a successful manner will be challenging. We can give you no assurance that any such integration would be successful. The failure to successfully integrate an acquired business could disrupt operations and divert management\u2019s attention, which could have an adverse effect on our business and operations.\nAny acquisitions we announce could be viewed negatively by mobile network operators, users, customers, vendors, marketers, developers, or investors. In addition, we may not successfully evaluate, integrate, or utilize the products, technology, services, operations, or talent we acquire. The integration of acquisitions may require significant time and resources, and we may not manage these integrations successfully. In addition, we may discover liabilities or deficiencies that we did not identify in advance associated with the companies or assets we acquire. The effectiveness of our due diligence with respect to acquisitions, and our ability to evaluate the results of such due diligence, is dependent upon the accuracy and completeness of statements and disclosures made or actions taken by the companies we acquire or their representatives. We may also fail to accurately forecast the financial impact of an acquisition transaction, including accounting charges. In the future, we may not be able to find suitable acquisition candidates, and we may not be able to complete acquisitions on favorable terms, if at all.\nWe may also incur substantial costs in making acquisitions. We may pay substantial amounts of cash or incur debt to pay for acquisitions, which could adversely affect our liquidity. The incurrence of indebtedness would also result in increased fixed obligations and interest expense, and could also include covenants or other restrictions that would impede our ability to manage our operations. Additionally, we may issue equity securities to pay for acquisitions or to retain the employees of the acquired company, which could increase our expenses, adversely affect our financial results, and result in dilution to our stockholders. In addition, acquisitions may result in our recording of substantial goodwill and amortizable intangible assets on our balance sheet upon closing, which could adversely affect our future financial results and financial condition. These factors related to acquisitions may require significant management attention, disrupt our business, result in dilution to our stockholders, and adversely affect our financial results and financial condition.\nThe acquisition of other companies, businesses, or technologies could result in operating difficulties, dilution, and other harmful consequences.\nWe have made acquisitions and we may pursue further acquisitions, any of which could be material to our business, operating results and financial condition. Future acquisitions could divert management\u2019s time and focus from operating our business, even in instances where acquisition negotiations are unsuccessful. In addition, integrating an acquired company, business or technology is risky and may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures. We may also raise additional capital for the acquisition of, or investment in, companies, technologies, products or assets that complement our business. Future acquisitions or dispositions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of our equity securities, including our common stock, or the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities, amortization expenses or acquired in-process research and development expenses, any of which could harm our financial condition and operating results. Future acquisitions may also require us to obtain additional financing, which may not be available on favorable terms or at all.\nInternational acquisitions involve risks related to integration of operations across different cultures and languages, currency risks and the particular economic, political and regulatory risks associated with specific countries.\nIn addition, a significant portion of the purchase price of companies we acquire may be allocated to acquired goodwill and other intangible assets, which must be assessed for impairment at least annually. In the future, if our acquisitions do not yield expected returns, we may be required to take charges to our earnings based on this impairment assessment process, which could harm our operating results.\nAlso, to realize the anticipated benefits of an acquisition, the acquired business must be successfully integrated. The acquired business may not be successfully integrated for a variety of reasons. Failure to successfully integrate the acquired business could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits from the acquisition, which in turn could have an adverse effect on our business, operations, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges to financial accounting standards could make it more expensive to issue stock options to employees, which would increase compensation costs and might cause us to change our business practices.\nWe prepare our financial statements to conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. These accounting principles are subject to interpretation by the FASB, the SEC, and various other bodies. A change in those principles could have a significant effect on our reported results and might affect our reporting of transactions completed before a change is announced. For example, we have used restricted stock and stock options grants as a fundamental component of our employee compensation packages. We believe that such grants directly motivate our employees to maximize long-term stockholder value and, through the use of vesting, encourage employees to remain in our employ. Several regulatory agencies and entities have made regulatory changes that could make it more difficult or expensive for us to grant stock options or restricted stock to employees. We may, as a result of these changes, incur increased compensation costs, change our equity compensation strategy or find it difficult to attract, retain and motivate employees, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nRisks Related to the Economy in the United States and Globally\nThe effects of the past recession in the United States and general downturn in the global economy, including financial market disruptions, could have an adverse impact on our business, operating results, or financial condition.\nOur operating results also may be affected by uncertain or changing economic conditions such as the challenges that are currently affecting economic conditions in the United States and the global economy. If global economic and market conditions, or economic conditions in the United States or other key markets, remain uncertain or persist, spread, or deteriorate further, we may experience material impacts on our business, operating results, and financial condition in a number of ways including negatively affecting our profitability and causing our stock price to decline.\nRisks Related to Potential Liability, Our Intellectual Property, and Our Content\nIf we do not adequately protect our intellectual property rights, it may be possible for third parties to obtain and improperly use our intellectual property and our competitive position may be adversely affected.\nOur intellectual property is an essential element of our business. We rely on a combination of copyright, trademark, trade secret and other intellectual property laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights. To date, we have not obtained patent protection; however, applications have been submitted. Consequently, we may not be able to protect our technologies from independent invention by third parties.\nWe also seek to maintain certain intellectual property as trade secrets. The secrecy could be compromised by outside parties, or by our employees, which could cause us to lose the competitive advantage resulting from these trade secrets.\nWe also face risks associated with our trademarks. For example, there is a risk that our international trademark applications may be considered too generic or that the words \u201cDigital\u201d or \u201cTurbine\u201d could be separately or compositely trademarked by third parties with competitive products who may try and block our applications or sue us for trademark dilution which could have adverse effects on our financial status.\nDespite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise to obtain and use our intellectual property. Monitoring unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult and costly, and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent infringement, piracy, and other unauthorized uses of our intellectual property, particularly internationally where the laws may not protect our intellectual property rights as fully as in the United States. In the future, we may have to resort to litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights, which could result in substantial costs and diversion of our management and resources.\nIn addition, although we require third parties to sign agreements not to disclose or improperly use our intellectual property, it may still be possible for third parties to obtain and improperly use our intellectual properties without our consent. This could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nThird parties may sue us for intellectual property infringement, which, if successful, may disrupt our business and could require us to pay significant damage awards.\nThird parties may sue us for intellectual property infringement or initiate proceedings to invalidate our intellectual property, either of which, if successful, could disrupt the conduct of our business, cause us to pay significant damage awards or require us to pay licensing fees. In the event of a successful claim against us, we might be enjoined from using our licensed intellectual property, we might incur significant licensing fees and we might be forced to develop alternative technologies. Our failure or inability to develop non-infringing technology or software or to license the infringed or similar technology or software on a timely basis could force us to withdraw products and services from the market or prevent us from introducing new products and services. In addition, even if we are able to license the infringed or similar technology or software, license fees could be substantial and the terms of these licenses could be burdensome, which might adversely affect our operating results. We might also incur substantial expenses in defending against third-party infringement claims, regardless of their merit. Successful infringement or licensing claims against us might result in substantial monetary liabilities and might materially disrupt the conduct of our business.\nOur platform contains third-party open source software components, which may pose particular risks to our proprietary software, technologies, and solutions in a manner that could negatively affect our business.\nOur platform contains software modules by third-party authors that are publicly available under \u201copen source\u201d licenses, and we expect to use open source software in the future. Use and distribution of open source software may entail greater risks than use of third-party commercial software, as open source licensors generally do not provide support, warranties, indemnification or other contractual protections regarding infringement claims or the quality of the code. To the extent that our platform depends upon the successful operation of open source software, any undetected errors or defects in this open source software could prevent the deployment or impair the functionality of our platform, delay introductions of new solutions, result in a failure of any of our solutions and injure our reputation. For example, undetected errors or defects in open source software could render it vulnerable to breaches or security attacks, and, in conjunction, make our systems more vulnerable to data breaches. In addition, the public availability of such software may make it easier for others to compromise our platform.\nSome open source licenses contain requirements that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon the type of open source software we use, or grant other licenses to our intellectual property. If we combine our proprietary software with open source software in a certain manner, we could, under certain open source licenses, be required to release the source code of our proprietary software to the public. While our open source polices are meant to prevent such misuse, there can be no assurance that such incidents would not occur. This would allow our competitors to create similar offerings with lower development effort and time and ultimately could result in a loss of our competitive advantages. Alternatively, to avoid the public release of the affected portions of our source code, we could be required to expend substantial time and resources to re-engineer some or all of our software.\nAlthough we monitor our use of open source software to avoid subjecting our platform to conditions we do not intend, there is a risk that these licenses could be construed in a way that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to provide or distribute our solutions. From time to time, there have been claims challenging the ownership of open source software against companies that incorporate open source software into their products or platforms. As a result, we could be subject to lawsuits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software. Moreover, we cannot assure you that our processes for controlling our use of open source software in our platform will be effective. If we are held to have breached or failed to fully comply with all the terms and conditions of an open source software license, we could face infringement or other liability, or be required to seek costly licenses from third parties to continue providing our solutions on terms that are not economically feasible, to re-engineer our solutions, to discontinue or delay the provision of our solutions if re-engineering could not be accomplished on a timely basis or to make generally available, in source code form, our proprietary code, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nLitigation may harm our business.\nSubstantial, complex or extended litigation could cause us to incur significant costs and distract our management. For example, lawsuits by employees, stockholders, collaborators, distributors, customers, vendors, competitors, end-users or others could be very costly and substantially disrupt our business. Disputes from time to time with such companies, organizations or individuals are not uncommon, and we cannot assure you that we will always be able to resolve such disputes or on terms favorable to us. Unexpected results could cause us to have financial exposure in these matters in excess of recorded reserves and insurance coverage, requiring us to provide additional reserves to address these liabilities, therefore impacting profits. Carriers or other customers have and may try to include us as defendants in suits brought against them by their own customers or third parties. In such cases, the risks and expenses would be similar to those where we are the party directly involved in the litigation.\nIndemnity provisions in various agreements potentially expose us to substantial liability for intellectual property infringement, damages caused by malicious software, and other losses.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, most of our agreements with carriers, customers and other distributors include indemnification provisions. In these provisions, we agree to indemnify them for losses suffered or incurred in connection with our products and services, including as a result of intellectual property infringement and damages caused by viruses, worms and other malicious software. The term of these indemnity provisions is generally perpetual after execution of the corresponding license agreement, and the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification provisions is generally unlimited. Large future indemnity payments could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur business in countries with a history of corruption and transactions with foreign governments, including with government-owned or controlled wireless carriers, increases the risks associated with our international activities.\nAs we operate and sell internationally, we are subject to certain economic and trade sanctions laws and regulations, export control and import laws and regulations, including those that are administered by the U.S. Department of Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (\u201cOFAC\u201d), the U.S. Department of State, the U.S. Department of Commerce, the United Nations Security Council and other relevant governmental authorities and the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or the FCPA, and other laws that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and their officials and political parties by the United States and other business entities for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We have operations, deal with carriers, and make sales in countries known to experience corruption, particularly certain emerging countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America, and Asia. Further international expansion may involve more of these countries. Our activities in these countries create the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by one of our employees, consultants, sales agents or distributors that could be in violation of various laws including the FCPA, even though these parties are not always subject to our control. We have attempted to implement safeguards to discourage these practices by our employees, consultants, sales agents and distributors. However, our existing safeguards and any future improvements may prove to be less than effective, and our employees, consultants, sales agents or distributors may engage in conduct for which we might be held responsible. Violations of the FCPA may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, and we may be subject to other liabilities, which could negatively affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nGovernment regulation of our marketing methods could restrict our ability to adequately advertise and promote our content, products, and services available in certain jurisdictions.\nThe governments of some countries have sought to regulate the methods and manner in which certain of our products and services may be marketed to potential end-users. Regulation aimed at prohibiting, limiting or restricting various forms of advertising and promotion we use to market our products and services could also increase our cost of operations or preclude the ability to offer our products and services altogether. As a result, government regulation of our marketing efforts could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nRisks Relating to Our Common Stock and Capital Structure\nThe Company has secured and unsecured indebtedness, which could limit its financial flexibility.\nThe Company\u2019s outstanding secured indebtedness, and its ability to borrow under its $400.0 million revolving credit facility, could have significant negative consequences including:\n\u2022increasing the Company\u2019s vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022limiting the Company\u2019s ability to obtain additional financing;\n\u2022violating a financial covenant, resulting in the indebtedness to be paid back immediately and thus negatively impacting our liquidity;\n\u2022requiring additional financial covenant measurement consents or default waivers without enhanced financial performance in the short term;\n\u2022requiring the use of a substantial portion of any cash flow from operations to service indebtedness, thereby reducing the amount of cash flow available for other purposes, including capital expenditures;\n\u2022limiting the Company\u2019s flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in the Company\u2019s business and the industry in which it competes, including by virtue of the requirement that the Company remain in compliance with certain negative operating covenants included in the credit arrangements under which the Company will be obligated as well as meeting certain reporting requirements; and\n\u2022placing the Company at a possible competitive disadvantage to less leveraged competitors that are larger and may have better access to capital resources.\nOur credit facility also contains a maximum consolidated secured net leverage ratio and minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio. There can be no assurance we will continue to satisfy these ratio covenants. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources-Recent Developments\u201d for a description of these ratio covenants. If we fail to satisfy these covenants, the lender may declare a default, which could lead to acceleration of the debt maturity. Any such default would have a material adverse effect on the Company.\nThe collateral pledged to secure our secured debt, consisting of substantially all of our and our U.S. subsidiaries\u2019 assets, would be available to the secured creditor in a foreclosure, in addition to many other remedies. Accordingly, any adverse change in our ability to service our secured debt could result in an event of default, cross default and foreclosure or forced sale. Depending on the value of the assets, there could be little if any assets available for common stockholders in any foreclosure or forced sale.\nTo service our debt and fund our other capital requirements, we will require a significant amount of cash and our ability to generate cash will depend on many factors beyond our control.\nOn April 29, 2021, we borrowed approximately $107.0 million under our senior revolving credit facility, and on May 25, 2021, we borrowed an additional $130.0 million under our senior revolving credit facility to fund the cash closing payments for the AdColony and Fyber acquisitions. In addition, under the terms of the Share Purchase Agreement for the acquisition of AdColony, we are obligated to pay $100.0 million in cash on or before October 29, 2021 and an earn-out payment estimated between $150.0 million to $175.0 million in cash within 10 days after December 31, 2021. In addition, under the Sale and Purchase Agreement for the acquisition of Fyber, we must pay the tender offer consideration in cash and are obligated to make a potential earn-out payment of up to $50.0 million, which may be paid in shares of our common stock or, under certain circumstances, in cash.\nOur ability to meet our debt service obligations and to fund working capital, capital expenditures, and investments in our business will depend upon our future performance, which will be subject to financial, business, and other factors affecting our operations, many of which are beyond our control, availability of borrowing capacity under our credit facility, and our ability to access the capital markets. For example, this could include general and regional economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, and other factors. We cannot ensure that we will generate cash flow from operations, or that future borrowings or the capital markets will be available, in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debt or to fund our other liquidity needs. We could face substantial liquidity problems and could be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures or to dispose of material assets or operations, seek additional indebtedness or equity capital, or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. We may not be able to effect any such alternative measures on commercially reasonable terms or at all and, even if successful, those alternative actions may not allow us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations.\nThe market price of our common stock is likely to be highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations, and you may be unable to resell your shares at or above the current price.\nThe market price of our common stock is likely to be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a number of factors that are beyond our control, including announcements of new products or services by our competitors. In addition, the market price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors, including:\n\u2022quarterly variations in our revenues and operating expenses;\n\u2022developments in the financial markets, and the worldwide or regional economies;\n\u2022announcements of innovations or new products or services by us or our competitors;\n\u2022significant sales of our common stock or other securities in the open market; and\n\u2022changes in accounting principles.\nIn the past, stockholders have often instituted securities class action litigation after periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities. If a stockholder were to file any such class action suit against us, we would incur substantial legal fees and our management\u2019s attention and resources would be diverted from operating our business to respond to the litigation, which could harm our business.\nIf we fail to comply with the continued listing requirements of the NASDAQ Capital Market, our common stock may be delisted and the price of our common stock and our ability to access the capital markets could be negatively impacted.\nOur common stock is listed for trading on the NASDAQ Capital Market (\u201cNADSAQ\u201d). A de-listing of our common stock from NADSAQ could materially reduce the liquidity of our common stock and result in a corresponding material reduction in the price of our common stock. In addition, de listing could harm our ability to raise capital through alternative financing sources on terms acceptable to us, or at all, and may result in the potential loss of confidence by investors, employees and fewer business development opportunities.\nThe sale of securities by us in any equity or debt financing, or the issuance of new shares related to an acquisition, could result in dilution to our existing stockholders and have a material adverse effect on our earnings.\nAny sale or issuance of common stock by us in a future offering or acquisition could result in dilution to the existing stockholders as a direct result of our issuance of additional shares of our capital stock. In addition, our business strategy may include expansion through internal growth by acquiring complimentary businesses, acquiring or licensing additional brands, or establishing strategic relationships with targeted customers and suppliers. In order to do so, or to finance the cost of our other activities, we may issue additional equity securities that could dilute our stockholders\u2019 stock ownership. We may also assume additional debt and incur impairment losses related to goodwill and other tangible assets if we acquire another company, and this could negatively impact our earnings and results of operations.\nWe may choose to raise additional capital to finance the purchase price of acquisitions or to otherwise accelerate the growth of our business, and we may not be able to raise capital to grow our business on terms acceptable to us or at all.\nShould we choose to pursue alternatives to accelerate the growth or enhance our existing business, we may require significant cash outlays and commitments. If our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments balances and any cash generated from operations are not sufficient to meet our cash requirements, we may seek additional capital, potentially through debt or equity financings, to fund our growth. We may not be able to raise needed cash on terms acceptable to us or at all. Financings, if available, may be on terms that are dilutive or potentially dilutive to our stockholders, and the prices at which new investors would be willing to purchase our securities may be lower than the fair market value of our common stock. The holders of new securities may also receive rights, preferences or privileges that are senior to those of existing holders of our common stock.\nFuture sales of our common stock in the public market could lower the market price of our common stock.\nIn the future, we may sell additional shares of our common stock or securities convertible into our common stock to raise capital. In addition, under the terms of the Share Purchase Agreement for the acquisition of AdColony, we must pay $100.0 million in cash on or before October 29, 2021 and an earn-out payment estimated between $150.0 million to $175.0 million in cash following December 31, 2021, and we may need to raise funds in the capital markets to fund such cash payment obligations. Also, under the terms of the Sale and Purchase Agreement for the acquisition of Fyber, we issued 3,216,935 newly-issued shares of our common stock equal in value to $235.0 million and will issue 2,599,653 newly-issued shares of our common stock equal in value to $165.0 million in June 2021, and may have to make an earn-out payment of up to $50.0 million in shares of our common stock or, under certain circumstances, cash. In addition, a substantial number of shares of our common stock is reserved for issuance upon the exercise of stock options, and the vesting of restricted stock units and restricted stock. We cannot predict the size of future issuances or the effect, if any, that they may have on the market price for our common stock. The issuance and sale of substantial amounts of common stock, or the perception that such issuances and sales may occur, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or if they downgrade their recommendations regarding our common stock, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about our business or us. If any of the analysts who cover us downgrade our common stock, our common stock price would likely decline. If analysts cease coverage of the Company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our common stock price or trading volume to decline.\nWe do not anticipate paying dividends.\nOur secured and unsecured indebtedness essentially prevents all payments of dividends to our stockholders. Even if such dividends were permitted by the applicable lenders, we have never paid cash or other dividends on our common stock. Payment of dividends on our common stock is within the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon our earnings, our capital requirements and financial condition, and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors. However, the earliest our Board of Directors would likely consider a dividend is if we begin to generate excess cash flow.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we might not be able to report our financial results accurately or prevent fraud. In that case, our stockholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting, which could negatively impact the price of our stock.\nEffective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and prevent fraud. In addition, Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, requires us to evaluate and report on our internal control over financial reporting. Management concluded that our internal controls over financial reporting were effective as of March 31, 2021; refer to Item 9A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information about management\u2019s assessment of internal controls. We cannot be certain that measures taken by the Company will continue to ensure that we implement and maintain adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future. Even if we are able to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting provides reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect fraud or misstatements. Failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation, could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. If we discover material weaknesses in our internal controls, the disclosure of that fact, even if quickly remedied, could reduce the market\u2019s confidence in our financial statements and harm our stock price. In addition, if we fail to comply with the applicable portions of Section 404, we could be subject to a variety of civil and administrative sanctions and penalties, including ineligibility for short form resale registration, action by the SEC, and the inability of registered broker-dealers to make a market in our common stock.\nMaintaining and improving our financial controls and the requirements of being a public company may strain our resources, divert management\u2019s attention, and affect our ability to attract and retain qualified members for our Board of Directors.\nAs a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Additionally, the time and effort required to maintain communications with stockholders and the public markets can be demanding on senior management, which can divert focus from operational and strategic efforts. The requirements of the public markets and the related regulatory requirements has resulted in an increase in our legal, accounting and financial compliance costs, may make some activities more difficult, time-consuming and costly and may place undue strain on our talent, systems, and resources.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. This can be difficult to do. For example, we depend on the reports of wireless carriers for information regarding the amount of sales of our products and services and to determine the amount of royalties we owe branded content licensors and the amount of our revenues. These reports may not be timely, and in the past they have contained, and in the future they may contain, errors.\nIn order to maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, we expend significant resources and provide significant management oversight. We have a substantial effort ahead of us to implement appropriate processes, document our system of internal control over relevant processes, assess their design, remediate any deficiencies identified and test their operation. As a result, management\u2019s attention may be diverted from other business concerns, which could harm our business, operating results and financial condition. These efforts will also involve substantial accounting-related costs.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act makes it more difficult and more expensive for us to maintain directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance, and we may be required in the future to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to maintain coverage. If we are unable to maintain adequate directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 insurance, our ability to recruit and retain qualified directors, and officers will be significantly curtailed.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of our company more difficult, limit attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management, and limit the market price of our common stock.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of preventing a change of control or changes in our management. Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws include provisions that:\n\u2022authorize our board of directors to issue, without further action by the stockholders, shares of undesignated preferred stock with terms, rights, and preferences determined by our board of directors that may be senior to our common stock;\n\u2022specify that special meetings of our stockholders can be called only by our board of directors, the chairperson of our board of directors, our chief executive officer, or our president, or holders of a majority of our outstanding common stock;\n\u2022establish an advance notice procedure for stockholder proposals to be brought before an annual meeting, including proposed nominations of persons for election to our board of directors;\n\u2022prohibit cumulative voting in the election of directors.\nIn addition, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which generally, subject to certain exceptions, prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any of a broad range of business combinations with any \u201cinterested\u201d stockholder for a period of three years following the date on which the stockholder became an \u201cinterested\u201d stockholder. Any of the foregoing provisions could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock, and they could deter potential acquirers of our company, thereby reducing the likelihood that you would receive a premium for your shares of our common stock in an acquisition.\nOur bylaws designate the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the exclusive forum for certain disputes between us and our stockholders.\nOur bylaws provide that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the sole and exclusive forum for the following types of actions or proceedings under Delaware statutory or common law: (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf; (ii) any action or proceeding asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our current or former directors, officers, or other employees to us or our stockholders; (iii) any action or proceeding asserting a claim arising out of or pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law; and (iv) any action or proceeding asserting a claim that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine, in all cases to the fullest extent permitted by law. These choice of forum provisions may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or other employees.",

Its on-device media platform powers frictionless application and content discovery, user acquisition and engagement, operational efficiency, and monetization opportunities. Through March 31, 2021, Digital Turbine's technology platform has been adopted by over 35 mobile operators and device original equipment manufacturers (\"OEMs\") and has delivered more than 5.3 billion application preloads for tens of thousands of advertising campaigns. The Company operates this business as one operating and reportable segment - Media Distribution, which was previously referred to as the operating segment O&O (which refers to operators and OEMs) and the reportable segment Advertising.\nAs the Company's suite of product offerings expands, both organically and through acquisitions, we believe that this renaming of our reporting and operating segment better reflects the way management views the business. There are no changes or historical differences to product offerings and financial information that were referred to as the Advertising segment in prior periods. While advertising, in general, remains a focus of our Media Distribution segment, we feel that this change in name more accurately conveys to the reader what we do for our customers and partners.\nThe Company's Media Distribution business consists of products and services that simplify the discovery and delivery of mobile applications and content media for consumers.\n\u2022Application Media represents the portion of the business where our platform delivers apps to end users through partnerships with carrier networks and OEMs. Application Media optimizes revenues by using developed technology to streamline, track, and manage app install demand from hundreds of application developers across various publishers, carriers, OEMs, and devices.\n\u2022Content Media represents the portion of the business where our platform presents news, weather, sports, and other content directly within the native device experience (e.g., as the start page in the mobile browser, a widget, on unlock, etc.) through partnerships with carrier networks and OEMs. Content Media optimizes revenue by a combination of:\n\u25e6Programmatic Ad Partner Revenue - advertising within the content media that\u2019s sold on an ad exchange at a market rate (CPM - Cost Per Thousand);\n\u25e6Sponsored Content - sponsored content media from 3rd party content providers, presented similarly to an ad, that is monetized when a recommended story is viewed (CPC - Cost Per Click);\n\u25e6Editorial Content - owned or licensed media, presented similarly to an ad, that is monetized when the media is clicked on (CPC - Cost Per Click).\nWith global headquarters in Austin, Texas and offices in Durham, North Carolina; San Francisco, California; Arlington, Virginia; S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil; Mexico City, Mexico; Mumbai, India; Singapore; and Tel Aviv, Israel, Digital Turbine\u2019s solutions are available worldwide. For additional information, please visit www.digitalturbine.com.\nAll dollar amounts are in thousands, except per share amounts.\nRecent Acquisitions\nThe Company recently completed the below-described acquisitions of Appreciate, AdColony, and Fyber in order to help execute on its expressed strategy of becoming a leading end-to-end solution for mobile brand acquisition, advertising, and monetization.\nAppreciate. On March 1, 2021, DT EMEA entered into a Share Purchase Agreement with Triapodi Ltd., an Israeli company (d/b/a Appreciate), the stockholder representative, and the stockholders of Appreciate pursuant to which DT EMEA acquired, on March 2, 2021, all of the outstanding capital stock of Appreciate in exchange for total consideration of $20,003 in cash. In connection with the acquisition, under the terms of the Purchase Agreement, DT EMEA entered into bonus arrangements to pay up to $6,000 in retention bonuses and performance bonuses to the founders and certain other employees of Appreciate. Appreciate is a programmatic mobile advertising demand-side platform (\"DSP\") company headquartered in Israel. Appreciate\u2019s platform collaborates closely with mobile measurement partners (\u201cMMPs\u201d), exchanges, advertisers, and other partners to programmatically provide a transparent ecosystem designed to optimize user acquisition and ROI for the mobile advertisers utilizing its platform. Deploying Appreciate's technology expertise across Digital Turbine\u2019s global scale and reach should further benefit partners and advertisers that are a part of the combined Company\u2019s platform.\nAdColony Holding AS. On April 29, 2021, DT Media completed the acquisition of AdColony Holding AS, a Norway company (\u201cAdColony\u201d), pursuant to a Share Purchase Agreement with AdColony and Otello Corporation ASA, a Norway company and the sole shareholder of AdColony (\u201cOtello\u201d). DT Media acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of AdColony in exchange for an estimated total consideration in the range of $350,000 to $375,000, to be paid as follows: (1) $100,000 in cash paid at closing (which was subject to customary closing purchase price adjustments), (2) $100,000 in cash to be paid six months after closing, and (3) an estimated earn-out in the range of $150,000 to $175,000, to be paid in cash, based on AdColony achieving certain future target net revenues, less associated cost of goods sold, over a twelve-month period ending on December 31, 2021 (the \u201cEarn-Out Period\u201d). Under the terms of the earn-out, DT Media would pay Otello a certain percentage of actual net revenues (less associated cost of goods sold) of AdColony depending on the extent to which AdColony achieves certain target net revenues (less associated cost of goods sold) over the Earn-Out Period. The earn-out payment will be made following the expiration of the Earn-Out Period. The Company paid the closing amount and intends to pay the remainder of the purchase price with a combination of available cash on hand and borrowings under its existing senior credit facility along with future capital financing. AdColony is a leading mobile advertising platform servicing advertisers and publishers with a reach of more than 1.5 billion monthly global users. AdColony\u2019s proprietary video technologies and rich media formats are widely viewed as a best-in-class technology delivering third-party verified viewability rates for well-known global brands.\nFyber, N.V. On May 25, 2021, the Company and DT Media completed the initial closing of the acquisition of 523,553,108 shares, representing approximately 95.1% of the outstanding voting shares (the \u201cMajority Fyber Shares\u201d) of Fyber N.V., a public limited liability company registered with the Netherlands Chamber of Commerce Business Register (\u201cFyber\u201d), pursuant to a Sale and Purchase Agreement between Tennor Holding B.V., Advert Finance B.V., and Lars Windhorst (collectively, the \u201cSeller\u201d), the Company, and DT Luxembourg. The Seller transferred and delivered 400,000,000 shares of the Majority Fyber Shares to DT Media on the closing date and will deliver the remaining 123,553,108 shares of the Majority Fyber Shares to DT Media in June 2021. The remaining approximately 4.9% of the shares in Fyber (the \u201cMinority Fyber Shares\u201d) are widely held by other shareholders of Fyber (the \u201cMinority Fyber Shareholders\u201d).\nDT Media acquired the Majority Fyber Shares in exchange for an estimated aggregate consideration of up to $600,000, consisting of (i) $150,000 in cash, which was subject to adjustments for certain items including the amount of cash consideration to be paid to the Minority Fyber Shareholders for the Minority Fyber Shares, paid at the closing of the acquisition, (ii) 3,216,935 newly issued shares of common stock of the Company equal in value to $235,000 (based on the volume-weighted average price of the common stock on NASDAQ during the 30-day period prior to the closing date), issued at the closing of the acquisition, (iii) 2,599,653 newly issued shares of common stock of the Company equal in value to $165,000 (based on the volume-weighted average price of the common stock on NASDAQ during the 30-day period prior to the closing date), to be issued in June 2021 after the receipt by the Company of a tax exemption certificate from the Israel Tax Authority, and (iv) contingent upon Fyber\u2019s net revenues being equal or higher than $100,000 for the 12-month earn-out period ending on March 31, 2022, as determined in the manner set forth in the Sale and Purchase Agreement, a certain number of shares of Company common stock, which will be newly-issued to the Seller at the end of the earn-out period, and under certain circumstances, an amount of cash, which value of such shares and cash in aggregate will not exceed $50,000 (subject to set-off against certain potential indemnification claims against the Seller). The Company paid the cash closing amount on the closing date, and intends to pay the remainder of the cash consideration for the acquisition with a combination of available cash on hand, borrowings under the Company\u2019s senior credit facility, and proceeds from future capital financings.\nFyber is a leading mobile advertising monetization platform empowering global app developers to optimize profitability through quality advertising. Fyber\u2019s proprietary technology platform and expertise in mediation, real-time bidding, advanced analytics tools, and video combine to deliver publishers and advertisers a highly valuable app monetization solution.\nPursuant to certain German law on public takeovers, following the closing, the Company is obligated to make a public tender offer to the Minority Fyber Shareholders to acquire from them the Minority Fyber Shares. The tender offer will be subject to certain minimum price rules under German law. The timing and the conditions of the tender offer, including the consideration offered to the Minority Fyber Shareholders in connection with the tender offer, will be subsequently determined by the Company pursuant to the applicable Dutch and German takeover laws. The Company anticipates completing the tender offer during the second fiscal quarter 2022.\nOther Recent Developments\nFebruary 2021 Credit Facility. On February 3, 2021, the Company entered into a credit agreement (\"the BoA Credit Agreement') with Bank of America, N.A. (the \u201cBank\u201d), which provides for a revolving line of credit of $100,000, with an accordion feature enabling the Company to increase the amount to up to $200,000, to be used for acquisitions, working capital, and general corporate purposes. DT Media and DT USA are additional co-borrowers under the BoA Credit Agreement.\nThe revolving line of credit matures on February 3, 2024.\nIn connection with the Company entering into the BoA Credit Agreement with the Bank as described above, on February 3, 2021, the Company and Western Alliance Bank terminated the Credit Agreement, dated February 28, 2020, by and among the Company, DT Media, DT USA, and Western Alliance Bank (and the amendments thereto), which was the previous term loan and revolving credit facility of the Company.\nAmounts outstanding under the BoA Credit Agreement accrue interest at an annual rate equal to LIBOR (or, if necessary, a broadly-adopted replacement index) plus an applicable margin that ranges from 1.50% to 2.25%, depending on the Company\u2019s consolidated leverage ratio. The obligations under the BoA Credit Agreement are secured by a grant of a security interest in substantially all of the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries. The BoA Credit Agreement contains customary covenants, representations, and events of default, and also requires the Company to comply with a maximum consolidated leverage ratio and minimum fixed charge coverage ratio.\nAt March 31, 2021, there was $15,000 outstanding principal on the BoA Credit Agreement and the Company had $85,000 available to draw.\nApril 2021 Credit Facility. Subsequent to year end, on April 29, 2021, the Company entered into an amended and restated Credit Agreement (the \u201cNew Credit Agreement\u201d) with Bank of America, N.A., as a lender and administrative agent, and a syndicate of lenders, which provides for a revolving line of credit of $400,000 to be used for working capital, permitted acquisitions, capital expenditures, and other lawful corporate purposes. DT Media and DT USA are additional co-borrowers under the Credit Agreement, and Mobile Posse is a guarantor (together with the Company, DT Media and DT USA, collectively, the \u201cLoan Parties\u201d). This modification replaced the existing BoA Credit Agreement. The New Credit Agreement contains an accordion feature that permits an increase of the revolver by up to $75,000 plus an amount that would enable the Loan Parties to remain in compliance with a consolidated secured net leverage ratio, on such terms as agreed to by the parties.\nThe revolving line of credit matures on April 29, 2026.\nAmounts outstanding under the Credit Agreement accrue interest at an annual rate equal to, at the Company\u2019s election, (i) LIBOR plus between 1.50% and 2.25% based on the Company\u2019s consolidated leverage ratio or (ii) a base rate determined based upon the highest of (a) the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, (b) Bank of America, N.A.\u2019s prime rate or (c) LIBOR plus 1.00%, plus between 0.50% and 1.25% based on the Company\u2019s consolidated leverage ratio. The Credit Agreement contains customary covenants, representations and events of default, and also requires the Company to comply with a maximum consolidated secured net leverage ratio and minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio.\nThe Loan Parties\u2019 payment and performance obligations under the New Credit Agreement and related loan documents are secured by their grant of a security interest in substantially all of their personal property assets, whether now existing or hereafter acquired, subject to certain exclusions. If the Loan Parties acquire any real property assets with a fair market value in excess of $5,000, they are required to grant a security interest in such real property as well. All such security interests are required to be first priority security interests, subject to certain permitted liens.\nMedia Distribution Business\nThe Company's Media Distribution business is an advertiser solution for unique and exclusive carrier and OEM inventory, which is comprised of first boot and recurring life-cycle products, features, and professional services delivered through our platform.\nOur software platform enables mobile operators and OEMs to control, manage, and monetize devices through application installation at the time of activation and over the life of a device. The platform allows mobile operators to personalize the application activation experience for customers and monetize their home screens via revenue-share agreements such as: Cost-Per-Install (CPI), Cost-Per-Placement (CPP), and Cost-Per-Action (CPA) with third-party advertisers; or via Per-Device-License Fees (PDL) agreements, which allow operators and OEMs to leverage the platform, its products, and other features for a structured fee. Setup Wizard, Dynamic Installs, or Software Development Kit (\"SDK\") are the delivery methods available to operators and OEMs on first boot of the device. Additional products and features are available throughout the life-cycle of the device that provide operators and OEMs additional opportunity for media delivery revenue streams. The Company has launched its software with operators and OEMs in North America, Latin America, Europe, Israel, and Asia-Pacific.\nThe acquisition of Mobile Posse provides an additional platform option, outside of our core platform, to monetize user actions over the life-cycle of a device by delivering media-rich advertising content to the end user and providing operators and OEMs with an additional opportunity for revenue streams synergistic with our core platform.\nThe Company's Media Distribution business consists of products and services that simplify the discovery and delivery of mobile applications and content media for consumers.\n\u2022Application Media represents the portion of the business where our platform delivers apps to end users through partnerships with carrier networks and OEMs. Application Media optimizes revenues by using developed technology to streamline, track, and manage app install demand from hundreds of application developers across various publishers, carriers, OEMs, and devices.\n\u2022Content Media represents the portion of the business where our platform presents news, weather, sports, and other content directly within the native device experience (e.g., as the start page in the mobile browser, a widget, on unlock, etc.) through partnerships with carrier networks and OEMs. Content Media optimizes revenue by a combination of:\n\u25e6Programmatic Ad Partner Revenue - advertising within the content media that\u2019s sold on an ad exchange at a market rate (CPM - Cost Per Thousand);\n\u25e6Sponsored Content - sponsored content media from 3rd party content providers, presented similarly to an ad, that is monetized when a recommended story is viewed (CPC - Cost Per Click);\n\u25e6Editorial Content - owned or licensed media, presented similarly to an ad, that is monetized when the media is clicked on (CPC - Cost Per Click).\nImpact of COVID-19 on the Business\nOur results of operations are affected by economic conditions, including macroeconomic conditions, levels of business confidence, and consumer confidence. There is some uncertainty regarding the extent to which COVID-19 will impact our business and the demand for our service offerings. The extent to which COVID-19 impacts our operational and financial performance will depend on the impact to carriers and OEMs in relation to their sales of smartphones, tablets, and other devices. If COVID-19 continues to have a significant negative impact on global economic conditions over a prolonged period of time, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted. Presently, we are conducting business as usual, with some modifications to employee travel, employee work locations, and cancellation of certain marketing events, among other modifications. We will continue to actively monitor the situation and may take further actions that alter our business operations, as required or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, partners, suppliers, and stockholders.\nDisposition of the Content Reportable Segment and A&P Business\nOn April 29, 2018, the Company entered into two distinct disposition agreements with respect to select assets owned by our subsidiaries.\nDT APAC and DT Singapore (together, \u201cPay Seller\u201d), each wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company, entered into an Asset Purchase Pay Agreement (the \u201cPay Agreement\u201d), dated April 23, 2018, with Chargewave Ptd Ltd (\u201cPay Purchaser\u201d) to sell certain assets (the \u201cPay Assets\u201d) owned by the Pay Seller related to the Company\u2019s Direct Carrier Billing business. The Pay Purchaser is principally owned and controlled by Jon Mooney, an officer of the Pay Seller. At the closing of the asset sale, Mr. Mooney was no longer employed by the Company or Pay Seller. As consideration for this asset sale, Digital Turbine is entitled to receive certain license fees, profit-sharing, and equity participation rights as outlined in the Company\u2019s Form 8-K filed on May 1, 2018 with the SEC. The transaction was completed on July 1, 2018 with an effective date of July 1, 2018. With the sale of these assets, the Company exited the reporting segment of the business previously referred to as the Content business.\nDT Media, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the \u201cA&P Agreement\u201d), dated April 28, 2018, with Creative Clicks B.V. (the \u201cA&P Purchaser\u201d) to sell business relationships with various advertisers and publishers (the \u201cA&P Assets\u201d) related to the Company\u2019s Advertising and Publishing business. As consideration for this asset sale, we are entitled to receive a percentage of the gross profit, as defined by the A&P Agreement, derived from these customer agreements for a period of three years, as outlined in the Company\u2019s Form 8-K filed on May 1, 2018 with the SEC. The transaction was completed on June 28, 2018 with an effective date of June 1, 2018. With the sale of these assets, the Company exited the operating segment of the business previously referred to as the A&P business, which was previously part of the Advertising segment, the Company's sole reporting segment (which is now Media Distribution).\nThese dispositions have allowed the Company to benefit from a streamlined business model, simplified operating structure, and enhanced management focus.\nDiscontinued Operations\nAs a result of the dispositions, the results of operations from our Content reporting segment and A&P business within the Media Distribution reporting segment, previously referred to as the Advertising segment, are reported as \u201cLoss from discontinued operations, net of taxes\u201d and the related assets and liabilities are classified as \u201cheld for disposal\" on the prior comparative period Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report. The Company has recast prior period amounts presented within this report to provide visibility and comparability.\nResults of Operations\nAll discussions in this Item 7, Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, unless otherwise noted, relate to the remaining continuing operations in our sole operating segment after the dispositions, the Media Distribution business.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nBelow are our revenues, costs of revenues, and expenses for fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019.

Our application delivery and management software enables operators and OEMs to control, manage, and monetize applications installed at the time of activation and over the life of a device. The increase in net revenues of $83,549 related to our Application Media business was attributable to increased demand for our core services, and expanded platform offerings, which led to higher CPI and CPP revenue per available placement. Of this increase in Application Media revenue, approximately $59,900 is related to increases in demand for our core services, and approximately $23,649 is related to new and expanded platform offerings. The increase in net revenues of $91,315 related to our Content Media business, primarily from the acquisition of Mobile Posse, is a function of a full year of contribution in the current fiscal year, as opposed to one month of contribution in the previous fiscal year, as well as post acquisition technology synergies driving expansion across the existing Digital Turbine partner base.\nWith respect to customer revenue concentration, the Company defines a customer as an advertiser or a carrier that is a distinct source of revenue and is legally bound to pay for the services that the Company delivers on the advertiser\u2019s or carrier's behalf. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, no single customer represented more than 10% of net revenues. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, one major customer, Oath Inc., a subsidiary of Verizon Communications, represented 15.3% of net revenues.\nWith respect to partner revenue concentration, the Company partners with mobile carriers and OEMs to deliver applications on our platform through the carrier network. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, T-Mobile US Inc., including Sprint and other subsidiaries, a carrier partner, generated 26.4%, AT&T Inc., including its Cricket subsidiary, a carrier partner, generated 22.3%, Verizon Wireless, a subsidiary of Verizon Communications, a carrier partner, generated 18.5%, and America Movil, primarily through its subsidiary Tracfone Wireless Inc., a carrier partner, generated 10.8% of our net revenues. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, Verizon Wireless, a subsidiary of Verizon Communications, a carrier partner, generated 37.3%, AT&T Inc., including its Cricket subsidiary, a carrier partner, generated 30.0%, and America Movil, primarily through its subsidiary Tracfone Wireless Inc., a carrier partner, generated 10.7% of our net revenues.\nA reduction or delay in operating activity from these customers or partners, or a delay or default in payment by these customers, or a termination of the Company's agreements with these customers, could materially harm the Company\u2019s business and prospects. The Company is not aware of any material changes to these relationships, or material reductions or delays in operating activity with these customers or partners.\nFiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2020, revenues increased $35,146, or 33.9%, compared to the prior year.\nThe Company's Media Distribution business is an advertiser solution for unique and exclusive carrier and OEM inventory. During the years ended March 31, 2020 and 2019, the Media Distribution business, primarily through silent application delivery, was the main driver of our revenues. Our application delivery and management software enables operators and OEMs to control, manage, and monetize applications installed at the time of activation and over the life of a device. The increase in net revenues of $35,146 was primarily attributable to increased demand for our platform offerings, which led to higher CPI and CPP revenue per available placement. Of this increase, approximately $30,329 is related to organic increases in demand for our platform services, and approximately $4,817 is related to revenue contributions from the acquisition of Mobile Posse.\nWith respect to customer revenue concentration, during the year ended March 31, 2020, one major customer, Oath Inc., a subsidiary of Verizon Communications, represented 15.3% of net revenues. During the year ended March 31, 2019, one major customer, Oath Inc., a subsidiary of Verizon Communications, represented 28.6% of net revenues.\nWith respect to partner revenue concentration, the Company partners with mobile carriers and OEMs to deliver applications on our platform through the carrier network. During the years ended March 31, 2020 and 2019, Verizon Wireless, a subsidiary of Verizon Communications, a carrier partner, generated 37.3% and 45.9%, respectively, while AT&T Inc., a carrier partner, including its Cricket subsidiary, generated 30.0% and 38.7%, respectively, of our net revenues. Additionally, during the year ended March 31, 2020, America Movil, primarily through its subsidiary Tracfone Wireless Inc., generated 10.7% of our net revenues.\nCosts of revenues and operating expenses\nYear ended March 31, Year ended March 31,\n2021 2020 % of Change 2020 2019 % of Change\n(in thousands) (in thousands)\nLicense fees and revenue share $ 178,649 $ 83,588 113.7 % $ 83,588 $ 65,981 26.7 %\nOther direct costs of revenues 2,358 1,454 62.2 % 1,454 2,023 (28.1) %\nProduct development 20,119 12,018 67.4 % 12,018 10,876 10.5 %\nSales and marketing 19,304 11,244 71.7 % 11,244 8,212 36.9 %\nGeneral and administrative 33,940 17,199 97.3 % 17,199 13,032 32.0 %\nTotal costs of revenues and operating expenses $ 254,370 $ 125,503 102.7 % $ 125,503 $ 100,124 25.3 %\nFiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020\nTotal costs of revenues and operating expenses for the years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020 were approximately $254,370 and $125,503, respectively, representing a year-over-year increase of approximately $128,867 or 102.7%. This change is a result of continued growth including the acquisitions of Mobile Posse and Appreciate. Company-wide cost control measures show the Company's ability to scale revenues at a greater rate than operating expenses.\nLicense fees and revenue share is reflective of amounts paid to our carrier and OEM partners who drive the revenues generated from advertising via direct CPI, CPP, or CPA arrangements with application developers, or indirect arrangements through advertising aggregators (ad networks) are shared with the carrier and the shared revenue is recorded as a cost of revenue. In each case the revenue share with the carrier varies depending on the agreement with the carrier, and, in some cases, is based upon revenue tiers. License fees and revenue share for the years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020 were approximately $178,649 and $83,588, respectively, representing a year-over-year increase of approximately $95,061 or 113.7%. The increase in these costs of revenues over the comparative period was primarily attributable to the increase in revenues over the same period, as these costs are paid as a percentage of revenues. License fees and revenue share, as a percent of revenue, for the years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020 were approximately 57% and 60%, respectively.\nOther direct costs of revenues are comprised primarily of hosting expense directly related to the generation of revenues, and depreciation expense accounted for under ASC 985-20, Costs of Software to be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise Marketed. Other direct costs of revenues for the years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020 were approximately $2,358 and $1,454, respectively, representing a year-over-year increase of approximately $904 or 62.2%.\nProduct development expenses include the development and maintenance of the Company's product suite. Expenses in this area are primarily a function of talent. Product development expenses for the years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020 were approximately $20,119 and $12,018, respectively, representing a year-over-year increase of approximately $8,101 or 67.4%. The increase in product development expenses over the comparative period was primarily attributable to increased product development headcount, both organic and through the acquisitions of Mobile Posse and Appreciate, and other employee-related and third-party development-related costs as the Company continues to scale its product development organization to support the Company's growth.\nSales and marketing expenses represent the costs of sales and marketing talent, advertising and marketing campaigns, and campaign management. Sales and marketing expenses for the years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020 were approximately $19,304 and $11,244, respectively, representing a year-over-year increase of approximately $8,060 or 71.7%. The increase in sales and marketing expenses over the comparative period was primarily attributable to the addition of new talent in existing markets related to the Company's continued expansion of its global footprint and increased commissions associated with the sales team generating more revenue through new and existing advertising relationships and markets.\nGeneral and administrative expenses represent management, finance, and support talent costs in both the parent and subsidiary companies, which include professional and consulting costs, in addition to other costs such as rent, stock-based compensation, and depreciation expense. General and administrative expenses for the years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020 were approximately $33,940 and $17,199, respectively, representing a year-over-year increase of approximately $16,741 or 97.3%. The increase over the comparative period is primarily attributable to employee-related expenses as a function of higher headcount, increased stock option expense, increases in depreciation and amortization related to capitalized internal-use software and intangible assets, and expenses incurred for the acquisitions of Mobile Posse and Appreciate.\nFiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019\nTotal operating expenses for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2020 and 2019 were approximately $125,503 and $100,124, respectively, representing a year-over-year increase of approximately $25,379 or 25.3%.

The increase in these costs of revenues over the comparative period was primarily attributable to the increase in revenues over the same period, as these costs are paid as a percentage of revenues. License fees and revenue share, as a percent of revenue, for the years ended March 31, 2020 and 2019 were approximately 60% and 64%, respectively.\nOther direct costs of revenues are comprised primarily of hosting expense directly related to the generation of revenues, and depreciation expense accounted for under ASC 985-20, Costs of Software to be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise Marketed. Other direct costs of revenues for the years ended March 31, 2020 and 2019 were approximately $1,454 and $2,023, respectively, representing a year-over-year decrease of approximately $569 or 28.1%.\nProduct development expenses for the years ended March 31, 2020 and 2019 were approximately $12,018 and $10,876, respectively, representing a year-over-year increase of approximately $1,142 or 10.5%. The increase in costs over the comparative period is primarily a function of talent hired during fiscal year 2020 and hosting expenses associated with development activity.\nSales and marketing expenses for the years ended March 31, 2020 and 2019 were approximately $11,244 and $8,212, respectively, representing a year-over-year increase of approximately $3,032 or 36.9%. The increase in sales and marketing expenses over the comparative period is primarily attributable to increased travel expenses for existing talent, the addition of new talent in existing markets related to the Company's continued expansion of its global footprint, and increased commissions associated with the sales team generating more revenue through new and existing advertising relationships and markets.\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the years ended March 31, 2020 and 2019 were approximately $17,199 and $13,032, respectively, representing a year-over-year increase of approximately $4,167 or 32.0%. The increase over the comparative period is primarily attributable to employee-related expenses as a function of higher headcount, increased stock option expense, increase in depreciation and amortization related to capitalized internal-use software, and expenses incurred for the acquisition of Mobile Posse.\nInterest and other income / (expense), net\nYear ended March 31, Year ended March 31,\n2021 2020 % of Change 2020 2019 % of Change\n(in thousands) (in thousands)\nChange in estimated contingent consideration $ (15,751) $ - (100.0) % $ - $ - - %\nInterest income / (expense) (1,003) 41 (2,546.3) % 41 (1,120) 103.7 %\nForeign exchange transaction gain - - - % - 3 (100.0) %\nChange in fair value of convertible note embedded derivative liability - - - % - (1,008) 100.0 %\nChange in fair value of warrant liability - (9,580) 100.0 % (9,580) (4,875) (96.5) %\nLoss on extinguishment of debt (452) - (100.0) % - (431) 100.0 %\nOther income / (expense) (146) 232 (162.9) % 232 153 51.6 %\nTotal interest and other income / (expense), net $ (17,352) $ (9,307) 86.4 % $ (9,307) $ (7,278) 27.9 %\nFiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020\nTotal interest and other income / (expense), net, for the years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020 were $(17,352) and $(9,307), respectively, an increase in net expenses of $8,045 or 86.4%. This change in total interest and other income / (expense), net, was primarily attributable to changes in interest income / (expense), fair value of warrant liability, and estimated contingent consideration related to the Mobile Posse acquisition. The change in fair value of warrant liability was due to all holders of the remaining outstanding warrants exercising all outstanding warrants during the year ended March 31, 2020.\nFiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019\nTotal interest and other income / (expense), net, for the years ended March 31, 2020 and 2019 were $(9,307) and $(7,278), respectively, an increase in net expenses of $2,029 or 27.9%. This change in total interest and other income / (expense), net, was primarily attributable to changes in interest income / (expense), fair value of convertible note embedded derivative liability, and fair value of warrant liability. The changes in fair values of the convertible note embedded derivative liability and warrant liability were due to the change in the Company's stock price from $3.50 at March 31, 2019 to $4.18 at March 31, 2020, partially offset by the settling of all of the remaining derivative instruments during the fiscal year.\nInterest income / (expense)\nIn the year ended March 31, 2021, interest expense was attributable to 1) fees related to obtaining debt, which were recorded as debt issuance costs and expensed as a component of interest expense over the life of the debt; 2) interest expense incurred on the prior credit agreement with Western Alliance Bank, which was the previous senior credit facility of the Company that was terminated on February 3, 2021, at approximately 5.5% (LIBOR + 3.75% with a 1.75% LIBOR floor); and 3) interest expense incurred under the BoA Credit Agreement at an annual rate equal to LIBOR (or, if necessary, a broadly-adopted replacement index) plus an applicable margin that ranges from 1.50% to 2.25%, depending on the Company\u2019s consolidated leverage ratio.\nIn the year ended March 31, 2020, interest expense was attributable to 1) fees related to obtaining debt, which were recorded as debt issuance costs and expensed as a component of interest expense over the life of the debt; and 2) interest expense incurred on the prior credit agreement with Western Alliance Bank, which was the previous senior credit facility of the Company that was terminated on February 3, 2021, at approximately 5.5% (LIBOR + 3.75% with a 1.75% LIBOR floor). During the majority of the year ended March 31, 2020, the Company had no outstanding debt and incurred no interest expense.\nIn the year ended March 31, 2019, interest expense was primarily attributable to 1) fees related to the obtaining debt, which were recorded as debt issuance costs and expensed as a component of interest expense over the life of the debt; 2) interest expense incurred from the $16,000 aggregate principal amount of 8.75% Convertible Notes due 2020 (the \u201cNotes\u201d), issued on September 28, 2016; 3) from amounts drawn on our business finance agreement (the \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d) with Western Alliance Bank (the \u201cBank\u201d) at approximately 6.75% (Wall Street Journal Prime Rate + 0.50%); and 4) amortization of debt discount related to the Notes, which were expensed as a component of interest expense over the life of the debt.\nInterest income consists of interest income earned on our cash.\nThe Company recorded $(1,003), $41, and $(1,120) of aggregate interest income / (expense), inclusive of debt discount and debt issuance costs amortization, during the years ended March 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.\nChange in fair value of convertible note embedded derivative liability\nThe Company accounts for the convertible note embedded derivative liability issued in accordance with US GAAP accounting guidance under ASC 815 applicable to derivative instruments, which requires every derivative instrument within its scope to be recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in earnings. All convertible notes were settled prior to the year ended March 31, 2020 and therefore no amounts associated with this derivative liability were recognized in the year ended March 31, 2021 or 2020.\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2019, the Company recorded a loss from change in fair value of convertible note embedded derivative liability of $1,008 due to the increase of the Company's stock price from $2.01 at March 31, 2018 to $3.50 at March 31, 2019, partially offset by the settling of $5,700 of the underlying debt instruments.\nChange in fair value of warrant liability\nThe Company accounts for the warrants issued in connection with the above-noted sale of Notes in accordance with US GAAP accounting guidance under ASC 815 applicable to derivative instruments, which requires every derivative instrument within its scope to be recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in earnings. Based on this guidance, the Company determined that these warrants did not meet the criteria for classification as equity. Accordingly, the Company classified the warrants as long-term liabilities. The warrants are subject to re-measurement at each balance sheet date, with any change in fair value recognized as a component of other income / (expense), net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income / (Loss).\nDue to the valuation of the derivative liability being highly sensitive to the trading price of the Company's stock, the increase and decrease in the trading price of the Company's stock has the impact of increasing the (loss) and gain, respectively. All warrants related to these Notes were exercised during the year ended March 31, 2020 and the associated liability settled.\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2020, the Company recorded a loss from change in fair value of warrant liability of $9,580 due to the increase of the Company's stock price from $3.50 at March 31, 2019 to $4.18 at March 31, 2020, partially offset by the exercise of all remaining warrants.\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2019, the Company recorded a loss from change in fair value of warrant liability of $4,875 due to the increase of the Company's stock price from $2.01 at March 31, 2018 to $3.50 at March 31, 2019, partially offset by the exercise of 484,900 warrants.\nChange in estimated contingent consideration\nOn February 28, 2020, the Company completed the acquisition of Mobile Posse, pursuant to the previously-reported stock purchase agreement (the \"Purchase Agreement\") with ACME Mobile, LLC (\u201cACME\u201d), Mobile Posse, and certain equity holders of ACME. The Company acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of Mobile Posse in exchange for an estimated total consideration of: (1) $41,500 in cash paid at closing (subject to customary closing purchase price adjustments) and (2) an estimated earn-out of $23,735, to be paid in cash, based on Mobile Posse achieving certain future target net revenues, less associated revenue shares, over a twelve-month period following the closing of the acquisition, noting that the earn-out amount is subject to change based on final results and calculation.\nUnder the terms of the earn-out, over the earn-out period, the Company paid ACME a certain percentage of actual net revenues (less associated revenue shares) of Mobile Posse, depending on the extent to which Mobile Posse achieved certain target net revenues (less associated revenue shares) for the relevant period. Due to the financial results of Mobile Posse during the earn-out period, in addition to the initial estimated contingent consideration of $23,735, the Company made additional earn-out payments in the amount of $15,751 during the year ended March 31, 2021. The earn-out period concluded during the year ended March 31, 2021.\nLoss on extinguishment of debt\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2021, connected with the early termination of the Western Alliance credit agreement, the Company recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of $452, which represents the write-off of all remaining unamortized debt issuance costs related to the Western Alliance credit agreement, as well as cash expenses incurred for the early extinguishment of the credit facility.\nNo loss on extinguishment of debt was recorded during the year ended March 31, 2020.\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2019, connected with the settlement of a portion of the convertible notes, the Company recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of $431, which represents the difference between the carrying value of the settled debt (including underlying derivative instruments) and the consideration given to settle the debt, in this case primarily stock.\nIncome taxes\nAccounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") 740 requires the consideration of a valuation allowance, on a jurisdictional basis, to reflect the likelihood of realization of deferred tax assets. Significant management judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets. During the year ended March 31, 2021, the Company\u2019s pre-tax income in the U.S. continued to increase such that the Company was no longer in a cumulative three-year loss position. Following the acquisition and integration of Mobile Posse, the Company was able to sustain this pre-tax income position throughout the full fiscal year. In the fourth quarter ended March 31, 2021, based on management\u2019s assessment of this income trend following the integration of Mobile Posse, we determined that the U.S. deferred tax assets were more likely than not realizable based on expected future taxable income. A net tax benefit of $11,782 was realized in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021 as a result of the release of the U.S. valuation allowance.\nAs part of the stock acquisition of Mobile Posse on February 28, 2020, the Company recorded a net U.S. deferred tax liability of $10,552 on the opening balance sheet. The deferred tax liability primarily related to intangible assets recorded at fair market value for financial accounting purposes compared to the carryover of historical tax basis. The acquired deferred tax liabilities represent a source of positive evidence with respect to the Company\u2019s ability to realize deferred tax assets. In accordance with ASC 805-740-30-3, a change in the acquirer\u2019s valuation allowance as a result of a business combination is recorded as a component of income tax expense. As a result of the business combination, the Company released $10,552 of valuation allowance as a component of income tax expense in the year ended March 31, 2020.\nThe Company\u2019s income is subject to taxation in both the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating the Company\u2019s tax positions and determining its provision for income taxes. The Company establishes liabilities for income tax-related uncertainties based on estimates of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. These liabilities for tax contingencies are established when the Company believes that a tax position is not more likely than not sustainable. The Company adjusts these liabilities in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the outcome of a tax audit or lapse of a statute of limitations. The provision for income taxes includes the impact of uncertain tax liabilities and changes in liabilities that are considered appropriate.\nThe Company\u2019s effective tax rate differs from the U.S. federal statutory tax rate primarily as a result of changes in valuation allowance, tax deductions in excess of book for stock compensation, nondeductible changes in stock acquisition earn-out and warrant liabilities, and state income taxes.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nMarch 31, 2021 March 31, 2020\n(in thousands)\nCash $ 30,778 $ 21,534\nRestricted cash 340 125\nShort-term debt\nShort-term debt, net of debt issuance costs of $443 and $62, respectively 14,557 1,188\nTotal short-term debt 14,557 1,188\nLong-term debt\nLong-term debt, net of debt issuance costs of $0 and $245, respectively - 18,505\nTotal long-term debt - 18,505\nWorking capital\nCurrent assets 97,385 58,447\nCurrent liabilities 111,149 82,809\nWorking capital $ (13,764) $ (24,362)\nOur primary sources of liquidity have historically been issuances of common and preferred stock, debt, and cash from operations. As of March 31, 2021, we had cash, including restricted cash, totaling approximately $31,118.\nThe Company anticipates that its primary sources of liquidity will continue to be cash-on-hand, cash provided by operations, and the credit available under the Company's senior credit facility. In addition, the Company may raise additional capital through future equity or, subject to restrictions contained in the Company's senior credit facility, debt financing to finance the future purchase price and earn-out payment obligations with respect to the AdColony and Fyber acquisitions, provide for greater flexibility to make acquisitions, make new investments in under-capitalized opportunities, or invest in organic opportunities.\nAdditional financing may not be available on acceptable terms or at all. If the Company issues additional equity securities to raise funds, the ownership percentage of its existing stockholders would be reduced. New investors may demand rights, preferences, or privileges senior to those of existing holders of common stock. The Company believes that it has sufficient cash and capital resources to operate its business for at least twelve months from the filing date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nBoA Revolving Line of Credit\nOn February 3, 2021, the Company entered into a credit agreement (\"the BoA Credit Agreement') with Bank of America, N.A. (the \u201cBank\u201d), which provides for a revolving line of credit of $100,000, with an accordion feature enabling the Company to increase the amount to up to $200,000, to be used for acquisitions, working capital, and general corporate purposes. DT Media and DT USA are additional co-borrowers under the BoA Credit Agreement.\nThe revolving line of credit matures on February 3, 2024.\nIn connection with the Company entering into the BoA Credit Agreement with the Bank as described above, on February 3, 2021, the Company and Western Alliance Bank terminated the credit agreement dated February 28, 2020, by and among the Company, DT Media, DT USA, and Western Alliance Bank (and the amendments thereto), which was the previous term loan and revolving credit facility of the Company.\nAmounts outstanding under the BoA Credit Agreement accrue interest at an annual rate equal to LIBOR (or, if necessary, a broadly-adopted replacement index) plus an applicable margin that ranges from 1.50% to 2.25%, depending on the Company\u2019s consolidated leverage ratio. The obligations under the BoA Credit Agreement are secured by a grant of a security interest in substantially all of the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries. The BoA Credit Agreement contains customary covenants, representations, and events of default, and also requires the Company to comply with a maximum consolidated leverage ratio and minimum fixed charge coverage ratio.\nAt March 31, 2021, there was $15,000 outstanding principal on the BoA Credit Agreement and the Company had $85,000 available to draw.\nApril 2021 Credit Facility\nSubsequent to year end, on April 29, 2021, the Company entered into an amended and restated Credit Agreement (the \u201cNew Credit Agreement\u201d) with Bank of America, N.A., as a lender and administrative agent, and a syndicate of lenders, which provides for a revolving line of credit of $400,000 to be used for working capital, permitted acquisitions, capital expenditures, and other lawful corporate purposes. DT Media and DT USA are additional co-borrowers under the Credit Agreement, and Mobile Posse is a guarantor (together with the Company, DT Media and DT USA, collectively, the \u201cLoan Parties\u201d). This modification replaced the existing BoA Credit Agreement. The New Credit Agreement contains an accordion feature that permits an increase of the revolver by up to $75,000 plus an amount that would enable the Loan Parties to remain in compliance with a consolidated secured net leverage ratio, on such terms as agreed to by the parties.\nThe revolving line of credit matures on April 29, 2026.\nAmounts outstanding under the Credit Agreement accrue interest at an annual rate equal to, at the Company\u2019s election, (i) LIBOR plus between 1.50% and 2.25% based on the Company\u2019s consolidated leverage ratio or (ii) a base rate determined based upon the highest of (a) the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, (b) Bank of America, N.A.\u2019s prime rate or (c) LIBOR plus 1.00%, plus between 0.50% and 1.25% based on the Company\u2019s consolidated leverage ratio. The Credit Agreement contains customary covenants, representations and events of default, and also requires the Company to comply with a maximum consolidated secured net leverage ratio and minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio.\nThe Loan Parties\u2019 payment and performance obligations under the New Credit Agreement and related loan documents are secured by their grant of a security interest in substantially all of their personal property assets, whether now existing or hereafter acquired, subject to certain exclusions. If the Loan Parties acquire any real property assets with a fair market value in excess of $5,000, they are required to grant a security interest in such real property as well. All such security interests are required to be first priority security interests, subject to certain permitted liens.\nCash Flow Summary\nYear ended March 31, Year ended March 31,\n2021 2020 % of Change 2020 2019 % of Change\n(in thousands) (in thousands)\nConsolidated Statement of Cash Flows Data:\nNet cash provided by operating activities - continuing operations $ 62,795 $ 33,670 86.5 % $ 33,670 $ 4,970 577.5 %\nCapital expenditures (9,204) (4,845) (90.0) % (4,845) (2,314) (109.4) %\nAcquisition of Appreciate, net of cash (20,348) - (100.0) % - - - %\nAcquisition of Mobile Posse, net of cash (8,256) (41,872) 80.3 % (41,872) - (100.0) %\nProceeds from borrowings 15,000 20,000 (25.0) % 20,000 - 100.0 %\nPayment of debt issuance costs (469) (313) (49.8) % (313) - (100.0) %\nPayment of contingent consideration (16,956) - (100.0) % - - - %\nOptions and warrants exercised 7,209 6,488 11.1 % 6,488 734 783.9 %\nRepayment of debt obligations (20,000) - (100.0) % - (1,650) 100.0 %\nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash $ (312) $ (235) (32.8) % $ (235) $ (31) (658.1) %\nOperating Activities\nDuring the years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company's net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was $62,795 and $33,670, respectively, an increase of $29,125, or 86.5%. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, and changes in working capital accounts over the comparative periods.\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2021, net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was $62,795, resulting from net income of $54,884 offset by net non-cash expenses of $13,340, which included depreciation and amortization, non-cash interest expense, stock-based compensation, stock-based compensation for services rendered, loss on extinguishment of debt, change in estimate of remaining contingent consideration, and payment of contingent consideration in excess of amounts capitalized at acquisition of approximately $7,114, $94, $4,853, $1,024, $255, $15,751, and $(15,751), respectively. Depreciation and amortization expense relates primarily to capitalized software development costs and acquired technology and IP-related intangible assets. Stock-based compensation expense relates primarily to options granted to our employees and, to a lesser extent, to restricted stock awards for executives and our Board of Directors. The net impact of the change in estimated earn-out due to ACME Mobile for the acquisition of Mobile Posse and the payment of this additional earn-out is $0 on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows; the $15,751 represents additional earn-out payments earned by ACME Mobile due to actual financial results during the earn-out period in excess of amounts capitalized under ASC 805 - Purchase Accounting. These amounts were all paid during the period. Net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal year 2021 was negatively impacted by the net change in working capital accounts as of March 31, 2021 compared to March 31, 2020, with a net increase over the comparative periods in current liabilities of $32,456 offset by an increase in current assets of approximately $24,540.\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2020, net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was $33,670, resulting from net income of $14,280 offset by net non-cash expenses of $15,281, which included depreciation and amortization, non-cash interest expense, stock-based compensation, stock-based compensation for services rendered, change in fair value of convertible note embedded derivative liability, and change in fair value of warrant liability of debt of approximately $2,342, $6, $2,710, $643, and $9,580, respectively. Depreciation and amortization expense relates primarily to capitalized software development costs and acquired technology and IP-related intangible assets. Stock-based compensation expense relates primarily to options granted to our employees and, to a lesser extent, to restricted stock awards for executives and our Board of Directors. The change in fair value of warrant liability was a result of the settlement of all outstanding warrants related to the convertible notes during fiscal year 2020. Net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal year 2020 was negatively impacted by the net change in working capital accounts as of March 31, 2020 compared to March 31, 2019, with a net increase over the comparative periods in current liabilities of approximately $15,239 offset by an increase in current assets of approximately $272.\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2019, net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was $4,970, resulting from a net loss of $4,302 offset by net non-cash expenses of $12,409, which included depreciation and amortization, non-cash interest expense, stock-based compensation, stock-based compensation for services rendered, change in fair value of convertible note embedded derivative liability, change in fair value of warrant liability, and loss on extinguishment of debt of approximately $2,766, $798, $2,011, $520, $1,008, $4,875, and $431, respectively. Depreciation and amortization expense relates primarily to capitalized software development costs and acquired technology and IP-related intangible assets. Stock-based compensation expense relates primarily to options granted to our employees and, to a lesser extent, to restricted stock awards for executives and our Board of Directors. The change in fair value of warrant liability was primarily a result of the change in our stock price during fiscal year 2019, offset by the settlement of a portion of the outstanding warrants. Net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal year 2019 was positively impacted by the net change in working capital accounts as of March 31, 2019 compared to March 31, 2018, with a net increase over the comparative periods in current liabilities of approximately $2,212 offset by an increase in current assets of approximately $5,531.\nInvesting Activities\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2021, cash used in investing activities was approximately $37,808, which includes capital expenditures of $9,204, comprised mostly of internally-developed software, the acquisition of Appreciate, net of cash, for $20,348, and earn-out payments associated with the acquisition of Mobile Posse, net of cash, for $8,256.\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2020, cash used in investing activities was approximately $46,717, which includes capital expenditures of $4,845, comprised mostly of internally-developed software, and the acquisition of Mobile Posse, net of cash, for $41,872.\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2019, cash used in investing activities was approximately $2,314, which includes capital expenditures of $2,314, comprised mostly of internally-developed software.\nFinancing Activities\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2021, cash used in financing activities was approximately $15,216, which is primarily attributable to proceeds from borrowings of $15,000 and proceeds received from the exercise of stock options of approximately $7,209, offset by the payment of debt issuance costs of $469, payment of contingent consideration of $16,956, and repayment of debt obligations of $20,000.\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2020, cash provided by financing activities was approximately $26,175, which is primarily attributable to proceeds from borrowings of $20,000 and proceeds received from the exercise of stock options and warrants of approximately $6,488, offset by payment of debt issuance costs of $313.\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2019, cash used in financing activities was approximately $916, which is primarily attributable to proceeds received from the exercise of stock options and warrants of approximately $734, offset by the repayment of debt obligations of approximately $1,650.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partners, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. In addition, we do not have any undisclosed borrowings or debt, and we have not entered into any synthetic leases. We believe, therefore, that we are not materially exposed to any financing, liquidity, market, or credit risks that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships.\nContractual Cash Obligations\nThe following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations at March 31, 2021:\nPayments Due by Period\nContractual cash obligations Total Less Than 1 Year 1-3 Years 3 to 5 Years More Than 5 Years\nOperating leases (a) $ 7,027 $ 1,716 $ 3,242 $ 2,069 $ -\nDebt repayments 15,000 15,000 - - -\nBank fees 450 150 300 - -\nUncertain tax positions (b) - - - - -\nTotal contractual cash obligations $ 22,477 $ 16,866 $ 3,542 $ 2,069 $ -\n(a)Consists of operating leases for our office facilities.\n(b)We have approximately $1,077 in additional liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions that are not expected to be liquidated within the next twelve months. We are unable to reliably estimate the expected payment dates for these additional non-current liabilities.\nCash Contractual Obligations Associated with Acquisitions\nUnder the terms of the Share Purchase Agreement for the acquisition of AdColony, we must pay $100,000 in cash on or before October 29, 2021 and an earn-out payment estimated between $150,000 to $175,000 in cash following December 31, 2021. In addition, under the terms of the Sale and Purchase Agreement for the acquisition of Fyber, we must pay the tender offer consideration in cash and make a potential earn-out payment of up to $50,000, which may be paid in shares of our common stock or, under certain circumstances, in cash. On April 29, 2021, we entered into the New Credit Agreement and borrowed approximately $107,000 on the revolver on that date, and we borrowed an additional $130,000 on the revolver on May 25, 2021 to fund the cash closing payments for the AdColony and Fyber acquisitions. In order to fund the future cash payments due in respect of the AdColony and Fyber acquisitions, we will need to use cash flows from operations and borrowings under the New Credit Agreement and may need to access the capital markets. If our cash flows and borrowings under our revolving credit facility are not available for any reason, we would need to seek funds from the capital markets.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"). The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to contingencies, litigation, and goodwill and intangible assets acquired from our acquisitions. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nWe believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements.\nBasis of Presentation\nThe financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) for annual financial statements. The financial statements, in the opinion of management, include all adjustments necessary for a fair statement of the results of operations, financial position, and cash flows of the Company for each period presented.\nEstimates and Assumptions\nThe preparation of our financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nRevenue Recognition\nIn accordance with ASC 606, revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised services. The amount of revenue recognized reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for these services.\nCarriers and OEMs\nAs discussed above, contracts with carriers and OEMs are created to help the customer control, manage, and monetize the mobile device through the marketing of application slots or advertisement space/inventory to advertisers and delivering the applications or advertisements to the mobile device. The Company generally offers these services under a revenue share model or, to a lesser extent, a customer contract per-device license fee model for a two-to-four year software as a service (\"SaaS\") license agreement. These agreements typically include the following services: the access to a SaaS platform, hosting, solution features, and general support and maintenance. The Company has concluded that each promised service is delivered concurrently, interdependently, and continuously with all other promised services over the contract term and, as such, has concluded these promises are a single performance obligation that is delivered to the customer over a series of distinct service periods over the contract term. The Company meets the criteria for overtime recognition because the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by the Company's performance as the Company performs, and the same method would be used to measure progress over each distinct service period. The fees for such services are not known at contract inception, but are measurable during each distinct service period. The Company's contracts do not include advance non-refundable fees. The Company\u2019s fees for these services are based upon a revenue-share arrangement with the carrier or OEM. Both parties have agreed to share the revenue earned from third-party advertisers, discussed below, for these services.\nThird-Party Advertisers\nApplication Management Software\nThe Company generally offers these services under customer contract Cost-Per-Install or CPI arrangements, Cost-Per-Placement or CPP arrangements, and/or Cost-Per-Action or CPA arrangements with third-party advertisers and developers, as well as advertising aggregators, generally in the form of insertion orders that specify the type of arrangement (as detailed above) at particular set budget amounts/restraints. These advertiser customer contracts are generally short-term in nature, at less than one year, as the budget amounts are typically spent in full within this time period. These agreements typically include the delivery of applications to home screens of mobile devices. Access to inventory of application slots is allocated by carriers or OEMs in the contracts identified above. The Company controls these application slots and markets it on behalf of the carriers and OEMs to the advertisers. The Company has concluded that the performance obligation within the contract is complete upon delivery of the application to the device. Revenue recognition related to CPI and CPA arrangements is dependent upon an action of the end user. As a result, the transaction price is variable and is fully constrained until an install or action occurs.\nProgrammatic Advertising and Targeted Media Delivery\nThe Company generally offers these services under cost-per-thousand impression arrangements and page-view arrangements. Through its mobile phone first screen applications and mobile web portals, the Company markets ad space/inventory within its content products for display advertising. The ad space/inventory is allocated to the Company through arrangement with the carrier or OEM in the contracts discussed above. The Company controls this ad space/inventory and markets it on behalf of the carriers and OEMs to the advertisers. The Company\u2019s advertising customers can bid on each individual display ad and the highest bid wins the right to fill each ad impression. Advertising agencies acting on the behalf of advertisers bid on the ad placement via the Company\u2019s advertising exchange customers. When the bid is won, the ad will be received and placed on the mobile device by the Company. The entire process happens almost instantaneously and on a continuous basis. The advertising exchanges bill and collect from the winning bidders and provide daily and monthly reports of the activity to the Company. The Company has concluded that the performance obligation is satisfied at the point in time upon delivery of the advertisement to the device based on the impressions or page-view arrangement, as defined in the contract.\nThrough its mobile phone first screen applications and mobile web portals, the Company\u2019s software platform also recommends sponsored content to mobile phone users and drives web traffic to a customer's website. The Company markets this content to content sponsors, such as Outbrain or Taboola, similarly to the marketing of ad space/inventory. This sponsored content takes the form of articles, graphics, pictures, and similar content. The Company has concluded that the performance obligation within the contract is complete upon delivery of the content to the mobile device.\nGross vs Net Reporting\nThe Company has determined that it is the primary obligor for its advertiser services for application management and programmatic advertising and targeted media delivery when it controls the application slots or ad space/inventory. This is because it has been allocated such slots or space from the carrier or OEM and is responsible for marketing or monetizing the slots or space. The advertisers look to the Company to acquire such slots or space, and the Company\u2019s software is used to deliver the applications, ads or content to the mobile device. The Company also may manage application or ad campaigns of advertisers associated with these services. If the applications or advertisements are not delivered to the mobile device or the Company doesn\u2019t comply with certain policies of the advertiser, the Company would be responsible and have to indemnify the customer for these issues. The Company also has discretion in setting the price of the slots or space based on market conditions, collects the transaction prices, and remits the revenue-share percentage of the transaction price to the carrier or OEM.\nThe Company recognizes the transaction price received from advertisers, content providers, or websites gross and the carrier or OEM share of such transaction price as costs of revenues - license fees and revenue share - in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income / (Loss).\nThe carrier or OEM may have the right to market and sell application slots or ad space to advertisers using the Company\u2019s software. The carrier or OEM will share revenue with the Company when it does so. The Company recognizes the revenue shared by the carrier or OEM on a net basis as the Company is not considered the primary obligor in these transactions.\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nThe Company maintains reserves for current expected credit losses on accounts receivable. Management reviews the composition of accounts receivable and analyzes historical bad debts, customer concentrations, current economic trends, and changes in customer payment patterns to evaluate the adequacy of these reserves.\nSoftware Development Costs\nThe Company applies the principles of FASB ASC 985-20, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software to Be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise Marketed (\u201cASC 985-20\u201d). ASC 985-20 requires that software development costs incurred in conjunction with product development be charged to research and development expense until technological feasibility is established. Thereafter, until the product is released for sale, software development costs must be capitalized and reported at the lower of the unamortized cost or net realizable value of the related product. At this time, we do not invest significant capital into the research and development phase of new products and features as the technological feasibility aspect of our platform products has either already been met or is met very quickly.\nThe Company has adopted the \u201ctested working model\u201d approach to establishing technological feasibility for its products. Under this approach, the Company does not consider a product in development to have passed the technological feasibility milestone until the Company has completed a model of the product that contains essentially all the functionality and features of the final product and has tested the model to ensure that it works as expected.\nThe Company considers the following factors in determining whether costs can be capitalized: the emerging nature of the mobile market; the gradual evolution of the wireless carrier platforms and devices for which it develops products; the lack of pre-orders or sales history for its products; the uncertainty regarding a product\u2019s revenue-generating potential; its lack of control over the carrier distribution channel resulting in uncertainty as to when, if ever, a product will be available for sale; and its historical practice of canceling products at any stage of the development process.\nAfter products and features are released, all product maintenance cost are expensed.\nThe Company also applies the principles of FASB ASC 350-40, Accounting for the Cost of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use (\u201cASC 350-40\u201d). ASC 350-40 requires that software development costs incurred before the preliminary project stage be expensed as incurred. We capitalize development costs related to these software applications once the preliminary project stage is complete and it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used to perform the functions intended.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with FASB ASC 740-10, Accounting for Income Taxes (\u201cASC 740-10\u201d), which requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in its financial statements or tax returns. Under ASC 740-10, the Company determines deferred tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of assets and liabilities, along with net operating losses, if it is more likely than not the tax benefits will be realized using the enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which it expects the differences to reverse. To the extent a deferred tax asset cannot be recognized, a valuation allowance is established, if necessary.\nThe Company is required to evaluate its ability to realize its deferred tax assets using all available evidence, both positive and negative, and determine if a valuation allowance is needed. Further, ASC 740-10-30-18 outlines the four possible sources of taxable income that may be available to realize a tax benefit for deductible temporary differences and carry-forwards. The sources of taxable income are listed below from least to most subjective:\n\u2022Future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences\n\u2022Future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards\n\u2022Taxable income in prior carryback year(s) if carryback is permitted under the tax law\n\u2022Tax-planning strategies that would, if necessary, be implemented to, for example:\n\u25e6Accelerate taxable amounts to utilize expiring carryforwards\n\u25e6Change the character of taxable or deductible amounts from ordinary income or loss to capital gain or loss\n\u25e6Switch from tax-exempt to taxable investments\nASC 740-10 prescribes that a company should use a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold based on the technical merits of the tax position taken. Tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold should be measured as the largest amount of the tax benefits, determined on a cumulative probability basis, which is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement in the financial statements. We recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters as a component of the provision for income taxes.\nThe Company\u2019s income is subject to taxation in both the United States and foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating the Company\u2019s tax positions and determining its provision for income taxes. The Company establishes reserves for income tax-related uncertainties based on estimates of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. These reserves for tax contingencies are established when the Company believes that positions do not meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold. The Company adjusts uncertain tax liabilities in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the outcome of a tax audit or lapse of a statute of limitations. The provision for income taxes includes the impact of uncertain tax liabilities and changes in liabilities that are considered appropriate.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe have applied FASB ASC 718, Share-Based Payment (\u201cASC 718\u201d), and, accordingly, we record stock-based compensation expense for all of our stock-based awards.\nUnder ASC 718, we estimate the fair value of stock options granted using the Black-Scholes model. The fair value for awards that are expected to vest is amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award, which is generally the option vesting term. The amount of expense recognized represents the expense associated with the stock options we expect to vest, based on an estimated rate of forfeitures. This rate of forfeitures is updated, as necessary, and any adjustments needed to recognize the fair value of options that vest or are forfeited are recorded.\nThe Black-Scholes model, used to estimate the fair value of an award, requires the input of subjective assumptions, including the expected volatility of our common stock, interest rates, dividend rates, and an option\u2019s expected life. As a result, the financial statements include amounts that are based on our best estimates and judgments for the expenses recognized for stock-based compensation.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. Such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Significant estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, estimated replacement costs and future expected cash flows from acquired users, acquired technology, acquired patents, and acquired trade names from a market participant perspective. Management's estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. Allocation of purchase consideration to identifiable assets and liabilities affects Company amortization expense, as acquired finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over the useful life, whereas any indefinite lived intangible assets, including goodwill, are not amortized. During the measurement period, which is not to exceed one year from the acquisition date, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings.\nGoodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets\nGoodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over fair value of net assets of businesses acquired. In accordance with FASB ASC 350-20, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, the value assigned to goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets is not amortized to expense, but rather they are evaluated, at least on an annual basis, to determine if there are potential impairments.\nFor goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets, we complete what is referred to as the \u201cStep 0\u201d analysis, which involves evaluating qualitative factors including macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, and overall financial performance. If our \u201cStep 0\u201d analysis indicates it is more likely than not the fair value is less than the carrying amount, we would perform a quantitative two-step impairment test.\nThe quantitative analysis compares the fair value of our reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible assets to their carrying amounts and an impairment loss is recognized equivalent to the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value. Fair value is determined based on discounted cash flows, market multiples, or appraised values, as appropriate. Discounted cash flow analysis requires assumptions about the timing and amount of future cash inflows and outflows, risk, the cost of capital, and terminal values. Each of these factors can significantly affect the value of the intangible asset. The estimates of future cash flows, based on reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections, require management\u2019s judgment.\nAny changes in key assumptions about the Company\u2019s businesses and their prospects, or changes in market conditions, could result in an impairment charge. Some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the intangible asset valuation process include: the timing and amount of projected future cash flows; the discount rate selected to measure the risks inherent in the future cash flows; and the assessment of the asset\u2019s life cycle and the competitive trends impacting the asset, including consideration of any technical, legal or regulatory trends.\nIn the years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company determined there were no indicators of impairment of goodwill. See Note \"Goodwill\" to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report. In performing the related valuation analyses, the Company used various valuation methodologies including probability-weighted discounted cash flows, comparable transaction analysis, and market capitalization and comparable company multiple comparison.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nRecent accounting pronouncements are detailed in Note 5 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.",
    "item_7A": "ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nWe have operations both within the United States and internationally and we are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business. These risks primarily consist of interest rate fluctuation and foreign currency exchange risks.\nInterest Rate Fluctuation Risk\nThe primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing income without significantly increasing risk. Our cash consists of cash and deposits which are not insensitive to interest rate changes.\nOur borrowings under our credit facility are subject to variable interest rates and thus expose us to interest rate fluctuations, depending on the extent to which we utilize the credit facility. If market interest rates materially increase, our results of operations could be adversely affected. A hypothetical increase in market interest rates of 100 basis points would result in an increase in our interest expense of $10 per year for every $1,000 of outstanding debt under the credit facility.\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk\nWe have foreign currency risks related to our revenue and operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.\nWhile a portion of our sales are denominated in these foreign currencies and then translated into the U.S. dollar, the vast majority of our media costs are billed in the U.S. dollar, causing both our revenue and, disproportionately, our operating income / (loss) and net income / (loss) to be impacted by fluctuations in exchange rates. In addition, gain / (loss) related to translating certain cash balances, trade accounts receivable balances, and inter-company balances that are denominated in these currencies impact our net income / (loss). As our foreign operations expand, our results may be more impacted by fluctuations in the exchange rates of the currencies in which we do business. At this time, we do not, but we may in the future, enter into financial instruments to hedge our foreign currency exchange risk.",

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of March 31, 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year ended March 31, 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (\u201cPCAOB\u201d), the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2021, based on criteria established in the 2013 Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (\u201cCOSO\u201d), and our report dated June 10, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion.\nBasis for opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company\u2019s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical audit matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nIncome Tax Valuation Allowance\nAs described further in Note 4 and Note 16 of the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements, the Company\u2019s net deferred income tax assets of $12.9 million are net of a valuation allowance of $5.2 million, for U.S. state and foreign deferred tax assets. For the year ended March 31, 2021, the Company recorded an income tax benefit of $13.0 million, of which $11.2 million was a reduction of the Company\u2019s federal tax valuation allowance against substantially all of its U.S. federal deferred tax assets. Management records a valuation allowance, on a jurisdictional basis, to reduce the carrying value of deferred income tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not to be realized. We identified the estimation of the valuation allowance for deferred income tax assets as a critical audit matter.\nThe principal considerations for assessing the valuation allowance as a critical audit matter are the high level of estimation uncertainty and the level of audit effort and expertise required to audit the amount and timing of future taxable income. Management applies judgment in assessing all available positive and negative evidence, including the history of profitable operations and projected taxable income, in determining whether deferred income tax assets are more likely than not to be realized. Projected taxable income includes judgmental assumptions related to future revenue, and operating expenses, as well as the timing of realization of taxable temporary differences.\nOur procedures related to the estimation of the valuation allowance for deferred income tax assets included the following, among others:\na.We tested the design and operating effectiveness of controls over the accuracy of the valuation allowance by tax jurisdiction.\nb.We obtained the Company\u2019s future taxable income estimate used to support realization of the deferred tax asset. We determined the reasonableness of the projection by considering historical pre-tax income, adjusted for significant permanent items, as an estimate for future periods, published industry sector growth rate projections, and the historical pre-tax income of the recently acquired business. We also performed a sensitivity analysis of the estimate of the Company\u2019s future taxable income, to determine if the Company\u2019s net operating losses could be realized prior to expiration based on pre-tax income that was less than the future pre-tax income used in the Company\u2019s estimate.\nc.We recalculated future taxable income arising from the expected reversal of taxable temporary differences.\nd.Professionals with specialized tax skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating management\u2019s analysis, including cumulative taxable income and the reasonableness of management\u2019s judgments and estimates.\n/s/ GRANT THORNTON LLP\nWe have served as the Company\u2019s auditor since 2021.\nDallas, Texas\nJune 10, 2021\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nBoard of Directors and Stockholders\nDigital Turbine, Inc.\nOpinion on internal control over financial reporting\nWe have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Digital Turbine, Inc. (a Delaware corporation) and subsidiaries (the \u201cCompany\u201d) as of March 31, 2021, based on criteria established in the 2013 Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (\u201cCOSO\u201d). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2021, based on criteria established in the 2013 Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by COSO.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (\u201cPCAOB\u201d), the consolidated financial statements of the Company as of and for the year ended March 31, 2021, and our report dated June 10, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.\nBasis for opinion\nThe Company\u2019s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management\u2019s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting (\u201cManagement\u2019s Report\u201d). Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nOur audit of, and opinion on, the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting does not include the internal control over financial reporting of Triapodi Ltd., a wholly-owned subsidiary, whose financial statements reflect total assets and revenues constituting 10.4 and 0.4 percent, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended March 31, 2021. As indicated in Management\u2019s Report, Triapodi Ltd. was acquired during 2021. Management\u2019s assertion on the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting excluded internal control over financial reporting of Triapodi Ltd.\nDefinition and limitations of internal control over financial reporting\nA company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ GRANT THORNTON LLP\nDallas, Texas\nJune 10, 2021\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Digital Turbine, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Digital Turbine, Inc. and Subsidiaries (collectively, the \u201cCompany\u201d) as of March 31, 2020, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income / (loss), stockholders\u2019 equity and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended March 31, 2020, and the related notes to the consolidated financial statements (collectively, the \u201cfinancial statements\u201d). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of March 31, 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the two years in the period ended March 31, 2020, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.

Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.

In connection with the Acquisition, under the terms of the Purchase Agreement, DT EMEA entered into bonus arrangements to pay up to $6,000 in retention bonuses and performance bonuses to the founders and certain other employees of Appreciate. The Purchase Agreement contains customary representations and warranties, covenants, and indemnification provisions. The Company determined the operating results of the acquisition to not be material to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2021 and, therefore, has not included pro forma financial information for the acquisition of Appreciate. None of the goodwill recognized for the Acquisition was deductible for tax purposes.\nDue to the proximity of the Acquisition to our fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition are presented on a preliminary basis and are as follows:\nAssets\nCash $ 2,152\nAccounts receivable 2,400\nOther current assets 53\nProperty, plant, and equipment 17\nDeveloped technology 8,200\nCustomer relationships 2,300\nTrade Names 1,700\nGoodwill 9,431\nTotal Assets $ 26,253\nLiabilities\nAccounts payable $ 5,271\nAccrued license fees and revenue share 365\nAccrued compensation 282\nOther current liabilities 332\nTotal Liabilities $ 6,250\nTotal Consideration $ 20,003\nThe amortization period for the intangible assets acquired in the transaction are as follows:\nIntangible Asset Remaining Useful Life\nDeveloped technology 10 years\nCustomer relationships 15 years\nTrade names 10 years\nGoodwill Indefinite\nThe operating results of Appreciate, which are included in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income / (Loss) from the acquisition date to March 31, 2021, are as follows:\nUnaudited\nRevenues $ 1,230\nCosts of revenues and operating expenses 1,139\nNet income $ 91\n3. Discontinued Operations\nOn April 29, 2018, the Company entered into two distinct disposition agreements with respect to selected assets owned by our subsidiaries.\nDT APAC and DT Singapore (together, \u201cPay Seller\u201d), each wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company, entered into an Asset Purchase Pay Agreement (the \u201cPay Agreement\u201d), dated as of April 23, 2018, with Chargewave Ptd Ltd (\u201cPay Purchaser\u201d) to sell certain assets (the \u201cPay Assets\u201d) owned by the Pay Seller related to the Company\u2019s Direct Carrier Billing business. The Pay Purchaser is principally owned and controlled by Jon Mooney, an officer of the Pay Seller. At the closing of the asset sale, Mr. Mooney was no longer employed by the Company or Pay Seller. As consideration for this asset sale, Digital Turbine is entitled to receive certain license fees, profit-sharing, and equity participation rights as outlined in the Company\u2019s Form 8-K filed on May 1, 2018 with the SEC. The transaction was completed on July 1, 2018 with an effective date of July 1, 2018. With the sale of these assets, the Company has determined that it will exit the segment of the business previously referred to as the Content business.\nIn accordance with the Pay Agreement, the Company assigned and transferred a material contract to the Pay Purchaser. Subsequently to the closing of the transaction associated with the Pay Agreement, the Company received notification from the Pay Purchaser that the partner to the material contract had terminated the contract with the Pay Purchaser. Due to the material contract being terminated, the Company has determined that the estimated earn-out from the Pay Purchaser to be $0. As all the assets being transferred had been fully impaired prior to the closing of the transaction, the gain/loss on sale related to the Pay Agreement transaction is currently estimated at $0. Furthermore, the Company retained certain receivables and payables for content delivered for the benefit of the partner to the material contract, where these certain receivables and payables were all recognized prior to the closing of the Pay Agreement. These amounts were presented as assets and liabilities held for disposal in prior presented periods. As of March 31, 2021, the Company has determined there to be uncertainty surrounding the collectability of the receivables due to a breakdown in ongoing discussions with the business partner. We have determined that the amounts recorded are more likely than not to be uncollectible due to disputes surrounding the content delivered, furthermore the related payables would also be contractually withheld unless payment is received at a later date. At this time, the Company has reserved for all balances remaining, both receivables and payables, related to the discontinued operations of the Pay business. The total impact to the Company if all of the remaining receivables and payables are subsequently collected is immaterial.\nDT Media, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the \u201cA&P Agreement\u201d), dated as of April 28, 2018, with Creative Clicks B.V. (the \u201cA&P Purchaser\u201d) to sell business relationships with various advertisers and publishers (the \u201cA&P Assets\u201d) related to the Company\u2019s Advertising and Publishing business. As consideration for this asset sale, we are entitled to receive a percentage of the gross profit, as defined by the A&P Agreement, derived from these customer agreements, for a period of three years, as outlined in the Company\u2019s Form 8-K filed on May 1, 2018 with the SEC. The transaction was completed on June 28, 2018 with an effective date of June 1, 2018. With the sale of these assets, the Company has determined that it will exit the operating segment of the business previously referred to as the A&P business, which was previously part of Advertising, the Company's sole continuing reporting unit. No gain or loss on sale was recognized related to this divestiture. All transferred assets and liabilities, with the exception of goodwill, were fully amortized prior to entering into the sales agreement. As the consideration given by the purchaser was already materially determined at March 31, 2018, goodwill was impaired to the estimated future cash flows of the divested business, which was effectively the purchase price. With the consummation of the sale, the remaining goodwill asset was netted against the purchase price receivable for a net impact of $0 on the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended March 31, 2019.\nThese dispositions have allowed the Company to benefit from a streamlined business model, simplified operating structure, and enhanced management focus.\nThe following table summarizes the financial results of our discontinued operations for all periods presented herein:\nCondensed Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss\nFor Discontinued Operations\n(in thousands, except per share amounts)\nYear ended March 31,\n2020 2019\nNet revenues $ - $ 3,970\nTotal costs of revenues (1,202) 1,788\nProduct development 60 732\nSales and marketing - 350\nGeneral and administrative 1,433 2,671\nLoss from operations (291) (1,571)\nInterest and other income / (expense), net (89) (137)\nLoss from discontinued operations before income taxes (380) (1,708)\nIncome tax provision / (benefit) - -\nLoss from discontinued operations, net of taxes (380) (1,708)\nForeign currency translation adjustment - -\nComprehensive loss (380) (1,708)\nBasic and diluted net loss per common share $ - $ (0.02)\nWeighted-average common shares outstanding, basic 84,594 77,440\nWeighted-average common shares outstanding, diluted 89,558 77,440\nThe following table provides reconciling cash flow information for our discontinued operations:\nYear ended March 31,\n2020 2019\nCash flows from operating activities\nNet loss from discontinued operations, net of taxes (380) (1,708)\nAdjustments to reconcile net loss to net cash used in operating activities:\nDepreciation and amortization 19 279\nChange in allowance for doubtful accounts (1,589) 1,011\nLoss on disposal of fixed assets 109 -\nStock-based compensation - 37\n(Increase) / decrease in assets:\nAccounts receivable 3,472 5,119\nGoodwill - 309\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets - 54\nIncrease / (decrease) in liabilities:\nAccounts payable (3,158) (5,631)\nAccrued license fees and revenue share (537) (2,522)\nAccrued compensation (226) (303)\nOther current liabilities (3) (346)\nCash used in operating activities (2,293) (3,701)\nCash used in discontinued operations (2,293) (3,701)\n4. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation\nThe financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\u201cGAAP\u201d) and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) for annual financial statements. The financial statements, in the opinion of management, include all adjustments necessary for a fair statement of the results of operations, financial position and cash flows for each period presented.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and our wholly-owned subsidiaries. All material intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nRevenue from Contracts with Customers\nThe Company adopted ASC 606 on April 1, 2018, and ASC 606 is effective from the beginning of fiscal year 2019, using the modified retrospective method for all contracts not completed as of the effective date. For contracts that were modified before the effective date, the Company reflected the aggregate effect of all modifications when identifying performance obligations and allocating transaction price in accordance with practical expedient ASC 606-10-65-1-(f)-4, which did not have a material effect on the adjustment to accumulated deficit. The adoption of ASC 606 represents a change in accounting principle that will more closely align revenue recognition with the delivery of the Company's services and will provide financial statement readers with enhanced disclosures. In accordance with ASC 606, revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised services. The amount of revenue recognized reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for these services.\nMedia Distribution Services\nThe Company\u2019s Media Distribution business consists of an advertiser solution for unique and exclusive carrier and OEM inventory, which is comprised of services including:\n\u2022An application media software platform that enables carriers and OEMs to control, manage, and monetize applications installed at the time of activation and over the life of a mobile device. This allows operators to personalize the application activation experience for customers and monetize their home screens via Cost-Per-Install or CPI arrangements, Cost-Per-Placement or CPP arrangements, and/or Cost-Per-Action or CPA arrangements, with third-party advertisers. There are several different delivery methods available to operators and OEMs on first boot of the device. Optional notifications and other features are available throughout the life-cycle of the device, providing operators and OEMs opportunity for additional revenue streams;\n\u2022A content media software platform that enables programmatic advertising and targeted media delivery. This allows operators to monetize their operator-branded on-phone applications by showing in-application advertisements via cost-per-thousand impression arrangements and page-view arrangements; and\n\u2022Other services related to the core platform.\nApplication Media revenues totaled $217,447, $133,898, and $103,569, respectively, for the years ended March 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, while Content Media revenues, primarily related to the Mobile Posse acquisition on February 28, 2020, totaled $96,132, $4,817, and $0, respectively.\nCarriers and OEMs\nAs discussed above, contracts with carriers and OEMs are created to help the customer control, manage, and monetize the mobile device through the marketing of application slots or advertisement space/inventory to advertisers and delivering the applications or advertisements to the mobile device. The Company generally offers these services under a revenue share model or, to a lesser extent, a customer contract per-device license fee model for a two-to-four year software as a service (\"SaaS\") license agreement. These agreements typically include the following services: the access to a SaaS platform, hosting, solution features, and general support and maintenance. The Company has concluded that each promised service is delivered concurrently, interdependently, and continuously with all other promised services over the contract term and, as such, has concluded these promises are a single performance obligation that is delivered to the customer over a series of distinct service periods over the contract term. The Company meets the criteria for overtime recognition because the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by the Company's performance as the Company performs, and the same method would be used to measure progress over each distinct service period. The fees for such services are not known at contract inception, but are measurable during each distinct service period. The Company's contracts do not include advance non-refundable fees. The Company\u2019s fees for these services are based upon a revenue-share arrangement with the carrier or OEM. Both parties have agreed to share the revenue earned from third-party advertisers, discussed below, for these services.\nThird-Party Advertisers\nApplication Management Software\nThe Company generally offers these services under customer contract Cost-Per-Install or CPI arrangements, Cost-Per-Placement or CPP arrangements, and/or Cost-Per-Action or CPA arrangements with third-party advertisers and developers, as well as advertising aggregators, generally in the form of insertion orders that specify the type of arrangement (as detailed above) at particular set budget amounts/restraints. These advertiser customer contracts are generally short-term in nature, at less than one year, as the budget amounts are typically spent in full within this time period. These agreements typically include the delivery of applications to home screens of mobile devices. Access to inventory of application slots is allocated by carriers or OEMs in the contracts identified above. The Company controls these application slots and markets it on behalf of the carriers and OEMs to the advertisers. The Company has concluded that the performance obligation within the contract is complete upon delivery of the application to the device. Revenue recognition related to CPI and CPA arrangements is dependent upon an action of the end user. As a result, the transaction price is variable and is fully constrained until an install or action occurs.\nProgrammatic Advertising and Targeted Media Delivery\nThe Company generally offers these services under cost-per-thousand impression arrangements and page-view arrangements. Through its mobile phone first screen applications and mobile web portals, the Company markets ad space/inventory within its content products for display advertising. The ad space/inventory is allocated to the Company through arrangement with the carrier or OEM in the contracts discussed above. The Company controls this ad space/inventory and markets it on behalf of the carriers and OEMs to the advertisers. The Company\u2019s advertising customers can bid on each individual display ad and the highest bid wins the right to fill each ad impression. Advertising agencies acting on the behalf of advertisers bid on the ad placement via the Company\u2019s advertising exchange customers. When the bid is won, the ad will be received and placed on the mobile device by the Company. The entire process happens almost instantaneously and on a continuous basis. The advertising exchanges bill and collect from the winning bidders and provide daily and monthly reports of the activity to the Company. The Company has concluded that the performance obligation is satisfied at the point in time upon delivery of the advertisement to the device based on the impressions or page-view arrangement, as defined in the contract.\nThrough its mobile phone first screen applications and mobile web portals, the Company\u2019s software platform also recommends sponsored content to mobile phone users and drives web traffic to a customer's website. The Company markets this content to content sponsors, such as Outbrain or Taboola, similarly to the marketing of ad space/inventory. This sponsored content takes the form of articles, graphics, pictures, and similar content. The Company has concluded that the performance obligation within the contract is complete upon delivery of the content to the mobile device.\nGross vs Net Reporting\nThe Company has determined that it is the primary obligor for its advertiser services for application management and programmatic advertising and targeted media delivery when it controls the application slots or ad space/inventory. This is because it has been allocated such slots or space from the carrier or OEM and is responsible for marketing or monetizing the slots or space. The advertisers look to the Company to acquire such slots or space, and the company\u2019s software is used to deliver the applications, ads or content to the mobile device. The Company also may manage application or ad campaigns of advertisers associated with these services. If the applications or advertisements are not delivered to the mobile device or the Company doesn\u2019t comply with certain policies of the advertiser, the Company would be responsible and have to indemnify the customer for these issues. The Company also has discretion in setting the price of the slots or space based on market conditions, collects the transaction prices, and remits the revenue-share percentage of the transaction price to the carrier or OEM.\nThe company recognizes the transaction price received from advertisers, content providers, or websites gross and the carrier or OEM share of such transaction price as costs of revenues - license fees and revenue share - in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income / (Loss).\nThe carrier or OEM may have the right to market and sell application slots or ad space to advertisers using the Company\u2019s software. The carrier or OEM will share revenue with the Company when it does so. The Company recognizes the revenue shared by the carrier or OEM on a net basis as the Company is not considered the primary obligor in these transactions.\nSoftware Development Costs\nThe Company applies the principles of FASB ASC 985-20, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software to Be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise Marketed (\u201cASC 985-20\u201d). ASC 985-20 requires that software development costs incurred in conjunction with product development be charged to research and development expense until technological feasibility is established. Thereafter, until the product is released for sale, software development costs must be capitalized and reported at the lower of unamortized cost or net realizable value of the related product. At this time, we do not invest significant capital into the research and development phase of new products and features as the technological feasibility aspect of our platform products has either already been met or is met very quickly.\nThe Company has adopted the \u201ctested working model\u201d approach to establishing technological feasibility for its products. Under this approach, the Company does not consider a product in development to have passed the technological feasibility milestone until the Company has completed a model of the product that contains essentially all the functionality and features of the final product and has tested the model to ensure that it works as expected. The Company capitalizes costs related to the development of software to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed as we believe we have met the \"tested working model\" threshold. Development costs continue to be capitalized until the related software is released. The Company considers the following factors in determining whether costs can be capitalized: the emerging nature of the mobile market; the gradual evolution of the wireless carrier platforms and mobile phones for which it develops products; the uncertainty regarding a product\u2019s revenue-generating potential; its lack of control over carrier distribution channels; and its historical practice of canceling products at any stage of the development process.\nAfter products and features are released, all product maintenance cost are expensed.\nThe Company also applies the principles of FASB ASC 350-40, Accounting for the Cost of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use (\u201cASC 350-40\u201d). ASC 350-40 requires that software development costs incurred before the preliminary project stage be expensed as incurred. We capitalize development costs related to these software applications once the preliminary project stage is complete and it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used to perform the functions intended. For fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019, the Company capitalized software development costs in the amount of $8,859, $1,453, and $1,544.\nCapitalized software development costs, whether for software developed to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed or for internal use, are generally amortized over a 3-year useful life.\nProduct Development Costs\nThe Company charges non-capitalizable costs related to design, development, deployment, and maintenance of products to product development expense as incurred. The types of costs included in product development expenses include salaries, contractor fees and allocated facilities costs.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe have applied FASB ASC 718 Share-Based Payment (\u201cASC 718\u201d) and accordingly, we record stock-based compensation expense for all of our stock-based awards.\nUnder ASC 718, we estimate the fair value of stock options granted using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The fair value for awards that are expected to vest is then amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award, which is generally the option vesting term. The amount of expense recognized represents the expense associated with the stock options we expect to ultimately vest based upon an estimated rate of forfeitures; this rate of forfeitures is updated as necessary and any adjustments needed to recognize the fair value of options that actually vest or are forfeited are recorded.\nThe Black-Scholes option pricing model, used to estimate the fair value of an award, requires the input of subjective assumptions, including the expected volatility of our common stock, interest rates, dividend rates and an option\u2019s expected life. As a result, the financial statements include amounts that are based upon our best estimates and judgments relating to the expenses recognized for stock-based compensation.\nThe Company grants restricted stock subject to market or performance conditions that vest based on the satisfaction of the conditions of the award. Unvested restricted stock entitles the grantees to dividends, if any, with voting rights determined in each agreement. The fair value of performance-based awards is determined using the market closing price on the grant date. Derived service periods and the periods charged with compensation expense for performance-based awards are estimated based on the Company\u2019s judgment of likely future performance and may be adjusted in future periods depending on actual performance.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with FASB ASC 740-10, Accounting for Income Taxes (\u201cASC 740-10\u201d), which requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in its financial statements or tax returns. Under ASC 740-10, the Company determines deferred tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of assets and liabilities along with net operating losses, if it is more likely than not the tax benefits will be realized using the enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which it expects the differences to reverse. To the extent a deferred tax asset cannot be realized, a valuation allowance is established.\nASC 740-10 prescribes that a company should use a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold based on the technical merits of the tax position taken. Tax positions that meet the \u201cmore-likely-than-not\u201d recognition threshold should be measured as the largest amount of the tax benefits, determined on a cumulative probability basis, which is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement in the financial statements. We recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters as a component of the provision for income taxes.\nThe Company is required to evaluate its ability to realize its deferred tax assets using all available evidence, both positive and negative, and determine if a valuation allowance is needed. Further, ASC 740-10-30-18 outlines the four possible sources of taxable income that may be available to realize a tax benefit for deductible temporary differences and carry-forwards. The sources of taxable income are listed below from least to most subjective:\n\u2022Future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences\n\u2022Future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards\n\u2022Taxable income in prior carryback year(s) if carryback is permitted under the tax law\n\u2022Tax-planning strategies that would, if necessary, be implemented to, for example:\n\u25e6Accelerate taxable amounts to utilize expiring carryforwards\n\u25e6Change the character of taxable or deductible amounts from ordinary income or loss to capital gain or loss\n\u25e6Switch from tax-exempt to taxable investments\nForeign Currency Translation\nThe Company uses the United States dollar for financial reporting purposes. Some of our foreign subsidiaries use their local currency as their functional currency. Assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated using current rates of exchange prevailing at the balance sheet date. Equity accounts have been translated at their historical exchange rates when the capital transaction occurred. Statement of Operations amounts are translated at average rates in effect for the reporting period. The foreign currency translation adjustment loss of $312, $235, and $31 in the years ended March 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 has been reported as a component of comprehensive income / (loss) in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income / (Loss) and Consolidated Statements of Stockholders\u2019 Equity.\nComprehensive Income / (Loss)\nComprehensive loss consists of two components, net loss and other comprehensive loss. Other comprehensive loss refers to gains and losses that, under generally accepted accounting principles, are recorded as an element of stockholders\u2019 equity, but are excluded from net income. The Company\u2019s other comprehensive loss currently includes only foreign currency translation adjustments.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe Company considers all highly liquid short-term investments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.\nRestricted Cash\nCash accounts that are restricted as to withdrawal or usage are presented as restricted cash. As of March 31, 2021 and March 31, 2020, the Company had $340 and $125, respectively, of restricted cash held by a bank in a collateral account as collateral to cover the Company's corporate credit cards as well as a letter of credit issued to guarantee a facility lease in the prior period.\nAccounts Receivable\nThe Company maintains reserves for current expected credit losses on accounts receivable. Management reviews the composition of accounts receivable and analyzes historical bad debts, customer concentrations, current economic trends, and changes in customer payment patterns to evaluate the adequacy of these reserves.\nDeposits\nAs of March 31, 2021, the Company had deposits of $201 comprised of facility and equipment lease deposits, as compared to $159 as of March 31, 2020.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe Company measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value based on the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. Where available, fair value is based on or derived from observable market prices or other observable inputs. Where observable prices or inputs are not available, valuation techniques are applied. These valuation techniques involve some level of management estimation and judgment, the degree of which is dependent on the price transparency for the instruments or market and the instruments\u2019 complexity.\nThe carrying amounts of certain financial instruments, such as cash equivalents, short term investments, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, approximate fair value due to their relatively short maturities. The carrying value of our debt, less capitalized debt issuance costs, approximates fair value.\nAs of March 31, 2021 and 2020, the carrying value of cash, accounts receivable, prepaid expenses and other current assets, accounts payable, accrued license fees, accrued compensation, debt, and other current liabilities approximates fair value due to the nature of such instruments.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets. Estimated useful lives are the lesser of 8-to-10 years or the term of the lease for leasehold improvements and 3-to-5 years for other assets.\nLeases\nOn April 1, 2019, we adopted Accounting Standards Update 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), using the modified retrospective transition approach such that we accounted for leases that commenced before the effective date of ASU 2016-02 in accordance with previous GAAP unless the lease is modified, except that we recognized right-of-use (\"ROU\") assets and a lease liability for all such leases at each reporting date based on the present value of the remaining minimum rental payments that were tracked and disclosed under previous GAAP. Results and disclosure requirements for reporting periods beginning after June 30, 2019 are presented under Topic 842, while prior period amounts have not been adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with our historical accounting under Topic 840. The adoption of ASU No. 2016-02 resulted in the recognition of incremental right-of-use assets and related lease liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of June 30, 2019.\nUnder Topic 842, we determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of remaining lease payments over the lease term. For this purpose, we consider only payments that are fixed and determinable at the time of commencement. As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. Our incremental borrowing rate is a hypothetical rate based on our understanding of what our credit rating would be. The ROU asset also includes any lease payments made prior to commencement and is recorded net of any lease incentives received. Our lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise such options. When determining the probability of exercising such options, we consider contract-based, asset-based, entity-based, and market-based factors. Our lease agreements may contain variable costs such as common area maintenance, insurance, real estate taxes or other costs. Variable lease costs are expensed as incurred on the consolidated statements of operations. Our lease agreements generally do not contain any residual value guarantees or restrictive covenants.\nThe right-of-use asset components of our operating leases are included in right-of-use assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, while the current portion of our operating lease liabilities are included in other current liabilities and the long-term portion of our operating lease liabilities in other non-current liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. Such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Significant estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, estimated replacement costs and future expected cash flows from acquired users, acquired technology, acquired patents, and acquired trade names from a market participant perspective. Management's estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. Allocation of purchase consideration to identifiable assets and liabilities affects Company amortization expense, as acquired finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over the useful life, whereas any indefinite lived intangible assets, including goodwill, are not amortized. During the measurement period, which is not to exceed one year from the acquisition date, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings.\nGoodwill and Indefinite Life Intangible Assets\nGoodwill represents the excess of cost over fair value of net assets of businesses acquired. In accordance with FASB ASC 350-20, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, the value assigned to goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets, including trademarks and trade names, through ASC 805, Business Combinations, is not amortized to expense, but rather evaluated on an at least annual basis to determine if there are potential impairments. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill is less than the carrying value. If the fair value of an indefinite lived intangible (such as trademarks and trade names) is less than its carrying amount, an impairment loss is recorded. Fair value is determined based on discounted cash flows, market multiples or appraised values, as appropriate. Discounted cash flow analysis requires assumptions about the timing and amount of future cash inflows and outflows, risk, the cost of capital, and terminal values. Each of these factors can significantly affect the value of the intangible asset. The estimates of future cash flows, based on reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections, require management\u2019s judgment. Any changes in key assumptions about the Company\u2019s businesses and their prospects, or changes in market conditions, could result in an impairment charge. Some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the intangible asset valuation process include: the timing and amount of projected future cash flows; the discount rate selected to measure the risks inherent in the future cash flows; and the assessment of the asset\u2019s life-cycle and the competitive trends impacting the asset, including consideration of any technical, legal or regulatory trends.\nGoodwill values assigned through ASC 805, Business Combinations, related to the acquisition of Appreciate are subject to adjustments prior to the finalization of the purchase price accounting one year from the date of acquisition.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets and Finite Life Intangibles\nLong-lived assets, including intangible assets subject to amortization, primarily consist of customer relationships and developed technology that have been acquired and are amortized using the straight-line method over their useful lives, ranging from five to eighteen years, and are reviewed for impairment in accordance with FASB ASC 360-10, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell.\nThere were no indications of impairment present or that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable during the fiscal years ended March 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019.\nPreferred Stock\nThe Company applies the guidance enumerated in FASB ASC 480-10, Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity (\u201cASC 480-10\u201d), when determining the classification and measurement of preferred stock. Preferred shares subject to mandatory redemption (if any) are classified as liability instruments and are measured at fair value in accordance with ASC 480-10. All other issuances of preferred stock are subject to the classification and measurement principles of ASC 480-10. Accordingly, the Company classifies conditionally redeemable preferred shares (if any), which includes preferred shares that feature redemption rights that are either within the control of the holder or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely within the Company\u2019s control, as temporary equity. At all other times, the Company classifies its preferred shares in stockholders\u2019 equity.\nConcentrations of Credit Risk and Significant Customers\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash deposits and accounts receivable. A significant portion of the Company\u2019s cash was held at one major financial institution as of March 31, 2021 and two major financial institutions as of March 31, 2020 that the Company's management has assessed to be of high credit quality. Accounts at each institution are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (\u201cFDIC\u201d) up to $250. At March 31, 2021 and March 31, 2020, the Company had $27,128 and $20,203 in excess of the FDIC-insured limit, respectively. The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts.\nThe Company mitigates its credit risk with respect to accounts receivable by monitoring advertisers' and carriers' accounts receivable balances. As of March 31, 2021, one major customer, Outbrain Inc., represented 13.0% of the Company's net accounts receivable balance. As of March 31, 2020, two major customers, Oath Inc., a subsidiary of Verizon Communications, and Outbrain Inc., represented 11.6% and 11.5% of the Company's net accounts receivable balance, respectively.\nWith respect to customer revenue concentration, the Company defines a customer as an advertiser or a carrier that is a distinct source of revenue and is legally bound to pay for the services that the Company delivers on the advertiser\u2019s or carrier's behalf. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, no single customer represented more than 10% of net revenues. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, one major customer, Oath Inc., a subsidiary of Verizon Communications, represented 15.3% of net revenues. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, one major customers, Oath Inc., a subsidiary of Verizon Communications, represented 28.6% of net revenues.\nWith respect to partner revenue concentration, the Company partners with mobile carriers and OEMs to deliver applications on our platform through the carrier network. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, T-Mobile US Inc., including Sprint and other subsidiaries, a carrier partner, generated 26.4%, AT&T Inc., including its Cricket subsidiary, a carrier partner, generated 22.3%, Verizon Wireless, a subsidiary of Verizon Communications, a carrier partner, generated 18.5%, and America Movil, primarily through its subsidiary Tracfone Wireless Inc., a carrier partner, generated 10.8% of our net revenues. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, Verizon Wireless, a subsidiary of Verizon Communications, a carrier partner, generated 37.3%, AT&T Inc., including its Cricket subsidiary, a carrier partner, generated 30.0%, and America Movil, primarily through its subsidiary Tracfone Wireless Inc., a carrier partner, generated 10.7% of our net revenues. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, Verizon Wireless, a subsidiary of Verizon Communications, a carrier partner, generated 45.9% and AT&T Inc., including its Cricket subsidiary, a carrier partner, generated 38.7% of our net revenues.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires the use of management's estimates. These estimates are subjective in nature and involve judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at fiscal year-end, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the fiscal year. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has created and may continue to create significant uncertainty in macroeconomic conditions, which may cause further business slowdowns or shutdowns, depress demand for our advertising business, and adversely impact our results of operations. We expect uncertainties around our key accounting estimates to continue to evolve depending on the duration and degree of impact associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Our estimates may change as new events occur and additional information emerges, and such changes may be recognized and disclosed in our consolidated financial statements.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nIn March 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued Accounting Standards Update 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848), which contains practical expedients for reference rate reform related activities that affect debt, leases, derivatives and other contracts. The guidance in ASU No. 2020-04 is optional and may be elected over time as reference rate reform activities occur. The Company continues to evaluate the impact of the guidance and may apply elections as applicable as changes in the market occur.\nIn January 2020, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2020-01, Investments-Equity Securities (Topic 321), Investments-Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323), and Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815) (ASU 2020-01), which clarifies the interaction of the accounting for equity securities under Topic 321, the accounting for equity method investments in Topic 323, and the accounting for certain forward contracts and purchased options in Topic 815. This guidance is effective for annual reporting periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2021 on a prospective basis, with early adoption permitted. The Company will adopt ASU 2020-01 during the quarter ended June 30, 2022 and does not expect the impact of the future adoption of this standard to have a material impact on its consolidated results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows based on our current investments.\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued Accounting Standard Update 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes, which simplifies the accounting for income taxes. This guidance is effective for annual reporting periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2020 on a prospective basis, with early adoption permitted. The Company will adopt ASU 2019-12 during the quarter ended June 30, 2021 and does not expect the impact of the future adoption of this standard to have a material impact on its consolidated results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.\nOther authoritative guidance issued by the FASB (including technical corrections to the FASB Accounting Standards Codification) and the SEC did not, or are not expected to have a material effect on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements.\nAccounting Pronouncements Adopted During the Period\nIn August 2018, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued Accounting Standard Update (\"ASU\") 2018-15, which aligns the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software (and hosting arrangements that include an internal use software license). This guidance is effective for annual reporting periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2019. As such, the Company adopted this standard during the quarter ended June 30, 2020 on a prospective basis, and such adoption has not had a material impact on the Company's consolidated results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows in the current presented periods.\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13: Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820). The amendments in this update modify the disclosure requirements on fair value measurements in Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement, as a result of the FASB\u2019s final deliberations of the financial reporting concepts pursuant to the March 4, 2014 issued FASB Concepts Statement, Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting-Chapter 8: Notes to Financial Statements, as they relate to fair value measurement disclosures. The amendments on changes in unrealized gains and losses, the range and weighted average of significant unobservable inputs used to develop Level 3 fair value measurements, and the narrative description of measurement uncertainty should be applied prospectively for only the most recent interim or annual period presented in the initial fiscal year of adoption. This guidance is effective for annual reporting periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2019. As such, the Company has adopted this standard during our quarter ended June 30, 2020, and it has not materially impacted our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326) amends guidelines on reporting credit losses for assets held at amortized cost basis and available-for-sale debt securities. For assets held at amortized cost basis, Topic 326 eliminates the probable initial recognition threshold in current GAAP and, instead, requires an entity to reflect its current estimate of all expected credit losses. The allowance for credit losses is a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of the financial assets to present the net amount expected to be collected. ASU 2016-13 affects entities holding financial assets and net investment in leases that are not accounted for at fair value through net income. The amendments affect loans, debt securities, trade receivables, net investments in leases, off balance sheet credit exposures, reinsurance receivables, and any other financial assets not excluded from the scope that have the contractual right to receive cash. This guidance is effective for annual reporting periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2019. As such, the Company has adopted this standard during our quarter ended June 30, 2020, and it has not materially impacted our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\n5. Accounts Receivable\nMarch 31, 2021 March 31, 2020\nBilled $ 28,636 $ 18,927\nUnbilled $ 38,837 $ 18,267\nAllowance for credit losses $ (5,488) $ (4,059)\nAccounts receivable, net $ 61,985 $ 33,135\nBilled accounts receivable represent amounts billed to customers that have yet to be collected. Unbilled accounts receivable represent revenue recognized and contractually eligible to be billed but billed after period end. All unbilled receivables as of March 31, 2021 are expected to be billed and collected within twelve months.\nThe Company recorded $1,032, $1,739, and $300 of bad debt expense during the years ended March 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 respectively.\n6. Property and Equipment\nMarch 31, 2021 March 31, 2020\nComputer-related equipment $ 20,736 $ 11,649\nFurniture and fixtures $ 714 $ 681\nLeasehold improvements $ 2,182 $ 2,099\nProperty and equipment, gross $ 23,632 $ 14,429\nAccumulated depreciation $ (10,582) $ (6,246)\nProperty and equipment, net $ 13,050 $ 8,183\nDepreciation expense for the years ended March 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 was $4,338, $2,124, and $1,535, respectively.\nDuring the years ended March 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, depreciation expense includes $1,980, $670, and $839, respectively, related to internal-use assets included in General and Administrative Expense and $2,358, $1,454, and $696, respectively, related to internally-developed software to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed included in Other Direct Costs of Revenue.\n7. Leases\nThe Company has entered into various non-cancellable operating lease agreements for certain offices. These leases currently have lease periods expiring between fiscal years 2024 and 2026. The lease agreements may include one or more options to renew. Renewals were not assumed in the Company's determination of the lease term unless the renewals were deemed to be reasonably assured at lease commencement. Our lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. The components of lease costs, weighted-average lease term, and discount rate are detailed below.\nSchedule, by fiscal year, of maturities of lease liabilities as of:\nMarch 31, 2021\nFiscal year 2022 $ 1,493\nFiscal year 2023 1,532\nFiscal year 2024 1,351\nFiscal year 2025 1,057\nFiscal year 2026 878\nThereafter -\nTotal undiscounted cash flows 6,311\n(Less imputed interest) (758)\nPresent value of lease liabilities $ 5,553\nThe current portion of our lease liabilities, payable within the next 12 months, is included in other current liabilities and the long-term portion of our lease liabilities is included in other non-current liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nAssociated with this financial liability, the Company has recorded a right-of-use asset of $3,495, which is calculated using the present value of lease liabilities less any lease incentives received from our landlords and any deferred rent liability balance as of the date of implementation. The discount rates used to calculate the imputed interest above range from 5.50% to 6.75% and the weighted-average remaining lease term is 4.35 years.\nAssociated with the Company's non-cancellable operating leases, during the fiscal years ended March 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, the Company had straight-line rent expense of $1,367, $703, and $643, respectively, and cash rent expense of $1,390, $733, and $551, respectively.\n8. Intangible Assets\nWe make judgments about the recoverability of purchased finite-lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist. Recoverability of finite-lived intangible assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate. We perform an annual impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of each year for indefinite-lived intangible assets, or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist, to determine whether it is more likely than not that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of indefinite-lived intangible assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate. If we determine that an individual asset is impaired, the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset.\nThe assumptions and estimates used to determine future values and remaining useful lives of our intangible and other long-lived assets are complex and subjective. They can be affected by various factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our forecasts.\nWe complete our annual impairment tests in the fourth quarter of each year unless events or circumstances indicate that an asset may be impaired. During the fiscal years ended March 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, we determined that there were no indicators of impairment related to the Company's continuing operations.\nThe components of intangible assets as at March 31, 2021 and 2020 were as follows:\nMarch 31, 2021\nCost Accumulated Amortization Net\nCustomer relationships $ 46,400 $ (4,171) $ 42,229\nDeveloped technology 20,526 (11,141) 9,385\nBrand/trade names 2,000 (314) 1,686\nTotal $ 68,926 $ (15,626) $ 53,300\nMarch 31, 2020\nCost Accumulated Amortization Net\nCustomer relationships $ 46,971 $ (5,154) $ 41,817\nDeveloped technology 7,926 (5,861) 2,065\nTotal $ 54,897 $ (11,015) $ 43,882\nDuring the fiscal years ended March 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, the Company recorded amortization expense in the amount of $2,782, $218, and $1,231, respectively. For the fiscal years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, amortization expense was a component of general and administrative operating expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income / (Loss), due to the classification of acquired internal-use intangible assets accounted for under ASC 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other. For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, amortization expense was a component of other direct costs of revenues on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income / (Loss). This represented the remaining amortization of historical external-use intangible assets accounted for under ASC 985-20, Costs of Software to be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise Marketed.\nBased on the amortizable intangible assets as of March 31, 2021, the Company expects future amortization expense to be approximately $3,755 per year over the next five fiscal years and $34,525 in residual expense thereafter.\nBelow is a summary of intangible assets:\nIntangible Assets\nBalance as of March 31, 2018 $ 1,231\nAmortization of intangibles (1,231)\nBalance as of March 31, 2019 -\nPurchase of Mobile Posse 44,100\nAmortization of intangibles (218)\nBalance as of March 31, 2020 43,882\nPurchase of Appreciate 12,200\nAmortization of intangibles (2,782)\nBalance as of March 31, 2021 $ 53,300\n9. Goodwill\nA reconciliation of the changes to the Company\u2019s carrying amount of goodwill for the periods or as of the dates indicated:\nMedia Distribution\nGoodwill as of March 31, 2018 $ 42,268\nAdjustments -\nGoodwill as of March 31, 2019 42,268\nPurchase of Mobile Posse 26,994\nGoodwill as of March 31, 2020 69,262\nAdjustments to purchase price of Mobile Posse 1,483\nPurchase of Appreciate 9,431\nGoodwill as of March 31, 2021 $ 80,176\nFair value is defined under ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures as \u201cthe price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.\u201d The Company considered the income and market approaches to derive an opinion of value. Under the income approach, the Company utilized the discounted cash flow method, and under the market approach, consideration was given to the guideline public company method, the merger and acquisition method, and the market capitalization method.\nGoodwill is recorded when the purchase price for an acquisition exceeds the estimated fair value of the net tangible and identified intangible assets acquired. Goodwill is allocated to our reporting units based on relative fair value of the future benefit of the purchased operations to our existing business units as well as the acquired business unit. Reporting units may be operating segments as a whole or an operation one level below an operating segment, referred to as a component. Our reporting units are consistent with the operating segments identified in Part I, Item 1 under the section \u201cBusiness\u201d of this Form 10-K.\nWe perform an annual impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of each year, or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist, to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit in which goodwill resides is less than its carrying value. For reporting units in which this assessment concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value is more than its carrying value, goodwill is not considered impaired and we are not required to perform the goodwill impairment test. Qualitative factors considered in this assessment include industry and market considerations, overall financial performance, and other relevant events and factors affecting the reporting unit.\nFor reporting units in which the impairment assessment concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying value, we perform a goodwill impairment test, which compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit, goodwill is not considered impaired. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the net assets assigned to that unit, an impairment charge is recorded in the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value.\nDetermining the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. The goodwill impairment test we utilized in the fourth quarter ended March 31, 2021 utilized an income method to estimate a reporting unit\u2019s fair value. The Company believes that the income method is the best method of determining fair value for our Company. The income method is based on a discounted future cash flow approach that uses the following reporting unit estimates: revenue, based on assumed growth rates; estimated costs; and appropriate discount rates based on a reporting unit's weighted-average cost of capital as determined by considering the observable weighted-average cost of capital of comparable companies. We test the reasonableness of the inputs and outcomes of our discounted cash flow analysis against available comparable market data and against the Company\u2019s market capitalization value, which includes a control premium estimate. A reporting unit\u2019s carrying value represents the assignment of various assets and liabilities.\nBased on the analysis performed for fiscal year 2021, all continuing operations, which are comprised entirely of the Media Distribution reporting unit, have an estimated fair value in excess of the carrying value of the associated goodwill.\nIn the years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company determined there was no impairment to goodwill.\n10. Debt\nMarch 31, 2021 March 31, 2020\nShort-term debt\nShort-term debt, net of debt issuance costs of $443 and $62, respectively\n$ 14,557 $ 1,188\nMarch 31, 2021 March 31, 2020\nLong-term debt\nLong-term debt, net of debt issuance costs of $- and $245, respectively\n$ - $ 18,505\nConvertible Notes\nOn September 28, 2016, the Company sold $16,000 of aggregate principal 8.75% convertible notes maturing on September 23, 2020, unless converted, repurchased, or redeemed in accordance with their terms prior to such date. As of March 31, 2019, all of the Notes have been extinguished, the underlying indenture relieved, and all derivative liabilities related to the Notes settled.\nEach purchaser of the convertible notes also received warrants to purchase shares of the Company's common stock. The warrants were issued under a Warrant Agreement (the \"Warrant Agreement\"), dated as of September 28, 2016, between Digital Turbine, Inc. and US Bank National Association, as the warrant agent.\nThe warrants were immediately exercisable on the date of issuance at an initial exercise price of $1.364 per share.\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2019, 484,900 of the warrants were exercised. During the year ended March 31, 2020, the remaining 3,614,100 of the warrants were exercised. No outstanding warrants related to the Warrant Agreement remained outstanding at March 31, 2020.\nSecured Credit Facility\nOn May 23, 2017, the Company entered a Business Finance Agreement (the \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d) with Western Alliance Bank (the \u201cBank\u201d). The Credit Agreement provides for a $5,000 total facility.\nThe amounts advanced under the Credit Agreement mature in two (2) years, and accrue interest at the following rates and bear the following fees:\n(1) Wall Street Journal Prime Rate + 1.25% (currently approximately 5.25%), with a floor of 4.0%.\n(2) Annual Facility Fee of $45.5.\n(3) Early termination fee of 0.5% if terminated during the first year.\nThe obligations under the Credit Agreement are secured by a perfected first position security interest in all assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, subject to partial (65%) pledges of stock of non-US subsidiaries. The Company\u2019s subsidiaries Digital Turbine USA and Digital Turbine Media are co-borrowers.\nIn addition to customary covenants, including restrictions on payments (subject to specified exceptions), and restrictions on indebtedness (subject to specified exceptions), the Credit Agreement requires the Company to comply with the following financial covenants, measured on a monthly basis:\n(1) Maintain a Current Ratio of at least 0.65, defined as unrestricted cash plus accounts receivable, divided by all current liabilities.\n(2) Revenue must exceed 85% of projected quarterly revenue.\nThe Credit Agreement required that at least two-thirds (2/3rds) of the holders of the Notes at all times be subject to subordination agreements with the Bank. The Company obtained the consent of the holders of at least two-thirds (2/3rds) of the Notes, which were held by a small number of institutional investors. In consideration for such consents, the Company entered into a Second Supplemental Indenture, dated May 23, 2017 (the \u201cSupplemental Indenture\u201d) to the Indenture, and also entered into a First Amendment, dated May 23, 2017 (the \u201cWarrant Amendment\u201d) to the Warrant Agreement. The Supplemental Indenture and Warrant Amendment provided for a 30-day stock price measurement period to determine whether or not there would be any change to the conversion price or exercise price of the Company\u2019s outstanding convertible notes or related warrants. The measurement period concluded on September 20, 2017, with no change to the existing $1.364 per share conversion or exercise price of our convertible notes or related warrants.\nOn May 22, 2019, the Company entered into an amendment to the Credit Agreement that extends the agreement through May 23, 2021 and provided for up to a $20,000 total facility, subject to draw limitations derived from current levels of eligible domestic receivables. The amounts advanced under the Credit Agreement, as amended, mature in two years, or May 22, 2021, and accrue interest at prime plus 0.50% subject to a 6.00% floor, with the prime rate defined as the greater of prime rate published in the Wall Street Journal or 5.50%. The Credit Agreement, as amended, also carried an annual facility fee of 0.20% of our available credit limit, and an unused line fee of 0.10% per annum.\nOn February 28, 2020, the Company entered into a new credit agreement (the \"New Credit Agreement\") with the Bank, which provides for (1) a term loan of $20,000, the proceeds of which the Company used to pay a portion of the closing cash purchase price for the Acquisition, and (2) a revolving line of credit of $5,000 to be used for working capital purposes. DT Media and DT USA are additional co-borrowers under the New Credit Agreement.\nThe term loan was to be repaid on a quarterly basis, beginning in July 2020, until the term loan maturity date of February 28, 2025, at which time the remaining unpaid principal balance must be repaid. The quarterly principal payment amounts increased from $250 to $1,250 over the term of the term loan. The revolving line of credit was to matures on February 28, 2025.\nAmounts outstanding under the New Credit Agreement accrue interest at an annual rate equal to LIBOR (or, if necessary, a broadly-adopted replacement index), subject to a 1.75% floor, plus 3.75%. The obligations under the New Credit Agreement are secured by a perfected first-priority security interest in all the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries. The New Credit Agreement contains customary covenants, representations and events of default, and also requires the Company to comply with a fixed charge coverage ratio and total funded debt to consolidated adjusted EBITDA ratio.\nThe New Credit Agreement contained representations and warranties by each of the parties to the New Credit Agreement, which were made only for purposes of the New Credit Agreement and as of specified dates.\nIn connection with the Company entering into the New Credit Agreement with the Bank, on February 28, 2020, the Company and the Bank terminated the existing Credit Agreement, dated as of May 23, 2017, between the Company, DT Media, DT USA, and the Bank (and the amendments thereto), which was the previous revolving credit facility of the Company.\nIn connection with the Company entering into the BoA Credit Agreement with the Bank as described below, on February 3, 2021, the Company and Western Alliance Bank terminated the New Credit Agreement, dated February 28, 2020, by and among the Company, DT Media, DT USA, and Western Alliance Bank (and the amendments thereto), which was the previous term loan and revolving credit facility of the Company.\nBoA Revolving Line of Credit\nOn February 3, 2021, the Company entered into a credit agreement (\"the BoA Credit Agreement') with Bank of America, N.A. (the \u201cBank\u201d), which provides for a revolving line of credit of $100,000, with an accordion feature enabling the Company to increase the amount to up to $200,000, to be used for acquisitions, working capital, and general corporate purposes. DT Media and DT USA are additional co-borrowers under the BoA Credit Agreement. The revolving line of credit matures on February 3, 2024.\nAmounts outstanding under the BoA Credit Agreement accrue interest at an annual rate equal to LIBOR (or, if necessary, a broadly-adopted replacement index) plus an applicable margin that ranges from 1.50% to 2.25%, depending on the Company\u2019s consolidated leverage ratio. The obligations under the BoA Credit Agreement are secured by a grant of a security interest in substantially all of the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries. The BoA Credit Agreement contains customary covenants, representations, and events of default, and also requires the Company to comply with a maximum consolidated leverage ratio and minimum fixed charge coverage ratio.\nPer the BoA Credit Agreement, the Company's consolidated leverage ratio shall be measured per the following tiers:\nConsolidated Leverage Ratio Interest Rate\nLess than 1.25:1.0\n1.50 %\nFrom 1.25:1.0 to 2.25:1.0\n1.75 %\nFrom 2.25:1.0 to 3.25:1.0\n2.00 %\nGreater than 3.25:1.0\n2.25 %\nAt March 31, 2021, there was $15,000 outstanding principal on the BoA Credit Agreement and the Company had $85,000 available to draw. As of March 31, 2021, the Company was in compliance with all BoA Credit Agreement covenants.\nSubsequent to year end, this debt was modified. Please see Note \"Subsequent Events\" for more information regarding the modification.\nInterest Expense\nInclusive of the convertible notes issued on September 28, 2016 and the Credit Agreement entered into on May 23, 2017 for fiscal year 2019, the New Credit Agreement for fiscal year 2020, and the New Credit Agreement and the BoA Credit Agreement for fiscal year 2021, the Company recorded $949, $101, and $322 of interest expense during the years ended March 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 respectively.\nAdditionally, aggregate debt discount related to the convertible notes detailed above in fiscal year 2019, and debt issuance cost amortization in all presented years, is reflected on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income / (Loss) as interest expense. Inclusive of this amortization of $94 recorded during the year ended March 31, 2021, $6 recorded during the year ended March 31, 2020, and $798 recorded during March 31, 2019, the Company recorded $1,043, $107, and $1,120 of total interest expense for the years ended March 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 respectively.\n11. Description of Stock Plans\nEmployee Stock Plan\nOn September 15, 2020, the Company\u2019s stockholders approved the 2020 Equity Incentive Plan of Digital Turbine, Inc. (the \u201c2020 Plan\u201d), pursuant to which the Company may grant equity incentive awards to directors, employees and other eligible participants. A total of 12,000,000 shares of common stock are reserved for grant under the 2020 Plan. The types of awards that may be granted under the 2020 Plan include incentive and non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, and restricted stock units. The 2020 Plan became effective on September 15, 2020 and has a term of ten years. Stock options may be either \u201cincentive stock options\u201d (\u201cISOs\u201d), as defined in Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d), or non-qualified stock options (\u201cNQSOs\u201d).\nPrevious to the approval of the Plan, stock awards were issued under the Amended and Restated Digital Turbine, Inc. 2011 Equity Incentive Plan (the \u201c2011 Plan\u201d), which was approved and adopted by our stockholders by written consent on May 23, 2012. The 2011 Plan provided for grants of stock-based incentive awards to our and our subsidiaries\u2019 officers, employees, non-employee directors, and consultants. Awards issued under the 2011 Plan can include stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, and restricted stock units. Stock options may be either ISOs, as defined in Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or NQSOs.\nThe 2011 Plan and 2020 Plan are collectively referred to as \"Digital Turbine's Incentive Plans.\"\nThe 2011 Plan reserved 20,000,000 shares for issuance, of which zero and 6,366,088 remained available as of March 31, 2021 and March 31, 2020, respectively. At the point when the 2011 Plan was retired, 4,452,064 shares remained unissued. No future grants will be issued pursuant to the 2011 Plan. All future awards will be issued under the 2020 Plan.\nThe 2020 Plan reserves 12,000,000 shares for issuance, of which 11,903,016 remained available for issuance as of March 31, 2021. The change over the period represents stock option grants, stock option forfeitures/cancellations returned to pool, and restricted shares/units of common stock of 97,193 shares, 209 shares, and zero shares, respectively.\nRestricted Stock Units\nAwards of restricted stock units (\"RSUs\") may be either grants of time-based restricted units or performance-based restricted units that are issued at no cost to the recipient. The cost of these awards is determined using the fair market value of the Company\u2019s common stock on the date of the grant. No capital transaction occurs until the units vest, at which time they are converted to restricted or unrestricted stock. Compensation expense for RSUs with a time condition is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. Compensation expense for RSUs with a performance condition are recognized on a straight-line basis based on the most likely attainment scenario, which is re-evaluated each period.\nIn June 2018, the Company issued 232,558 RSUs to its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. The shares vest over three years. The fair value of the shares on the date of issuance was $400.\nIn May 2019, the Company issued 109,416 RSUs to its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. The shares vest over three years. The fair value of the shares on the date of issuance was $413.\nIn May 2020, the Company issued 109,034 RSUs to its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. The shares vest over three years. The fair value of the shares on the date of issuance was $700.\nWith respect to RSUs, the Company expensed $466, $220, and $140 during the years ended March 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively, to general and administrative expense on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income / (Loss). Remaining unamortized expense, with respect to RSUs, of $688 is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 2.17 years.\nNumber of Shares Weighted-Average Grant Date Fair Value\nUnvested restricted units outstanding as of March 31, 2020 293,525 $ 2.48\nGranted 109,034 6.42\nVested (91,570) 2.47\nCancelled - -\nUnvested restricted units outstanding as of March 31, 2021 310,989 $ 3.87\nStock Option Agreements\nStock options granted under the Company\u2019s Stock Plans typically vest over a three-to-four-year period. These options, which are granted with option exercise prices equal to the fair market value of the Company\u2019s common stock on the date of grant, generally expire up to ten years from the date of grant.\nStock Option Activity\nThe following table summarizes stock option activity for the Stock Plans during the years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020:\nNumber of\nShares Weighted-Average\nExercise Price\n(per share) Weighted-Average\nRemaining Contractual\nLife (in years) Aggregate Intrinsic\nValue\n(in thousands)\nOptions Outstanding, March 31, 2019 9,128,885 $ 1.80 7.31 $ 16,347\nGranted 2,624,244 5.00\nForfeited / Canceled (488,952) 2.05\nExercised (2,279,747) 1.70\nOptions Outstanding, March 31, 2020 8,984,430 2.75 7.17 16,517\nGranted 1,999,997 8.49\nForfeited / Canceled (331,599) 5.61\nExercised (2,506,383) 2.87\nOptions Outstanding, March 31, 2021 8,146,445 $ 4.01 6.86 $ 622,249\nVested and expected to vest (net of estimated forfeitures) at March 31, 2021 (a) 7,994,718 $ 3.92 6.82 $ 611,356\nExercisable, March 31, 2021 5,469,049 $ 2.39 5.92 $ 426,418\na.For options vested and expected to vest, options exercisable, and options outstanding, the aggregate intrinsic value in the table above represents the total pre-tax intrinsic value (the difference between Digital Turbine's closing stock price on March 31, 2021 and the exercise price multiplied by the number of in-the-money options) that would have been received by the option holders had the holders exercised their options on March 31, 2021. The intrinsic value changes based on changes in the price of Digital Turbine's common stock.\nInformation about options outstanding and exercisable at March 31, 2021 is as follows:\nOptions Outstanding Options Exercisable\nNumber of Shares Weighted-Average Exercise Price Weighted-Average Remaining Life (Years) Number of Shares Weighted-Average Exercise Price\n$0.01 - 5.00\n5,578,097 2.13 5.91 4,908,281 1.96\n$5.01 - 10.00\n2,314,183 5.66 8.85 547,958 5.61\n$10.01 - 15.00\n126,272 13.43 9.27 - -\n$15.01 - 20.00\n31,288 15.54 9.35 5,959 15.54\n$20.01 - and over\n96,605 56.69 9.80 6,851 41.25\n8,146,445 4.01 6.86 5,469,049 2.39\nOther information pertaining to stock options for the Stock Plans is as follows:\nYear ended March 31,\n2021 2020 2019\nTotal fair value of options vested $ 4,816 $ 2,577 $ 1,977\nTotal intrinsic value of options exercised (a) $ 97,603 $ 10,890 $ 603\na.The total intrinsic value of options exercised represents the total pre-tax intrinsic value (the difference between the stock price at exercise and the exercise price multiplied by the number of options exercised) that was received by the option holders who exercised their options during the fiscal year.\nDuring the years ended March 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, the Company granted options to purchase 1,999,997, 2,624,244, and 1,463,925 shares of its common stock, respectively, to employees with weighted-average grant-date fair values of $4.69, $2.86, and $1.02, respectively.\nAt March 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, there was $9,612, $4,787, and $2,639 of total unrecognized stock-based compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, related to unvested stock options expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.2 years, 2.3 years, and 1.9 years, respectively.\nValuation of Awards\nFor stock options granted under Digital Turbine\u2019s Incentive Plans, the Company typically uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock options at grant date. The Black-Scholes option pricing model incorporates various assumptions, including volatility, expected term risk-free interest rates, and dividend yields. The assumptions utilized in this model during fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019 are presented below.\nYear ended March 31,\n2021 2020 2019\nRisk-free interest rate 0.21% to 0.66%\n0.64% to 2.25%\n2.38% to 2.96%\nExpected life of the options 4.93 to 5.23 years\n5.02 to 9.83 years\n5.52 to 9.19 years\nExpected volatility 64% to 72%\n64% to 66%\n66%\nExpected dividend yield -% -% -%\nExpected forfeitures 6%-7%\n29% 29%\nExpected volatility is based on a blend of implied and historical volatility of Digital Turbine's common stock over the most recent period commensurate with the estimated expected term of Digital Turbine\u2019s stock options. Digital Turbine uses this blend of implied and historical volatility, as well as other economic data, because management believes such volatility is more representative of prospective trends. The expected term of an award is based on historical experience and on the terms and conditions of the stock awards granted to employees.\nTotal stock compensation expense for the Company\u2019s equity plans, which includes stock options, restricted stock, and warrants issued, is included in the following Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income / (Loss) component. See Note \"Capital Stock Transactions\" regarding restricted stock.\nYear ended March 31,\n2021 2020 2019\nGeneral and administrative $ 5,876 $ 3,353 $ 2,531\n12. Capital Stock Transactions\nPreferred Stock\nThere are 2,000,000 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, $0.0001 par value per share (\u201cSeries A\u201d), authorized and 100,000 shares issued and outstanding, which are currently convertible into 20,000 shares of common stock. The Series A holders are entitled to: (1) vote on an equal per share basis as common stock, (2) dividends paid to the common stock holders on an as-if-converted basis and (3) a liquidation preference equal to the greater of $10 per share of Series A (subject to adjustment) or such amount that would have been paid to the common stock holders on an as-if-converted basis.\nCommon Stock and Warrants\nFor the years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company issued 2,506,383 and 2,279,747 shares, respectively, of common stock for the exercise of employee options.\nFor the years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company issued zero and 3,283,090 shares, respectively, of common stock to the holders of warrants upon exercise.\nThe following table provides activity for warrants issued and outstanding during the year ended March 31, 2021:\nNumber of Warrants Outstanding Weighted-Average Exercise Price\nOutstanding as of March 31, 2020 25,000 $ 2.04\nIssued - -\nExercised - -\nCanceled/Expired - -\nOutstanding as of March 31, 2021 25,000 $ 2.04\nRestricted Stock Agreements\nFrom time to time, the Company enters into restricted stock agreements (\u201cRSAs\u201d) with certain employees and consultants. The RSAs have performance conditions, market conditions, time conditions, or a combination thereof. In some cases, once the stock vests, the individual is restricted from selling the shares of stock for a certain defined period, from three months to two years, depending on the terms of the RSA. As reported in our Current Reports on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on February 12, 2014 and June 25, 2014, the Company adopted a Board Member Equity Ownership Policy that supersedes any post-vesting lock-up in RSAs that are applicable to people covered by the policy, which includes the Company\u2019s Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer.\nDuring the years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company issued 45,110 and 75,493 restricted shares, respectively, to its directors for services. The shares vest over 1 year.\nWith respect to RSAs, during the years ended March 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, the Company expensed $558, $424, and $380 related to time condition RSAs, respectively, to general and administrative expense on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income / (Loss). As of March 31, 2021, 22,555 shares remain unvested.\nThe following is a summary of restricted stock awards and activities for all vesting conditions for the years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively:\nNumber of Shares Weighted-Average Grant Date Fair Value\nUnvested restricted stock outstanding as of March 31, 2019 153,328 $ 1.39\nGranted 75,494 5.58\nVested (191,076) 2.22\nCancelled - -\nUnvested restricted stock outstanding as of March 31, 2020 37,746 5.58\nGranted 45,110 13.88\nVested (60,301) 8.68\nCancelled - -\nUnvested restricted stock outstanding as of March 31, 2021 22,555 $ 13.88\nAll restricted shares, vested and unvested, cancellable and not cancelled, have been included in the outstanding shares as of March 31, 2021.\nAt March 31, 2021 and March 31, 2020, there was $209 and $140, respectively, of unrecognized stock-based compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, related to unvested restricted stock awards expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 0.34 and 0.34 years, respectively.\nVesting of Restricted Stock Units\nDuring the years ended March 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, the Company entered into restricted stock units (RSU) agreements with certain officers of the Company to issue 109,034, 109,416, and 232,558 shares of common stock, respectively, upon vesting. As of March 31, 2021, 140,022 RSUs related to these agreements were vested and an equivalent number of shares of commons stock were issued. See Note \"Description of Stock Plans\" above for further detail on unvested units.\n13. Net Income / (Loss) per Common Share\nBasic and diluted net income / (loss) per share is calculated by dividing net income / (loss) by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period, less shares subject to repurchase, and excludes any dilutive effects of employee stock-based awards in periods where the Company has net losses. Because the Company had a net loss for the year ended March 31, 2019, all potentially dilutive shares of common stock were determined to be anti-dilutive and, accordingly, were not included in the calculation of diluted net loss per share for those fiscal years.\nThe following table sets forth the computation of net income / (loss) per share of common stock (in thousands, except per share amounts):\nYear ended March 31,\n2021 2020 2019\nIncome / (loss) from continuing operations, net of taxes $ 54,884 $ 14,280 $ (4,302)\nWeighted-average common shares outstanding, basic 88,514 84,594 77,440\nBasic net income / (loss) per common share $ 0.62 $ 0.17 $ (0.06)\nWeighted-average common shares outstanding, diluted 96,151 89,558 77,440\nDiluted net income / (loss) per common share $ 0.57 $ 0.16 $ (0.06)\nCommon stock equivalents excluded from net loss per diluted share because their effect would have been anti-dilutive - - 3,312\n14. Employee Benefit Plans\nThe Company has a qualified contributory retirement plan under section 401(k) of the IRC covering eligible full-time employees. Employees may voluntarily contribute eligible compensation up to the annual IRS limit. During the years ended March 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, the Company made matching contributions of $558, $267, and $226, respectively.\n15. Related-Party Transactions\nNone.\n16. Income Taxes\nThe provision / (benefit) for income taxes by taxing jurisdiction was as follows:\nYear ended March 31,\n2021 2020 2019\nCurrent state and local $ 204 $ 182 $ -\nCurrent non-U.S. 38 (55) (63)\nTotal current 242 127 (63)\nDeferred U.S. federal (13,185) (7,928) -\nDeferred state and local (204) (2,624) -\nDeferred non-U.S. 120 50 532\nTotal deferred (13,269) (10,502) 532\nTotal income tax provision / (benefit) $ (13,027) $ (10,375) $ 469\nIncome before income taxes included income / (loss) from domestic operations of $44,800, $3,800, and ($9,300) for the years ended March 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively, and income / (loss) from foreign operations of ($2,800), ($300), and $3,700 for the years ended March 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.\nA reconciliation of income tax expense using the statutory U.S. income tax rate compared with the actual income tax provision follows:\nYear ended March 31,\n2021 2020 2019\nStatutory federal income taxes $ 8,819 $ 741 $ (1,163)\nState income taxes, net of federal benefit (1,284) 144 -\nNon-deductible expenses 926 272 1,097\nChange in warrant liability - 2,012 1,024\nChange in Mobile Posse earn-out 3,238 - -\nExcess deductions for stock compensation (16,523) (1,384) (47)\nChange in uncertain tax liability 591 32 (5)\nChange in valuation allowance (11,223) (12,262) (2,422)\nReturn-to-provision adjustments 2,243 - 2,411\nOther miscellaneous 186 70 (426)\nIncome tax provision / (benefit) $ (13,027) $ (10,375) $ 469\nFiscal year 2020 and 2019 amounts recast for immaterial differences to match reported financial statements.\nThe Company\u2019s effective tax rate differs from the U.S. federal statutory tax rate primarily as a result of changes in valuation allowance, tax deductions in excess of book for stock compensation, nondeductible changes in stock acquisition earn-out and warrant liabilities, and state income taxes.\nASC 740 requires the consideration of a valuation allowance, on a jurisdictional basis, to reflect the likelihood of realization of deferred tax assets. Significant management judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets. During the year ended March 31, 2021, the Company\u2019s pre-tax income in the U.S. continued to increase such that the Company was no longer in a cumulative three-year loss position. Following the acquisition and integration of Mobile Posse, the Company was able to sustain this pre-tax income position throughout the full fiscal year. In the fourth quarter ended March 31, 2021, based on management\u2019s assessment of this income trend following the integration of Mobile Posse, we determined that the U.S. deferred tax assets were more likely than not realizable based on expected future taxable income. A net tax benefit of $11,782 was realized in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021 as a result of the release of the U.S. valuation allowance.\nFor the year ended March 31, 2021, an adjustment to prior period deferred tax balances for net operating losses and stock-based compensation was recorded, resulting in a reduction to deferred tax assets of $2,243. The majority of the adjustment was for the removal of the deferred tax asset for expired equity awards and adjustments to the net operating losses related to transfer pricing. A similar adjustment to net operating loss deferred assets was recorded in the year ended March 31, 2019, in the amount of $2,411, as a result of updates to transfer pricing studies.\nAs part of the stock acquisition of Mobile Posse on February 28, 2020, the Company recorded a net U.S. deferred tax liability of $10,552 on the opening balance sheet. The deferred tax liability primarily related to intangible assets recorded at fair market value for financial accounting compared to the carryover of historical tax basis. The acquired deferred tax liabilities represent a source of positive evidence with respect to the Company\u2019s ability to realize deferred tax assets. In accordance with ASC 805-740-30-3, a change in the acquirer\u2019s valuation allowance as a result of a business combination is recorded as a component of income tax expense. As a result of the business combination, the Company released $10,552 of valuation allowance as a component of income tax expense in the year ended March 31, 2020.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities consist of the following:\nYear ended March 31,\n2021 2020 2019\nDeferred income tax assets\nNet operating loss carry-forward $ 25,630 $ 21,913 $ 23,471\nStock-based compensation 1,675 3,775 3,996\nOther 3,887 2,284 1,228\nGross deferred income tax assets 31,192 27,972 28,695\nValuation allowance (5,287) (15,977) (27,972)\nNet deferred income tax assets 25,905 11,995 723\nDeferred income tax liabilities\nDepreciation and amortization (2,627) (1,648) (678)\nIntangibles and goodwill (10,315) (10,356) -\nOther - - (5)\nNet deferred income tax assets / (liabilities) $ 12,963 $ (9) $ 40\nFiscal year 2020 amounts recast for immaterial differences to match reported financial statements.\nAs of March 31, 2021, the Company had U.S. federal net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards of $87,341, state of approximately $35,722, Australia of approximately $6,399, and Israel of approximately $15,802. U.S. federal NOL of $77,902 and state NOLs expire between 2028 and 2037, and $9,439 of the U.S. federal NOL has an unlimited carryover period. Australia and Israel NOLs have unlimited carryover periods. Utilization of the NOLs in the U.S. are governed by Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d), as well as similar state and foreign limitations that place limitations on the amount of NOLs able to be utilized following ownership changes. Due to the accumulation of annual allowances as of March 31, 2021, the U.S. NOLs are no longer subject to limitation. A valuation allowance of $5,287 is recorded against deferred tax assets as of March 31, 2021, of which $3,272 relates to non-U.S. locations with a history of losses, $417 for U.S. federal deferred tax assets, and $1,598 for state NOL carryforwards.\nThe Company\u2019s income is subject to taxation in both the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating the Company\u2019s tax positions and determining its provision for income taxes. The Company establishes liabilities for income tax-related uncertainties based on estimates of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. These liabilities for tax contingencies are established when the Company believes that a tax position is not more likely than not sustainable. The Company adjusts these liabilities in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the outcome of a tax audit or lapse of a statute of limitations. The provision for income taxes includes the impact of uncertain tax liabilities and changes in liabilities that are considered appropriate.\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of unrecognized tax benefits for the years ended March 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 is as follows:\n2021 2020 2019\nBalance at April 1 $ 787 $ 788 $ 838\nAdditions for tax position of prior years 585 - -\nReductions for tax positions of prior years - (1) (50)\nBalance at March 31 $ 1,372 $ 787 $ 788\nIncluded in the net deferred tax assets balances at March 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 on our Consolidated Balance Sheets are $1,372, $787, and $788, respectively, of unrecognized tax benefits, which would affect the annual effective tax rate if recognized. The Company recognized $23, $33, and $45 of expense for interest and penalties on uncertain income tax liabilities in income tax expense for the years ended March 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. The Company does not expect the amount of unrecognized tax benefits to change significantly in the next twelve months.\nThe Company\u2019s U.S. federal, state, and foreign income tax returns generally remain subject to examination for the tax years ended 2016 through 2021.\n17. Segment and Geographic Information\nThe Company manages its business in one operating and reportable segment: Media Distribution. Our chief operating decision maker does not evaluate operating segments using asset information.\nThe Company attributes its long-lived assets, which primarily consist of property and equipment, to a country primarily based on the physical location of the assets. Goodwill and intangibles are not included in this allocation.\nThe following table sets forth geographic information on our net revenues and net property and equipment for the years ended March 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019. Net revenues by geography are based on the billing addresses of our customers.\nYear ended March 31,\n2021 2020 2019\nNet revenues\nUnited States and Canada $ 193,804 $ 90,245 $ 72,898\nEurope, Middle East, and Africa 79,752 34,970 18,606\nAsia Pacific and China 34,774 11,865 9,324\nMexico, Central America, and South America 5,249 1,635 2,741\nConsolidated net revenues $ 313,579 $ 138,715 $ 103,569\nProperty and equipment, net\nUnited States and Canada $ 12,995 $ 8,132 $ 3,405\nEurope, Middle East, and Africa 40 38 15\nAsia Pacific and China 15 13 10\nMexico, Central America, and South America - - -\nConsolidated property and equipment, net $ 13,050 $ 8,183 $ 3,430\n18. Commitments and Contingencies\nOperating Lease Obligations\nThe Company leases office facilities under non-cancellable operating lease agreements expiring between fiscal years 2024 and 2026.\nThe following table provides a summary of future minimum payments under initial terms of leases as of:\nYear ending March 31,\n2022 $ 1,493\n2023 1,532\n2024 1,351\n2025 1,057\n2026 878\nThereafter -\nTotal Minimum Lease Payments $ 6,311\nThese amounts do not reflect future escalations for real estate taxes and building operating expenses. Rental expense for continuing operations amounted to $1,611, $1,093, and $1,065, for the years ended March 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.\nLegal Matters\nThe Company may be involved in various claims, suits, assessments, investigations, and legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of its business. The Company accrues a liability when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company reviews these accruals at least quarterly and adjusts them to reflect ongoing negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and other relevant information. To the extent new information is obtained and the Company's views on the probable outcomes of claims, suits, assessments, investigations, or legal proceedings change, changes in the Company's accrued liabilities would be recorded in the period in which such determination is made. For some matters, the amount of liability is not probable or the amount cannot be reasonably estimated and, therefore, accruals have not been made.\n19. Valuation of Qualifying Accounts\nFiscal Year Description Balance at Beginning of Period Charged to Income Statement Charged to Allowance Balance at End of Period\n(in thousands)\nTrade Receivables\n2021 Allowance for doubtful accounts $ 4,059 $ 1,032 $ 397 $ 5,488\n2020 Allowance for doubtful accounts 895 1,739 1,425 $ 4,059\n2019 Allowance for doubtful accounts 512 300 83 $ 895\n20. Subsequent Events\nApril 2021 Credit Facility\nSubsequent to year end, on April 29, 2021, the Company entered into an amended and restated Credit Agreement (the \u201cNew Credit Agreement\u201d) with Bank of America, N.A., as a lender and administrative agent, and a syndicate of lenders, which provides for a revolving line of credit of $400,000 to be used for working capital, permitted acquisitions, capital expenditures, and other lawful corporate purposes. DT Media and DT USA are additional co-borrowers under the Credit Agreement, and Mobile Posse is a guarantor (together with the Company, DT Media and DT USA, collectively, the \u201cLoan Parties\u201d). This modification replaced the existing BoA Credit Agreement. The New Credit Agreement contains an accordion feature that permits an increase of the revolver by up to $75,000 plus an amount that would enable the Loan Parties to remain in compliance with a consolidated secured net leverage ratio, on such terms as agreed to by the parties.\nThe revolving line of credit matures on April 29, 2026.\nAmounts outstanding under the Credit Agreement accrue interest at an annual rate equal to, at the Company\u2019s election, (i) LIBOR plus between 1.50% and 2.25% based on the Company\u2019s consolidated leverage ratio or (ii) a base rate determined based upon the highest of (a) the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, (b) Bank of America, N.A.\u2019s prime rate or (c) LIBOR plus 1.00%, plus between 0.50% and 1.25% based on the Company\u2019s consolidated leverage ratio. The Credit Agreement contains customary covenants, representations and events of default, and also requires the Company to comply with a maximum consolidated secured net leverage ratio and minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio.\nThe Loan Parties\u2019 payment and performance obligations under the New Credit Agreement and related loan documents are secured by their grant of a security interest in substantially all of their personal property assets, whether now existing or hereafter acquired, subject to certain exclusions. If the Loan Parties acquire any real property assets with a fair market value in excess of $5,000, they are required to grant a security interest in such real property as well. All such security interests are required to be first priority security interests, subject to certain permitted liens.\nAcquisition of AdColony\nOn April 29, 2021, DT Media completed the acquisition of AdColony Holding AS, a Norway company (\u201cAdColony\u201d), pursuant to a Share Purchase Agreement with AdColony and Otello Corporation ASA, a Norway company and the sole shareholder of AdColony (\u201cOtello\u201d). DT Media acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of AdColony in exchange for an estimated total consideration in the range of $350,000 to $375,000, to be paid as follows: (1) $100,000 in cash paid at closing (which was subject to customary closing purchase price adjustments), (2) $100,000 in cash to be paid six months after closing, and (3) an estimated earn-out in the range of $150,000 to $175,000, to be paid in cash, based on AdColony achieving certain future target net revenues, less associated cost of goods sold, over a twelve-month period ending on December 31, 2021 (the \u201cEarn-Out Period\u201d). Under the terms of the earn-out, DT Media would pay Otello a certain percentage of actual net revenues (less associated cost of goods sold) of AdColony depending on the extent to which AdColony achieves certain target net revenues (less associated cost of goods sold) over the Earn-Out Period. The earn-out payment will be made following the expiration of the Earn-Out Period. The Company paid the closing amount and intends to pay the remainder of the purchase price with a combination of available cash on hand and borrowings under its existing senior credit facility along with future capital financing.\nAcquisition of Fyber\nOn May 25, 2021, the Company and DT Media completed the initial closing of the acquisition of 523,553,108 shares, representing approximately 95.1% of the outstanding voting shares (the \u201cMajority Fyber Shares\u201d) of Fyber N.V., a public limited liability company registered with the Netherlands Chamber of Commerce Business Register (\u201cFyber\u201d), pursuant to a Sale and Purchase Agreement between Tennor Holding B.V., Advert Finance B.V., and Lars Windhorst (collectively, the \u201cSeller\u201d), the Company, and DT Luxembourg. The Seller transferred and delivered 400,000,000 shares of the Majority Fyber Shares to DT Media on the closing date and will deliver the remaining 123,553,108 shares of the Majority Fyber Shares to DT Media in June 2021. The remaining approximately 4.9% of the shares in Fyber (the \u201cMinority Fyber Shares\u201d) are widely held by other shareholders of Fyber (the \u201cMinority Fyber Shareholders\u201d).\nDT Media acquired the Majority Fyber Shares in exchange for an estimated aggregate consideration of up to $600,000, consisting of (i) $150,000 in cash, which was subject to adjustments for certain items including the amount of cash consideration to be paid to the Minority Fyber Shareholders for the Minority Fyber Shares, paid at the closing of the acquisition, (ii) 3,216,935 newly issued shares of common stock of the Company equal in value to $235,000 (based on the volume-weighted average price of the common stock on NASDAQ during the 30-day period prior to the closing date), issued at the closing of the acquisition, (iii) 2,599,653 newly issued shares of common stock of the Company equal in value to $165,000 (based on the volume-weighted average price of the common stock on NASDAQ during the 30-day period prior to the closing date), to be issued in June 2021 after the receipt by the Company of a tax exemption certificate from the Israel Tax Authority, and (iv) contingent upon Fyber\u2019s net revenues being equal or higher than $100,000 for the 12-month earn-out period ending on March 31, 2022, as determined in the manner set forth in the Sale and Purchase Agreement, a certain number of shares of Company common stock, which will be newly-issued to the Seller at the end of the earn-out period, and under certain circumstances, an amount of cash, which value of such shares and cash in aggregate will not exceed $50,000 (subject to set-off against certain potential indemnification claims against the Seller). The Company paid the cash closing amount on the closing date, and intends to pay the remainder of the cash consideration for the acquisition with a combination of available cash on hand, borrowings under the Company\u2019s senior credit facility, and proceeds from future capital financings.\nPursuant to certain German law on public takeovers, following the closing, the Company is obligated to make a public tender offer to the Minority Fyber Shareholders to acquire from them the Minority Fyber Shares. The tender offer will be subject to certain minimum price rules under German law. The timing and the conditions of the tender offer, including the consideration offered to the Minority Fyber Shareholders in connection with the tender offer, will be subsequently determined by the Company pursuant to the applicable Dutch and German takeover laws. The Company anticipates completing the tender offer during the second fiscal quarter 2022.\n21.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer, who is our principal executive officer, and our chief financial officer, who is our principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of March 31, 2021, the end of the period covered by this Annual Report. The term \u201cdisclosure controls and procedures,\u201d as set forth in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act\"), includes, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company\u2019s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of March 31, 2021, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting, or in other factors identified in connection with the evaluation required by Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(d) or 15d-15(d), that occurred during the fiscal periods covered by this Annual Report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nManagement's Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nManagement of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company. Internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Management regularly monitors its internal control over financial reporting and actions are taken to correct deficiencies as they are identified.\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of management, including the principal executive and principal financial officers, the Company conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. This assessment was based on the framework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013. Based on this evaluation under the framework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework, management concluded that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2021, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f).\nManagement has excluded Triapodi, Ltd. from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2021 because it was acquired by the Company during fiscal year 2021. Total assets, including intangible assets created through ASC 805, Business Combinations, and total revenues of Triapodi, Ltd. represent approximately 10.4%, or $27,150, and 0.4%, or $1,230, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts of the Company as of, and for the fiscal year ended, March 31, 2021.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Further, because of changes in conditions, internal control effectiveness may vary over time.\nGrant Thornton LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting. This report is included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.",
