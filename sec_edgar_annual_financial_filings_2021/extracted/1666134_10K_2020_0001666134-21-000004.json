    "item_1": "Item 1. Business\nOverview\nWe have created comprehensive cloud-based solutions designed to transform and modernize accounting and finance operations for organizations of all types and sizes. Our secure, scalable solutions support critical accounting processes such as the financial close, account reconciliations, cash application, intercompany accounting, and compliance. By introducing software to automate these processes and to enable them to function continuously, we empower our customers to improve the integrity of their financial reporting, increase efficiency in their accounting and finance processes and enhance real-time visibility into their results and operations.\nCritical accounting and finance processes underlie the integrity of an organization\u2019s financial reports. The lack of effective accounting and finance tools can result in inefficient and cumbersome processes and, in some cases, accounting errors, restatements and write-offs, as well as material weaknesses and significant deficiencies. Traditional enterprise resource planning, or ERP, systems do not generally provide effective solutions for processes handled outside of an organization\u2019s general ledger, such as balance sheet account reconciliation, intercompany transaction accounting and the broader financial close process. Many organizations also use multiple ERPs and other financial systems without a platform to efficiently integrate them. As a result, to manage these tasks, organizations rely on spreadsheets and other error-prone and labor-intensive processes that are unsuited for the increasing regulatory complexity and transaction volumes encountered by many modern businesses. We believe that we are creating a new category of powerful cloud-based software that is capable of automating and streamlining accounting and finance operations, in a manner that complements and supports traditional ERP\nsystems. We believe our customers benefit from cost savings through improvements in process management and staff productivity, in addition to managing a faster financial close.\nOur mission is to transform how accounting and finance departments operate. Our approach modernizes what historically has been done through batch processing and manual controls typically applied only during the month, quarter or year-end financial close, and delivers dynamic workflows embedded within a real-time, highly automated framework, a process we refer to as \u201ccontinuous accounting.\u201d It also enables up-to-date analytics, provides industry-benchmarked metrics and is designed to help customers run more efficiently while achieving greater accuracy, control and transparency. We believe the need for our software has been driven by growing business and information technology complexities, transaction volumes and expanding regulatory requirements. Our software integrates with, and obtains data from, more than 30 different ERP systems, including NetSuite, Oracle, SAP, and Workday, as well as many other financial systems and applications such as bank accounts, sub-ledgers and in-house databases.\nWe are a holding company and conduct our operations through our wholly-owned subsidiary, BlackLine Systems, Inc. (\u201cBlackLine Systems\u201d). BlackLine Systems funded its business with investments from our founder and cash flows from operations until September 3, 2013. On September 3, 2013, we acquired BlackLine Systems, and Silver Lake Sumeru and Iconiq acquired a controlling interest in us, which we refer to as the \u201c2013 Acquisition.\u201d The 2013 Acquisition was accounted for as a business combination under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\u201cGAAP\u201d) and resulted in a change in accounting basis as of the date of the 2013 Acquisition.\nOn October 2, 2020, we acquired Rimilia Holdings Ltd. (\u201cRimilia\u201d), which is referred to as the \u201cRimilia Acquisition\". The primary purpose of the Rimilia Acquisition was to extend the Company\u2019s capabilities into an adjacent area, adding accounts receivable automation to financial close automation.\nOur cloud-based products include Account Reconciliations, Cash Application, Compliance, Consolidation Integrity Manager, Intercompany Hub, Journal Entry, Task Management, Transaction Matching, and Variance Analysis. These products are offered to customers as scalable solutions that support critical accounting processes, such as the financial close, account reconciliations, cash application, intercompany accounting, and compliance.\nOur Growth Strategy\nOur principal growth strategies include the following:\nContinue to Innovate and Expand our Platform. Our ability to internally develop or make strategic acquisitions of new, market-leading applications and functionalities is integral to our success, and we intend to continue extending the functionality and range of our applications to bring new solutions to accounting and finance.\nEnhance Our Leadership Position with Enterprise Market and Mid-Market Companies. We believe we have a leading position in the enhanced financial controls and automation market with both enterprise market and mid-market companies. We intend to leverage our brand, history of innovation, and customer focus to maintain and grow our leadership position with enterprise market businesses. In addition, we believe that mid-market businesses are particularly underserved and that our platform can help these businesses modernize their accounting and finance processes efficiently and effectively.\nIncrease Existing Customer Spend through Expanded Usage and Adoption of Additional Products. We pursue a land-and-expand sales model and believe there is significant opportunity to increase sales of our solutions within our existing customer base. Our pricing model is designed to allow us to capture additional revenue as our customers\u2019 usage of our platform grows, providing us with an opportunity to increase the lifetime value of our customer relationships.\nExpand Our International Operations and Customer Footprint. We believe that we have a significant opportunity to expand the use of our cloud-based products outside the United States. We have an established presence in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Poland, Singapore, and the United Kingdom, and we intend to invest in further expanding our footprint in these and other regions through organic growth activities and strategic acquisitions.\nExtend Our Customer Relationships and Distribution Channels. We have established strong relationships with technology vendors such as SAP and NetSuite, professional services firms such as Deloitte and KPMG, and business process outsourcers such as Cognizant, Genpact, and IBM. We intend to continue to strengthen and\nexpand our existing relationships, seek new relationships, and further expand our distribution channels to help us expand into new markets and increase our presence in existing markets.\nBlackLine Solutions\nWe provide a powerful cloud-based solution designed to automate and streamline accounting and finance operations. The key elements of our solutions include:\nComprehensive Platform\nWe offer integrated suites of applications that deliver a broad range of capabilities to support critical accounting processes such as the financial close, account reconciliations, cash application, intercompany accounting, and compliance.\nThe technology underpinning our software includes a comprehensive base of accounting-specific business logic and rules engines, which enable our customers to implement continuous accounting.\nEnterprise Integration\nWe provide simple, secure and automated tools and integrations to transfer data to and from a range of enterprise-wide processes and systems, including ERPs, financial systems and in-house databases, and other custom applications and data. Our solutions integrate with over 30 ERP systems, including NetSuite, Oracle, SAP, and Workday. In addition, for companies with multiple systems and complex needs, we can connect with any number of general ledger systems simultaneously, resolving many of the issues associated with consolidating data across systems.\nIndependence\nOur solutions are not dependent on any single operating system and work with most major ERP systems our customers may use. Our cross-system functionality allows us to reach a broader group of customers. We are also able to focus on and innovate for the needs of our customers irrespective of updates or changes in their existing systems. We believe this independence provides us with a competitive advantage in the industry over traditional methods.\nEase of Use\nOur solutions are designed by accountants, for accountants, to be intuitive and easy to use. We strive to enable any user to rapidly implement our platform to manage their accounting and finance activities, from the simplest to the most sophisticated tasks. Our user-friendly interface provides clear visualization of accounting and finance data, enables user collaboration and streamlines business processes.\nInnovation\nOur ability to develop innovative products has been a key driver of our success and organic growth. Through a history and culture of thought leadership, we have created a new category of powerful software that automates and streamlines antiquated, manual accounting processes to better meet our clients\u2019 diverse and rapidly changing needs, and we continue to focus on providing advanced solutions to time and labor intensive accounting practices.\nSecurity\nOur solutions and services incorporate industry best practices and meet internationally recognized standards with respect to information security management. We have implemented and maintain our certified Information Security Management System in accordance with the ISO/IEC 27001 standard requirements. We meet a breadth of requirements for our security control environment, including information security policies, organization of information security, human resource security, access control, cryptography, physical and environmental security, operations security, communications security, information security incident management, and information security aspects of business continuity management. In our continued commitment to customer trust, transparency, and security in service, we provide customers independently validated testing and evaluation of our control environment through issued reports and certifications.\nKey Benefits\nOur platform is designed to provide the following benefits to our customers:\nFlexibility and scalability\nOur unified cloud platform is designed for modern business environments and has broad applicability across large and small organizations in almost any industry. The platform supports complex corporate structures, provides integration across core financial systems, manages multiple currencies and languages, and scales to support high transaction volumes.\nEmbedded controls and workflow\nOur solutions are designed for the complex global regulatory environment. Our solutions embed key controls within standardized, repeatable and well-documented workflows, which are designed to result in substantially reduced risk of non-compliance or negative audit findings, greater tolerance for regulatory complexity and increased confidence in financial reports.\nReal-time visibility\nWe provide users with real-time visibility into the status, progress and quality of their accounting processes. With configurable dashboards, user-defined reporting and the ability to drill down to individual reconciliations, journals and tasks, users can track open items, identify bottlenecks within a process or intervene to prevent mistakes.\nAutomation and efficiency\nOur solutions can ingest data from a variety of sources, including ERP systems and other data repositories, and apply powerful, rules-driven automation to reconciliations, journals and transactions. This streamlines accounting processes, minimizes manual data entry and improves individual productivity to help ensure that accounting processes are completed on time. As a result, this automation allows users to focus on value-added activities instead of process management.\nContinuous processing\nOur solutions help organizations embed quality control, compliance and financial integrity into their day-to-day processes rather than rely on the traditional process of validating financial information at the end of each period. Activities such as account reconciliation and variance analysis can be performed in real-time, thus reducing the risk of errors and creating a more agile accounting environment.\nCustomers\nOur customers include multinational corporations, large domestic enterprises and mid-market companies across a broad array of industries. These businesses include publicly-listed entities and privately-owned enterprises, as well as non-profit entities. At December 31, 2020, we had over 291,000 individual users across more than 3,400 customers exclusive of on-premise software. We define a customer as an entity with an active subscription agreement as of the measurement date. In situations where an organization has multiple subsidiaries or divisions, each entity that is invoiced as a separate entity is treated as a separate customer. However, where an existing customer requests its invoice be divided for the sole purpose of restructuring its internal billing arrangement without any incremental increase in revenue, such customer continues to be treated as a single customer.\nProducts and Services\nOur cloud-based solutions for modern accounting are designed to be the primary system of interaction for accountants every day. Our solutions unify systems and data and work to drive accuracy, collaboration, and accountability through visibility. By unifying and automating activity, we enable accounting departments to execute their work continuously, empowering real-time reporting and business partnership. These products are offered to our customers as scalable solutions for critical accounting processes, including financial close management, cash application, and intercompany accounting.\nFinancial Close Management\nThe collection of processes by which organizations reconcile, consolidate, and report their financial information at the end of each period is referred to as the financial close. For organizations of any size, the traditional way of closing the books is held together by manual processes and error-prone spreadsheets, increasing risk and threatening the accuracy of financial reporting. Our Financial Close Management solutions allow customers to standardize and automate key steps across the close process to ensure accuracy, control, and timeliness.\n\u2022Account Reconciliations provides a centralized workspace from which users can collaborate to complete account reconciliations. Features include standardized templates, workflows for review and approval, linkage to policies and procedures, and integrated storage of supporting documentation. The product automates otherwise manual activities in the reconciliation process, significantly reducing time and effort and increasing productivity. It also enhances internal controls by facilitating the appropriate segregation of duties, simplifying reconciliation audits and adding transparency and visibility to the reconciliation process.\n\u2022Transaction Matching analyzes and reconciles high volumes of individual transactions from different sources of data based upon user-configured logic. Our rules engine automatically identifies exceptions, errors, missing data, and variances within massive data sets. The matching engine processes millions of records per minute, can be used with any type of data and allows customers to reconcile transactions in real-time.\n\u2022Task Management enables users to create and manage processes and task lists. The product provides automatic and recurring task scheduling, includes configurable workflow and provides a management console for accounting and finance projects. Though most commonly used with the financial close, users can create task lists and projects for hundreds of different use cases ranging from external audits to environmental impact surveys.\n\u2022Journal Entry allows users to manually or automatically generate, review and post manual journal entries. Journals can be automatically allocated across multiple business units and calculated based on complex, client-defined logic. More importantly, the addition of validation and approval checkpoints helps ensure the integrity of information passed to other financial applications. Customers can use the Journal Entry product to pass information to hundreds of different ERPs and subsystems in a configurable, easily consumable format.\n\u2022Variance Analysis provides \u201calways-on\u201d monitoring and automatically identifies anomalous fluctuations in balance sheet and income statement account balances. Once an account in flux is identified, users are automatically alerted so they can research and determine the source of the fluctuation.\n\u2022Consolidation Integrity Manager manages the automated system-to-system tie-out process that occurs during the consolidation phase of the financial close. Companies with multiple ERPs utilize a consolidation system to produce their consolidated financial results. Because these systems contain and produce information that changes continually and requires constant adjustments, a final tie-out that is typically handled manually in a spreadsheet is necessary prior to publishing results. This product automates the tie-out process, aggregating balances from dozens or hundreds of different systems and allowing users to identify exceptions and create adjustments quickly.\n\u2022Compliance is an integrated solution that facilitates compliance-related initiatives, consolidates project management, and provides visibility over control self-assessments and testing.\nAccounts Receivable Automation\nCash is vital to every business, and accounts receivable automation is central to improving cash flow. Cash application is the process of matching and applying cash receipts to invoices. Managing accounts receivable well means maximizing working capital and minimizing credit losses. This critical process is often highly manual. Our Cash Application product drives an automated and effective end-to-end process from an invoice to cash in the bank and fully applied in the subledger.\n\u2022Cash Application transforms the order-to-cash cycle by significantly reducing the time it takes to apply cash receipts to open invoices, resulting in significant reductions in unapplied cash. Cash Application uses intelligent automation to help customers accurately apply payments to\ncustomers\u2019 invoices in the ERP. Embedded machine learning then reduces the manual effort involved in the process, which can release working capital for our customers.\nIntercompany Accounting\nIntercompany transactions occur when entities within a corporate parent organization transact with each other. These transactions are some of the most complex and frequent sources of uncertainty for the accounting function. It is a manual, time-consuming, and resource-intensive process. Our Intercompany Hub solution manages the entire intercompany transaction lifecycle within our platform, and we believe it is the only widely available end-to-end intercompany solution. This solution includes the following features:\n\u2022Intercompany Workflow replaces informal, ad-hoc intercompany requests and approvals with a simple, structured workflow approval process. The application stores permissions by entity and transaction type, ensuring that both the initiator and the approver of the intercompany transaction are authorized to conduct business.\n\u2022Intercompany Processing records an organization\u2019s intercompany transactions once they reach an appropriate completion level and posts them to the appropriate systems from a single source. The product automatically incorporates local taxes, exchange rates, invoicing requirements, and customer-specific transfer pricing so that the resulting journal entries will net, which reduces the possibility of intercompany differences and eliminates the need to perform a manual reconciliation.\n\u2022Netting and Settlement automatically generates a real-time, aggregated settlement matrix, which shows the balance of transactions across an entire organization. Users can filter the information by transaction type, currency or business relationship, easing the process of netting transactions and helping them make informed, strategic decisions.\nServices\nCustomer service is essential to our success. We offer the following services for our customers:\n\u2022Implementation. With a focus on configuration over customization, our implementation approach favors rapid and efficient deployments led by accounting experts, rather than technical resources. A typical project will focus on mapping our application to a customer\u2019s current or ideal process, coaching them on best practices, and helping organizations become self-sufficient, instead of dependent on additional professional services. For clients that elect to work with a business process outsourcer or other company for implementation services, our implementation team provides ongoing support in order to ensure that the implementation or finance transformation projects are completed successfully. We generally provide this service for a fixed fee.\n\u2022Support. We provide live customer support 24/7/365 from our offices in California, Sydney and London. All customers have access to support resources by phone, email or through our portal, free of charge.\n\u2022Customer Success. Our customer success managers, many of whom are former users, provide customers with best practices and help create a roadmap for expanded usage of our platform. We believe that this service, which is made available to all customers, is central to our retention and upsell efforts.\n\u2022Training. We offer a variety of live and web-based training options, but most customers elect to consume their training through our e-learning environment, BlackLine U. Courses cover platform functionality, as well as the underlying concepts that make reconciliation, the financial close and other accounting and finance activities necessary.\nSales and Marketing\nWe sell our solutions through our direct sales force. Our direct sales force leverages our relationships with technology vendors such as SAP and NetSuite, professional services firms such as Deloitte, Ernst & Young, and KPMG and business process outsourcers such as Cognizant, Genpact and IBM, to influence and drive customer growth. In particular, our solution integrates with SAP\u2019s ERP solutions. In the fourth quarter of 2018, SAP became\npart of the reseller channel that we use in the ordinary course of business. SAP has the ability to resell our solutions, as an SAP solution-extension (\u201cSolEx\u201d), for which we receive a percentage of the revenues.\nOur marketing efforts are focused on creating sales leads, establishing and extending our brand proposition, generating product awareness, and cultivating our community of users. We generate sales leads primarily through word-of-mouth, search engine marketing, outbound lead generation, and our network of business process outsourcers, business services organizations and resellers. We leverage online and offline marketing channels on a global basis and organize customer roundtables and user conferences and release white papers, case studies, blogs, and digital programs and seminars. We have further extended our brand awareness through sponsorships with leading industry organizations such as the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, or AICPA, the Institute of Management Accountants, or IMA, the Financial Executives International, or FEI, the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, or ICAEW, and the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants, or ACCA.\nCompetition\nThe market for accounting and financial software and services is competitive, rapidly evolving and requires deep understanding of the industry standards, accounting rules and global financial regulations.\nWe compete with vendors of financial automation software such as Trintech, and we also compete with components of Oracle\u2019s Hyperion software. Further, other established software vendors not currently focused on accounting and finance software and services, including some of our partners, resellers, and other parties with which we have relationships, may expand their services to compete with us.\nWe believe the principal competitive factors in our market include the following:\n\u2022level of customer satisfaction;\n\u2022ease of deployment and use of applications;\n\u2022ability to integrate with multiple legacy enterprise infrastructures and third-party applications;\n\u2022domain expertise on accounting best practices;\n\u2022ability to innovate and respond to customer needs rapidly;\n\u2022capability for configurability, integration and scalability of applications;\n\u2022cloud-based delivery model;\n\u2022advanced security and reliability features;\n\u2022brand recognition and historical operating performance; and\n\u2022price and total cost of ownership.\nWe believe we are positioned favorably against our competitors based on these factors. However, certain of our competitors may have greater name recognition, longer operating histories, more established customer and marketing relationships, larger marketing budgets, and significantly greater resources.\nIntellectual Property and Proprietary Rights\nOur intellectual property and proprietary rights are important to our business. We currently have two patents. We primarily rely on copyright, trade secret and trademark laws, trade secret protection, and confidentiality or license agreements with our employees, customers, partners, and others to protect our intellectual property rights. Though we rely in part upon these legal and contractual protections, we believe that factors such as the skills and ingenuity of our employees and the functionality and frequent enhancements to our solutions are larger contributors to our success in the marketplace.\nDespite our efforts to preserve and protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights, unauthorized third parties may attempt to copy, reverse engineer or otherwise obtain portions of our software. Competitors may attempt to develop similar products that could compete in the same market as our products. Unauthorized disclosure of our confidential information by our employees or third parties could occur. Laws of other jurisdictions may not protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights from unauthorized use or disclosure in the same\nmanner as the United States. The risk of unauthorized use of our proprietary and intellectual property rights may increase as our company continues to expand outside of the United States.\nThird-party infringement claims are also possible in our industry, especially as software functionality and features expand, evolve and overlap with other industry segments.\nHuman Capital\nAt December 31, 2020, we had 1,325 employees worldwide. Our employees contribute their unique talents, experience and backgrounds to help our customers move to modern accounting. We are committed to driving a culture of inclusion and innovation through programs designed to attract, develop and engage exceptional talent as part of our Think, Create, Serve ethos.\nThrough ongoing employee development, comprehensive compensation and benefits, and a focus on health, safety and employee wellbeing, we strive to cultivate an environment where employees can do their best work in our award-winning workplace, which the Los Angeles Business Journal included in its \u201cBest Places to Work in Los Angeles\u201d list in 2016, 2017, and 2020.\nDiversity, Equity, and Inclusion\nOur board of directors is made up of highly skilled individuals from the technology and business sectors. Women represent 30% of our board of directors and 20% of our board of directors is drawn from underrepresented communities, as defined under the California Corporations Code.\nAt BlackLine we empower employees to think, create and serve in a workplace that is diverse and equitable, where everyone truly feels they belong. We are committed to providing an environment that is safe, inclusive, equitable, accepting, and supportive for all. How we treat one another-how we serve one another-is at our foundation. At BlackLine, employee resource groups (\"ERGs\") are open to all employees and support our diversity, equity and inclusion goals. Our ERGs include: women, people of color, LGBTQ+, veterans, and a faith-based group, all of which promote inclusion, belonging and innovation.\nDiversity, equity and inclusion are deeply rooted in our culture. We strive to attract, develop and engage exceptional talent. In 2020, BlackLine hired a Vice President of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion responsible for evaluating and strengthening our programs and initiatives worldwide. In 2020, we also launched a global program to raise awareness of and address unconscious bias across the organization, and began implementing psychometric and skill-based testing to reduce bias in the interview process.\nCompensation and Benefits\nBlackLine strives to maintain a pay for performance compensation program that is competitive and appropriately balanced to attract, motivate, reward, and retain talent. We benchmark and set compensation based on our compensation philosophy, market data, employee\u2019s role, experience, location, and performance. We also review our compensation practices, both in terms of our overall workforce and individual employees, to ensure our pay practices are fair and equitable. In addition to competitive compensation, we offer our employees a wide range of benefits such as: comprehensive healthcare and wellness, competitive retirement, time off, and recognition opportunities.\nCommunity Involvement\nBlackLine\u2019s charitable program provides all employees with an opportunity to give back and to make a positive impact through Company-matched charitable giving and virtual volunteering. BlackLine proudly supports the Los Angeles Regional Food Bank, the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Feeding America, and UNICEF, among other charitable organizations.\nEmployee Engagement\nBlackLine regularly seeks input from employees, including through broad employee satisfaction surveys and pulse surveys on specific issues, intended to assess our degree of success in promoting an environment where employees are engaged, satisfied, productive and possess a strong understanding of our business goals. In 2020, 89% of our global employees participated in our annual engagement survey. In the survey, BlackLine received its\ntop scores related to the company's future, creating an environment where people of diverse backgrounds can succeed, and our culture.\nTraining and Development\nWe continually invest in our employees\u2019 career growth and provide employees with a wide range of development opportunities, self-directed learning, and support for continuing education through a tuition reimbursement program. Our 2020 objectives included to \u201cGrow and cultivate a high-performance organization\u201d and to \u201cDeliver training to our people managers that improves their capabilities to support the development, growth, and high performance of our employees.\u201d In 2020, BlackLine employees participated in instructor-led and self-directed learning related to BlackLine products, technical training, business, and development training.\nEmployee Support During COVID-19\nBlackLine has taken a proactive and supportive approach to helping its employees remain healthy and productive through the COVID-19 pandemic. We currently require that the vast majority of our employees work from home, using digital platforms and virtual collaboration tools to maintain productivity and to remain in contact with one another and our customers and business partners. To support and protect our employees, we have also instituted travel bans and restrictions, and have taken precautions in accordance with local laws and guidelines to protect the health and safety of the small number of employees who need to be in our offices to perform their roles. We have also adopted new employee benefits and wellbeing initiatives, including physical, emotional, mental, and social programming, a global employee assistance program, and work from home reimbursement. These programs were recently recognized by the CEO World Awards, which honored BlackLine in the category of \u201cCompany Work-From-Home Implementation of the Year.\u201d\nCorporate Information\nWe were incorporated in May 2001. Our principal executive offices are located at 21300 Victory Blvd., 12th Floor, Woodland Hills, California 91367, and our telephone number is (818) 223-9008. On September 3, 2013, BlackLine, Inc., a newly-formed Delaware C-Corporation, acquired BlackLine Systems, Inc., a California S-Corporation, and Silver Lake Sumeru and Iconiq acquired a controlling interest in us, which we refer to as the \u201c2013 Acquisition\u201d.\nThe names \u201cBlackLine,\u201d \u201cBlackLine Systems,\u201d \u201cIntercompany Hub,\u201d and our logo are our trademarks.

    "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and our consolidated financial statements and related notes, before making a decision to invest in our common stock. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risk and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we presently deem less significant may also impair our business operations. If any of the events or circumstances described in the following risk factors actually occurs, our business, operating results,\nfinancial condition, cash flows, and prospects could be materially and adversely affected. In that event, the market price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose part or all of your investment.\nSummary Risk Factors\nOur business is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that you should consider before investing in our Company, as fully described below. The principal factors and uncertainties that make investing in our Company risky include, among others:\n\u2022If we are unable to attract new customers and expand sales to existing customers, our growth could be slower than we expect and our business may be harmed.\n\u2022Our business and growth depend substantially on customers renewing their subscription agreements with us, and any decline in our customer renewals could adversely affect our operating results.\n\u2022The global COVID-19 pandemic is having a material adverse impact on the operations and financial performance of customers in industries that we serve and could harm our business and operating results.\n\u2022We have a history of losses and we may not be able to generate sufficient revenue to achieve or sustain profitability.\n\u2022We continue to experience rapid growth and organizational change and if we fail to manage our growth effectively, we may be unable to execute our business plan.\n\u2022Our quarterly results may fluctuate, and if we fail to meet the expectations of analysts or investors, our stock price and the value of your investment could decline substantially.\n\u2022If we are not able to provide successful enhancements, new features or modifications to our software solutions, our business could be adversely affected.\n\u2022We derive substantially all of our revenues from a limited number of software solutions, and our growth is dependent on their success.\n\u2022If our relationships with technology vendors and business process outsourcers are not successful, our business and growth may be harmed.\n\u2022If our security controls are breached or if unauthorized, or inadvertent access to customer, employee or other confidential data is otherwise obtained, our software solutions may be perceived as insecure, we may lose existing customers or fail to attract new customers, our business may be harmed and we may incur significant liabilities.\n\u2022Interruptions or performance problems associated with our software solutions, platform and technology may adversely affect our business and operating results.\n\u2022If our software contains serious errors or defects, we may lose revenue and market acceptance and may incur costs to defend or settle product liability claims.\n\u2022The market in which we participate is intensely competitive, and if we do not compete effectively, our business and operating results could be harmed.\n\u2022The market price of our common stock may be volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nIf we are unable to attract new customers and expand sales to existing customers, our growth could be slower than we expect and our business may be harmed.\nOur growth depends in part upon increasing our customer base. Our ability to achieve significant growth in revenues will depend, in large part, upon the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts, both domestically and internationally. We may have difficulty attracting potential customers that rely on tools such as Excel, or that have already invested substantial personnel and financial resources to integrate on-premise or other software into their businesses, as such organizations may be reluctant or unwilling to invest in a new product. If we fail to attract new customers or maintain and expand those customer relationships, our revenues will grow more slowly than expected and our business will be harmed. As we reallocate marketing resources to focus on digital events, digital lead generation, and tools to help our sales representatives connect with prospects virtually in light of COVID-19, there is no guarantee these new marketing efforts will be successful, and our business may be harmed.\nOur growth also depends upon our ability to add users and sell additional products to our existing customers. It is important for the growth of our business that our existing customers make additional significant purchases of our products and add additional users to our platform. Although our customers, users, and revenue have grown rapidly in the past, in recent periods our slower growth rates have reflected the size and scale of our business, as well as our focus on our strategic products. We cannot be assured that we will achieve similar growth rates in future periods as our customers, users, and revenue could decline or grow more slowly than we expect. Our business also depends on retaining existing customers. If we do not retain customers, including due to the acquisition of our customers by other companies, or our customers do not purchase additional products or we do not add additional users to our platform, our revenues may grow more slowly than expected, may not grow at all or may decline. Additionally, increasing incremental sales to our current customer base may require additional sales efforts that are targeted at senior management. There can be no assurance that our efforts will result in increased sales to existing customers or additional revenues.\nOur sales and marketing efforts may be impacted by geopolitical developments and other events beyond our control, such as COVID-19. Such events can increase levels of political and economic unpredictability globally and increase the volatility of global financial markets. For example, in response to COVID-19, we have shifted our customer events to virtual-only experiences and we may deem it advisable to similarly alter, postpone or cancel entirely additional customer or industry events. Moreover, these conditions could adversely affect our customers\u2019 ability or willingness to attend our events or to purchase new or additional products or services, delay prospective customers\u2019 purchasing decisions, or reduce the value or duration of their subscription agreements, all of which could adversely affect our growth.\nOur business and growth depend substantially on customers renewing their subscription agreements with us and any decline in our customer renewals could adversely affect our operating results.\nOur initial subscription period for the majority of our customers is one to three years. In order for us to continue to increase our revenue, it is important that our existing customers renew their subscription agreements when the contract term expires. Although our agreements typically include automatic renewal language, our customers may cancel their agreements at the expiration of the term. In addition, our customers may renew for fewer users, renew for shorter contract lengths or renew for fewer products or solutions. Renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors, including satisfaction or dissatisfaction with our software or professional services, our pricing or pricing structure, the pricing or capabilities of products or services offered by our competitors, the effects of economic conditions, or reductions in our customers\u2019 spending levels. For example, economic effects of COVID-19 have impacted and may continue to impact our renewal rate. Any prolonged shut down of a significant portion of global economic activity or a downturn in the global economy would adversely affect the industries in which our customers operate, which could adversely affect our customers\u2019 ability or willingness to renew their subscription agreements or could cause our customers to downgrade the terms of their subscription agreements.\nFurther, as the markets for our existing solutions mature, or as current and future competitors introduce new products or services that compete with ours, we may experience pricing pressure and be unable to renew our agreements with existing customers or attract new customers at prices that are profitable to us. If this were to occur, it is possible that we would have to change our pricing model, offer price incentives or reduce our prices. In response to COVID-19, many of our competitors have begun offering free products or services to attract new customers. We have offered free access to our entire training library and have offered the Task Management and Reporting modules complimentary for six months to existing customers to enable a more effective remote close. In addition, we are now offering complimentary coaching sessions with our existing customers. We may have to provide additional free products, services or modules in order to retain our customers, which could adversely impact our operating results over time. If our customers do not renew their agreements with us or renew on terms less favorable to us, our revenues may decline.\nThe global COVID-19 pandemic is having a material adverse impact on the operations and financial performance of many of the customers in industries that we serve and could harm our business and operating results.\nIn December 2019, the emergence of COVID-19 was reported and in March 2020, the World Health Organization (\"WHO\") characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic. This contagious disease outbreak has continued to spread across the world and is impacting macroeconomic activity and financial markets. In light of the uncertain and rapidly evolving situation relating to the spread of COVID-19, we have taken precautionary measures intended to minimize the risk of the virus to our employees, our customers, and the communities in which we operate, which has, and may continue to negatively impact our business and we continue to monitor the situation and may adjust our current policies as more information and public health guidance become available. These precautionary measures could negatively affect our customer success efforts, sales and marketing efforts, delay and increase the length of our sales cycle, or create operational or other challenges, any of which will harm our business and operating results. In addition, COVID-19 has disrupted the operations of our customers and partners, and may continue to disrupt their operations for an indefinite period of time, including as a result of travel restrictions and/or business shut downs, uncertainty in the financial markets or other harm to their business and financial results, resulting in delayed purchasing decisions, extended payment terms, and postponed or cancelled projects, all of which will negatively impact our business and operating results, including sales and cash flows. More generally, COVID-19 has adversely affected economies and financial markets globally, which may lead to an extended economic downturn and a resulting decrease in technology spending, which could adversely affect demand for our offerings and harm our business and operating results. It is not possible at this time to estimate the potential impact of COVID-19 on our business, as the impact will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted.\nWe continue to experience rapid growth and organizational change and if we fail to manage our growth effectively, we may be unable to execute our business plan.\nWe increased our number of full-time employees from 183 at December 31, 2013 to 1,325 at December 31, 2020 as we have experienced growth in number of customers and expanded our operations. Our growth has placed, and may continue to place, a significant strain on our managerial, administrative, operational, financial and other resources. We intend to further expand our headcount and operations both domestically and internationally, with no assurance that our business or revenue will continue to grow. Additionally, due to COVID-19, we have shut down certain workplaces and required our employees to work remotely. We may experience difficulties onboarding new employees remotely. Continuing to create a global organization and managing a geographically dispersed workforce will require substantial management effort, the allocation of valuable management resources and significant additional investment in our infrastructure. We will be required to continually improve our operational, financial and management controls and our reporting procedures and we may not be able to do so effectively, which could negatively affect our results of operations and overall business. In addition, we may be unable to manage our expenses effectively in the future, which may negatively impact our gross margins or operating expenses in any particular quarter. Moreover, if we fail to manage our anticipated growth and change in a manner that preserves the key aspects of our corporate culture, the quality of our software solutions may suffer, which could negatively affect our brand and reputation and harm our ability to retain and attract customers.\nIf we are not able to provide successful enhancements, new features or modifications to our software solutions, our business could be adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to provide enhancements and new features for our existing solutions or new solutions that achieve market acceptance or that keep pace with rapid technological developments, our business could be adversely affected. The success of enhancements, new products and solutions depends on several factors, including timely completion, introduction and market acceptance. We must continue to meet changing expectations and requirements of our customers and, because our platform is designed to operate on a variety of systems, we will need to continuously modify and enhance our solutions to keep pace with changes in internet-related hardware and other software, communication, browser and database technologies. Our platform is also designed to integrate with existing enterprise resource planning (\u201cERP\u201d) systems such as NetSuite, Oracle, SAP and Workday, and will require modifications and enhancements as these systems change over time. Any failure of our solutions to operate effectively with future platforms and technologies could reduce the demand for our solutions or result in customer dissatisfaction. Furthermore, uncertainties about the timing and nature of new solutions or technologies, or modifications to existing solutions or technologies, could increase our research and development expenses. If we are not successful in developing modifications and enhancements to our solutions or if we fail to bring them to\nmarket in a timely fashion, our solutions may become less marketable, less competitive or obsolete, our revenue growth may be significantly impaired and our business could be adversely affected.\nWe derive substantially all of our revenues from a limited number of software solutions, and our growth is dependent on their success.\nWe currently derive and expect to continue to derive substantially all of our revenues from our Close Process Management solution. As such, the continued growth in market demand for this solution is critical to our continued success. We cannot be certain that any new software solutions or products we introduce will generate significant revenues. Accordingly, our business and financial results have been and will be substantially dependent on a limited number of solutions.\nIf our security controls are breached or unauthorized, or inadvertent access to customer, employee or other confidential data is otherwise obtained, our software solutions may be perceived as insecure, we may lose existing customers or fail to attract new customers, our business may be harmed and we may incur significant liabilities.\nUse of our platform involves the storage, transmission and processing of our customers\u2019 proprietary data, including highly confidential financial information regarding their business and personal or identifying information of their customers or employees. Our platform is at risk for breaches as a result of third-party action, employee, vendor or contractor error, malfeasance or other factors. The risk of a cybersecurity incident occurring has increased as more companies and individuals work remotely, and potentially expose us to new, complex threats. If any unauthorized or inadvertent access to or a security breach of our platform occurs, or is believed to occur, such an event could result in the loss of data, loss of business, severe reputational damage adversely affecting customer or investor confidence, regulatory investigations and orders, litigation, indemnity obligations, damages for contract breach or penalties for violation of applicable laws or regulations. As we rely more on third-party and public-cloud infrastructure, such as Google Cloud Platform, and other third-party service providers, we will become more dependent on third-party security measures to protect against unauthorized access, cyberattacks and the mishandling of customer, employee and other confidential data and we may be required to expend significant time and resources to address any incidents related to the failure of those third-party security measures. We may also suffer breaches of our internal systems. Security breaches of our platform or our internal systems could also result in significant costs for remediation that may include liability for stolen assets or information and repair of system damage that may have been caused, incentives offered to customers or other business partners in an effort to maintain business relationships after a breach, and other liabilities.\nAdditionally, many jurisdictions have enacted or may enact laws and regulations requiring companies to notify individuals of data security breaches involving certain types of personal data. These mandatory disclosures regarding a security breach could result in negative publicity to us, which may cause our customers to lose confidence in the effectiveness of our data security measures which could impact our operating results.\nWe incur significant expenses to minimize the risk of security breaches, including deploying additional personnel and protection technologies, training employees annually, and engaging third-party experts and contractors. We continually increase our investments in cybersecurity to countermeasure emerging risks and threats. If a high profile security breach occurs with respect to another Software as a Service (\u201cSaaS\u201d) provider or other technology companies, our current and potential customers may lose trust in the security of our platform or in the SaaS business model generally, which could adversely impact our ability to retain existing customers or attract new ones. Even in the absence of any security breach, customer concerns about privacy, security, or data protection may deter them from using our platform for activities that involve personal or other sensitive information. Our errors and omissions insurance policies covering certain security and privacy damages and claim expenses may not be sufficient to compensate for all potential liability. Although we maintain cyber liability insurance, we cannot be certain that our coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred or that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all.\nBecause the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not identified until they are launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. We may also experience security breaches that may remain undetected for an extended period of time. Periodically, we experience cyber security events including \u201cphishing\u201d attacks targeting our employees, web application and infrastructure attacks and other information technology incidents that are typical for a SaaS company of our size. These threats continue to evolve in sophistication and volume and are difficult to detect and predict due to advances in electronic warfare techniques,\nnew discoveries in the field of cryptography and new and sophisticated methods used by criminals including phishing, social engineering or other illicit acts. We may experience security breaches introduced through the tools and services we use. For example, in the fourth quarter of 2020, we became aware of reports that an update to widely-used IT infrastructure management software provided by one of our vendors, SolarWinds Corporation, had been compromised by attackers. We have evaluated our internal systems and networks for vulnerable versions of the affected software, and we have detected no indicators of compromise. While we believe we were not negatively affected by this incident, we have invested additional time and resources to evaluate potential impacts, and we continue to monitor our infrastructure, adjust our intrusion detection capabilities, and practice security-by-design principles in our software development lifecycle to help prevent similar incidents. However, there can be no assurances that our defensive measures will prevent cyber-attacks and any incidents could damage our brand and reputation and negatively impact our business.\nBecause data security is a critical competitive factor in our industry, we make numerous statements in our privacy policy and customer agreements, through our certifications to privacy standards and in our marketing materials, providing assurances about the security of our platform including detailed descriptions of security measures we employ. Should any of these statements be untrue or become untrue, even through circumstances beyond our reasonable control, we may face claims of misrepresentation or deceptiveness by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, state and foreign regulators and private litigants. Our errors and omissions insurance coverage covering privacy, security, and data protection damages and claim expenses may not be sufficient to compensate for all liabilities.\nInterruptions or performance problems associated with our software solutions, platform and technology may adversely affect our business and operating results.\nOur continued growth depends in part on the ability of our current and potential customers to access our platform at any time. Our platform is proprietary, and we rely on the expertise of members of our engineering, operations and software development teams for its continued performance. We have experienced, and may in the future experience, disruptions, outages and other performance problems due to a variety of factors, including infrastructure changes, introductions of new functionality, human or software errors, capacity constraints due to an overwhelming number of users accessing our platform simultaneously, denial of service attacks or other security related incidents. In some instances, we may not be able to identify the cause or causes of these performance problems within an acceptable period of time. Because of the seasonal nature of financial close activities, increasing complexity of our platform and expanding user population, it may become difficult to accurately predict and timely address performance and capacity needs during peak load times. If our platform is unavailable or if our users are unable to access it within a reasonable amount of time or at all, our business will be harmed. In addition, our infrastructure does not currently include the real-time mirroring of data. Therefore, in the event of any of the factors described above, or other failures of our infrastructure, customer data may be permanently lost. Our customer agreements typically include performance guarantees and service level standards that obligate us to provide credits in the event of a significant disruption in our platform. To the extent that we do not effectively address capacity constraints, upgrade our systems and continually develop our technology and network architecture to accommodate actual and anticipated changes in technology, our business and operating results may be adversely affected.\nIf our software contains serious errors or defects, we may lose revenue and market acceptance and may incur costs to defend or settle product liability claims.\nComplex software such as ours often contains errors or defects, particularly when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released. Despite internal and third-party testing and testing by our customers, our current and future software may contain serious defects, which could result in lost revenue or a delay in market acceptance.\nSince our customers use our platform for critical business functions such as assisting in the financial close or account reconciliation process, errors, defects or other performance problems could result in damage to our customers. They could seek significant compensation from us for the losses they suffer. Although our customer agreements typically contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to product liability claims, existing or future laws or unfavorable judicial decisions could negate these limitations. Even if not successful, a product liability claim brought against us would likely be time-consuming and costly and could seriously damage our reputation in the marketplace, making it harder for us to sell our products.\nWe depend on our executive officers and other key employees and the loss of one or more of these employees or an inability to attract and retain highly-skilled employees could adversely affect our business.\nOur success depends largely upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key employees. We rely on our leadership team, many of whom are new, in the areas of research and development, operations, security, marketing, sales and general and administrative functions. In particular, our founder and Chief Executive Officer, Therese Tucker, has provided our strategic direction for over nineteen years and has built and maintained what we believe is an attractive workplace culture. In August 2020, our board of directors elected Marc Huffman, our President and Chief Operating Officer, to succeed Therese Tucker as our Chief Executive Officer, effective as of January 1, 2021. This change in our executive management team, and any future changes, resulting from the hiring or departure of executives, could disrupt our business, and could impact our ability to preserve our culture, which could negatively affect our ability to recruit and retain personnel. If we are not successful in managing the transition of our new Chief Executive Officer, it could be viewed negatively by our customers, employees or investors and could have an adverse impact on our business. Further, this change also increases our dependency on other members of our executive management team who remain with us. We do not have employment agreements with our executive officers or other key personnel that require them to continue to work for us for any specified period and, therefore, they could terminate their employment with us at any time. Any such departure could be particularly disruptive in light of the recent leadership transition and to the extent we experience management turnover, competition for top management is high and it may take months to find a candidate that meets our requirements. Accordingly, the loss of one or more of our executive officers or key employees could have an adverse effect on our business.\nIn addition, to execute our growth plan, we must attract and retain highly-qualified personnel. Competition for personnel is intense, especially for engineers experienced in designing and developing software applications, and experienced sales professionals. We have, from time to time experienced, and we expect to continue to experience, difficulty in hiring and retaining employees with appropriate qualifications and this difficulty may be heightened by intensified restrictions on travel and social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic. Many of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater resources than we have. If we hire employees from competitors or other companies, their former employers may attempt to assert that these employees or we have breached legal obligations, resulting in a diversion of our time and resources. Likewise, if competitors hire our employees, we may divert time and resources to deterring any breach by our former employees or their new employers of their respective legal obligations. Given the competitive nature of our industry, we have both received and asserted such claims in the past. In addition, job candidates and existing employees often consider the value of the equity awards they receive in connection with their employment. If the perceived value of our equity awards declines, it may adversely affect our ability to recruit and retain highly-skilled employees. If we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel, our business and growth prospects could be adversely affected.\nIf our industry does not continue to develop as we anticipate or if potential customers do not continue to adopt our platform, our sales will not grow as quickly as expected, or at all, and our business and operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected.\nWe operate in a rapidly evolving industry focused on modernizing financial and accounting operations. Our solutions are relatively new and have been developed to respond to an increasingly global and complex business environment with more rigorous regulatory standards. If organizations do not increasingly allocate their budgets to financial automation software as we expect or if we do not succeed in convincing potential customers that our platform should be an integral part of their overall approach to their accounting processes, our sales may not grow as quickly as anticipated, or at all. Our business is substantially dependent on enterprises recognizing that accounting errors and inefficiencies are pervasive and are not effectively addressed by legacy solutions. The COVID-19 outbreak has adversely affected economies and financial markets globally, with many businesses cutting spending on information technology deemed nonessential. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we have seen certain new and existing customers halt or decrease investment in infrastructure, which has negatively impacted our business, operating results, and financial condition. Future deterioration in general economic conditions, including as a result of COVID-19, or a slow economic recovery, may also cause our customers to cut their overall information technology spending, and such cuts may disproportionately affect software solutions like ours to the extent customers view our solutions as discretionary. If our revenue does not increase for any of these reasons, or any other reason, our business, financial condition and operating results may be materially adversely affected.\nThe market in which we participate is intensely competitive, and if we do not compete effectively, our operating results could be harmed.\nThe market for accounting and financial software and services is highly competitive and rapidly evolving. Our competitors vary in size and in the breadth and scope of the products and services they offer. We often compete with other vendors of financial automation software such as Trintech. We also compete with large, well-established, enterprise application software vendors, such as Oracle, whose Hyperion software contains components that compete with our platform. In the future, a competitor offering ERP software could include a free service similar to ours as part of its standard offerings or may offer a free standalone version of a service similar to ours. Further, other established software vendors not currently focused on accounting and finance software and services, including some of our partners, resellers, and other parties with which we have relationships, may expand their services to compete with us.\nOur competitors may have greater name recognition, longer operating histories, more established customer and marketing relationships, larger marketing budgets and significantly greater resources than we do. They may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards, or customer requirements. In addition, some of our competitors have partnered with, or have acquired, and may in the future partner with or acquire, other competitors to offer services, leveraging their collective competitive positions, which makes, or would make, it more difficult to compete with them.\nWith the introduction of new technologies, the evolution of our platform and new market entrants, we expect competition to intensify in the future. Increased competition generally could result in reduced sales, reduced margins, losses or the failure of our platform to achieve or maintain more widespread market acceptance, any of which could harm our business.\nFailure to effectively organize or expand our sales resources could harm our ability to increase our customer base.\nIncreasing our customer base and sales will depend, to a significant extent, on our ability to effectively organize and expand our sales and marketing operations and activities. At December 31, 2020, our sales and marketing teams included 564 employees. As we\u2019ve grown and scaled our operations, we have aligned our sales team to help streamline the customer experience. We rely on our direct sales force, which includes an account management team, to obtain new customers and to maximize the lifetime value of our customer relationships through retention and upsell efforts. Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to support new and existing customer growth and maintain customer satisfaction. Due to COVID-19, our sales and marketing teams have avoided in-person meetings and have been engaging with customers online and through other communications channels, including virtual meetings. There is no guarantee that our sales and marketing teams will be as successful or effective using these other communications channels as they try to build relationships. If we cannot provide our team with the tools and training to our teams enable them to do their jobs efficiently and satisfy customer demands, we may not be able to achieve anticipated revenue growth as quickly as expected. Moreover, some industries particularly impacted by COVID-19, such as travel, hospitality, retail, or oil and gas have significantly cut or eliminated capital expenditures at this time. As such, we have deemphasized building new relationships with those verticals during the pandemic which could harm our customer base.\nIn addition, we plan to continue to expand our direct sales force both domestically and internationally. We believe that there is significant competition for experienced sales professionals with the sales skills and technical knowledge that we require. Our ability to achieve significant revenue growth will depend, in part, on our success in recruiting, training, and retaining a sufficient number of experienced sales professionals. New hires require significant training and time before they achieve full productivity, particularly in new sales segments and territories. Our recent hires and planned hires may not become as productive as quickly as we expect, and we may be unable to hire or retain sufficient numbers of qualified individuals in the markets where we do business. Our business will be harmed if our sales expansion efforts do not generate a significant increase in revenue.\nIf we are not able to maintain and enhance our brand, our business, operating results and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nWe believe that maintaining and enhancing our reputation for accounting and finance software is critical to our relationships with our existing customers and to our ability to attract new customers. The successful promotion of our brand attributes will depend on a number of factors, including our marketing efforts, our ability to continue to develop high-quality software, and our ability to successfully differentiate our platform from competitive products and services. Our brand promotion activities may not ultimately be successful or yield increased revenue. In addition, independent industry analysts provide reviews of our platform, as well as products and services offered by our competitors, and perception of our platform in the marketplace may be significantly influenced by these reviews. If\nthese reviews are negative, or less positive as compared to those of our competitors\u2019 products and services, our brand may be adversely affected.\nThe promotion of our brand requires us to make substantial expenditures, and we anticipate that the expenditures will increase as our market becomes more competitive, as we expand into new markets and as more sales are generated. To the extent that these activities yield increased revenue, this revenue may not offset the increased expenses we incur. If we do not successfully maintain and enhance our brand, our business may not grow, we may have reduced pricing power relative to competitors, and we could lose customers or fail to attract potential customers, all of which would adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may be unable to integrate acquired businesses and technologies successfully, or achieve the expected benefits of these transactions and other strategic transactions.\nWe regularly evaluate and consider potential strategic transactions, including acquisitions of, or investments in, businesses, technologies, services, products, and other assets. For example, in October 2020, we completed the Rimilia Acquisition, and in 2018, we entered into our Japanese Joint Venture. We also may enter into relationships with other businesses to expand our products and services, which could involve preferred or exclusive licenses, additional channels of distributions or discount pricing.\nNegotiating these transactions can be time-consuming, difficult, and expensive, and our ability to complete these transactions may be subject to approvals that are beyond our control. Consequently, these transactions, even if announced, may not be completed. In connection with a strategic transaction, we may:\n\u2022issue additional equity or convertible debt securities that would dilute our existing stockholders;\n\u2022use cash that we may need in the future to operate our business;\n\u2022incur large charges or substantial liabilities;\n\u2022incur debt on terms unfavorable to us or that we are unable to repay; or\n\u2022become subject to adverse tax consequences, substantial depreciation, and amortization, or deferred compensation charges.\nAny future acquisition, investment or business relationship may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures. In particular, we may encounter difficulties assimilating or integrating the businesses, technologies, products, personnel or operations of the acquired companies, particularly if the key personnel of the acquired company choose not to work for us, their software is not easily adapted to work with our platform, or we have difficulty retaining the customers of any acquired business due to changes in ownership, management or otherwise. Acquisitions may also disrupt our business, divert our resources, and require significant management attention that would otherwise be available for development of our existing business. Moreover, the anticipated benefits of any acquisition, investment, or business relationship may not be realized or we may be exposed to unknown risks or liabilities.\nIncorrect or improper implementation or use of our solutions could result in customer dissatisfaction and negatively affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and growth prospects.\nOur platform is deployed in a wide variety of technology environments and into a broad range of complex workflows. Our platform has been integrated into large-scale, enterprise-wide technology environments, and specialized use cases, and our success depends on our ability to implement our platform successfully in these environments. We often assist our customers in implementing our platform, but many customers attempt to implement even complex deployments themselves or use a third-party service firm. If we or our customers are unable to implement our platform successfully, or are unable to do so in a timely manner, customer perceptions of our platform and company may be impaired, our reputation and brand may suffer, and customers may choose not to renew or expand the use of our platform.\nOur customers and third-party resellers may need training in the proper use of our platform to maximize its potential. If our platform is not implemented or used correctly or as intended, including if customers input incorrect or incomplete financial data into our platform, inadequate performance may result. Because our customers rely on our platform to manage their financial close and other financial tasks, the incorrect or improper implementation or use of our platform, our failure to train customers on how to efficiently and effectively use our platform, or our failure to provide adequate product support to our customers, may result in negative publicity or legal claims against us.\nAlso, as we continue to expand our customer base, any failure by us to properly provide these services will likely result in lost opportunities for additional subscriptions to our platform.\nAny failure to offer high-quality product support may adversely affect our relationships with our customers and our financial results.\nIn deploying and using our solutions, our customers depend on our support services team to resolve complex technical and operational issues. We may be unable to respond quickly enough to accommodate short-term increases in customer demand for product support. We also may be unable to modify the nature, scope and delivery of our product support to compete with changes in product support services provided by our competitors. Increased customer demand for product support, without corresponding revenue, could increase costs and adversely affect our operating results. Our sales are highly dependent on our business reputation and on positive recommendations from our existing customers. Any failure to maintain high-quality product support, or a market perception that we do not maintain high-quality product support, could adversely affect our reputation, our ability to sell our solutions to existing and prospective customers, our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nUnfavorable conditions in our industry or the global economy could limit our ability to grow our business and negatively affect our operating results.\nOur operating results may vary based on the impact of changes in our industry or the global economy on us or our customers. General macro-economic conditions, such as a recession or economic slowdown in the United States or internationally, could adversely affect demand for our products and make it difficult to accurately forecast and plan our future business activities. For example, as a result of the impact of COVID-19, current and potential customers have delayed and deferred purchasing decisions and there has been a deterioration in the near-term demand. The revenue growth and potential profitability of our business depend on demand for business software applications and services generally and for accounting and finance systems in particular. Services may decrease sequentially as new implementation projects are delayed. Weak economic conditions affect the rate of accounting and finance and information technology spending and could adversely affect our current or potential customers\u2019 ability or willingness to purchase our cloud platform, delay purchasing decisions, reduce the value or duration of their subscription contracts, or affect attrition rates, all of which could adversely affect our operating results. Prolonged economic uncertainties relating to COVID-19 could limit our ability to grow our business and negatively affect our operating results. If economic conditions deteriorate, our customers and prospective customers may elect to decrease their accounting and finance and information technology budgets, which would limit our ability to grow our business and negatively affect our operating results. For example, the impact of COVID-19 on the current economic environment has caused customers to request concessions, including extended payment terms, free modules or better pricing.\nIn addition, our customers may be affected by changes in trade policies, treaties, government regulations and tariffs. Trade protection measures, retaliatory actions, tariffs and increased barriers, policies favoring domestic industries, or increased import or export licensing requirements or restrictions could have a negative effect on the overall macro economy and our customers, which could have an adverse impact on our operating results.\nTo the extent conditions in the national and global economy change, our business could be harmed as current and potential customers may reduce or postpone spending or choose not to purchase or renew subscriptions to our products, which they may consider discretionary. For example, Brexit continues to cause significant political and economic uncertainty in both the UK and the EU. As a result, the level of economic activity generally in this region could be adversely impacted, negatively affecting our customers' use of our products and our operating results.\nUncertain economic conditions may also adversely affect third parties with which we have entered into relationships and upon which we depend in order to grow our business. As a result, we may be unable to continue to grow in the event of future economic slowdowns.\nWe provide service level commitments under our customer contracts, and if we fail to meet these contractual commitments, our revenues could be adversely affected.\nOur customer agreements typically provide service level commitments. If we are unable to meet the stated service level commitments or suffer extended periods of unavailability for our applications, we may be contractually obligated to provide these customers with service credits, refunds for prepaid amounts related to unused subscription services, or we could face contract terminations. Our revenues could be significantly affected if we suffer unscheduled downtime that exceeds the allowed downtimes under our agreements with our customers. Any extended service outages could adversely affect our reputation, revenues and operating results.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Performance or Results\nWe have a history of losses and we may not be able to generate sufficient revenue to achieve or sustain profitability.\nWe have incurred net losses attributable to BlackLine, Inc. in recent periods, including $46.9 million, $32.5 million, and $28.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. We had an accumulated deficit of $201.7 million at December 31, 2020. We may not be able to generate sufficient revenue to achieve and sustain profitability. We also expect our costs to increase in future periods as we continue to expend substantial financial and other resources on:\n\u2022development of our cloud-based platform, including investments in research and development, product innovation to expand the features and functionality of our software solutions and improvements to the scalability and security of our platform;\n\u2022sales and marketing, including expansion of our direct sales force and our relationships with technology vendors, professional services firms, business process outsourcers and resellers;\n\u2022additional international expansion in an effort to increase our customer base and sales; and\n\u2022general administration, including legal, accounting and other expenses related to being a public company.\nThese investments may not result in increased revenue or growth of our business or any growth in revenue and may not be sufficient to offset the expense and may harm our profitability. If we fail to continue to grow our revenue, we may not achieve or sustain profitability.\nOur quarterly results may fluctuate, and if we fail to meet the expectations of analysts or investors, our stock price and the value of your investment could decline substantially.\nOur quarterly financial results may fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control. If our quarterly financial results fall below the expectations of investors or any securities analysts who may follow our stock, the price of our common stock could decline substantially. Some of the important factors that may cause our revenue, operating results and cash flows to fluctuate from quarter to quarter include:\n\u2022our ability to attract new customers and retain and increase sales to existing customers;\n\u2022the number of new employees added;\n\u2022the rate of expansion and productivity of our sales force;\n\u2022long sales cycles and the timing of large contracts;\n\u2022changes in our or our competitors\u2019 pricing policies;\n\u2022the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures related to the operations and expansion of our business;\n\u2022new products, features or functionalities introduced by us and our competitors;\n\u2022significant security breaches, technical difficulties or interruptions to our platform;\n\u2022the timing of customer payments and payment defaults by customers;\n\u2022general economic conditions that may adversely affect either our customers\u2019 ability or willingness to purchase additional products or services, delay a prospective customer\u2019s purchasing decision or affect customer retention, including the effects of COVID-19;\n\u2022changes in foreign currency exchange rates;\n\u2022the impact of new accounting pronouncements;\n\u2022the impact and timing of taxes or changes in tax law;\n\u2022the timing and the amount of grants or vesting of equity awards to employees;\n\u2022seasonality of our business; and\n\u2022changes in customer buying patterns.\nMany of these factors are outside of our control, and the occurrence of one or more of them might cause our revenue, operating results, and cash flows to vary widely. As such, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our revenue, operating results and cash flows may not be meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance.\nWe typically add fewer customers in the first quarter of the year than other quarters. We also experience a higher volume of sales at the end of each quarter and year, which is often the result of buying decisions by our customers. Seasonality may be reflected to a much lesser extent, and sometimes may not be immediately apparent, in our revenue, due to the fact that we recognize subscription revenue over the term of our agreements. We may also increase expenses in a period in anticipation of future revenues. Changes in the number of customers and users in different periods will cause fluctuations in our financial metrics and, to a lesser extent, revenues. Those changes and fluctuations in our expenses will affect our results on a quarterly basis, and will make forecasting our operating results and financial metrics difficult.\nOur financial results may fluctuate due to our long and increasingly variable sales cycle.\nOur sales cycle generally varies in duration between four to nine months and, in some cases, even longer depending on the size of the potential customer, the size of the potential contract and the type of solution or product being purchased. The sales cycle for our global enterprise customers is generally longer than that of our mid-market customers. In addition, the length of the sales cycle tends to increase for larger contracts and for more complex, strategic products like Intercompany Hub. As we continue to focus on increasing our average contract size and selling more strategic products, we expect our sales cycle to lengthen and become less predictable. This could cause variability in our operating results for any particular period.\nA number of other factors that may influence the length and variability of our sales cycle include:\n\u2022the need to educate potential customers about the uses and benefits of our software solutions;\n\u2022the need to educate potential customers on the differences between traditional, on-premise software and SaaS solutions;\n\u2022the relatively long duration of the commitment customers make in their agreements with us;\n\u2022the discretionary nature and timing of potential customers\u2019 purchasing and budget cycles and decisions;\n\u2022the competitive nature of potential customers\u2019 evaluation and purchasing processes;\n\u2022announcements or planned introductions of new products by us or our competitors; and\n\u2022lengthy purchasing approval processes of potential customers.\nWe may incur higher costs and longer sales cycles as a result of large enterprises representing an increased portion of our revenue. In this market, the decision to subscribe to our solutions may require the approval of more technical and information security personnel and management levels within a potential customer\u2019s organization, and if so, these types of sales require us to invest more time educating these potential customers. In addition, larger organizations may demand more features and integration services and have increased purchasing power and leverage in negotiating contractual arrangements with us, which may contain restrictive terms favorable to the larger organization. As a result of these factors, these sales opportunities may require us to devote greater research and development, sales, product support and professional services resources to individual customers, resulting in increased costs and reduced profitability, and would likely lengthen our typical sales cycle, which could strain our resources.\nIn addition, more sales are closed in the last month of a quarter than other times. If we are unable to close sufficient transactions in a particular period, or if a significant amount of transactions are delayed until a subsequent\nperiod, our operating results for that period, and for any future periods in which revenue from such transaction would otherwise have been recognized, may be adversely affected.\nWe recognize subscription revenue over the term of our customer contracts and, consequently, downturns or upturns in new sales may not be immediately reflected in our operating results and may be difficult to discern.\nWe recognize subscription revenue from our platform ratably over the terms of our customers\u2019 agreements, most of which have one-year terms but an increasing number of which have up to three-year terms. As a result, most of the revenue we report in each quarter is derived from the recognition of deferred revenue related to subscriptions entered into during previous quarters. Consequently, a decline in new or renewed subscriptions in any single quarter may have a small impact on our revenue results for that quarter. However, such a decline will negatively affect our revenue in future quarters. Accordingly, the effect of significant downturns in sales and market acceptance of our platform, and potential changes in our pricing policies or rate of expansion or retention, may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods. We may also be unable to reduce our cost structure in line with a significant deterioration in sales. In addition, a significant majority of our costs are expensed as incurred, while revenue is recognized over the life of the agreement with our customer. As a result, increased growth in the number of our customers could continue to result in our recognition of more costs than revenue in the earlier periods of the terms of our agreements. Our subscription model also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue through additional sales in any period, as revenue from new customers must be recognized over the applicable subscription term.\nWe face exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations that could harm our results of operations.\nWe conduct transactions, particularly intercompany transactions, in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, primarily the British pound and the Euro. As we grow our international operations, we expect the amount of our revenues that are denominated in foreign currencies to increase in the future. Accordingly, changes in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar could affect our revenue and operating results due to transactional and translational remeasurements that are reflected in our results of operations. As a result of such foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, it could be more difficult to detect underlying trends in our business and results of operations. In addition, to the extent that fluctuations in currency exchange rates cause our results of operations to differ from our expectations or the expectations of our investors, the trading price of our common stock could be adversely affected.\nAdditionally, Brexit has and may continue to adversely impacted global markets and foreign currencies. In particular, the value of the British pound declined as compared to the U.S. dollar and other currencies. This volatility in foreign currencies is expected to continue as the United Kingdom completes its exit from the EU, but it is uncertain over what time period this will occur. A significantly weaker British pound compared to the U.S. dollar could have a negative effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe do not currently maintain a program to hedge transactional exposures in foreign currencies. However, in the future, we may use derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The use of such hedging activities may not offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place. Moreover, the use of hedging instruments may introduce additional risks if we are unable to structure effective hedges with such instruments.\nIf our goodwill or intangible assets become impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings.\nWe review our goodwill and intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least annually. At December 31, 2020, we had goodwill and intangible assets with a net book value of $336.4 million primarily related to acquisitions. An adverse change in market conditions, particularly if such change has the effect of changing one of our critical assumptions or estimates, could result in a change to the estimation of fair value that could result in an impairment charge to our goodwill or intangible assets. Any such charges may have a material negative impact on our operating results.\nOur ability to use our net operating losses to offset future taxable income may be subject to limitations.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards (\u201cNOLs\u201d) of $188.7 million and $98.2 million, respectively. In general, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d) a corporation that undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its NOLs to offset future taxable income. Our existing NOLs may be subject to limitations arising from previous ownership changes, and if we undergo an ownership change, our ability to utilize NOLs could be further limited by Section 382 of the Code. Future changes in our stock ownership, some of which are outside of our control, could result in an ownership change under Section 382 of the Code. Furthermore, our ability to utilize NOLs of companies that we may acquire in the future may be subject to limitations. There is also a risk that due to regulatory changes, such as suspensions on the use of NOLs, or other unforeseen reasons, our existing NOLs could expire or otherwise be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities. For example, California has recently passed legislation limiting the use of NOLs for taxable years 2020, 2021, and 2022. For these reasons, we may not be able to realize a tax benefit from the use of our NOLs, whether or not we attain profitability. The legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, as modified by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, includes changes to the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate and changes to the rules governing the deductibility of certain NOLs, and our NOLs and other deferred tax assets have been revalued at the newly enacted rate and according to the new rules. The revaluation did not have a material impact on our consolidated balance sheet and consolidated statement of operations because we currently maintain a full valuation allowance on our U.S. deferred tax assets.\nRisks Related to Our Dependence on Third Parties\nIf our relationships with technology vendors and business process outsourcers are not successful, our business and growth will be harmed.\nWe depend on, and anticipate that we will continue to depend on, various strategic relationships in order to sustain and grow our business. We have established strong relationships with technology vendors such as SAP and NetSuite to market our solutions to users of their ERP solutions, and professional services firms such as Deloitte, Ernst & Young, and KPMG, and business process outsourcers such as Cognizant, Genpact and IBM to supplement delivery and implementation of our applications. We believe these relationships enable us to effectively market our solutions by offering a complementary suite of services. In particular, our solution integrates with SAP\u2019s ERP solutions. In the fourth quarter of 2018, SAP became part of the reseller channel that we use in the ordinary course of business. SAP has the ability to resell our solutions as an SAP solution-extension (\u201cSolEx\u201d), for which we receive a percentage of the revenues. Since October 1, 2018, we are no longer obligated to pay SAP a fee based on a percentage of revenues from our customers that use an SAP ERP solution. If we are unsuccessful in maintaining our relationship with SAP, if our reseller arrangement with SAP is less successful than we anticipate, if our customers that use an SAP ERP solution do not renew their subscriptions directly with us and instead purchase our solution through the SAP reseller channel or if we are unsuccessful in supporting or expanding our relationships with other companies, our business would be adversely affected. As a result of COVID-19, we also expect delays coming from our SAP and SolEx partnerships, which could harm our business. We also expect services revenue to decrease as new implementation projects are delayed.\nIdentifying, negotiating and documenting relationships with other companies require significant time and resources. Our agreements with technology vendors are typically limited in duration, non-exclusive, cancellable upon notice and do not prohibit the counterparties from working with our competitors or from offering competing services. For example, our agreement with SAP can be terminated by either party upon six months\u2019 notice and there is no assurance that our relationship with SAP will continue. If our solution is no longer resold by SAP as a solution extension, our business could be adversely affected. Our competitors may be effective in providing incentives to third parties to favor their products or services or to prevent or reduce subscriptions to our platform. If we are unsuccessful in establishing or maintaining our relationships, or if the counterparties to our relationships offer competing solutions, our ability to compete in the marketplace or to grow our revenue could be impaired and our operating results could suffer. Even if we are successful, we cannot assure you that these relationships will result in improved operating results.\nWe rely on Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Microsoft Azure (Azure), and third-party data centers (collectively, \u201cpublic cloud providers\u201d) to deliver our cloud-based software solutions, and any disruption of our use of public cloud providers could negatively impact our operations and harm our business.\nWe manage our software solutions and serve most of our customers using a cloud-based infrastructure that has historically been operated in a limited number of third-party data center facilities in North America and Europe.\nWe are developing plans to migrate some of our third-party data centers to GCP, increasing our reliance on this cloud provider. Additionally, we rely on Azure to serve Rimilia customers. As we implement the transition to GCP, there could be occasional planned or unplanned downtime for our cloud-based software solutions and potential service delays, all of which will impact our customers\u2019 ability to use our solutions. We may also need to divert resources away from other important business operations, which could harm our business and growth. Additionally, if the costs to migrate to GCP are greater than we expect or take significantly more time than we anticipate, our business could be harmed.\nWe do not control the operation of our public cloud providers. Any changes in third-party service levels or any disruptions or delays from errors, defects, hacking incidents, security breaches, computer viruses, DDoS attacks, bad acts or performance problems could harm our reputation, damage our customers\u2019 businesses, and adversely affect our business and operating results. Our public cloud providers are also vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, fires, war, public health crises, such as COVID-19, terrorist attacks, power losses, hardware failures, systems failures, telecommunications failures and similar events. We may have limited remedies against third-party providers in the event of any service disruptions. If our third-party public cloud providers are compromised or unavailable or our customers are unable to access our solutions for any reason, our business would be materially and adversely affected.\nOur customers have experienced minor disruptions and outages in accessing our solutions in the past, and may experience disruptions, outages, and other performance problems. Although we expend considerable effort to ensure that our platform performance is capable of handling existing and increased traffic levels, the ability of our cloud-based solutions to effectively manage any increased capacity requirements depends on our public cloud providers. Our public cloud providers may not be able to meet such performance requirements, especially to cover peak levels or spikes in traffic, and as a result, our customers may experience delays in accessing our solutions or encounter slower performance in our solutions, which could significantly harm the operations of our customers. Interruptions in our services might reduce our revenue, cause us to issue credits to customers, subject us to potential liability, and cause customers to terminate their subscriptions or harm our renewal rates.\nIf we do not accurately predict our infrastructure capacity requirements, our customers could experience service shortfalls. The provisioning of additional cloud hosting capacity requires lead time. As we continue to restructure our data management plans, and increase our cloud hosting capacity, we have and expect to in the future move or transfer our data and our customers\u2019 data. Despite precautions taken during such processes and procedures, any unsuccessful data transfers may impair the delivery of our service, and we may experience costs or downtime in connection with the transfer of data to other facilities which may lead to, among other things, customer dissatisfaction and non-renewals. GCP and Azure have no obligations to renew their agreements with us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. If GCP or Azure increases pricing terms, terminates or seeks to terminate our contractual relationship, establishes more favorable relationships with our competitors, or changes or interprets their terms of service or policies in a manner that is unfavorable with respect to us, we may be required to transfer to other providers. If we are required to transfer to other providers, we would incur significant costs and experience possible service interruption in connection with doing so.\nIf we are unable to develop and maintain successful relationships with resellers, our business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nWe believe that continued growth in our business is dependent upon identifying, developing, and maintaining strategic relationships with companies that resell our solutions. We plan to expand our growing network of resellers and to add new resellers, in particular to help grow our mid-market business globally. Our agreements with our existing resellers are non-exclusive, meaning resellers may offer customers the products of several different companies, including products that compete with ours. They may also cease marketing our solutions with limited or no notice and with little or no penalty. We expect that any additional resellers we identify and develop will be similarly non-exclusive and not bound by any requirement to continue to market our solutions. If we fail to identify additional resellers in a timely and cost-effective manner, or at all, or are unable to assist our current and future resellers in independently selling our solutions, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be adversely affected. If resellers do not effectively market and sell our solutions, or fail to meet the needs of our customers, our reputation and ability to grow our business may also be adversely affected.\nWe depend and rely upon SaaS applications from third parties to operate our business and interruptions or performance problems with these technologies may adversely affect our business and operating results.\nWe rely heavily upon SaaS applications from third parties in order to operate critical functions of our business, including billing and order management, enterprise resource planning, and financial accounting services. If these services become unavailable due to extended outages, interruptions, or because they are no longer available on commercially reasonable terms, our expenses could increase, our ability to manage finances could be interrupted and our processes for managing sales of our solutions and supporting our customers could be impaired until equivalent services, if available, are identified, obtained, and implemented, all of which could adversely affect our business.\nWe rely on third-party computer hardware and software that may be difficult to replace or which could cause errors or failures of our software solutions.\nWe rely on computer hardware purchased or leased and software licensed from third parties, including third-party SaaS applications, in order to deliver our software solutions. This hardware and software may not continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Any loss of the right to use any of this hardware or software could result in delaying or preventing our ability to provide our software solutions until equivalent technology is either developed by us or, if available, identified, obtained and integrated. In addition, errors or defects in third-party hardware or software used in our software solutions could result in errors or a failure, which could damage our reputation, impede our ability to provide our platform or process information, and adversely affect our business.\nRisks Related to Our Legal and Regulatory Environment\nOur long-term success depends, in part, on our ability to expand the sales of our solutions to customers located outside of the United States, and thus our business is susceptible to risks associated with international sales and operations.\nWe currently maintain offices and/or have sales personnel in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Hong Kong, the Netherlands, Poland, Romania, Singapore, and the United Kingdom, and we intend to build out our international operations. As part of our ongoing international expansion strategy, in August 2016, we acquired Runbook Company B.V. (\"Runbook\"), a Netherlands-based provider of financial close automation software solutions to SAP customers, which is referred to as the \"Runbook Acquisition\". Additionally, in September 2018, we entered into an agreement with Japanese Cloud Computing and M30 LLC to engage in a joint venture that is focused on the sale of our products in Japan (the \u201cJapanese Joint Venture\u201d). In October 2020, we completed the Rimilia Acquisition, a United Kingdom-based provider of accounts receivable automation solutions that enable organizations to control cash flow and cash collection in real time. We derived approximately 25%, 23%, and 21% of our revenues from sales outside the United States in the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. Any international expansion efforts that we may undertake, including our Runbook Acquisition, our Japanese Joint Venture and our Rimilia Acquisition, may not be successful. In addition, conducting international operations in new markets subjects us to new risks that we have not generally faced in the United States. These risks include:\n\u2022localization of our solutions, including translation into foreign languages and adaptation for local practices and regulatory requirements;\n\u2022lack of familiarity and burdens of complying with foreign laws, legal standards, regulatory requirements, tariffs and other barriers;\n\u2022unexpected changes in regulatory requirements, taxes, trade laws, tariffs, export quotas, custom duties or other trade restrictions;\n\u2022differing technology standards;\n\u2022longer accounts receivable payment cycles and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable;\n\u2022difficulties in managing and staffing international operations and differing employer/employee relationships;\n\u2022fluctuations in exchange rates that may increase the volatility of our foreign-based revenue;\n\u2022potentially adverse tax consequences, including the complexities of foreign value-added tax (or other tax) systems and restrictions on the repatriation of earnings;\n\u2022uncertain political and economic climates, including the significant volatility in the global financial markets;\n\u2022the impact of natural disasters and public health pandemics, such as COVID-19, on employees, customers, partners, third-party contractors, travel and the global economy; and\n\u2022reduced or varied protection for intellectual property rights in some countries.\nThese factors may cause our international costs of doing business to exceed our comparable domestic costs. Operating in international markets also requires significant management attention and financial resources. Any negative impact from our international business efforts could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition as a whole.\nWe use third-party contractors outside of the United States to supplement our research and development capabilities, which may expose us to risks, including risks inherent in foreign operations.\nWe use third-party contractors outside of the United States to supplement our research and development capabilities. We currently use third-party contractors located in Romania, India, and China. Outbreaks of pandemic diseases, such as COVID-19, or the fear of such events, have required us to shut down certain workplaces, which could decrease productivity and increase reliance on remote solutions, which present different security challenges. Managing operations that are remote from our U.S. headquarters is difficult and we may not be able to manage these third-party contractors successfully. If we fail to maintain productive relationships with these contractors generally, we may be required to develop our solutions in a less efficient and cost-effective manner and our product release schedules may be delayed while we hire software developers or find alternative contract development resources. Additionally, while we take precautions to ensure that software components developed by our third-party contractors are reviewed and that our source code is protected, misconduct by our third-party contractors could result in infringement or misappropriation of our intellectual property. Furthermore, any acts of espionage, malware attacks, theft of confidential information or other privacy, security, or data protection incidents attributed to our third-party contractors may compromise our system infrastructure, expose us to litigation and lead to reputational harm that could result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results.\nPrivacy and data security concerns, and data collection and transfer restrictions and related domestic or foreign regulations may limit the use and adoption of our solutions and adversely affect our business.\nPrivacy, security, and data protection are significant issues in the United States, Europe and many other jurisdictions where we offer our platform. The regulatory framework governing the collection, processing, storage and use of business information, particularly information that affects financial statements, and personal data, is rapidly evolving and any failure or perceived failure to comply with applicable privacy, security, or data protection laws or regulations may adversely affect our business.\nThe U.S. federal and various state and foreign governments have adopted or proposed requirements regarding the collection, distribution, use, security and storage of personally identifiable information and other data related to individuals, and federal and state consumer protection laws are being applied to enforce regulations related to the online collection, use and dissemination of data. Some of these requirements include obligations on companies to notify individuals of security breaches involving particular personal information, which could result from breaches experienced by us or by organizations with which we have formed strategic relationships. Even though we may have contractual protections with such organizations, notifications related to a security breach could impact our reputation, harm customer confidence, hurt our expansion into new markets or cause us to lose existing customers.\nFurther, many foreign countries and governmental bodies, including the European Union (the \u201cEU\u201d), where we conduct business and have offices or utilize vendors, have laws and regulations concerning the collection and use of personal data obtained from their residents or by businesses operating within their jurisdiction. These laws and regulations often are more restrictive than those in the United States. Laws and regulations in these jurisdictions apply broadly to the collection, use, storage, disclosure and security of data that identifies or may be used to identify or locate an individual, such as names, email addresses and, in some jurisdictions, Internet Protocol, or IP, addresses. With regard to data transfers of personal data from our European employees and customers to the United States, we have historically relied upon EU-U.S. Privacy Shield and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield certifications for the transfer of personal data from the EU and Switzerland to the United States. The \u201cSchrems II\u201d decision issued by the Court of Justice of the European Union (\"ECJ\") on July 16, 2020 invalidated use of the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield as a valid mechanism for transfer of personal data of EU data subjects from the EU to the United States. We have begun putting in place the EU Standard Contractual Clauses with our clients per the guidance of the ECJ in\nthe Schrems II ruling. We may, in addition to other impacts, experience additional costs associated with increased compliance burdens following the Schrems II decision, and we and our customers face the potential for regulators in the EEA to apply different standards to the transfer of personal data from the EEA to the United States, and to block, or require ad hoc verification of measures taken with respect to, certain data flows from the EEA to the United States. We also may be required to engage in new contract negotiations with third parties that aid in processing data on our behalf. Our means for transferring personal data from the EU and Switzerland may not be adopted by all of our customers and may be subject to legal challenge by data protection authorities. We may also experience reluctance or refusal by European customers to use our solutions due to potential risk exposure. We and our customers face a risk of enforcement actions taken by EU and Swiss data protection authorities regarding data transfers from the EU and Switzerland to the United States. Any such enforcement actions could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources, distract management and technical personnel and negatively affect our business, operating results and financial condition. In China, we continue to monitor legal and government advisory developments regarding the Chinese Cybersecurity Law and Draft Cybersecurity Review Measures for impacts to our business related to cross-border transfer limitations and evolving privacy, security, or data protection requirements.\nWe also expect laws, regulations and industry standards to be proposed, enacted, and otherwise established concerning privacy, security, and data protection in the United States, the EU, and other jurisdictions. For example, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (the \u201cGDPR\u201d), which became effective on May 25, 2018 imposes stringent EU data protection requirements for processors and controllers of personal data. As a regulation, the GDPR applies throughout all EU member states but permits member states to enact supplemental requirements in certain areas. Noncompliance with the GDPR can trigger penalties up to \u20ac20 million or 4% of global annual revenues, whichever is higher. Further, the European Commission and the United Kingdom government announced an EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement on December 24, 2020, providing for a temporary free flow of personal data between the EU and the United Kingdom, but it remains to be seen how the United Kingdom\u2019s withdrawal from the EU will impact the manner in which United Kingdom data protection laws or regulations will develop and how data transfers to and from the United Kingdom will be regulated and enforced by the UK Information Commissioner\u2019s Office, EU data protection authorities, or other regulatory bodies in the longer term.\nAdditionally, several states have begun enacting new data privacy laws. For example, California recently enacted legislation, the California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d), that, among other things, requires covered companies to provide new disclosures to California consumers, and afford such consumers new abilities to opt out of certain sales of personal information. The CCPA became effective on January 1, 2020. The CCPA has been amended on multiple occasions and additional regulations of the California Attorney General came into effect on August 14, 2020. However, aspects of the CCPA and its interpretation remain unclear. The effects of the CCPA are significant and may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and to incur substantial costs and expenses in an effort to comply. Moreover, a new privacy law, the California Privacy Rights Act (\u201cCPRA\u201d) was recently approved by California voters in connection with the election on November 3, 2020. The CPRA creates obligations relating to consumer data beginning on January 1, 2022, with implementing regulations expected on or before July 1, 2022, and enforcement beginning July 1, 2023. The CPRA significantly modifies the CCPA, potentially resulting in further uncertainty and requiring us to incur additional costs and expenses in an effort to comply. We cannot yet determine the impact these laws and regulations or any future laws, regulations and standards may have on our business. Such laws, regulations and standards are often subject to differing interpretations and may be inconsistent among jurisdictions. These and other requirements could reduce demand for our service, increase our costs, impair our ability to grow our business, or restrict our ability to store and process data or, in some cases, impact our ability to offer our service in some locations and may subject us to liability. Further, in view of new or modified federal, state or foreign laws and regulations, industry standards, contractual obligations and other legal obligations, or any changes in their interpretation, we may find it necessary or desirable to fundamentally change our business activities and practices or to expend significant resources to modify our software or platform and otherwise adapt to these changes. We may be unable to make such changes and modifications in a commercially reasonable manner or at all, and our ability to develop new products and features could be limited.\nOur customers also expect that we comply with regulatory standards that may place additional burdens on us. Our customers expect us to meet voluntary certifications or adhere to standards established by third parties, such as the SSAE 18, SOC1 and SOC2 audit processes, and may demand that they be provided a report from our auditors that we are in compliance. If we are unable to maintain these certifications or meet these standards, it could adversely affect our customers\u2019 demand for our service and could harm our business.\nThe costs of compliance with and other burdens imposed by laws, regulations and standards may limit the use and adoption of our service and reduce overall demand for it, or lead to significant fines, penalties or liabilities for any noncompliance. Privacy, security, and data protection concerns, whether valid or not valid, may inhibit market adoption of our platform, particularly in certain industries and foreign countries.\nWe are subject to governmental export and import controls that could impair our ability to compete in international markets due to licensing requirements and subject us to liability if we are not in full compliance with applicable laws.\nOur solutions are subject to export controls, including the Commerce Department\u2019s Export Administration Regulations and various economic and trade sanctions regulations established by the Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control. Obtaining the necessary authorizations, including any required license, for a particular export or sale may be time-consuming, is not guaranteed, and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities. The U.S. export control laws and economic sanctions laws prohibit the export, re-export or transfer of specific products and services to U.S. embargoed or sanctioned countries, governments and persons. Even though we take precautions to prevent our solutions from being provided to U.S. sanctions targets, our solutions could be sold by resellers or could be used by persons in sanctioned countries despite such precautions. Failure to comply with the U.S. export control, sanctions and import laws could have negative consequences, including government investigations, penalties and reputational harm. We and our employees could be subject to civil or criminal penalties, including the possible loss of export or import privileges, fines, and, in extreme cases, the incarceration of responsible employees or managers. In addition, if our resellers fail to obtain appropriate import, export or re-export licenses or authorizations, we may also be adversely affected through reputational harm and penalties.\nIn addition, various countries regulate the import of encryption technology, including through import permitting/licensing requirements, and have enacted laws that could limit our ability to distribute our solutions or could limit our customers\u2019 ability to implement or access our solutions in those countries. Changes in our solutions or changes in export and import regulations may create delays in the introduction and sale of our solutions in international markets, prevent our customers with international operations from accessing our solutions or, in some cases, preventing the export or import of our solutions to some countries, governments or persons altogether. Any change in export or import regulations, economic sanctions or related laws, shift in the enforcement or scope of existing regulations, or change in the countries, governments, persons or technologies targeted by such regulations, could result in decreased use of our solutions, or in our decreased ability to export or sell our solutions to current or potential customers with international operations. Any decreased use of our solutions or limitation on our ability to export or sell our solutions would likely adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in laws and regulations related to the internet and cloud computing or changes to internet infrastructure may diminish the demand for our solutions, and could have a negative impact on our business.\nThe success of our business depends upon the continued use of the internet as a primary medium for commerce, communication, and business applications. Federal, state, or foreign government bodies or agencies have in the past adopted, and may in the future adopt, laws or regulations affecting the use of the internet as a commercial medium. Regulators in some industries have also adopted, and may in the future adopt regulations or interpretive positions regarding the use of SaaS and cloud computing solutions. For example, some financial services regulators have imposed guidelines for the use of cloud computing services that mandate specific controls or require financial services enterprises to obtain regulatory approval prior to utilizing such software. Changes in these laws or regulations could require us to modify our solutions in order to comply with these changes. In addition, government agencies or private organizations have imposed and may impose additional taxes, fees, or other charges for accessing the internet or commerce conducted via the internet. These laws or charges could limit the growth of internet-related commerce or communications generally, or result in reductions in the demand for internet-based solutions and services such as ours. In addition, the use of the internet as a business tool could be adversely affected due to delays in the development or adoption of new standards and protocols to handle increased demands of internet activity, security, reliability, cost, ease-of-use, accessibility, and quality of service. The performance of the internet and its acceptance as a business tool has been adversely affected by \u201cviruses,\u201d \u201cworms,\u201d and similar malicious programs and the internet has experienced a variety of outages and other delays as a result of damage to portions of its infrastructure. If the use of the internet is adversely affected by these issues, demand for our solutions could decline.\nThe adoption of any laws or regulations adversely affecting the growth, popularity or use of the Internet, including laws impacting Internet neutrality, could decrease the demand for our products and increase our operating\ncosts. The current legislative and regulatory landscape regarding the regulation of the Internet and, in particular, Internet neutrality, in the United States is subject to uncertainty. The Federal Communications Commission had previously passed Open Internet rules in February 2015, which generally provided for Internet neutrality with respect to fixed and mobile broadband Internet service. On December 14, 2017, the Federal Communications Commission voted to repeal Open Internet rules generally providing for Internet neutrality with respect to fixed and mobile broadband Internet service regulations and return to a \u201clight-touch\u201d regulatory framework known as the \u201cRestoring Internet Freedom Order.\u201d The FCC\u2019s new rules, which took effect on June 11, 2018, repealed the neutrality obligations imposed by the 2015 rules and granted providers of broadband internet access services greater freedom to make changes to their services, including, potentially, changes that may discriminate against or otherwise harm our business. However, a number of parties have appealed this order. The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals recently upheld the FCC\u2019s repeal, but ordered the FCC to reconsider certain elements of the repeal; thus the future impact of the FCC's repeal and any changes thereto remains uncertain. In addition, in September 2018, California enacted the California Internet Consumer Protection and Net Neutrality Act of 2018, making California the fourth state to enact a state-level net neutrality law since the FCC repealed its nationwide regulations. This act mandated that all broadband services in California be provided in accordance with California's net neutrality requirements. The U.S. Department of Justice has sued to block the law going into effect, and California has agreed to delay enforcement until the resolution of the FCC's repeal of the federal rules. A number of other states are considering legislation or execution action that would regulate the conduct of broadband providers. In its recent decision on the FCC\u2019s repeal, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals also ruled that the FCC does not have the authority to bar states from passing their own net neutrality rules. It is uncertain whether the FCC will argue that some state net neutrality laws are preempted by federal law and challenge such state net neutrality laws on a case-by-case basis. We cannot predict whether the FCC order or state initiatives will be modified, overturned or vacated by legal action. Additional changes in the legislative and regulatory landscape regarding Internet neutrality, or otherwise regarding the regulation of the Internet, could also harm our business.\nOur international operations subject us to potentially adverse tax consequences.\nWe report our taxable income in various jurisdictions worldwide based upon our business operations in those jurisdictions. Our intercompany relationships are subject to complex transfer pricing regulations administered by taxing authorities in various jurisdictions. The relevant taxing authorities may disagree with our determinations as to the value of assets sold or acquired or income and expenses attributable to specific jurisdictions. If such a disagreement were to occur, and our position were not sustained, we could be required to pay additional taxes, interest and penalties, which could result in one-time tax charges, higher effective tax rates, reduced cash flows, and lower overall profitability of our operations. We believe that our financial statements reflect adequate reserves to cover such a contingency, but there can be no assurances in that regard.\nThe enactment of legislation implementing changes in the U.S. taxation of international business activities or the adoption of other tax reform policies could materially impact our financial position and results of operations.\nRecent changes to U.S. tax laws, including limitations on the ability of taxpayers to claim and utilize foreign tax credits, as well as changes to U.S. tax laws that may be enacted in the future, could impact the tax treatment of our foreign earnings. Due to expansion of our international business activities, any changes in the U.S. taxation of such activities may increase our worldwide effective tax rate and adversely affect our financial position and results of operations. In addition, current and future changes to non-U.S. tax laws, including the continuing development of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development Base Erosion and Profit Shifting recommendations, could negatively impact the anticipated tax benefits of our international structure.\nTaxing authorities may successfully assert that we should have collected, or in the future should collect, sales and use, value-added or similar taxes, and we could be subject to liability with respect to past or future sales, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nSales and use, value-added and similar tax laws and rates vary greatly by jurisdiction and are subject to change from time to time. Some jurisdictions in which we do not collect such taxes may assert that such taxes are applicable, which could result in tax assessments, penalties and interest, and we may be required to collect such taxes in the future. Such tax assessments, penalties and interest or future requirements may adversely affect our results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nAny failure to protect our intellectual property rights could impair our ability to protect our proprietary technology and our brand.\nOur success and ability to compete depend, in part, upon our intellectual property. We currently have two patents and primarily rely on copyright, trade secret and trademark laws, trade secret protection, and confidentiality or license agreements with our employees, customers, partners and others to protect our intellectual property rights. However, the steps we take to protect our intellectual property rights may be inadequate.\nIn order to protect our intellectual property rights, we may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect these rights. In the past, we have utilized demand letters as a means to assert and resolve claims regarding potential misuse of our proprietary or trade secret information. Litigation brought to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights could be costly, time-consuming, and distracting to management, and could result in the impairment or loss of portions of our intellectual property. Furthermore, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights may be met with defenses, counterclaims and countersuits attacking the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights. Our failure to secure, protect and enforce our intellectual property rights could adversely affect our brand and adversely impact our business.\nLawsuits or other claims by third parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights could cause us to incur significant expenses or liabilities.\nThere is considerable patent and other intellectual property development activity in our industry. Our success depends, in part, on not infringing upon the intellectual property rights of others. From time to time, our competitors or other third parties may claim that our solutions and underlying technology infringe or violate their intellectual property rights, and we may be found to be infringing upon such rights. We may be unaware of the intellectual property rights of others that may cover some or all of our technology. Any claims or litigation could cause us to incur significant expenses and, if successfully asserted against us, could require that we pay substantial damages or ongoing royalty payments, prevent us from offering our solutions or require that we comply with other unfavorable terms. We may also be obligated to indemnify our customers or other companies in connection with any such litigation and to obtain licenses, modify our solutions, or refund subscription fees, which could further exhaust our resources. In addition, we may incur substantial costs to resolve claims or litigation, whether or not successfully asserted against us, which could include payment of significant settlement, royalty or license fees, modification of our solutions, or refunds to customers of subscription fees. Even if we were to prevail in the event of claims or litigation against us, any claim or litigation regarding our intellectual property could be costly and time-consuming and divert the attention of our management and other employees from our business operations. Such disputes could also disrupt our solutions, adversely impacting our customer satisfaction and ability to attract customers.\nWe use open source software in our products, which could subject us to litigation or other actions.\nWe use open source software in our products and may use more open source software in the future. From time to time, there have been claims challenging the use of open source software against companies that incorporate open source software into their products. As a result, we could be subject to suits by parties claiming misuse of, or a right to compensation for, what we believe to be open source software. Litigation could be costly for us to defend, have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition or require us to devote additional research and development resources to change our products. In addition, if we were to combine our proprietary software products with open source software in a certain manner, we could, under certain of the open source licenses, be required to release the source code of our proprietary software products. If we inappropriately use open source software, we may be required to re-engineer our products, discontinue the sale of our products or take other remedial actions.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nThe market price of our common stock may be volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nThe market price of our common stock since our initial public offering has been and may continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control and may not be related to our operating performance. Factors that could cause fluctuations in the market price of our common stock include the following:\n\u2022actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results;\n\u2022the financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in these projections or our failure to meet these projections;\n\u2022failure of securities analysts to initiate or maintain coverage of our company, changes in financial estimates by any securities analysts who follow our company or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors;\n\u2022ratings changes by any securities analysts who follow our company;\n\u2022announcements by us or our competitors of significant technical innovations, acquisitions, strategic relationships, joint ventures, or capital commitments;\n\u2022changes in operating performance and stock market valuations of other technology companies generally, or those in our industry in particular;\n\u2022price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to time, including as a result of trends in the economy as a whole;\n\u2022changes in accounting standards, policies, guidelines, interpretations or principles;\n\u2022actual or perceived privacy, security, or data protection incidents;\n\u2022actual or anticipated developments in our business or our competitors\u2019 businesses or the competitive landscape generally;\n\u2022developments or disputes concerning our intellectual property, or our products or third-party proprietary rights;\n\u2022announced or completed acquisitions of businesses or technologies by us or our competitors;\n\u2022new laws or regulations, or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business;\n\u2022any major change in our board of directors or management;\n\u2022sales of shares of our common stock by us or our stockholders;\n\u2022lawsuits threatened or filed against us; and\n\u2022other events or factors, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism, outbreaks of pandemic diseases, such as COVID-19, presidential elections, civil unrest, or responses to these events.\nIn addition, the stock markets, and in particular the market on which our common stock is listed, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many technology companies. Stock prices of many technology companies have fluctuated in a manner unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. In the past, stockholders have instituted securities class action litigation following periods of market volatility. If we were to become involved in securities litigation, it could subject us to substantial costs, divert resources and the attention of management from operating our business, and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nProvisions of our corporate governance documents could make an acquisition of the company more difficult and may impede attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management, even if beneficial to our stockholders.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws and the Delaware General Corporation Law (the \u201cDGCL\u201d) contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third-party to acquire us, even if doing so might be beneficial to our stockholders. Among other things:\n\u2022we have authorized but unissued shares of undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which may be established and the shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval, and which may include supermajority voting, special approval, dividend, or other rights or preferences superior to the rights of stockholders;\n\u2022we have a classified board of directors with staggered three-year terms;\n\u2022stockholder action by written consent is prohibited;\n\u2022any amendment, alteration, rescission or repeal of our amended and restated bylaws or of certain provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation by our stockholders requires the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 75% of the voting power of our stock entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a single class outstanding; and\n\u2022stockholders are required to comply with advance notice requirements for nominations for elections to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings.\nFurther, as a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to provisions of Delaware law, which may impair a takeover attempt that our stockholders may find beneficial. These anti-takeover provisions and other provisions under Delaware law could discourage, delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of the company, including actions that our stockholders may deem advantageous, or negatively affect the trading price of our common stock. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors of your choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions you desire.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock so any returns will be limited to changes in the value of our common stock.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock. We currently anticipate that we will retain future earnings for the development, operation, and expansion of our business, and do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends for the foreseeable future. Any return to stockholders will therefore be limited to the increase, if any, of our stock price, which may never occur.\nOur amended and restated bylaws designate a state or federal court located within the State of Delaware as the exclusive forum for certain litigation that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us.\nPursuant to our amended and restated bylaws, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the sole and exclusive forum for (1) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (2) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or other employees to us or our stockholders, (3) any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL, or (4) any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine shall be a state or federal court located within the State of Delaware, in all cases subject to the court\u2019s having personal jurisdiction over indispensable parties named as defendants. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to this provision. The forum selection clause in our amended and restated bylaws may have the effect of discouraging lawsuits against us or our directors and officers and may limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us.\nRisks Related to Our Outstanding Convertible Notes\nWe may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to settle conversions of the Notes in cash, to repurchase the Notes upon a fundamental change, or to repay the principal amount of the Notes in cash at their maturity, and our future debt may contain limitations on our ability to pay cash upon conversion or repurchase of the Notes.\nHolders of the Notes will have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of their Notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change before the maturity date at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, as described in the Indenture. In addition, upon conversion of the Notes, unless we elect to deliver solely shares of our common stock to settle such conversion (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we will be required to make cash payments in respect of the Notes being converted, as described in the Indenture. Moreover, we will be required to repay the Notes in cash at their maturity unless earlier converted, redeemed, or repurchased. However, we may not have enough available cash on hand or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to make repurchases of Notes surrendered therefor or pay cash with respect to Notes being converted or at their maturity. Further, if the Notes convert and we elect to issue common stock in lieu of cash upon conversion, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution.\nIn addition, our ability to repurchase Notes or to pay cash upon conversions of Notes or at their maturity may be limited by law, regulatory authority, or agreements governing our future indebtedness. Our failure to repurchase Notes at a time when the repurchase is required by the Indenture or to pay cash upon conversions of Notes or at\ntheir maturity as required by the Indenture would constitute a default under the Indenture. A default under the Indenture or the fundamental change itself could also lead to a default under agreements governing our existing and future indebtedness. Moreover, the occurrence of a fundamental change under the Indenture could constitute an event of default under any such agreement. If the payment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay such indebtedness and repurchase the Notes or pay cash with respect to Notes being converted or at maturity of the Notes.\nThe conditional conversion feature of the Notes, if triggered, may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nAt December 31, 2020, the conditional conversion feature of the Notes was triggered, and, consequently, holders of the Notes will be entitled under the Indenture governing the Notes to convert their such Notes at any time during the calendar quarter ending March 31, 2021 at their option. If one or more holders elect to convert their Notes, unless we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering solely shares of our common stock (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we would be required to settle a portion or all of our conversion obligation in cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity. In addition, in certain circumstances, such as conversions by holders or redemption, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or certain of the outstanding principal of the Notes as a current rather than long-term liability, which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital.\nThe Capped Calls may affect the value of the Notes and our common stock and we are subject to counterparty risk with respect to the Capped Calls.\nIn connection with the issuance of the Notes, we entered into the Capped Calls. The Capped Calls cover, subject to customary adjustments, the number of shares of our common stock initially underlying the Notes. The Capped Calls are expected to offset the potential dilution as a result of conversion of the Notes.\nThe counterparties or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to our common stock and/or purchasing or selling our common stock or other securities of ours in secondary market transactions at any time prior to the maturity of the Notes (and are likely to do so on each exercise date of the capped call transactions). This activity could also cause or prevent an increase or a decrease in the market price of our common stock.\nWe do not make any representation or prediction as to the direction or magnitude of any potential effect that the transactions described above may have on the price of the Notes or the shares of our common stock. In addition, we do not make any representation that these transactions will not be discontinued without notice.\nIn addition, global economic conditions have in the past resulted in the actual or perceived failure or financial difficulties of many financial institutions. The counterparties to the Capped Calls are financial institutions and we will be subject to the risk that one or more of the counterparties may default or otherwise fail to perform, or may exercise certain rights to terminate, their obligations under the Capped Calls. If a counterparty to one or more Capped Calls becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure at the time under such transaction. Our exposure will depend on many factors but, generally, it will increase if the market price or the volatility of our common stock increases. Upon a default or other failure to perform, or a termination of obligations, by a counterparty, we may suffer adverse tax consequences and more dilution than we currently anticipate with respect to our common stock. We can provide no assurances as to the financial stability or viability of the counterparties.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nWe might require additional capital to support business growth, and this capital might not be available on acceptable terms, if at all.\nWe intend to continue to make investments to support our business growth and may require additional funds to respond to business challenges, including the need to develop new features or enhance our existing solutions, improve our operating infrastructure or acquire complementary businesses and technologies. Accordingly, we may need to engage in equity or debt financings to secure additional funds, or we may opportunistically decide to raise capital. If we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution, and any new equity or convertible debt securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges superior to those of holders of our common stock. Any debt financing secured by us in the future could involve restrictive covenants relating to our capital raising activities and other financial and\noperational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions. In addition, we may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us, or at all, for example because of increased demand for financings due to economic uncertainty relating to COVID-19. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us, when we require it, our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges could be significantly impaired.\nThe requirements of being a public company may strain our resources, divert management\u2019s attention, and affect our ability to attract and retain executive management and qualified board members.\nAs a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d) the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, the listing requirements of the exchanges and other markets upon which our common stock is listed, and other applicable securities rules and regulations. Compliance with these rules and regulations increases our legal and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming, or costly, and increase demand on our systems and resources. The Exchange Act requires, among other things, that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and operating results. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. In order to maintain and, if required, improve our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting to meet this standard, significant resources and management oversight may be required. We are required to disclose changes made in our internal control and procedures on a quarterly basis and are required to furnish a report by management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting on an annual basis. Additionally, our independent registered public accounting firm is required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404. As a result of the complexity involved in complying with the rules and regulations applicable to public companies, our management\u2019s attention may be diverted from other business concerns, which could adversely affect our business and operating results. Although we have hired additional employees to assist us in complying with these requirements, we may need to hire more employees or engage outside consultants, which will increase our operating expenses.\nIn addition, changing laws, regulations, and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure are creating uncertainty for public companies, increasing legal and financial compliance costs, and making some activities more time-consuming. These laws, regulations, and standards are subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. We intend to invest substantial resources to comply with evolving laws, regulations, and standards, and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management\u2019s time and attention from business operations to compliance activities. If our efforts to comply with new laws, regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to their application and practice, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us and our business, financial conditions, and operating results may be adversely affected.\nAs a result of increased disclosure of information in the filings required in a public company, our business and financial condition has become more visible, which we believe may result in threatened or actual litigation, including by competitors and other third parties. If such claims are successful, our business, financial condition, and operating results could be adversely affected, and even if the claims do not result in litigation or are resolved in our favor, these claims, and the time and resources necessary to resolve them, could divert the resources of our management and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us. If few securities analysts commence coverage of us, or if industry analysts cease coverage of us, the trading price for our common stock would be negatively affected. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our common stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our common stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our common stock could decrease, which might cause our common stock price and trading volume to decline.\nWe may fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting in the future and may not be able to accurately or timely report our financial condition or results of operations, which may adversely affect investor confidence in us and the price of our common stock.\nAs a public company, we are required to maintain internal control over financial reporting and to report any material weaknesses in such internal controls. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the \u201cSarbanes-Oxley Act\u201d), requires that we evaluate and determine the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and provide a management report on internal control over financial reporting.\nThe process of designing and implementing internal control over financial reporting required to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act has been and will continue to be time consuming, costly and complicated. If, during the evaluation and testing process, we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, our management will be unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective. Even if our management concludes that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, our independent registered public accounting firm may conclude that there are material weaknesses with respect to our internal controls or the level at which our internal controls are documented, designed, implemented, or reviewed. If we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or when required in the future, if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, the market price of our common stock could be adversely affected, and we could become subject to stockholder lawsuits, litigation or investigations by the stock exchange on which our securities are listed, the SEC, or other regulatory authorities, which could require additional financial and management resources, and cause investor perceptions to be adversely affected and potentially resulting in restatement of our financial statements for prior periods and a decline in the market price of our stock.\nNatural disasters and other events beyond our control could harm our business.\nNatural disasters or other catastrophic events may cause damage or disruption to our operations, international commerce and the global economy, and thus could have a strong negative effect on us. Our business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters, fire, power shortages, pandemics, such as the recent spread of COVID-19, terrorism, political unrest, and other events beyond our control. Although we maintain crisis management and disaster response plans, such events could make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver our solutions to our customers, and could decrease demand for our solutions. The majority of our research and development activities, corporate headquarters, information technology systems and other critical business operations are located in California, which has experienced major earthquakes and wildfires in the past. Significant recovery time could be required to resume operations and our business could be harmed in the event of a major earthquake or catastrophic event.",

Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nMarket for Our Common Stock and Related Stockholder Matters\nOur common stock has been traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol \u201cBL\u201d since October 28, 2016. Prior to that time, there was no public market for our common stock.\nHolders of Record\nAt February 18, 2021, there were 6 shareholders of record. The number of record holders does not include beneficial holders who hold their shares in \u201cstreet name,\u201d meaning that the shares are held for their accounts by a broker or other nominee. Accordingly, we believe that the total number of beneficial holders is higher than the number of our shareholders of record.\nDividend Policy\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock. We currently intend to retain all of our future earnings, if any, to finance our operations and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future.

See Part I, \u201cSpecial Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d for a discussion of the forward-looking statements contained below and Part I, Item 1A, \u201cRisk Factors\u201d for a discussion of certain risks that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results anticipated in such forward-looking statements.\nThis discussion and analysis deals with comparisons of material changes in the consolidated financial statements for fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019. For the comparison of fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018, see the Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Part II, Item 7 of our 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 27, 2020.\nOverview\nWe have created a comprehensive cloud-based software platform designed to transform and modernize accounting and finance operations for organizations of all types and sizes. Our secure, scalable platform supports critical accounting processes such as the financial close, account reconciliations, intercompany accounting, and controls assurance. By introducing software to automate these processes and to enable them to function continuously, we empower our customers to improve the integrity of their financial reporting, increase efficiency in their accounting and finance processes and enhance real-time visibility into their operations.\nAt December 31, 2020, we had 291,873 individual users across 3,433 customers. Additionally, we continue to build strategic relationships with technology vendors, professional services firms, business process outsourcers, and resellers.\nWe are a holding company and conduct our operations through our wholly-owned subsidiary, BlackLine Systems, Inc. (\u201cBlackLine Systems\u201d). BlackLine Systems funded its business with investments from our founder and cash flows from operations until September 3, 2013. On September 3, 2013, we acquired BlackLine Systems, and Silver Lake Sumeru and Iconiq acquired a controlling interest in us, which we refer to as the \u201c2013 Acquisition.\u201d The 2013 Acquisition was accounted for as a business combination under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\u201cGAAP\u201d) and resulted in a change in accounting basis as of the date of the 2013 Acquisition.\nOur cloud-based products include Account Reconciliations, Cash Application, Compliance, Consolidation Integrity Manager, Intercompany Hub, Journal Entry, Task Management, Transaction Matching, and Variance Analysis. These products are offered to customers as scalable solutions that support critical accounting processes, such as the financial close, account reconciliations, cash application, intercompany accounting, and compliance.\nWe derived approximately 93% of our revenue from subscriptions to our cloud-based software platform and approximately 7% from professional services for the year ended December 31, 2020. The majority of subscriptions are sold through one-year non-cancellable contracts, with a growing percentage of subscriptions sold through three-year contracts. We price our subscriptions based on a number of factors, primarily the number of users having access to the products and the number of products purchased by the customer. Subscription revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the customer contract. The first year of subscription fees are typically payable within 30 days after execution of a contract, and thereafter upon renewal.\nProfessional services consist of implementation and consulting services. Although our platform is ready to use immediately after a new customer has access to it, we typically help customers implement our solutions for a fixed fee, which is initially recorded as deferred revenue and recognized on a proportional performance basis as the services are performed. We also provide consulting services to help customers optimize the use of our products. We charge customers for our consulting services on a time-and-materials basis and we recognize that revenue as services are performed.\nWe typically invoice customers annually in advance for annual and multi-year subscriptions and invoice in advance or on a time-and-materials basis for professional services. We record amounts invoiced for portions of annual subscription periods that have not occurred or services that have not been performed as deferred revenue on our consolidated balance sheet.\nWe sell our solutions primarily through our direct sales force, which leverages our relationships with technology vendors, professional services firms and business process outsourcers. In particular, our solution integrates with SAP\u2019s ERP solutions. In the fourth quarter of 2018, SAP became part of the reseller channel that we use in the ordinary course of business. SAP has the ability to resell our solutions, as an SAP solution-extension (\u201cSolEx\u201d), for which we receive a percentage of the revenues.\nOur ability to maximize the lifetime value of our customer relationships will depend, in part, on the willingness of customers to purchase additional user licenses and products from us. We rely on our sales and customer\nsuccess teams to support and grow our existing customers by maintaining high customer satisfaction and educating customers on the value all our products provide.\nThe length of our sales cycle depends on the size of a potential customer and contract, as well as the type of solution or product being purchased. The sales cycle for our global enterprise customers is generally longer than that of our mid-market customers. In addition, the length of the sales cycle tends to increase for larger contracts and for more complex, strategic products like Intercompany Hub. As we continue to focus on increasing our average contract size and selling more strategic products, we expect our sales cycle to lengthen and become less predictable, which could cause variability in our results for any particular period.\nWe have historically signed a high percentage of agreements with new customers, as well as renewal agreements with existing customers, in the fourth quarter of each year and usually during the last month of the quarter. This can be attributed to buying patterns typical in the software industry. As the terms of most of our customer agreements are measured in full year increments, agreements initially entered into during the fourth quarter or last month of any quarter will generally come up for renewal at that same time in subsequent years. This seasonality is reflected in our revenues, though the impact to overall annual or quarterly revenues is minimal due to the fact that we recognize subscription revenue ratably over the term of the customer contract.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, we had revenues totaling $351.7 million, $289.0 million, and $227.8 million, respectively, and we incurred net losses attributable to BlackLine, Inc. of $46.9 million, $32.5 million, and $28.7 million, respectively.\nCOVID-19 Update\nIn December 2019, the emergence of a novel coronavirus, or COVID-19, was reported and in March 2020, the World Health Organization, or WHO, characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic. We responded to the pandemic by creating an executive task force to monitor the COVID-19 situation daily, immediately restricted non-essential travel and enabled work-from-home protocols. Shortly thereafter, and in line with guidance provided by government agencies and international organizations, we restricted all travel, mandated a work-from-home policy across our global workforce, and moved all in-person customer-facing events to virtual ones. We expect these restrictions to stay in effect during the first half of 2021. We also responded with COVID-19 customer-relief programs to help our community of global accounting and finance professionals in these challenging times. We have offered free access to our entire training library. We also offered the Task Management and Reporting modules complimentary for six months to existing customers to enable a more effective remote close. In addition, we announced complimentary coaching sessions with our existing customers. We have been recognized by The Stevie International Business Awards and the CEO World Awards for our commitment to helping ensure business continuity and fostering well-being for both customers and employees in response to, and throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.\nWe have continued to see purchasing decisions being deferred due to COVID-19 and a reduction on new business pipeline and large deals. Moreover, we have experienced and expect to continue to experience delays in deals in EMEA and North America mid-market, as well as large digital transformation deals. We further expect delays in deals arising out of our SAP partnership, all which will impact our customers and prospects, and our financial results for fiscal 2021. We have also seen a decrease in travel-related expenses and advertising and trade show expenses.\nThe broader implications of the global emergence of COVID-19 on our business, operating results, and overall financial performance remain uncertain and depend on certain developments, including the duration and spread of the outbreak, impact on our customers and our sales cycles, impact on our partners and employees, and impact on the economic environment and financial markets, all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted. We are conducting business as usual with certain limitations to employee travel, employee work locations, and marketing events, among other modifications. We have observed other companies taking precautionary and preemptive actions to address COVID-19, and the effects it has had and is expected to have on business and the economy. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we have seen certain new and existing customers halt or decrease investment in infrastructure, and we have seen that certain of our current and potential customers take actions to reduce operating expenses and moderate cash flows, including by delaying sales and requesting extended billing and payment terms. The risk of a cybersecurity incident occurring has increased as more companies and individuals are working remotely and through less secure network connections. As a result, we have increased our investments in network security to help mitigate against such an incident. We cannot provide assurances that our preventative efforts will be successful. We will continue to actively monitor the situation and may take further actions that alter our\nbusiness operations, as may be required by federal, state, or local authorities, or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, partners, suppliers, and stockholders.\nAcquisition of Rimilia\nOn October 2, 2020, we completed the acquisition (the \u201cRimilia Acquisition\u201d) of Rimilia Holdings Ltd. (\u201cRimilia\u201d) for consideration of $120.0 million payable at the closing of the acquisition with additional cash payments of up to $30.0 million payable upon certain earnout conditions being met. We funded the Rimilia Acquisition on September 30, 2020 with existing cash on-hand, in advance of the closing. The acquisition extends our capabilities into accounts receivable automation through enabling cash application and collection solutions, accelerating our larger, long-term plan for transforming and modernizing Finance and Accounting. This acquisition was not a significant acquisition under Regulation S-X.\nKey Metrics\nWe regularly review a number of metrics, including the following key metrics, to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate financial projections, and make strategic decisions. Each of the metrics below exclude the impact of on-premise software.\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2019 2018\nDollar-based net revenue retention rate 106 % 110 % 108 %\nNumber of customers 3,433 3,024 2,631\nNumber of users 291,873 267,621 222,619\nDollar-based net revenue retention rate. We believe that dollar-based net revenue retention rate is an important metric to measure the long-term value of customer agreements and our ability to retain and grow our relationships with existing customers over time. We calculate dollar-based net revenue retention rate as the implied monthly subscription and support revenue at the end of a period for the base set of customers from which we generated subscription revenue in the year prior to the calculation, divided by the implied monthly subscription and support revenue one year prior to the date of calculation for that same customer base. This calculation does not reflect implied monthly subscription and support revenue for new customers added during the one-year period but does include the effect of customers who terminated during the period. We define implied monthly subscription and support revenue as the total amount of minimum subscription and support revenue contractually committed to, under each of our customer agreements over the entire term of the agreement, divided by the number of months in the term of the agreement. At December 31, 2020, our dollar-based net revenue retention rate declined primarily due to lower net growth in existing customer accounts. We believe that the financial challenges caused by COVID-19 contributed to lower technology spending by our existing customers. Our ability to maximize the lifetime value of our customer relationships will depend, in part, on the willingness of the customer to purchase additional user licenses and products from us. We rely on our customer success and sales teams to support and grow our existing customers by maintaining high customer satisfaction and educating the customer on the value all our products provide.\nNumber of customers. We believe that our ability to expand our customer base is an indicator of our market penetration and the growth of our business. We define a customer as an entity with an active subscription agreement as of the measurement date. In situations where an organization has multiple subsidiaries or divisions, each entity that is invoiced as a separate entity is treated as a separate customer. However, where an existing customer requests its invoice be divided for the sole purpose of restructuring its internal billing arrangement without any incremental increase in revenue, such customer continues to be treated as a single customer. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, no single customer accounted for more than 10% of our total revenues.\nNumber of users. Since our customers generally pay fees based on the number of users of our platform within their organization, we believe the total number of users is an indicator of the growth of our business. We are also beginning to sell an increasing number of non-user based strategic products, such as Transaction Matching and Intercompany Hub.\nKey Components of our Results of Operations\nRevenues\nSubscription and support. The majority of subscriptions are sold through one-year non-cancellable contracts and a growing percentage of subscriptions are sold through three-year contracts. Fees are based on a number of factors, including the solutions subscribed to by the customer and the number of users having access to the solutions. The first year of subscription fees are typically payable within 30 days after execution of a contract, and thereafter upon renewal. We initially record the subscription fees as deferred revenue and recognize revenue ratably over the term of the contract. At any time during the subscription period, customers may increase their number of users and add products. Additional fees are payable for the remainder of the initial or renewed contract term. Customers may only reduce their number of users or subscription to products upon renewal of their arrangement. Revenues from subscriptions to our cloud-based software platform composed approximately 93% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nSubscription and support revenues also include revenues associated with sales of on-premise software licenses and related support. Prior to our migration to SaaS in 2012, we licensed our legacy on-premise software. We no longer develop any new applications or functionality for our legacy on-premise software.\nProfessional services. We offer our customers implementation and consulting services. Although our platform is ready to use immediately after a new customer has access to it, we typically help customers implement our solutions for a fixed fee. We also provide consulting and training services to help customers optimize the use of our products. These services are considered distinct performance obligations. Professional services do not result in significant customization of the subscription service. We apply the practical expedient to recognize professional services revenue when we have the right to invoice based on time and materials incurred. Professional services revenues composed approximately 7% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nFor a description of our revenue accounting policies, see \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates.\u201d\nCost of Revenues\nSubscription and support cost of revenues. Subscription and support cost of revenues primarily consists of amortization of acquired developed technology costs, salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation associated with our hosting operations and support personnel, data center costs related to hosting our cloud-based software, and amortization of capitalized internal-use software costs. We also allocate a portion of overhead to subscription and support cost of revenues.\nProfessional services costs of revenues. Costs associated with providing professional services primarily consist of salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation associated with our implementation personnel. These costs are expensed as incurred when the services are performed. We also allocate a portion of overhead to professional services cost of revenues.\nOperating Expenses\nSales and marketing. Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel costs of our sales and marketing employees, including salaries, sales commissions and incentives, benefits and stock-based compensation expense, travel and related costs, commissions paid in connection with our strategic relationships, outside consulting fees, marketing programs, including lead generation, costs of our annual conference, advertising, and trade shows, other event expenses, and allocated overhead costs. Sales and marketing expenses also include amortization of customer relationship intangible assets. We defer sales and partner commissions and amortize them over an estimated period of benefit of five years. We expect the annual trend in sales and marketing expenses to continue to increase as we expand our direct sales teams and increase sales through our strategic relationships and resellers.\nResearch and development. Research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation associated with our engineering, product and quality assurance personnel and allocated overhead costs. Research and development expenses also include the cost of third-party contractors. Other than internal-use software development costs that qualify for capitalization, research and development costs are expensed as incurred. We expect research and development costs to increase as we develop new solutions and make improvements to our existing platform.\nGeneral and administrative. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation associated with our executive, finance, legal, human resources, compliance, and other administrative personnel, accounting, auditing and legal professional services fees, recruitment costs, other corporate-related expenses, transaction-related costs, and allocated overhead costs. General and administrative expenses also include amortization of covenant not to compete and trade name intangible assets, and the change in fair value of contingent consideration. We expect that general and administrative expenses will increase as we incur the costs of compliance associated with being a publicly-traded company, including legal, audit and consulting fees.\nInterest Income\nInterest income primarily consists of earnings on our cash and cash equivalents and our marketable securities.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense consists primarily of interest expense associated with our Convertible Senior Notes (the \u201cNotes\u201d) issued in August 2019.\nProvision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes\nWe are subject to federal and state income taxes in the United States and taxes in foreign jurisdictions. We use the liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under the liability method, deferred taxes are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities, using tax rates expected to be in effect during the years in which the bases differences are expected to reverse.\nWe record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets to the extent that realization of the deferred tax assets, including consideration of our deferred tax liabilities, is not more likely than not. For the year ended December 31, 2020, for both federal and state income taxes, our deferred assets exceeded our deferred tax liabilities and because of our recent history of operating losses we believe that the realization of the deferred tax assets is currently not more likely than not. Accordingly, we have recorded a valuation allowance against our federal, state, and certain foreign deferred tax assets.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to our results determined in accordance with GAAP, we believe the non-GAAP measures below are useful to us and our investors in evaluating our business. These non-GAAP financial measures are useful because they provide consistency and comparability with our past performance, facilitate period-to-period comparisons of operations and facilitate comparisons with other peer companies, many of which use similar non-GAAP financial measures to supplement their GAAP results.\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2019\n(in thousands, except percentages)\nGAAP gross profit $ 282,765 $ 230,001\nGAAP gross margin 80.4 % 79.6 %\nGAAP net loss attributable to BlackLine, Inc. $ (46,911) $ (32,535)\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2019\n(in thousands, except percentages)\nNon-GAAP gross profit $ 290,853 $ 239,612\nNon-GAAP gross margin 82.7 % 82.9 %\nNon-GAAP net income attributable to BlackLine, Inc. $ 46,100 $ 21,993\nNon-GAAP Gross Profit and Non-GAAP Gross Margin. Non-GAAP gross profit is defined as GAAP revenues less GAAP cost of revenue adjusted for the amortization of acquired developed technology and stock-based compensation. Non-GAAP gross margin is defined as non-GAAP gross profit divided by GAAP revenues. We believe that presenting non-GAAP gross margin is useful to investors as it eliminates the impact of certain non-cash expenses and allows a direct comparison of gross margin between periods.\nNon-GAAP Net Income. Non-GAAP net income is defined as GAAP net loss adjusted for the impact of the provision for (benefit from) income taxes related to acquisitions, amortization of acquired intangible assets, stock-based compensation, the amortization of debt discount and issuance costs, the change in the fair value of contingent consideration, transaction-related costs, legal settlement gains, and the adjustment to the value of the redeemable non-controlling interest to the redemption amount. We believe that presenting non-GAAP net income is useful to investors as it eliminates the impact of items that have been affected by the 2013 Acquisition, the Runbook Acquisition, and the Rimilia Acquisition, certain non-cash expenses, and other costs related to non-recurring non-operating events in order to allow a direct comparison of net loss between current and future periods\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of gross profit, gross margin, and net loss, the most comparable GAAP measures to non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin and non-GAAP net income:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2019\n(in thousands)\nNon-GAAP Gross Profit:\nGross profit $ 282,765 $ 230,001\nAmortization of acquired developed technology 1,192 4,797\nStock-based compensation expense 6,896 4,814\nTotal non-GAAP gross profit $ 290,853 $ 239,612\nGross margin 80.4 % 79.6 %\nNon-GAAP gross margin 82.7 % 82.9 %\nNon-GAAP Net Income Attributable to BlackLine, Inc.:\nNet loss attributable to BlackLine, Inc. $ (46,911) $ (32,535)\nProvision for (benefit from) income taxes (669) 90\nAmortization of intangible assets 7,679 10,265\nStock-based compensation 49,690 34,052\nAmortization of debt discount and issuance costs 22,689 8,410\nChange in fair value of contingent consideration 28 46\nTransaction-related costs 4,736 -\nLegal settlement gains - (380)\nShelf offering costs - 212\nAdjustment to redeemable non-controlling interest 8,858 1,833\nTotal non-GAAP net income attributable to BlackLine, Inc. $ 46,100 $ 21,993\nResults of Operations\nThe following tables set forth selected historical consolidated statements of operations data, which should be read in conjunction with Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates, Liquidity and Capital Resources, and Contractual Obligations and Commitments included in this Item 7, as well as Quantitative and Qualitative\nDisclosures About Market Risk and the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nConsolidated statements of operations information was as follows (in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2019\n(in thousands)\nRevenues\nSubscription and support $ 328,559 $ 272,447\nProfessional services 23,178 16,529\nTotal revenues 351,737 288,976\nCost of revenues\nSubscription and support 47,919 44,968\nProfessional services 21,053 14,007\nTotal cost of revenues 68,972 58,975\nGross profit 282,765 230,001\nOperating expenses\nSales and marketing 174,581 158,837\nResearch and development 56,464 43,006\nGeneral and administrative 71,611 56,057\nTotal operating expenses 302,656 257,900\nLoss from operations (19,891) (27,899)\nOther income (expense)\nInterest income 4,502 6,128\nInterest expense (23,311) (8,650)\nOther expense, net (18,809) (2,522)\nLoss before income taxes (38,700) (30,421)\nProvision for income taxes 702 1,725\nNet loss (39,402) (32,146)\nNet loss attributable to non-controlling interest (1,349) (1,444)\nAdjustment attributable to non-controlling interest 8,858 1,833\nNet loss attributable to BlackLine, Inc. $ (46,911) $ (32,535)\nRevenues\nYear Ended December 31, Change\n2020 2019 $ %\n(in thousands, except percentages)\nSubscription and support $ 328,559 $ 272,447 $ 56,112 21 %\nProfessional services 23,178 16,529 6,649 40 %\nTotal revenues $ 351,737 $ 288,976 $ 62,761 22 %\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2019\nDollar-based net revenue retention rate 106 % 110 %\nNumber of customers 3,433 3,024\nNumber of users 291,873 267,621\nThe increase in revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, was primarily due to an increase in the number of customers, an increase in the number of users added by\nexisting customers, and an increase in non-user based strategic product sales. The total number of customers and users increased by 14% and 9%, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nCost of revenues\nYear Ended December 31, Change\n2020 2019 $ %\n(in thousands, except percentages)\nSubscription and support $ 47,919 $ 44,968 $ 2,951 7 %\nProfessional services 21,053 14,007 7,046 50 %\nTotal cost of revenues $ 68,972 $ 58,975 $ 9,997 17 %\nGross margin 80.4 % 79.6 %\nThe increase in cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, was primarily due to a $10.0 million increase in salaries, benefits, and stock-based compensation; a $2.7 million increase in computer software expenses; a $1.7 million increase in amortization of internally developed technology; and a $0.6 million increase in professional services expense. These increases were partially offset by a $3.1 million decrease in depreciation and amortization; a $1.5 million decrease in travel-related expenses; and a $0.8 million decrease in data center costs. The increase in salaries, benefits, and stock-based compensation was primarily driven by a 27% increase in average cost of revenues-related headcount from the year ended December 31, 2019 to the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in computer software expenses was primarily driven by purchases of additional server licenses and cloud hosting charges, driven by growth in our customer base. Amortization of our capitalized software development costs increased due to larger total capitalized costs as we expanded the functionality of our solutions. Depreciation and amortization expense decreased primarily due to a decrease in amortization related to acquired developed technology from the 2013 Acquisition, which became fully amortized in the year ended December 31, 2019. Travel-related expenses decreased primarily as a result of travel restrictions due to COVID-19.\nSales and marketing\nYear Ended December 31, Change\n2020 2019 $ %\n(in thousands, except percentages)\nSales and marketing $ 174,581 $ 158,837 $ 15,744 10 %\nPercentage of total revenues 49.6 % 55.0 %\nThe increase in sales and marketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, was primarily due to a $30.1 million increase in salaries, sales commissions, stock-based compensation, and incentives; a $1.3 million increase in company event-related expenses; a $1.0 million increase in computer software expenses; and a $0.9 million increase in depreciation and amortization. These increases were partially offset by a $7.2 million decrease in travel-related costs; a $5.1 million decrease in partner referral fees; and a $4.9 million decrease in advertising and trade show expenses. The increase in salaries, sales commissions, and incentives was primarily driven by an increase in headcount and revenue growth. Our sales and marketing average headcount increased 20% from the year ended December 31, 2019 to the year ended December 31, 2020. Computer software expenses increased due to the additional software licenses driven by an increase in average sales and marketing headcount. Travel-related expenses decreased primarily as a result of COVID-19 travel restrictions. The decrease in partner referral fees was primarily driven by the amendment of the previous SAP agreement in the fourth quarter of 2018 and the addition of SAP to our channel of resellers. The decrease in advertising and trade show expenses was primarily a result of restrictions related to live events due to COVID-19.\nResearch and development\nYear Ended December 31, Change\n2020 2019 $ %\n(in thousands, except percentages)\nResearch and development, gross $ 67,283 $ 48,269 $ 19,014 39 %\nCapitalized internally developed software costs (10,819) (5,263) (5,556) 106 %\nResearch and development, net $ 56,464 $ 43,006 $ 13,458 31 %\nPercentage of total revenues 16.1 % 14.9 %\nThe increase in research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, was primarily due to a $14.9 million increase in salaries, benefits, and stock-based compensation; a $2.7 million increase in computer software expenses; and a $1.8 million increase in professional services expense. These increases were partially offset by a $5.6 million increase in capitalized software costs, which resulted in a decrease in net expenses, and a $0.6 million decrease in travel-related costs. The increase in salaries, benefits, and stock-based compensation was primarily driven by a 33% increase in average headcount from the year ended December 31, 2019 to the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in computer software expenses was primarily driven by our migration to the public cloud and the purchase of additional software licenses driven by an increase in average research and development headcount. The increase in professional services expense was primarily driven by external consultant fees as part of our investment in products, features, and functionality buildouts. Capitalized software costs increased due to significant new enhancement initiatives related to the functionality of our solutions. Travel-related expenses decreased primarily as a result of COVID-19 travel restrictions.\nGeneral and administrative\nYear Ended December 31, Change\n2020 2019 $ %\n(in thousands, except percentages)\nGeneral and administrative $ 71,611 $ 56,057 $ 15,554 28 %\nPercentage of total revenues 20.4 % 19.4 %\nThe increase in general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, was primarily due to an $8.8 million increase in salaries, benefits, and stock-based compensation; $4.7 million of transaction-related costs; and a $2.2 million increase in professional services expense. These increases were partially offset by a $0.8 million decrease in travel-related expenses. The increase in salaries, benefits, and stock-based compensation was primarily driven by an 18% increase in average headcount from the year ended December 31, 2019 to the year ended December 31, 2020. Transaction-related costs in the period related to the Rimilia Acquisition, which closed in October 2020. Travel-related expenses decreased primarily as a result of COVID-19 travel restrictions.\nInterest income\nYear Ended December 31, Change\n2020 2019 $ %\n(in thousands, except percentages)\nInterest income $ 4,502 $ 6,128 $ (1,626) (27) %\nThe decrease in interest income during the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, was primarily due to a decrease in average interest rates, partially offset by interest earned on higher cash balances in the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.\nInterest expense\nYear Ended December 31, Change\n2020 2019 $ %\n(in thousands, except percentages)\nInterest expense $ 23,311 $ 8,650 $ 14,661 169 %\nThe increase in interest expense during the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, was primarily due to increased amortization of the debt discount on the Notes. The notes were issued in the third quarter of 2019 and, as such, there was less amortization in 2019 as compared to a full year in 2020. The increase was also, to a lesser extent, related to increased interest accrued during the period on the outstanding balance on the Notes in the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.\nProvision for income taxes\nYear Ended December 31, Change\n2020 2019 $ %\n(in thousands, except percentages)\nProvision for income taxes $ 702 $ 1,725 $ (1,023) (59) %\nWe are subject to federal and state income taxes in the United States and taxes in foreign jurisdictions. For the year ended December 31, 2020, our annual estimated effective tax rate differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% primarily as a result of state taxes, foreign taxes, and changes in our valuation allowance for domestic income taxes. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we recorded $0.7 million and $1.7 million in income tax expense, respectively. The decrease in income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, was attributable to 2020 tax benefits associated with our international operations. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we continued to maintain a full valuation allowance on our U.S. federal and state net deferred tax assets as it was more likely than not that those deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAt December 31, 2020, our principal sources of liquidity were an aggregate of $542.6 million of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities, which primarily consist of short-term, investment-grade U.S. treasury securities, corporate bonds, and commercial paper. In October 2020, we completed the acquisition of Rimilia and paid $121.4 million. We had $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of Notes outstanding at December 31, 2020.\nDuring the quarter ended December 31, 2020, the Stock Price Condition allowing holders of the Notes to convert was met. As a result, holders have the option to convert their Notes at any time during the calendar quarter ending March 31, 2021. We have the ability to settle the Notes in cash, shares of our common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock at our election. From January 1, 2021, through the date of this filing, we have not received any conversion requests for our Notes. It is our current intent to settle any such conversions through combination settlement, which involves repayment of the principal portion in cash and any excess conversion value over the principal amount in shares of our common stock.\nIn connection with the offering of the Notes, we entered into the Capped Calls with certain counterparties covering, subject to anti-dilution adjustments, approximately 6.8 million shares of our common stock and are generally expected to offset the potential economic dilution of our common stock up to the initial cap price. The Capped Calls have an initial strike price of $73.40 per share, subject to certain adjustments, which corresponds to the initial conversion price of the Notes. The Capped Calls have an initial cap price of $106.76 per share, subject to certain adjustments. At December 31, 2020, all of the Capped Calls for the Notes remained outstanding.\nWe believe our existing cash and cash equivalents, investments in marketable securities and cash from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital needs, capital expenditures and financing obligations for at least the next 12 months.\nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our growth rate, the expansion of our direct sales force, strategic relationships and international operations, the timing and extent of spending to support research and development efforts and strategic transactions and the continuing market acceptance of our solutions. From time to time, we may require or opportunistically raise additional equity or debt financing. Sales of additional equity or equity-linked securities could result in dilution to our stockholders. If we raise funds by borrowing from third parties, the terms of those financing arrangements would require us to incur interest expense and may include negative covenants or other restrictions on our business that could impair our operating flexibility. We can provide no assurance that financing will be available at all or, if available, that we would be able to obtain financing on terms favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional capital when needed, we would be required to curtail our operating activities and capital expenditures, and our business operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected.\nHistorical Cash Flows\nThe following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows for the periods indicated:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2019\n(in thousands)\nNet cash provided by operating activities $ 54,735 $ 29,724\nNet cash provided by (used in) investing activities $ 173,594 $ (408,450)\nNet cash provided by financing activities $ 18,862 $ 452,512\nNet Cash Provided by Operating Activities\nOur net loss and cash flows from operating activities are significantly influenced by our investments in headcount and infrastructure to support anticipated growth. In recent periods, our net loss has generally been significantly greater than our use of cash for operating activities due to our subscription-based revenue model in which billings occur in advance of revenue recognition, as well as the substantial amount of non-cash charges which we incur. Non-cash charges primarily include depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, non-cash lease expense, amortization of debt discount and issuance costs, and deferred taxes.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, cash provided by operations was $54.7 million, resulting from net non-cash expenses of $97.5 million, partially offset by our net loss of $39.4 million and net cash flow used as a result of changes in operating assets and liabilities of $3.4 million. The $3.4 million of net cash flows used as a result of changes in our operating assets and liabilities reflected the following:\n\u2022a $12.4 million increase in other assets;\n\u2022a $5.7 million increase in accounts receivable;\n\u2022a $5.3 million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets;\n\u2022a $5.0 million decrease in operating lease liabilities; and\n\u2022a $4.4 million decrease in accounts payable.\nThese changes in our operating assets and liabilities were partially offset by the following:\n\u2022a $26.4 million increase in deferred revenue as a result of the growth of our customer and user bases; and\n\u2022a $3.1 million increase in accrued expenses and other current liabilities.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, cash provided by operations was $29.7 million, resulting from net non-cash expenses of $68.2 million, partially offset by our net loss of $32.1 million and net cash flow used as a result of changes in operating assets and liabilities of $6.3 million. The $6.3 million of net cash flows used as a result of changes in our operating assets and liabilities reflected the following:\n\u2022a $28.0 million increase in accounts receivable;\n\u2022a $16.4 million increase in other assets; and\n\u2022a $5.5 million decrease in operating lease liabilities.\nThese changes in our operating assets and liabilities were largely offset by the following:\n\u2022a $33.4 million increase in deferred revenue as a result of the growth of our customer and user bases;\n\u2022a $5.8 million increase in accrued expenses and other current liabilities primarily associated with increases in employee-related accruals as a result of increases in headcount and bonuses;\n\u2022a $3.2 million increase in accounts payable; and\n\u2022a $1.2 million decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets.\nNet Cash Provided By (Used In) Investing Activities\nOur investing activities consist primarily of investments in and maturities of marketable securities, capital expenditures for property and equipment, and capitalized software development costs.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, cash provided by investing activities was $173.6 million as a result of $312.4 million of proceeds from maturities and sales of marketable securities, net of purchases, partially offset by $119.3 million in cash paid for an acquisition, net of cash acquired, $10.6 million in capitalized software development costs, $6.5 million in purchases of property and equipment, and $2.3 million in purchases of intangible assets related to the purchase of a defensive patent.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, cash used in investing activities was $408.5 million as a result of $398.8 million of purchases of marketable securities, net of proceeds from maturities and sales, $5.1 million in capitalized software development costs, and $4.6 million in purchases of property and equipment.\nNet Cash Provided By Financing Activities\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, cash provided by financing activities was $18.9 million as a result of $20.6 million of proceeds from exercises of stock options and $7.0 million of proceeds from the employee stock purchase plan, partially offset by $8.2 million of acquisitions of common stock for tax withholding obligations.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, cash provided by financing activities was $452.5 million primarily as a result of net proceeds of $441.0 million from the issuance of the Notes and the purchase of the associated Capped Calls; $10.6 million of proceeds from exercises of stock options; and $5.3 million of proceeds from the employee stock purchase plan, partially offset by $3.9 million of acquisitions of common stock for tax withholding obligations.\nBacklog\nWe enter into both single and multi-year subscription contracts for our solutions. The timing of our invoices to the customer is a negotiated term and thus varies among our subscription contracts. For multi-year agreements, it is common to invoice an initial amount at contract signing followed by subsequent annual invoices. At any point in the contract term, there can be amounts that we have not yet been contractually able to invoice. Until such time as these amounts are invoiced, they are not recorded in revenues, deferred revenue or elsewhere in our consolidated financial statements and are considered by us to be backlog. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had backlog of approximately $468.6 million and $366.9 million, respectively. We expect backlog will change from period to period for several reasons, including the timing and duration of customer agreements, varying billing cycles of subscription agreements, and the timing and duration of customer renewals. Because revenue for any period is a function of revenue recognized from deferred revenue under contracts in existence at the beginning of the period, as well as contract renewals and new customer contracts during the period, backlog at the beginning of any period is not necessarily indicative of future revenue performance. We do not utilize backlog as a key management metric internally.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations at December 31, 2020:\nPayments Due by Period\nTotal Less than\n1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years More than\n5 Years\nPrincipal amount and interest payable on the Notes (1) $ 502,500 $ 625 $ 1,250 $ 500,625 $ -\nOperating lease liabilities 12,712 4,644 6,291 758 1,019\nPurchase obligations 10,577 2,098 7,674 170 635\nTotal $ 525,789 $ 7,367 $ 15,215 $ 501,553 $ 1,654\n(1) For additional information regarding the Notes, refer to Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe are required to pay up to a maximum of $8.0 million of contingent consideration relating to our 2013 Acquisition if we realize a tax benefit from the use of net operating losses generated from the stock option exercises concurrent with the 2013 Acquisition and up to a maximum of $30.0 million of contingent consideration relating to the Rimilia Acquisition if certain Rimilia Annual Recurring Revenue (\"ARR\") thresholds are met each year over a two year period subsequent to the acquisition date. We have not included these obligations in the table above because there is a high degree of uncertainty regarding the amount and timing of future cash flows to extinguish this liability.\nAt December 31, 2020, liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits of $2.5 million were not included in the table above because, due to their nature, there was a high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows and other events that extinguish these liabilities.\nCommitments under letters of credit at December 31, 2020 were scheduled to expire as follows (in thousands):\nTotal Less than 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years Thereafter\nLetters of credit $ 311 $ - $ - $ 38 $ 273\nLetters of credit are maintained pursuant to certain of our lease arrangements. The letters of credit remain in effect at varying levels through the terms of the related agreements.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs part of our ongoing business, we do not have any relationships with other entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities that have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. We are therefore not exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in those types of relationships.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we may provide indemnification of varying scope and terms to customers, vendors, investors, directors and officers with respect to certain matters, including, but not limited to, losses arising out of our breach of such agreements, services to be provided by us, or from intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties. These indemnification provisions may survive termination of the underlying agreement and the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification provisions may not be subject to maximum loss clauses. The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification provisions is indeterminable. We have never paid a material claim, nor have we been sued in connection with these indemnification arrangements. At December 31, 2020, we had not accrued a liability for these indemnification arrangements because the likelihood of incurring a payment obligation, if any, in connection with these indemnification arrangements is not probable or reasonably estimable.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP\nrequires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results could differ from these estimates.\nWe believe that the following critical accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment or complexity than our other accounting policies. Accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to a full understanding and evaluation of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. See \u201cSignificant Accounting Policies\u201d in Note 2 of the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nRevenue Recognition and Deferred Revenue\nAssets recognized from the costs to obtain a contract with a customer - We recognize an asset for the incremental and recoverable costs of obtaining a contract with a customer if we expect the benefit of those costs to be one year or longer. We have determined that certain sales incentive programs to our employees (\"deferred customer contract acquisition costs\") and our partners (\"partner referral fees\") meet the requirements to be capitalized. Deferred customer acquisition costs related to new revenue contracts and upsells are deferred and then amortized straight line over the expected period of benefit that we have determined to be five years, based upon both the product turnover rate and estimated customer life. Partner referral fees are deferred and then amortized on a straight-line basis over the related contractual period, as the fees for renewals are commensurate with fees incurred for the initial contract. Deferred customer acquisition costs and partner referral fees are included within other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. There were no impairment losses in relation to the costs capitalized for the periods presented.\nCapitalized Software Costs\nWe account for the costs of computer software obtained or developed for internal use in accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (\u201cASC 350\u201d). We capitalize certain implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract. These capitalized costs exclude training costs, project management costs, and data migration costs. We capitalize certain costs in the development of our SaaS subscription solutions when (i) the preliminary project stage is completed, (ii) management has authorized further funding for the completion of the project and (iii) it is probable that the project will be completed and performed as intended. These capitalized costs include personnel and related expenses for employees and costs of third-party contractors who are directly associated with and who devote time to internal-use software projects and, when material, interest costs incurred during the development. Capitalization of these costs ceases once the project is substantially complete and the software is ready for its intended purpose. Costs incurred for significant upgrades and enhancements to our SaaS software solutions are also capitalized. Costs incurred for post-configuration training, maintenance and minor modifications or enhancements are expensed as incurred. Capitalized software development costs are amortized using the straight-line method over an estimated useful life of three years.\nBusiness Combinations\nThe results of businesses acquired in business combinations are included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of the acquisition. Purchase accounting results in assets and liabilities of an acquired business being recorded at their estimated fair values on the acquisition date. Any excess consideration over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recognized as goodwill.\nWe perform valuations of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and allocate the purchase price to its respective assets and liabilities. Determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires our management to use significant judgment and estimates, including the selection of valuation methodologies, estimates of future revenue, costs and cash flows, discount rates, and selection of comparable companies. We engage the assistance of valuation specialists in concluding on fair value measurements in connection with determining fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations.\nContingent consideration payable in cash arising from business combinations is recorded at fair value as a liability on the acquisition date and remeasured at each reporting date. Changes in fair value are recorded in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. Determining the fair value of the\ncontingent consideration each period requires management to make assumptions and judgments. These estimates involve inherent uncertainties, and if different assumptions had been used, the fair value of contingent consideration could have been materially different from the amounts recorded. The significant inputs used in the fair value measurement of contingent consideration are the amount and timing of Rimilia ARR in each year over a two year period subsequent to the acquisition and determining an appropriate discount rate, which considers the risk associated with the forecasted ARR. Significant changes in the estimated future ARR and the periods in which they are generated would significantly impact the fair value of the contingent consideration liability.\nTransaction-related costs incurred by the Company are expensed as incurred and are included in general and administrative expenses in the Company's consolidated statements of operations.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2, \"Significant Accounting Policies-Recently Issued Accounting Standards,\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of recent accounting pronouncements, including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.",
    "item_7A": "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risks\nWe have operations both within the United States and internationally, and we are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business. These risks primarily include interest rate, foreign exchange and inflation risks, as well as risks relating to changes in the general economic conditions in the countries where we conduct business. To reduce these risks, we monitor the financial condition of our customers and limit credit exposure by collecting in advance and setting credit limits as we deem appropriate. In addition, our investment strategy has historically been to invest in financial instruments that are highly liquid and readily convertible into cash and that mature within three months from the date of purchase. To date, we have not used derivative instruments to mitigate the impact of our market risk exposures. We have also not used, nor do we intend to use, derivatives for trading or speculative purposes.\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates.\nIn August 2019, we issued $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of the Notes. The Notes have a fixed annual interest rate of 0.125%; therefore, we do not have economic interest rate exposure with respect to the Notes. However, the fair value of the Notes is exposed to interest rate risk. Generally, the fair market value of the Notes will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. In addition, the fair value of the Notes is affected by our common stock price. The fair value of the Notes will generally increase as our common stock price increases and will generally decrease as our common stock price declines. Additionally, we carry the Notes at face value less unamortized discount and issuance costs on our balance sheet, and we present the fair value for required disclosure purposes only.\nWe had cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities of $542.6 million at December 31, 2020. Our cash equivalents and marketable securities consist of highly liquid, investment-grade commercial paper, corporate bonds, and U.S. treasury bonds. The carrying amount of our cash equivalents and marketable securities reasonably approximates fair value due to the highly liquid nature of these instruments. The primary objectives of our investment activities are the preservation of capital, the fulfillment of liquidity needs and the fiduciary control of cash and investments. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. Our investments are exposed to market risk due to fluctuations in interest rates, which may affect our interest income and the fair market value of our investments. Due to the short-term nature of our investment portfolio, however, we do not believe an immediate 10% increase or decrease in interest rates would have a material effect on the fair market value of our portfolio. We therefore do not expect our operating results or cash flows to be materially affected by a sudden change in market interest rates.\nWe do not believe our cash equivalents and marketable securities have significant risk of default or illiquidity. While we believe our cash equivalents and marketable securities do not contain excessive risk, we cannot provide absolute assurance that in the future our investments will not be subject to adverse changes in market value. In\naddition, we maintain significant amounts of cash and cash equivalents at one or more financial institutions that are in excess of federally insured limits. We cannot be assured that we will not experience losses on these deposits.\nForeign Currency Risk\nWhile we primarily transact with customers in the U.S. Dollar, we also transact in foreign currencies, including the Euro, British Pound, Canadian Dollar, Australian Dollar, Singapore Dollar, Philippine Peso, South African Rand, Malaysian Ringgit, Romanian Leu, Hong Kong Dollar, Japanese Yen, and Polish Zloty, due to foreign operations and customer sales. We expect to continue to grow our foreign operations and customer sales. Our international subsidiaries maintain certain asset and liability balances that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of these subsidiaries, which is the U.S. Dollar for all international subsidiaries, with the exception of BlackLine K.K., for which the Japanese Yen is the functional currency. Changes in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. Dollar can result in fluctuations in our total assets, liabilities, revenue, operating expenses, and cash flows. The effect of a hypothetical 10% change in foreign currency exchange rates applicable to our business would not have had a material impact on our cash and marketable securities at December 31, 2020.\nAs our international operations grow, our risks associated with fluctuation in currency rates will become greater, and we will continue to reassess our approach to managing this risk. In addition, currency fluctuations or a weakening U.S. Dollar can increase the costs of our international expansion. To date, we have not entered into any foreign currency hedging contracts, since exchange rate fluctuations have not had a material impact on our operating results and cash flows. Based on our current international structure, we do not plan on engaging in hedging activities in the near future.\nInflation Risk\nWe do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Nonetheless, if our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases. Our inability or failure to do so could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.",

We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.\nChange in Accounting Principle\nAs discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for leases in 2019.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management\u2019s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nAs described in Management\u2019s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management has excluded Rimilia Holdings Ltd. (\u201cRimilia\u201d) from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020 because it was acquired by the Company in a purchase business combination during 2020. We have also excluded Rimilia from our audit of internal control over financial reporting. Rimilia is a wholly-owned subsidiary whose total assets and total revenues excluded from management\u2019s assessment and our audit of internal control over financial reporting represent 1% and 1%, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nAcquisition of Rimilia - Valuation of Acquired Intangible Assets and Contingent Consideration Liability\nAs described in Notes 2 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements, during the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company completed its acquisition of Rimilia for consideration of $120.0 million payable at the closing of the acquisition with additional cash payments of up to $30.0 million payable upon certain earnout conditions being met. The purchase price allocation included acquired intangible assets of a developed technology intangible asset of $21.8 million and a customer relationships intangible asset of $12.7 million. The purchase price allocation also included a contingent consideration liability of $17.1 million based on the amount and timing of Rimilia\u2019s future Annual Recurring Revenue (\u201cARR\u201d). Determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management to use significant judgment and estimates. To estimate the fair value of the developed technology intangible asset, management utilized the multi-period excess earnings model, which includes the discount rate, obsolescence rate, revenue forecasts, and EBITDA forecasts as significant assumptions. To estimate the fair value of the customer relationships intangible asset, management utilized the differential cash flow (with-and-without) model, which includes the discount rate and the customer ramp up rate as significant assumptions. To estimate the fair value of the contingent consideration liability, management utilized a Monte Carlo simulation model, which includes the amount and timing of Rimilia\u2019s ARR projections in each year over a two year period subsequent to the acquisition date as a significant assumption. As disclosed by management, the purchase price allocation is preliminary.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the acquisition of Rimilia - valuation of acquired intangible assets and contingent consideration liability is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management in developing the assumptions used in the fair value estimates; this in turn led to significant auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence relating to (i) the discount rate for the developed technology and customer relationships intangible assets; (ii) the obsolescence rate, revenue forecasts, and EBITDA forecasts for the developed technology intangible asset; (iii) the customer ramp up rate for the customer relationships intangible asset; and (iv) the amount and timing of ARR projections for the contingent consideration liability. Also, the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the acquisition accounting, including controls over management's valuation of the developed\ntechnology and customer relationships intangible assets and contingent consideration liability, and controls over the development of the discount rate, revenue forecasts, EBITDA forecasts, obsolescence rate, customer ramp up rate and amount and timing of ARR projections. These procedures also included, among others, (i) reading the purchase agreements; (ii) evaluating management\u2019s assessments of the completeness of the identified intangible assets acquired and contingent consideration liability; and (iii) testing management\u2019s process for estimating the fair value of the developed technology and customer relationships intangible assets and the contingent consideration liability. Testing management\u2019s process included evaluating the appropriateness of the models used to develop the fair value estimates, testing the completeness, accuracy, and relevance of underlying data used in the valuation models, and evaluating the reasonableness of significant assumptions used by management, including the discount rate, revenue forecasts, EBITDA forecasts, obsolescence rate, customer ramp up rate and amount and timing of ARR projections. Evaluating management\u2019s significant assumptions related to the revenue forecasts, EBITDA forecasts, customer ramp up rate and ARR projections involved evaluating whether the assumptions used were reasonable considering (i) the current and past performance of the Company and Rimilia and (ii) whether these assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating the reasonableness of the discount rate and obsolescence rate.\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nLos Angeles,

\u201cCompany\u201d or \u201cBlackLine\u201d) provide financial accounting close solutions delivered primarily as Software as a Service (\u201cSaaS\u201d). The Company\u2019s solutions enable its customers to address various aspects of their financial close process including account reconciliations, variance analysis of account balances, journal entry capabilities, and certain types of data matching capabilities.\nThe Company is a holding company and conducts its operations through its wholly-owned subsidiary, BlackLine Systems, Inc. (\u201cBlackLine Systems\u201d). BlackLine Systems funded its business with investments from its founder and cash flows from operations until September 3, 2013, when the Company acquired BlackLine Systems, and Silver Lake Sumeru and Iconiq acquired a controlling interest in the Company, which is referred to as the \u201c2013 Acquisition.\u201d\nOn October 2, 2020, the Company acquired Rimilia Holdings Ltd. (\u201cRimilia\u201d), which is referred to as the \u201cRimilia Acquisition.\u201d\nThe Company is headquartered in Woodland Hills, California and has offices in the Netherlands, Canada, France, Singapore, the United Kingdom, Germany, Australia, Hong Kong, Romania, and Poland.\nNote 2-Significant Accounting Policies\nPrinciples of consolidation and basis of presentation\nThe Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\u201cGAAP\u201d) and include the operating results of its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nUse of estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.\nOn an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates, primarily those related to determining the stand alone selling price (\u201cSSP\u201d) for separate deliverables in the Company\u2019s subscription revenue arrangements, allowance for doubtful accounts, fair value of assets and liabilities assumed in a business combination, recoverability of goodwill and long-lived assets, useful lives associated with long-lived assets, income taxes, contingencies, fair value of contingent consideration, fair value of convertible senior notes, redemption value of redeemable non-controlling interest, and the valuation and assumptions underlying stock-based compensation. These estimates are based on historical data and experience, as well as various other factors that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nThe extent to which COVID-19 impacts the Company\u2019s business and financial results will depend on numerous continuously evolving factors including, but not limited to, the magnitude and duration of COVID-19, including resurgences; the impact on the Company\u2019s employees; the extent to which it will impact worldwide macroeconomic conditions, including interest rates, employment rates, and health insurance coverage; the speed and degree of the anticipated economic recovery, as well as variability in such recovery across different geographies, industries, and markets; and governmental and business reactions to the pandemic. The Company assessed certain accounting matters that generally require consideration of forecasted financial information in context with the information reasonably available to the Company and the unknown future impacts of COVID-19 at December 31, 2020 and through the date of this report. The accounting matters assessed included, but were not limited to, the Company\u2019s allowance for credit losses and doubtful accounts, and the carrying value of goodwill and other long-lived assets. While there was not a material impact to the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements at and for the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company\u2019s future assessment of the magnitude and duration of\nCOVID-19, as well as other factors, could result in material impacts to the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements in future reporting periods.\nSegments\nManagement has determined that the Company has one operating segment. The Company\u2019s chief operating decision maker, reviews financial information on a consolidated and aggregate basis, together with certain operating metrics principally to make decisions about how to allocate resources and to measure the Company\u2019s performance.\nConcentration of credit risk and significant customers\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to a significant concentration of credit risk consist of cash and cash equivalents, investments in marketable securities and accounts receivable.\nThe Company maintains the majority of its cash balances with one major commercial bank in interest bearing accounts, which exceeds the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or FDIC, federally insured limits.\nThe Company invests its excess cash in money market mutual funds, commercial paper, corporate bonds, and U.S. treasury securities. To date, the Company has not experienced any impairment losses on its investments.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, no single customer comprised 10% or more of the Company\u2019s total revenues. No single customer had an accounts receivable balance of 10% or greater of total accounts receivable at December 31, 2020 or 2019.\nCash and cash equivalents\nThe Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original or remaining maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. Cash includes cash held in checking and savings accounts. Cash equivalents are comprised of investments in money market mutual funds. The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents approximates fair value.\nRestricted cash\nIncluded in other assets and prepaid expenses and other current assets was $0.5 million and $0.3 million of restricted cash at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The cash was required to be restricted as to use by the Company\u2019s office leaseholder to collateralize a standby letter of credit and under the terms of the Company\u2019s corporate credit card programs.\nInvestments in Marketable Securities\nThe Company periodically assesses its portfolio of marketable securities for impairment. For debt securities in an unrealized loss position, this assessment first takes into account the Company\u2019s intent to sell, or whether it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If either of these criteria are met, the debt security\u2019s amortized cost basis is written down to fair value through other income (expense), net.\nFor debt securities in an unrealized loss position that do not meet the aforementioned criteria, the Company assesses whether the decline in fair value has resulted from credit losses or other factors. In making this assessment, the Company considers the extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost, any changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency, and any adverse conditions specifically related to the security, among other factors. If this assessment indicates that a credit loss may exist, the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the security are compared to the amortized cost basis of the security. If the present value of cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis, a credit loss exists and an allowance for credit losses will be recorded through other income (expense), net, limited by the amount that the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis. Any additional impairment not recorded through an allowance for credit losses is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss in the consolidated statements of stockholders\u2019 equity.\nChanges in the allowance for credit losses are recorded as provision for (or reversal of) credit loss expense. Losses are charged against the allowance when the Company believes the uncollectibility of an available-for-sale security is confirmed or when either of the criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met. The Company has not recorded any credit losses for the year ended December 31, 2020. The Company has not recorded any impairment charges for unrealized losses in the periods presented.\nAccounts receivable and credit losses\nAccounts receivable are recorded and carried at the original invoiced amount less an allowance for any potential uncollectible amounts. The Company makes estimates of expected credit losses for the allowance for doubtful accounts and allowance for cancellations and credits based upon its assessment of various factors, including historical experience, the age of the accounts receivable balances, credit quality of its customers, current economic conditions, reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions, and other factors that may affect its ability to collect from customers. The estimated credit loss allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded as general and administrative expenses, while the estimated credit loss allowance for cancellations and credits is recorded as a reduction in revenue on the consolidated statements of operations.\nLeases\nOn January 1, 2019, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") No. 842, Leases, on a modified retrospective basis. Financial information related to periods prior to adoption are as originally reported under ASC 840, Leases.\nThe Company made accounting policy elections, including a short-term lease exception policy, permitting the Company to not apply the recognition requirements of this standard to short-term leases (i.e. leases with expected terms of 12 months or less), and an accounting policy to account for lease and certain non-lease components as a single component for certain classes of assets. The portfolio approach, which allows a lessee to account for its leases at a portfolio level, was elected for certain equipment leases in which the difference in accounting for each asset separately would not have been materially different from accounting for the assets as a combined unit.\nThe Company has leases for office space, equipment, and data centers. The Company\u2019s leases have remaining initial lease terms of less than one year to approximately five years, some of which include options to extend the leases for up to nine years, and some of which include options to terminate the leases within one year.\nThe Company determines whether an arrangement is a lease, or contains a lease, at inception if the Company is both able to identify an asset and can conclude it has the right to control the identified asset for a period of time. Leases are included in operating lease ROU assets and operating lease liabilities on the Company\u2019s consolidated balance sheets. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the consolidated balance sheet.\nROU assets represent the Company\u2019s right to control an underlying asset for the lease term, and lease liabilities represent the Company\u2019s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. ROU assets and operating lease liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As the Company\u2019s leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company used its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the discount rate used to present value lease payments. The Company used the incremental borrowing rate on January 1, 2019 for operating leases that commenced on or prior to that date. The Company uses the incremental borrowing rate at the commencement date, or remeasurement date, for operating leases. The incremental borrowing rate used is estimated based on what the Company would be required to pay for a collateralized loan over a similar term. Additionally, the Company used the portfolio approach when applying the discount rate selected based on the dollar amount and term of the obligation. The Company\u2019s leases typically do not include any residual value guarantees, bargain purchase options, or asset retirement obligations.\nThe Company\u2019s lease terms are only for periods in which it has enforceable rights. A lease is no longer enforceable when both the lessee and the lessor each have the right to terminate the lease without permission from the other party with no more than an insignificant penalty. The Company\u2019s lease terms are impacted by options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. The Company generally uses the base, non-cancelable lease term when determining the lease assets and liabilities.\nThe Company\u2019s agreements may contain variable lease payments. The Company includes variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate and excludes those which depend on facts or circumstances occurring after the commencement date, other than the passage of time. Additionally, for certain equipment leases, the Company applies a portfolio approach to effectively account for the operating lease ROU assets and operating lease liabilities.\nJudgment is required when determining whether any of the Company\u2019s data center contracts contain a lease. The Company concluded a lease exists when the asset is specifically identifiable, substantially all the economic benefit of the asset is obtained, and the right to direct the use of the asset exists during the term of the lease.\nProperty and equipment\nProperty and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which is generally three to five years for machinery and equipment and purchased software and five years for furniture and fixtures. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of the lease term or seven years. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred, while renewals and betterments are capitalized. Depreciation expense is charged to operations on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets.\nCapitalized internal-use software costs\nThe Company accounts for the costs of computer software obtained or developed for internal use in accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (\u201cASC 350\u201d). The Company capitalizes certain costs in the development of its Software as a Service (\u201cSaaS\u201d) subscription solution when (i) the preliminary project stage is completed, (ii) management has authorized further funding for the completion of the project and (iii) it is probable that the project will be completed and performed as intended. These capitalized costs include personnel and related expenses for employees and costs of third-party contractors who are directly associated with and who devote time to internal-use software projects. Capitalization of these costs ceases once the project is substantially complete and the software is ready for its intended purpose. Costs incurred for significant upgrades and enhancements to the Company\u2019s SaaS software solutions are also capitalized. Costs incurred for training, maintenance and minor modifications or enhancements are expensed as incurred. Capitalized software development costs are amortized using the straight-line method over an estimated useful life of three years.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, the Company amortized $6.4 million, $4.7 million, and $3.9 million, respectively, of internal-use software development costs to subscription and support cost of revenues. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the accumulated amortization of capitalized internal-use software development costs was $19.7 million and $14.3 million, respectively.\nThe Company capitalizes certain implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract. These capitalized costs exclude training costs, project management costs, and data migration costs. Capitalized software implementation costs are amortized using the straight-line method over the terms of the associated hosting arrangements.\nAmortization of internal-use software implementation costs included in sales and marketing expenses in the consolidated statement of operations was $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. During the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company had no material amortization of internal-use software implementation costs.\nIntangible assets\nIntangible assets primarily consist of developed technology, customer relationships, and trade names, which were acquired as part of the 2013 Acquisition, the Runbook Acquisition, and the Rimilia Acquisition. The Company determines the appropriate useful life of its intangible assets by performing an analysis of expected cash flows of the acquired assets. Intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, ranging from one to 11 years.\nImpairment of long-lived assets\nManagement evaluates the recoverability of the Company\u2019s property and equipment, finite-lived intangible assets and capitalized internal-software costs when events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment exists. Events and changes in circumstances considered by the Company in determining whether the carrying value of long-lived assets may not be recoverable include, but are not limited to, significant changes in performance relative to expected operating results, significant changes in the use of the assets, significant negative industry or economic trends, and changes in the Company\u2019s business strategy. Impairment testing is performed at an asset level that represents the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities (an \u201casset group\u201d). In determining if impairment exists, the Company estimates the undiscounted cash flows to be generated from the use and ultimate disposition of the asset group. If impairment is indicated based on a comparison of the assets\u2019 carrying values and the undiscounted cash flows, the impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. The Company determined that there were no events or changes in circumstances that potentially indicated that the Company\u2019s long-lived assets were impaired during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018.\nBusiness combinations\nThe results of businesses acquired in business combinations are included in the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements from the date of the acquisition. Purchase accounting results in assets and liabilities of an acquired business generally being recorded at their estimated fair values on the acquisition date. Any excess consideration over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recognized as goodwill.\nTransaction costs associated with business combinations are expensed as incurred and are included in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.\nThe Company performs valuations of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and allocates the purchase price to its respective assets and liabilities. Determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management to use significant judgment and estimates, including the selection of valuation methodologies, estimates of future revenue, costs and cash flows, discount rates, and selection of comparable companies. The Company engages the assistance of valuation specialists in concluding on fair value measurements in connection with determining fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in a business combination. The Company tests goodwill for impairment in accordance with the provisions of ASC 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other. Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually at the reporting unit level or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired. Events or changes in circumstances which could trigger an impairment review include a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate, unanticipated competition, loss of key personnel, significant changes in the use of the acquired assets or the Company\u2019s strategy, significant negative industry or economic trends, or significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future results of operations.\nASC 350 provides that an entity has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, an entity determines it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then additional impairment testing is not required. However, if an entity concludes otherwise, then it is required to perform an impairment test.\nThe first step involves comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit with its book value, including goodwill. If the estimated fair value exceeds book value, goodwill is considered not to be impaired and no additional steps are necessary. If, however, the fair value of the reporting unit is less than book value, then an impairment charge is recorded for the difference between the reporting unit\u2019s fair value and carrying amount, not to exceed the carrying amount of the goodwill.\nThe Company has one reporting unit, and it tests its goodwill for impairment annually, during the fourth quarter of the calendar year. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company used the quantitative approach to perform its\nannual goodwill impairment test. The fair value of the Company's reporting unit significantly exceeded the carrying value of its net assets and, accordingly, goodwill was not impaired.\nRedeemable non-controlling interest\nThe Company's Japanese subsidiary (\u201cBlackLine K.K.\u201d) is not wholly owned. The agreements with the minority investors of BlackLine K.K. contain redemption features whereby the interest held by the minority investors are redeemable either (i) at the option of the minority investors or (ii) at the option of the Company, both beginning on the seventh anniversary of the initial capital contribution. If the interest of the minority investors were to be redeemed under these agreements, the Company would be required to redeem the interest based on a prescribed formula derived from the relative revenue of BlackLine K.K. and the Company. The balance of the redeemable non-controlling interest is reported at the greater of the initial carrying amount adjusted for the redeemable non-controlling interest's share of earnings or losses and other comprehensive income or loss, or its estimated redemption value. The resulting changes in the estimated redemption amount (increases or decreases) are recorded with corresponding adjustments against retained earnings or, in the absence of retained earnings, additional paid-in-capital. These interests are presented on the consolidated balance sheets outside of equity under the caption \"Redeemable non-controlling interest.\"\nConvertible Senior Notes\nThe Company accounts for the issued Convertible Senior Notes (the \u201cNotes\u201d) as separate liability and equity components. The carrying amount of the liability component was calculated by measuring the fair value of a similar liability that does not have an associated convertible feature. The carrying amount of the equity component representing the difference between the proceeds and the fair value of a similar liability that does not have an associated convertible feature. This difference represents a debt discount that is amortized to interest expense over the term of the Notes using the effective interest rate method. The equity component is not remeasured as long as it continues to meet the conditions for equity classification. The Company has allocated issuance costs incurred to the liability and equity components. Issuance costs attributable to the liability component are being amortized to expense over the respective term of the Notes, and issuance costs attributable to the equity components were netted with the respective equity component in additional paid-in capital.\nTo the extent that the Company receives conversion requests prior to the maturity of the Notes, a portion of the equity component is classified as temporary equity, which is measured as the difference between the principal and net carrying amount of the Notes requested for conversion. Upon settlement of the conversion requests, the difference between the fair value and the amortized book value of the liability component of the Notes requested for conversion is recorded as a gain or loss on early conversion. The fair value of the Notes are measured based on a similar liability that does not have an associated convertible feature based on the remaining term of the Notes.\nFair value of financial instruments\nASC 820, Fair Value Measurement, requires entities to disclose the fair value of financial instruments, both assets and liabilities recognized and not recognized on the balance sheet, for which it is practicable to estimate fair value. Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date.\nValuation techniques used to measure fair value must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. ASC 820 describes a fair value hierarchy based on three levels of inputs, of which the first two are considered observable and the last unobservable, that may be used to measure fair value, which are the following:\nLevel 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical or similar assets and liabilities.\nLevel 2: Quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active or observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical or similar assets or liabilities.\nLevel 3: Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.\nAt December 31, 2020 and 2019, the carrying values of cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued expenses approximate their fair values due to the short-term nature of such instruments.\nContingent consideration related to acquisitions is recorded at fair value as a liability on the acquisition date and is remeasured at each reporting date, based on significant inputs not observable in the market, which represents a Level 3 measurement within the fair value hierarchy. The valuation of contingent consideration uses assumptions management believes would be made by a market participant. Management assesses these estimates on an ongoing basis as additional data impacting the assumptions becomes available. Changes in the fair value of contingent consideration related to updated assumptions and estimates are recognized within general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company determined the fair value of the contingent consideration relating to the 2013 Acquisition by discounting estimated future taxable income. The significant inputs used in the fair value measurement of contingent consideration are the timing and amount of taxable income in any given period and determining an appropriate discount rate, which considers the risk associated with the forecasted taxable income. Significant changes in the estimated future taxable income and the periods in which they are generated would significantly impact the fair value of the contingent consideration liability. To estimate the fair value of the contingent consideration liability, management utilized a Monte Carlo simulation model to value the earn-out based on the likelihood of reaching firm specific targets. Significant inputs used in the fair value measurement of contingent consideration are the amount and timing of Rimilia Annual Recurring Revenue (\"ARR\") in each year over a two year period subsequent to the acquisition date. Significant inputs used in the fair value measurement of contingent consideration are the amount and timing of Rimilia's ARR in each year over a two year period subsequent to the acquisition and determining an appropriate discount rate, which considers the risk associated with the forecasted Rimilia ARR. Significant changes in the estimated future Rimilia ARR would significantly impact the fair value of the contingent consideration liability.\nCertain assets, including goodwill and long-lived assets, are also subject to measurement at fair value on a non-recurring basis if they are deemed to be impaired as a result of an impairment review. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, no impairments were identified on those assets required to be measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis.\nRevenue recognition\nRevenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for those products or services. The Company enters into contracts that can include various combinations of subscription and support services and professional services, which are generally capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations. The Company\u2019s agreements do not contain any refund provisions other than in the event of the Company\u2019s non-performance or breach.\nThe Company determines revenue recognition through the following steps:\n\u2022Identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer\n\u2022Identification of the performance obligations in the contract\n\u2022Determination of the transaction price\n\u2022Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract\n\u2022Recognition of revenue when, or as, the Company satisfies a performance obligation\nSubscription and support revenue - Customers pay subscription and support fees for access to the Company\u2019s SaaS platform generally for a one-year period. In more limited cases, customers may pay for up to three years in advance. Fees are based on a number of factors, including the solutions subscribed for by the customer and the number of users having access to the solutions. Subscription services, which allow customers to use hosted software over the contract period without taking possession of the software, are considered distinct performance obligations and are recognized ratably as the Company transfers control evenly over the contract period.\nSubscription and support revenue also includes software and related maintenance and support fees on legacy BlackLine solutions, Runbook Company B.V. (\"Runbook\") software, and Rimilia software. Software licenses for legacy BlackLine solutions, Runbook software, and Rimilia software provide the customer with a right to use the software as it exists when made available to the customer. Customers may have purchased perpetual licenses or\nterm-based licenses, which provide customers with the same functionality and differ mainly in the duration over which the customer benefits from the software.\nProfessional services revenue - Professional services consist of implementation and consulting services to assist the Company\u2019s customers as they deploy its solutions. These services are considered distinct performance obligations. Professional services do not result in significant customization of the subscription service. The Company applies the practical expedient to recognize professional services revenue when it has the right to invoice based on time and materials incurred. The Company applies the optional exemption and has excluded the variable consideration from the disclosure of remaining performance obligations.\nSignificant judgments - The Company\u2019s contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services. Determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment. Judgment is also required to determine the SSP for each distinct performance obligation. The Company typically has more than one SSP for its SaaS solutions and professional services. Additionally, management has determined that there are no third-party offerings reasonably comparable to the Company\u2019s solutions. Therefore, the Company determines the SSPs of subscriptions to the SaaS solutions and professional services based on numerous factors including the Company\u2019s overall pricing objectives, geography, customer size and number of users, and discounting practices. The Company uses historical maintenance renewal fees to estimate SSP for maintenance and support fees bundled with software licenses. The Company uses the residual method to estimate SSP of software licenses, because license pricing is highly variable and not sold separately from maintenance and support.\nContract balances - Timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to customers. The Company records an unbilled receivable when revenue is recognized prior to invoicing, and deferred revenue when revenue is recognized subsequent to invoicing. The Company generally invoices customers annually at the beginning of each annual contract period. The Company records a receivable related to revenue recognized for multi-year agreements as it has an unconditional right to invoice and receive payment in the future related to those services.\nDeferred revenue is comprised mainly of billings related to the Company\u2019s SaaS solutions in advance of revenue being recognized. Deferred revenue also includes payments for: professional services to be performed in the future; legacy BlackLine maintenance and support; Runbook maintenance, support, license, and implementation; and other offerings for which the Company has been paid in advance and earns the revenue when the Company transfers control of the product or service.\nChanges in deferred revenue for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 were primarily due to additional billings in the periods, partially offset by revenue recognized of $161.3 million, $129.3 million, and $104.2 million, respectively, that was previously included in the deferred revenue balance at December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively.\nThe transaction price is generally determined by the stated fixed fees in the contract, excluding any related sales taxes. Transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations represents contracted revenue that has not yet been recognized (\u201ccontracted not recognized\u201d), which includes deferred revenue and amounts that will be invoiced and recognized as revenue in future periods. Contracted not recognized revenue was $468.6 million at December 31, 2020, of which the Company expects to recognize approximately 58% over the next 12 months and the remainder thereafter.\nFees are generally due and payable upon receipt of invoice or within 30 days. None of the Company\u2019s contracts include a significant financing component.\nAssets recognized from the costs to obtain a contract with a customer - The Company recognizes an asset for the incremental and recoverable costs of obtaining a contract with a customer if the Company expects the benefit of those costs to be one year or longer. The Company has determined that certain sales incentive programs to the Company\u2019s employees (\"deferred customer contract acquisition costs\") and its partners (\"partner referral fees\") meet the requirements to be capitalized. Deferred customer acquisition costs related to new revenue contracts and upsells are deferred and then amortized on a straight-line basis over the expected period of benefit, which the Company has determined to be five years, based upon both the product turnover rate and estimated customer life. The Company enters into partnership arrangements where partner referral fees are paid either on the initial contract or on both the initial contract and renewal of the contract. The Company assesses whether the\nrenewal fee is commensurate with the initial fee. When the renewal fee is commensurate with the initial fee, the Company amortizes the deferred costs over the initial year of the contract. Otherwise, the initial fee is amortized over five years. Deferred customer acquisition costs and partner referral fees are included within other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. There were no impairment losses in relation to the costs capitalized for the periods presented.\nAmortization expense related to the asset recognized from the costs to obtain a contract with a customer is included in sales and marketing expenses in the consolidated statements of operations and was $17.3 million, $18.1 million, and $23.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.\nCost of revenues\nCost of revenues primarily consists of costs related to hosting the Company\u2019s cloud-based application suite, salaries and benefits of operations and support personnel, including stock-based compensation, and amortization of capitalized internal-use software costs. The Company allocates a portion of overhead, such as rent, information technology costs and depreciation and amortization to cost of revenues. Costs associated with providing professional services are expensed as incurred when the services are performed. In addition, subscription and support cost of revenues includes amortization of acquired developed technology.\nSales and marketing\nSales and marketing expenses consist primarily of compensation and employee benefits, including stock-based compensation, of sales and marketing personnel and related sales support teams, sales and partner commissions, marketing events, advertising costs, travel, trade shows, other marketing materials, and allocated overhead. Sales and marketing expenses also include amortization of customer relationship intangible assets. Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and totaled $6.8 million, $10.9 million, and $8.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.\nResearch and development\nResearch and development expenses are comprised primarily of salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation associated with the Company\u2019s engineering, product and quality assurance personnel. Research and development expenses also include third-party contractors and supplies and allocated overhead. Other than software development costs that qualify for capitalization, as discussed above, research and development costs are expensed as incurred.\nGeneral and administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs associated with the Company\u2019s executive, finance, legal, human resources, compliance, and other administrative personnel, as well as accounting and legal professional services fees, other corporate-related expenses and allocated overhead. General and administrative expenses also include amortization of covenant not to compete and tradename intangible assets, the change in value of the contingent consideration, legal settlement gains, and costs associated with the shelf offerings.\nStock-based compensation\nThe Company accounts for stock-based compensation awards granted to employees and directors based on the awards\u2019 estimated grant date fair value. The Company estimates the fair value of its stock options using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. For awards that vest solely based on continued service (\u201cservice-only vesting conditions\u201d), the resulting fair value is recognized on a straight-line basis over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award, usually the vesting period, which is generally four years. The Company recognizes the fair value of stock options which contain performance conditions based upon the probability of the performance conditions being met, using the graded vesting method. On January 1, 2017, the Company changed its accounting policy to account for forfeitures when they occur rather than estimate a forfeiture rate.\nDetermining the grant date fair value of options using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires management to make assumptions and judgments. These estimates involve inherent uncertainties and, if different\nassumptions had been used, stock-based compensation expense could have been materially different from the amounts recorded.\nThe assumptions and estimates are as follows:\nValue per share of the Company\u2019s common stock. The fair value of the underlying common stock was determined by the Company\u2019s board of directors through the date of the initial public offering. For awards granted subsequent to the Company\u2019s initial public offering, the fair value of common stock is based on the closing price of the Company\u2019s common stock, as reported on the NASDAQ, on the date of grant.\nExpected volatility. The Company determines the expected volatility based on historical average volatilities of similar publicly-traded companies corresponding to the expected term of the awards. The Company determines expected volatility for the Employee Stock Purchase Plan (\u201cESPP\u201d) based on the historical volatility of its common stock.\nExpected term. The Company determines the expected term of awards which contain service-only vesting conditions using the simplified approach, in which the expected term of an award is presumed to be the mid-point between the vesting date and the expiration date of the award, as the Company does not have sufficient historical data relating to stock option exercises. The expected term for the Company\u2019s ESPP represents the amount of time remaining in the 12-month offering period.\nRisk-free interest rate. The risk-free interest rate is based on the United States Treasury yield curve in effect during the period the options were granted corresponding to the expected term of the awards.\nEstimated dividend yield. The estimated dividend yield is zero, as the Company does not currently intend to declare dividends in the foreseeable future.\nThe following information represents the weighted average of the assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model for stock options granted:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2019 2018\nExpected term (years) 6.2 6.1 6.1\nExpected volatility 48.4 % 46.7 % 46.0 %\nRisk free interest rate 0.4 % 2.2 % 2.8 %\nExpected dividend yield - - -\nIncome taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes. ASC 740 requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that some of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nThe Company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized. The Company recognizes interest and penalties accrued with respect to uncertain tax positions, if any, in the provision for income taxes in the consolidated statements of operations.\nNet loss per share\nBasic and diluted loss per share is calculated by dividing net loss attributable to BlackLine, Inc. by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding. As the Company has net losses for the periods presented, all potentially dilutive common stock, which are comprised of stock options and restricted stock units, are antidilutive.\nForeign currency\nThe Company\u2019s functional currency for its foreign subsidiaries is the U.S. Dollar (\u201cUSD\u201d), with the exception of its BlackLine K.K. subsidiary, for which the Japanese Yen is the functional currency. The foreign exchange impacts of remeasuring the local currency of the foreign subsidiaries to the functional currency is recorded in general and administrative expenses in the Company\u2019s consolidated statements of operations. Monetary assets and liabilities of foreign operations are remeasured at balance sheet date exchange rates, non-monetary assets and liabilities and equity are remeasured at the historical exchange rates, while results of operations are remeasured at average exchange rates in effect for the period. Foreign currency transaction losses totaled $0.6 million, $0.5 million, and $0.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. The financial statements of BlackLine K.K. are translated to USD using balance sheet date exchange rates for monetary assets and liabilities, historical rates of exchange for non-monetary assets and liabilities and equity, and average exchange rates in the period for revenues and expenses. Translation gains and losses are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as a component of stockholders\u2019 equity in the consolidated balance sheets.\nRecent accounting pronouncements\nRecently-issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted\nIn January 2021, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) issued ASU No. 2021-01, Reference Rate Reform, which refines the scope of ASC 848 and clarifies some of its guidance of global reference rate reform activities. The new guidance provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying generally accepted accounting principles to transactions affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. These transactions include contract modifications, hedging relationships, and sale or transfer of debt securities classified as held-to-maturity. Entities may apply the provisions of the new standard as of the beginning of the reporting period when the election is made (i.e., as early as the first quarter of 2020). This Accounting Standards Update is the final version of Proposed Accounting Standards Update 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Scope Refinement, which has since been deleted. The Company has not adopted the provisions of the new standard and does not expect it to have a material impact on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements.\nIn June 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-06, Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entity\u2019s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40). This standard eliminates the beneficial conversion and cash conversion accounting models for convertible instruments. It also amends the accounting for certain contracts in an entity\u2019s own equity that are currently accounted for as derivatives because of specific settlement provisions. In addition, the new guidance modifies how particular convertible instruments and certain contracts that may be settled in cash or shares impact the diluted EPS computation. For public business entities, it is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, including interim periods within those fiscal years using the fully retrospective or modified retrospective method. Early adoption is permitted but no earlier than fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption of the update on its consolidated financial statements.\nRecently adopted accounting pronouncements\nIn May 2020, the Securities Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) issued a final rule that amended the disclosure requirements applicable to acquisitions and dispositions of businesses. The changes include: updating the tests used to determine significance and expanding the use of pro forma financial information when measuring significance; conforming the significance threshold and tests for a disposed business to those used for an acquired business; permitting abbreviated financial statements for certain acquisitions of a component of an entity; revising the pro forma financial information requirements; reducing the maximum number of years for which financial statements under Regulation S-X Rule 3-05 are required to two years; and modifying the disclosure requirements relating to the aggregate effect of acquisitions for which financial statements are not (or not yet) required. The amendments are intended to improve the financial information about acquired or disposed businesses provided to\ninvestors, facilitate more timely access to capital, and reduce the complexity and costs to prepare the disclosures. The Company early adopted this rule in the quarter ended June 30, 2020, and the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standard Update (\u201cASU\u201d) 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. ASU 2016-13 replaced the incurred loss impairment methodology under current GAAP with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. ASU 2016-13 requires use of a forward-looking expected credit loss model for accounts receivables, loans, and other financial instruments. Adoption of the standard requires using a modified retrospective approach through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the effective date to align existing credit loss methodology with the new standard. In November 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-11, Codification Improvements to Topic 326, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses. ASU 2019-11 requires entities that did not adopt the amendments in ASU 2016-13 as of November 2019 to adopt ASU 2019-11. This ASU contains the same effective dates and transition requirements as ASU 2016-13. The Company adopted this guidance effective January 1, 2020, and the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements.\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued guidance which modifies the disclosure requirements of fair value measurements in Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement, based on the concepts in FASB Concepts Statement, Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting-Chapter 8: Notes to Financial Statements, including the consideration of costs and benefits. The amendments on changes in unrealized gains and losses, the range and weighted average of significant unobservable inputs used to develop Level 3 fair value measurements, and the narrative description of measurement uncertainty should be applied prospectively for only the most recent interim or annual period presented in the initial fiscal year of adoption. All other amendments should be applied retrospectively to all periods presented upon their effective date. The Company adopted this guidance effective January 1, 2020, and the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements.\nNote 3-Revenues\nThe Company disaggregates its revenue from contracts with customers by geographic location, as it believes it best depicts how the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of its revenues and cash flows are affected by economic factors.\nThe following table sets forth the Company\u2019s revenues by geographic region (in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2019 2018\nUnited States $ 264,016 $ 223,375 $ 180,152\nInternational 87,721 65,601 47,636\n$ 351,737 $ 288,976 $ 227,788\nNo countries outside the United States represented 10% or more of total revenues.\nNote 4-Redeemable Non-Controlling Interest\nIn September 2018, the Company entered into an agreement with Japanese Cloud Computing and M30 LLC (the \u201cInvestors\u201d) to engage in the investment, organization, management, and operation of a Japanese subsidiary (\u201cBlackLine K.K.\u201d) of the Company that is focused on the sale of the Company's products in Japan. In October 2018, the Company initially contributed approximately $4.5 million in cash in exchange for 51% of the outstanding common stock of BlackLine K.K. As the Company controls a majority stake in BlackLine K.K., the entity has been consolidated.\nAll of the common stock held by the Investors is callable by the Company or puttable by the Investors upon certain contingent events. Should the call or put option be exercised, the redemption value will be determined based upon a prescribed formula derived from the discrete revenues of BlackLine K.K. and the Company and may be settled, at the Company\u2019s discretion, with Company stock or cash. As a result of the put right available to the Investors in the future, the redeemable non-controlling interest in BlackLine K.K. is classified outside of permanent\nequity in the Company\u2019s consolidated balance sheets, and the balance is reported at the greater of the initial carrying amount adjusted for the redeemable non-controlling interest\u2019s share of earnings, or its estimated redemption value. The resulting changes in the estimated redemption amount are recorded within retained earnings or, in the absence of retained earnings, additional paid-in-capital.\nThe following table summarizes the activity in the redeemable non-controlling interest for the periods indicated below:\nDecember 31,\n2020 2019 2018\nBalance at beginning of period $ 4,905 $ 4,387 $ -\nInvestment by redeemable non-controlling interest - - 4,317\nNet loss attributable to redeemable non-controlling interest (excluding adjustment to non-controlling interest) (1,349) (1,444) (62)\nForeign currency translation 110 129 132\nAdjustment to redeemable non-controlling interest 8,858 1,833 -\nBalance at end of period $ 12,524 $ 4,905 $ 4,387\nNote 5 - Business Combinations\nOn October 2, 2020, the Company completed the acquisition of Rimilia for consideration of $120.0 million payable at the closing of the acquisition with additional cash payments of up to $30.0 million payable upon certain earnout conditions being met. The acquisition expands the Company's capabilities into an adjacent area, adding accounts receivable automation, and accelerating the Company's larger, long-term plan for transforming and modernizing Finance and Accounting. Transaction-related costs incurred by the Company totaling approximately $4.7 million were expensed as incurred and were included in general and administrative expenses in the Company's consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nThe contingent cash consideration was classified as a liability and included in contingent consideration on the Company\u2019s consolidated balance sheet, which will be remeasured on a recurring basis at fair value. To estimate the fair value of the contingent consideration liability, management utilized a Monte Carlo simulation model to value the earn-out based on the likelihood of reaching firm specific targets. Significant inputs used in the fair value measurement of contingent consideration are the amount and timing of Rimilia Annual Recurring Revenue (\"ARR\") in each year over a two year period subsequent to the acquisition date. At the acquisition date, the fair value of the contingent consideration payable was determined to be $17.1 million. At December 31, 2020, there were no material changes in the range of expected outcomes and the fair value of the contingent consideration from the acquisition date.\nThe Company accounted for the transaction as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting. The total purchase price was allocated to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective estimated fair values on the acquisition date. The total purchase consideration was $121.4 million of cash, reduced by a working capital adjustment of $0.2 million, and $17.1 million in contingent consideration payable based on the amount and timing of Rimilia's future ARR. The purchase price allocation is preliminary. Upon the finalization of the working capital adjustment, the amount of the purchase price allocated to goodwill may change.\nThe major classes of assets and liabilities to which the Company has allocated the total fair value of purchase consideration of $138.4 million were as follows (in thousands):\nCash and cash equivalents $ 1,901\nAccounts receivable, net 2,232\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets 1,873\nProperty and equipment, net 180\nOperating lease right-of-use assets 329\nIntangible assets, net 34,500\nGoodwill 104,572\nAccounts payable (533)\nAccrued expenses and other current liabilities (1,885)\nDeferred revenue (2,100)\nOperating lease liabilities (329)\nDeferred tax liabilities, net (2,357)\nTotal consideration $ 138,383\nThe Company believes the amount of goodwill resulting from the acquisition is primarily attributable to increased offerings to customers, enhanced opportunities for growth and innovation, and expected synergies from the assembled workforce. The goodwill resulting from the acquisition is not tax deductible.\nTo determine the estimated fair value of intangible assets acquired, the Company engaged a third-party valuation specialist to assist management. All estimates, key assumptions, and forecasts were either provided by, or reviewed by the Company. While the Company chose to utilize a third-party valuation specialist for assistance, the fair value analysis and related valuations reflect the conclusions of the Company and not those of any third party. The fair value measurements of the intangible assets were based primarily on significant unobservable inputs and thus represent a Level 3 measurement as defined in ASC 820. The acquired intangible asset categories, fair value, and amortization periods, were as follows:\nAmortization\nPeriod Fair Value\n(in thousands)\nDeveloped technology 11 years $ 21,800\nCustomer relationships 4 years 12,700\n$ 34,500\nThe weighted average lives of intangible assets at the acquisition date was 8.4 years.\nThe identified intangible assets, developed technology and customer relationships, were valued as follows:\nDeveloped technology - The Company valued the finite-lived developed technology using the multi-period excess earnings model (\"MPEEM\") under the income approach. This method estimates an intangible asset\u2019s value based on the present value of the incremental after-tax cash flows attributable to the intangible asset. The Company applied judgement which involves the use of significant assumptions with respect to the discount rate, obsolescence rate, revenue forecasts, and EBITDA forecasts.\nCustomer relationships - The Company valued the finite-lived customer relationships using the differential cash flow (with-and-without) model. This method assumes that the value of the intangible asset is equal to the difference between the present value of the prospective cash flows with the intangible asset in place and the present value of the prospective cash flows without the intangible asset. The Company applied judgement, which involved the significant assumption of the discount rate and the customer ramp up rate.\nThe revenue and earnings of the acquired business have been included in the Company\u2019s results since the acquisition date and are not material to the Company\u2019s consolidated financial results. Pro forma revenues and results of operations for this acquisition have not been presented as the impact on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements would be immaterial.\nNote 6-Balance Sheet Components\nInvestments in Marketable Securities\nInvestments in marketable securities presented within current assets on the consolidated balance sheet consisted of the following:\nDecember 31, 2020\nAmortized\nCost Gross\nUnrealized\nGains Gross\nUnrealized\nLosses Fair Value\n(in thousands)\nMarketable securities\nU.S. treasury securities $ 149,991 $ 3 $ - $ 149,994\nCorporate bonds 22,621 - (8) 22,613\nCommercial paper 2,599 - - 2,599\n$ 175,211 $ 3 $ (8) $ 175,206\nDecember 31, 2019\nAmortized\nCost Gross\nUnrealized\nGains Gross\nUnrealized\nLosses Fair Value\n(in thousands)\nMarketable securities\nU.S. treasury securities $ 382,269 $ 67 $ (1) $ 382,335\nCorporate bonds 77,009 63 (18) 77,054\nCommercial paper 28,126 - - 28,126\n$ 487,404 $ 130 $ (19) $ 487,515\nNet gains related to maturities of marketable securities that were reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss to earnings, and included in general and administrative expenses in the Company's consolidated statements of operations, were $0.2 million, $2.0 million, and $1.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. Net gains and losses are determined using the specific identification method. During the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, there were no material realized gains or losses related to sales of marketable securities recognized in the Company\u2019s consolidated statements of operations.\nMarketable securities in a continuous loss position for less than 12 months had an estimated fair value of $12.6 million and an immaterial amount of unrealized losses at December 31, 2020, and an estimated fair value of $83.9 million and an immaterial amount of unrealized losses at December 31, 2019.

The initial resale of the Notes by the initial purchasers to qualified institutional buyers was exempt from registration pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act. The Notes were issued pursuant to an Indenture (the \u201cIndenture\u201d) between the Company and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the \u201cTrustee\u201d).\nInterest on the Notes is payable semi-annually in cash at a rate of 0.125% per annum on February 1 and August 1 of each year, beginning on February 1, 2020. The Notes mature on August 1, 2024 unless redeemed, repurchased or converted prior to such date in accordance with their terms.\nPrior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding May 1, 2024, the Notes will be convertible only under the following circumstances:\n(1) during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending on December 31, 2020, and only during such calendar quarter, if the last reported sale price of the common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price for the Notes on each applicable trading day (the \u201cStock Price Condition\u201d);\n(2) during the five business-day period after any five consecutive trading-day period in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of Notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of the common stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day;\n(3) if the Company calls any or all of the Notes for redemption, at any time prior to the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the redemption date; or\n(4) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events set forth in the Indenture.\nOn or after May 1, 2024, until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date of the Notes, holders of the Notes, at their option, may convert all or any portion of their Notes regardless of the foregoing conditions.\nDuring the quarter ended December 31, 2020, the Stock Price Condition allowing holders of the Notes to convert was met. As a result, holders have the option to convert their Notes at any time during the calendar quarter ending March 31, 2021. The Notes may be convertible thereafter if one or more of the conversion conditions specified in the Indenture and described above is satisfied during future measurement periods.\nThe Notes have an initial conversion rate of 13.6244 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Notes, equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $73.40 per share of common stock. The conversion rate is subject to adjustment for certain events. Upon conversion, the Company will pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of its common stock or a combination of cash and shares of its common stock, at its election. It is the Company\u2019s current intent to settle conversions of the Notes through \u201ccombination settlement\u201d, which involves repayment of the principal portion in cash and any excess of the conversion value over the principal amount in shares of its common stock.\nIf the Company undergoes a fundamental change, as described in the Indenture, prior to the maturity date of the Notes, holders of the Notes may require the Company to repurchase all or a portion of the Notes for cash at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date.\nThe Notes are the Company\u2019s senior unsecured obligations and will rank senior in right of payment to any of the Company\u2019s indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes; equal in right of payment to any of the Company\u2019s unsecured indebtedness that is not so subordinated; effectively junior in right of payment to any of the Company\u2019s secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and structurally junior to all indebtedness and other liabilities (including trade payables) of current or future subsidiaries of the Company.\nThe Indenture contains customary events of default with respect to the Notes and provides that upon certain events of default occurring and continuing, the Trustee may, and the Trustee at the request of holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the Notes shall, declare all principal and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, of the Notes to be due and payable. In case of certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization, involving the Company, all of the principal of, and accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes will automatically become due and payable.\nIn accounting for the issuance of the Notes, the Company allocated the proceeds of the Notes between liability and equity components, with the equity component representing the difference between the proceeds and the fair value of a similar liability that does not have an associated convertible feature. To estimate the fair value of a similar liability that does not have an associated conversion feature, the Company discounted the contractual cash flows of the Notes at an estimated interest rate for a comparable nonconvertible note. The Company applied judgment to determine the interest rate, which was estimated based on the credit spread implied by the Notes issuance and based on the credit spread implied by the J.P. Morgan Yield Index based on estimates of its credit rating. The significant assumptions used in these models were the expected volatility over the term of the Notes and an estimate of the Company\u2019s credit rating. The difference of $114.2 million between the principal amount of the Notes and the liability component was recorded as a debt discount. In addition, the Company incurred $12.8 million of transaction costs related to the Notes of which $9.9 million and $2.9 million, respectively, was allocated to the liability and equity components of the Notes. Transaction costs allocated to the liability component was recorded as additional debt discount. The equity component of the Notes will not be remeasured as long as it continues to meet the conditions for equity classification. The debt discount is amortized to interest expense over the term of the Notes using the effective interest method.\nThe Notes consisted of the following (in thousands):\nDecember 31,\n2020 2019\nLiability:\nPrincipal $ 500,000 $ 500,000\nUnamortized debt discount and issuance costs (92,968) (115,657)\nNet carrying amount $ 407,032 $ 384,343\nCarrying amount of the equity component $ 111,230 $ 111,230\nThe effective interest rate of the liability component of the Notes, excluding the conversion option, is 6.06%.\nThe Company carries the Notes at face value less unamortized discount and issuance costs on its consolidated balance sheets and presents the fair value for disclosure purposes only. The estimated fair value of the Notes, based on a market approach at December 31, 2020 was approximately $941.3 million, which represents a Level 2 valuation. The estimated fair value was determined based on the actual bids and offers of the Notes in an over-the-counter market on the last trading day of the period.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recognized $22.7 million of interest expense related to the amortization of debt discount and issuance costs and $0.6 million of coupon interest expense. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recognized $8.4 million of interest expense related to the amortization of debt discount and issuance costs and $0.2 million of coupon interest expense.\nAt December 31, 2020, the remaining life of the Notes was approximately 43 months.\nAt December 31, 2020 through the date of this filing, the Company has not received any conversion requests for the Notes.\nCapped Calls\nIn conjunction with the issuance of the Notes, the Company entered into capped call transactions (the \u201cCapped Calls\u201d) with a certain counterparty affiliated with the Initial Purchasers and others at a cost of approximately $46.2 million, which was recorded as a reduction of the Company\u2019s additional paid-in capital in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nUnder the Capped Calls, the Company purchased capped call options that in the aggregate relate to the total number of shares of the Company\u2019s common stock, with an exercise price equal to the initial conversion price of each of the Notes, and a cap price of $106.76 per share of common stock, subject to certain adjustments under the terms of the Capped Calls.\nBy entering into the Capped Calls, the Company expects to reduce the potential dilution to its common stock (or, in the event a conversion of the Notes is settled in cash, to reduce its cash payment obligation) in the event that at the time of conversion of the Notes its common stock price exceeds the conversion price of the Notes. As of the date of this filing, the Company has not exercised the Capped Calls in relation to any conversions of the Notes.\nThe cost of the Capped Calls is not expected to be tax deductible as the Company did not elect to integrate the Capped Calls into the Notes for tax purposes.\nNote 11-Intangible Assets and Goodwill\nThe carrying value of intangible assets was as follows (in thousands):\nDecember 31, 2020\nGross Carrying Amount Accumulated Amortization Net Carrying Amount\nTrade name $ 15,977 $ (11,720) $ 4,257\nDeveloped technology 64,358 (40,463) 23,895\nCustomer relationships 44,483 (28,058) 16,425\nDefensive patent 2,333 (236) 2,097\n$ 127,151 $ (80,477) $ 46,674\nDecember 31, 2019\nGross Carrying Amount Accumulated Amortization Net Carrying Amount\nTrade name $ 15,977 $ (10,124) $ 5,853\nDeveloped technology 42,558 (39,270) 3,288\nCustomer relationships 31,783 (23,404) 8,379\n$ 90,318 $ (72,798) $ 17,520\nAmortization expense is included in the following functional statements of operations expense categories.

Realization of future tax benefits is dependent on the Company\u2019s ability to generate sufficient taxable income within the carryforward period. For financial reporting purposes, the Company has incurred losses for each of the past three years. Based on available objective evidence, including the Company\u2019s history of losses, management believes it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will not be fully realizable. Accordingly, the Company provided a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets. The net deferred tax liability position at December 31, 2020 was related to the Company\u2019s foreign tax jurisdictions.\nThe changes in the valuation allowance were as follows (in thousands).\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2019 2018\nValuation allowance, at beginning of year $ 30,598 $ 45,173 $ 23,904\nIncrease in valuation allowance recorded through earnings\n7,064 12,808 21,269\nIncrease (decrease) in valuation allowance recorded through equity 29 (27,383) -\nValuation allowance, at end of year $ 37,691 $ 30,598 $ 45,173\nThe Company did not provide for US income taxes on the undistributed earnings and other outside temporary differences of foreign subsidiaries as they are considered indefinitely reinvested outside the United States. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the amount of temporary differences related to undistributed earnings and other outside temporary differences upon which U.S. income taxes have not been provided is immaterial to these consolidated financial statements.\nDuring 2020, the Company elected to change certain foreign subsidiaries from disregarded to controlled foreign corporation tax status for U.S. tax purposes. The change in tax status resulted in the recapture of $70.6 million and $37.7 million for federal and state tax purposes, respectively. Accordingly, the Company\u2019s federal and state net operating losses have been reduced for these recaptured amounts.\nAt December 31, 2020, the Company had consolidated federal and state net operating loss carryforwards available to offset future taxable income of approximately $188.7 million and $98.2 million, respectively. The federal losses will begin to expire in 2033, and the state losses will begin to expire between 2023 and 2033, depending on the jurisdiction. The Company has federal research and development credits and foreign tax credits of $7.8 million and $2.8 million, respectively, which begin to expire in 2033 and 2023, respectively. The Company has state research and development credits and enterprise zone credits of $6.3 million and $0.6 million, respectively, which are indefinite in expiration and begin to expire in 2023, respectively. Pursuant to Internal Revenue Code Section 382, use of the Company\u2019s net operating loss carryforwards may be limited if the Company experiences a cumulative change in ownership of more than 50% over a three-year period.\nThe following is a rollforward of the Company\u2019s total gross unrecognized tax benefits (in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2019 2018\nBeginning gross unrecognized tax benefits $ 1,737 $ 1,223 $ 672\nIncreases related to prior year tax positions 161 134 130\nIncreases related to current year tax positions 625 380 421\nEnding gross unrecognized tax benefits $ 2,523 $ 1,737 $ 1,223\nAt December 31, 2020, the realization of unrecognized tax benefits were not expected to impact the effective rate due to a full valuation allowance on federal and state deferred taxes. The Company has not recorded any interest or penalties in its provision for income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 and no such amounts have been accrued at December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nThe Company files U.S. federal, various state, and foreign income tax returns. In the normal course of business, the Company is subject to examination by taxing authorities. The tax years from 2013 forward remain subject to examination for federal purposes. Generally, state and foreign tax authorities may examine the Company\u2019s tax returns for four years and five years, respectively, from the date an income tax return is filed. However, the taxing authorities may continue to examine the Company\u2019s federal and state net operating loss carryforwards until the statute of limitations closes on the tax years in which the federal and state net operating losses are utilized.\nThe Company does not anticipate material changes in the total amount or composition of its unrecognized tax benefits within 12 months of the reporting date.\nNote 13-Net Loss per Share\nThe following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net loss per share (in thousands, except per share amounts):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2019 2018\nNumerator:\nNet loss attributable to BlackLine, Inc. $ (46,911) $ (32,535) $ (28,714)\nDenominator:\nWeighted average shares 56,832 55,320 53,912\nAdd: Dilutive effect of securities - - -\nShares used to calculate diluted net loss per share 56,832 55,320 53,912\nBasic net loss per share attributable to BlackLine, Inc. $ (0.83) $ (0.59) $ (0.53)\nDiluted net loss per share attributable to BlackLine, Inc. $ (0.83) $ (0.59) $ (0.53)\nThe following potentially dilutive shares were excluded from the calculation of diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders because they were anti-dilutive:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2019 2018\nStock options with service-only vesting conditions 2,944 3,486 3,820\nStock options with performance conditions 483 683 683\nRestricted stock units 2,072 1,654 1,300\nTotal shares excluded from net loss per share 5,499 5,823 5,803\nAdditionally, approximately 6.8 million shares underlying the conversion option in the Notes are not considered in the calculation of diluted net loss per share as the effect would be anti-dilutive. The shares are subject to adjustment, up to approximately 9.4 million shares for the Notes, if certain corporate events occur prior to the maturity date or if the Company issues a notice of redemption. The Company uses the treasury stock method for calculating any potential dilutive effect of the conversion option on diluted net income per share, if applicable. The conversion option may have a diluted impact on net loss per share when the average market price per share for a given period exceeds the conversion price of the Notes of $73.40 per share.\nNote 14-Contingent Consideration\nIn conjunction with the 2013 Acquisition, option holders of BlackLine Systems, Inc. were allowed to cancel their stock option rights and receive a cash payment equal to the amount of calculated gain (less applicable expense and other items) had they exercised their stock options and then sold their common shares as part of the 2013 Acquisition. As a condition of the 2013 Acquisition, the Company is required to pay additional cash consideration to certain equity holders if the Company realizes a tax benefit from the use of net operating losses generated from the stock option exercises concurrent with the 2013 Acquisition. The maximum contingent cash consideration to be distributed is $8.0 million. The fair value of the contingent consideration was $6.4 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. See Note 2 for additional information regarding the valuation of the contingent consideration.\nAs a condition of the Rimilia Acquisition, the Company is required to pay additional cash consideration if Rimilia realizes certain ARR thresholds. The maximum contingent cash consideration to be distributed is $30.0 million. The fair value of the contingent consideration was $17.1 million at December 31, 2020. See Note 2 for additional information regarding the valuation of the contingent consideration.\nNote 15-Commitments and Contingencies\nPurchase obligations- At December 31, 2020, the Company had $10.6 million of non-cancelable purchase obligations primarily related to future sales and user conferences and software agreements.\nLitigation-From time to time, the Company may become subject to legal proceedings, claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. The Company is not currently a party to any legal proceedings, nor is it aware of any pending or threatened litigation, that would have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, operating results, cash flows, or financial condition should such litigation be resolved unfavorably.\nIndemnification-In the ordinary course of business, the Company may provide indemnification of varying scope and terms to customers, vendors, investors, directors, and officers with respect to certain matters, including, but not limited to, losses arising out of its breach of such agreements, services to be provided by the Company, or from intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties. These indemnification provisions may survive termination of the underlying agreement and the maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under these indemnification provisions may not be subject to maximum loss clauses. The maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under these indemnification provisions is indeterminable. The Company has never paid a material claim, nor has it been sued in connection with these indemnification arrangements. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company has not accrued a liability for these indemnification arrangements because the likelihood of incurring a payment obligation, if any, in connection with these indemnification arrangements was not probable or reasonably estimable.\nNote 16-Equity Awards\n2014 and 2016 Plans\nOn March 3, 2014, the Company adopted the 2014 Stock Incentive Plan (the \u201c2014 Plan\u201d). In November 2016, upon the completion of the Company\u2019s initial public offering, the Company adopted the 2016 Equity Incentive Plan (the \u201c2016 Plan\u201d) and determined that it will no longer grant any additional awards under the 2014 Plan. However, the 2014 Plan continues to govern the terms and conditions of the outstanding awards previously granted under the 2014 plan. Upon the adoption of the 2016 Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable was 6.2 million, plus a number of shares equal to the number of shares subject to outstanding awards granted under the 2014 Plan after the date the 2014 Plan is terminated without having been exercised in full. The Company\u2019s board of directors may grant stock options and restricted stock units to employees, directors and consultants under the 2016 Plan. The aggregate number of shares available under the 2016 Plan and the number of shares subject to outstanding options automatically adjusts for any changes in the Company\u2019s outstanding common stock by reason of any recapitalization, spin-off, reorganization, reclassification, stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split, or similar transaction. Stock options and restricted stock units generally vest over four years and have contractual terms of ten years.\nAt December 31, 2020, 12.2 million shares were available for issuance under the 2016 Plan.\nStock options with service-only vesting conditions\nA summary of the Company\u2019s stock option activity and related information for awards that contain service-only vesting conditions was as follows:\nShares Weighted-\nAverage\nExercise Price Weighted-\nAverage\nRemaining\nContractual Term Aggregate\nIntrinsic Value\n(in thousands) (in years) (in thousands)\nOutstanding at December 31, 2019 3,486 $ 26.92 7.0 $ 85,983\nGranted 578 $ 57.91\nExercised (1,052) $ 20.36\nForfeited/canceled (68) $ 40.66\nOutstanding at December 31, 2020 2,944 $ 35.03 6.8 $ 289,561\nExercisable at December 31, 2020 1,682 $ 24.31\nThe weighted average grant date fair value per share of options granted during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 that contain service only vesting conditions were $26.63, $23.40, and $20.15, respectively. The aggregate intrinsic value of options exercised that contain service only vesting conditions during\nthe years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 were $62.6 million, $25.6 million, and $66.7 million, respectively. Cash received from the exercise of stock options for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 was $20.6 million, $10.6 million, and $14.0 million, respectively.\nUnrecognized compensation expense relating to stock options that contain service only vesting conditions was $24.3 million at December 31, 2020, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.6 years.\nStock options with performance conditions\nIn October 2016, the Company granted options to purchase 682,800 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $14.00 per share to two executive officers that vest upon meeting certain performance conditions and continued service. The performance conditions include meeting yearly cash flow targets and cumulative annual recurring revenue targets through 2019. If each yearly cash flow target is met through 2019, but the full cumulative annual recurring target through 2019 is not met, the executive officers are still able to vest in the award if an additional cash flow target for 2020 and a cumulative annual recurring revenue target through 2020 are achieved. The cash flow performance targets for the final year were set during the quarter ended March 31, 2019, resulting in a grant date being established. The total fair value of the awards at grant date was approximately $24 million. At December 31, 2020, the Company determined that the achievement of the performance targets was not probable and, accordingly, no stock-based compensation expense was recorded for these awards. On July 1, 2020, 200,000 stock options with performance conditions were canceled upon the change in the employment status of one of the officers. On February 17, 2021 (the \"Subsequent Determination Date\"), the Compensation Committee, under delegation from the Board, certified that the performance targets were not achieved on the Subsequent Determination Date, and as such, the remaining outstanding performance awards, totaling 482,800 stock options were forfeited.\nRestricted stock units\nThe following table summarizes activity for restricted stock units:\nRestricted\nStock Units Weighted-Average\nGrant Date\nFair Value\n(in thousands)\nNonvested at December 31, 2019 1,654 $ 46.05\nGranted 1,208 $ 64.28\nVested (656) $ 46.28\nForfeited/canceled (134) $ 51.16\nNonvested at December 31, 2020 2,072 $ 56.29\nAt December 31, 2020, the intrinsic value of nonvested restricted stock units was $276.3 million. At December 31, 2020, total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested restricted stock units was $99.8 million and was expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.7 years.\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan\nUnder the Company\u2019s 2018 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (\u201cESPP\u201d) eligible employees are granted the right to purchase shares at the lower of 85% of the fair value of the stock at the time of grant or 85% of the fair value at the time of exercise. The right to purchase shares is granted twice yearly for six month offering periods in May and November and exercisable on or about the succeeding November and May, respectively, of each year. Under the ESPP, 1.2 million shares remained available for issuance at December 31, 2020. The Company recognized stock-based compensation expense related to the ESPP of $2.9 million, $2.1 million, and $0.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.\nThe fair value of ESPP shares granted was estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2019 2018\nRisk-free interest rate 0.1% - 0.2%\n1.6% - 2.4%\n2.6%\nExpected term (in years) 0.5 - 1\n0.5 - 1\n0.7\nVolatility 50.2% - 57.8%\n39.3% - 54.3%\n42.9%\nAt December 31, 2020, total unrecognized compensation cost related to the 2018 ESPP was $3.1 million and was expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately one year.\nStock-based compensation expense\nStock-based compensation expense recorded in the Company\u2019s consolidated statements of operations was as follows (in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2019 2018\nCost of revenues $ 6,896 $ 4,814 $ 3,265\nSales and marketing 21,546 15,389 8,674\nResearch and development 7,398 4,729 2,570\nGeneral and administrative 13,850 9,120 6,386\n$ 49,690 $ 34,052 $ 20,895\nStock-based compensation capitalized as an asset was $1.3 million, $0.5 million, and $0.4 million in the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.\nThe Company recorded $0.3 million, $0.1 million, and $0.2 million of foreign tax benefits attributable to equity awards for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.\nNote 17-Defined Contribution Plan\nThe Company sponsors a defined contribution retirement plan (the \u201cPlan\u201d) that covers substantially all domestic employees. The Company makes matching contributions of 100% of each $1 of the employee\u2019s contribution up to the first 3% of the employee\u2019s bi-weekly compensation and 50% of each $1 of the employee\u2019s contribution up to the next 2% of the employee\u2019s bi-weekly compensation. Matching contributions to the Plan recorded in the Company\u2019s consolidated statements of operations totaled $4.7 million, $3.6 million, and $2.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.\nNote 18-Geographic Information\nThe following table sets forth the Company\u2019s long-lived assets, which consist of property and equipment, net, and operating lease right-of-use assets by geographic region (in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2019\nUnited States $ 17,600 $ 20,848\nInternational 4,347 4,725\n$ 21,947 $ 25,573\nNote 19-Subsequent Events\nOn February 17, 2021, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of BlackLine, Inc. approved restricted stock unit grants to employees totaling 0.1 million shares. Each restricted stock unit entitles the recipient\nto receive one share of common stock upon vesting of the award.

    "item_9A": "Item 9A. Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nDisclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or \u201cthe Exchange Act\u201d means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC\u2019s rules and forms; and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the company\u2019s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures at December 31, 2020, the last day of the period covered by this Annual Report. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that, at December 31, 2020, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level.\nLimitations on the Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures\nIn designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and our management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. The design of any disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.\nManagement\u2019s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act).\nOur management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in \"Internal Control - Integrated Framework\" (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In accordance with guidance issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission, companies are permitted to exclude acquisitions from their final assessment of internal control over financial reporting for the first fiscal year in which the acquisition occurred. We have excluded from our evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, the internal control activities of Rimilia Holdings Ltd. (\"Rimilia\"), which we acquired in October 2020. The financial results of this acquisition are included from the date of acquisition in the December 31, 2020 consolidated financial statements and constituted 1% of total assets and 1% of total revenues, respectively, at and for the year ended December 31, 2020. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that the Company's internal control over financial reporting was effective at December 31, 2020. The effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears herein.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rules 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) under the Exchange Act that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2020 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.",
