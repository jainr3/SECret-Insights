    "item_1": "Item 1. Business\nZix\u00ae (the \u201cCompany,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cour,\u201d or \u201cus\u201d) is a leading cloud provider of email security, productivity and compliance solutions. Trusted by the nation\u2019s most influential institutions in healthcare, finance and government, Zix delivers a superior experience and easy-to-use solutions for email encryption, data loss prevention (\u201cDLP\u201d), advanced threat protection, unified archiving, and cloud data backup. As a leading provider of cloud-based cybersecurity, compliance, and productivity solutions for businesses of all sizes, we are focused on the protection of business communication, enabling our customers to better secure data and meet compliance needs. We serve organizations in many industries, with particular emphasis on the healthcare (including multiple major hospitals and several Blue Cross Blue Shield plans), financial services (including several major U.S. Banks), and insurance and government (including the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d)) sectors.\nOur email encryption and DLP capabilities enable the secure exchange of email that includes sensitive information. Through a comprehensive secure messaging service, called Email Encryption (formerly ZixEncrypt), we allow an enterprise to use policy-driven rules to determine which email messages should be sent securely or quarantined for review to comply with regulations or company-defined policies.\nThe main differentiation for Email Encryption in the marketplace is our exceptional ease of use. The best example of this is our ability to provide transparent delivery of encrypted email. Most email encryption solutions are focused on the sender. They typically introduce an added burden on recipients, often requiring additional user authentication with the creation of a new user identity and password. We designed our solution to alleviate the recipient\u2019s burden by enabling the delivery of encrypted email automatically and transparently. Zix enables transparent delivery through (1) The Directory (formerly ZixDirectory\u00ae), an email encryption community which is designed to share identities of our tens of millions of members, (2) Zix\u2019s patented Best Method of Delivery\u00ae, which is designed to deliver email in the most secure, most convenient method possible for the recipient, and (3) policy-based encryption, which automatically encrypts and decrypts messages with sensitive content. Our Email Encryption also addresses a business\u2019s greatest source of data loss - corporate email - with an easy, straightforward DLP approach. By focusing strictly on the risks of email, Email Encryption simplifies DLP in comparison to other DLP solutions by decreasing complexity and cost, reducing deployment time and minimizing impact on customer resources and workflow.\nOur Email Encryption solution enables DLP capabilities for email by combining proven policy and content scanning capabilities with quarantine functionality. The quarantine system and its intuitive interface allow administrators to (1) easily define policies and create custom lexicons for quarantining email messages, (2) conveniently manage quarantined messages using flexible searching and filtering options, (3) release or delete individual or multiple quarantined messages with one click, (4) review reports that monitor quarantine activities and trends and (5) automate custom notifications informing employees of quarantined messages.\nIn March 2017, Zix acquired Greenview Data, Inc. (\u201cGreenview\u201d), an email security company. Zix\u2019s acquisition of Greenview addresses increasing buyer demand for email security bundles by adding advanced threat protection, antivirus, anti-spam and archiving capabilities to its industry-leading email encryption. Greenview was a good fit for Zix\u2019s business based on its employees\u2019 expertise in email security and its emphasis on customer success, which align with Zix\u2019s reputation for delivering industry-leading solutions and a superior experience.\nThrough the acquisition of Greenview, Zix launched two new solutions in April 2017 - ZixProtectSM and ZixArchiveSM. ZixProtect is now called Advanced Email Threat Protection while ZixArchive is now called Information Archive. Advanced Email Threat Protection defends organizations from zero-day malware, ransomware, phishing, CEO fraud, W-2 phishing attacks, spam and viruses in email with multi-layer filtering techniques. Accuracy in protecting organizations from email threats is increased further with automated traffic analysis, machine learning and real-time threat analysis. The solution is available as a cloud-based service in a variety of bundles. Information Archive is a low-cost, cloud-based email retention solution that easily enables user retrieval, compliance and eDiscovery. Available as a standalone or add-on solution for other products, Zix\u2019s Information Archive includes policy-based retention, automatic indexing and flexible search capabilities for audit and legal requirements. With on-demand access through the cloud, organizations can conveniently share messages with employees, auditors and outside consultants or legal counsel, as well as revoke access when needed.\nIn April 2018, Zix acquired Erado, a unified archiving company. Erado strengthened Zix\u2019s comprehensive archiving solutions with unified archiving, supervision, security, and messaging solutions for customers that demand bundled services. Erado\u2019s long- standing focus on helping its customers comply with FINRA and SEC regulations helped further strengthen Zix\u2019s offerings for customers with compliance requirements. This acquisition also expanded Zix\u2019s cloud-based email archiving capabilities into more than 50 content channels, including social media, instant message, mobile, web, audio and video.\nOn February 20, 2019, Zix acquired AppRiver, a leading provider of cloud-based cybersecurity solutions for Small and Medium Businesses (\u201cSMB\u201d). The combined company creates one of the leading cloud-based security solutions providers, particularly for the small and mid-size enterprise market. This acquisition further strengthened that alignment by bolstering our Advanced Threat Protection offerings, expanding our go-to-market channels, and providing a stronger cloud platform to drive even more value for our customers and partners. In addition, we now can directly offer Microsoft\u2019s substantial catalog of productivity and Microsoft Office 365 cloud email solutions.\nOn May 7, 2019, Zix acquired DeliverySlip, expanding our portfolio with additional email encryption, information rights management, e-signatures, and secure file sharing solutions.\nOn November 5, 2020, Zix acquired CloudAlly, a pioneer of enterprise-grade, software-as-a-service (SaaS) cloud backup and recovery solutions. CloudAlly provides a secure cloud data backup solution for critical business information, including backup services for Microsoft O365 cloud email, Google applications, and Salesforce.\nOur business operations and service offerings are supported by the ZixData Center\u2122, which is ISO 27001 certified SOC2 accredited and SOC 3 certified for applicable services. The operations of the ZixData Center are independently audited annually to maintain ISO 27001 certification covering numerous categories and controls and AICPA SOC3 certification in the areas of security, confidentiality, integrity and availability. Auditors also produce a SOC2 report on the effectiveness of operational controls used over the audit period.\nOur company was incorporated as a corporation in Texas in 1988. Originally named Amtech Corporation, we changed our name to ZixIt\u00ae Corporation in 1999 when we entered the encrypted email market. In 2002, we became Zix Corporation, and in 2017, the Company rebranded to Zix.\nOverview\nSecurity, productivity, and compliance of business communication is critical in today\u2019s highly connected environment. Companies are deploying more devices, communicating on more channels, and enabling more remote work, all while facing more sophisticated security threats. The key to enabling companies to thrive in this dynamic environment is a secure modern workplace that protects business communication and continuity from on-premises to cloud-based services. Through the Secure Cloud platform, Zix provides email encryption, DLP, advanced threat protection, unified archiving, and cloud data backup services. This combination of cloud-based security and compliance services is further combined with Microsoft\u2019s cloud-based productivity tools within the Secure Cloud extensible platform to provide companies with the secure modern workplace they need to meet the challenges of today.\nMany security threats begin with email. Zix Email Threat Protection secures this key vulnerability in a way that\u2019s straightforward to implement and manage. Our Email Threat Protection provides multilayered filtering that permits legitimate email while blocking malicious threats such as phishing, impersonation, malware, ransomware, and spam-type messages-all automatically. By using advanced threat protection capabilities such as machine learning, attachment sandboxing/disarm, link rewriting and time-of-click analysis, Zix protects business email from the evolving threat landscape.\nProtecting email also means protecting sensitive business data in email communication. Once email leaves the secure business network environment, it can be intercepted, redirected, manipulated or exposed to unauthorized parties. Failure to control and manage such risks can result in enforcement penalties for noncompliance under numerous regulations, in addition to damaged reputation, competitive disadvantage, a loss of intellectual property or other corporate assets, exposure to negligence or liability claims, and diversion of resources to repair such damage. For example, healthcare organizations, business associates and sub-contractors are subject to the Privacy, Security, and Enforcement Rules of the Health Information Portability and Accountability Act (\u201cHIPAA\u201d) enacted in 1996, and as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (\u201cHITECH Act\u201d) enacted in 2009. Financial institutions are subject to data privacy laws including the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (\u201cGLBA\u201d) enacted in 1999. These U.S. federal laws help drive the use of encrypted email. In addition, individual states and foreign countries have enacted privacy laws requiring the safeguard of personal data, and almost all states encourage email encryption by allowing exemptions from data breach notification laws.\nOur Email Encryption Service allows a user to send encrypted email to any email user anywhere and on any Internet-enabled device. Encrypted email is delivered through the patented Best Method of Delivery protocol which automatically determines the most direct and appropriate means of delivery, based on the sender\u2019s and recipient\u2019s communications environment and preferences. Our Best Method of Delivery makes the technology simple for end users and provides flexibility and ease of implementation for information technology professionals. We believe the ability to send messages through different modes of delivery is one of many differentiators that makes our Email Encryption Service superior to competitive offerings.\nZix Email Encryption also includes our unique email data loss prevention capabilities that automatically detect sensitive data using our industry leading pre-built filters that cover many of today\u2019s industry regulations including HIPAA, GLBA, and state privacy laws. Zix also provides the ability to build new custom filters to meet the needs of any business. Additionally, customers can define policies to determine what should be done when sensitive information is found. This can include blocking, routing, encrypting or quarantining the email. When quarantined, users and authorized administrators can review the violations to determine appropriate action.\nZix Information Archive solution provides additional compliance protection, archiving not only email communication but all types of business communication including, instant messaging, chat, social media, web and much more. The ability to collect various forms of digital business communication into a centralized archive and then easily search and collect data is critical for organizations in both regulated and non-regulated industries. Zix also provides advanced supervisory capabilities for highly regulated companies and enables the digital sharing of eDiscovery results with outside auditors and legal counsel.\nA comprehensive data protection plan is more important than ever as companies around the world are focusing on cybersecurity, particularly for their remote workforce. To help companies address this, Zix has added a Cloud Data Backup service through the acquisition of CloudAlly. Our Cloud Data Backup enables the secure backup and recovery of cloud services such as Microsoft Office 365 and Sharepoint, Google Workspace, Salesforce, Dropbox and more. Our backup and recovery capabilities include automated or on-demand backup and non-destructive restore.\nZix also enables both customers and partners to manage their Zix security and compliance services through our world-class Secure Cloud platform. Secure Cloud provides a centralized management platform where Zix services can be accessed. As a true multi-tenant environment, partners can add services and manage their customers, while integrating Secure Cloud with their own back office systems.\nBy combining our solutions, as well as selling Microsoft productivity and email solutions, Zix makes it possible for customers to build a secure modern workplace that protects their business communication. Zix provides security, productivity and compliance in an easy to implement and manage cloud service.\nCompetition\nThe most significant differentiators for Zix as compared with our competition is ease of use and exceptional support. We are best known for our superior ease of use with transparent delivery of encrypted email messages. We are able to deliver transparent email encryption as a result of The Directory and Best Method of Delivery capabilities of our Email Encryption. The Directory is a global \u201cwhite pages\u201d enabling transparent secure communications with other Email Encryption customers using our centralized key management system and overall unique approach to implementing encrypted email. Our patented Best Method of Delivery (BMOD) automatically identifies the best method of encrypting an email to provide the highest security and ease-of-use to each user. BMOD can deliver encrypted email using a variety of encrypt technologies including S/MIME, TLS, \u201cpush\u201d delivery and secure portal \u201cpull\u201d delivery mechanisms.\nOur exceptional support is another area that differentiates Zix from the competition. Zix focuses on ensuring every step of the experience for both customers and partners is smooth and easy. For example, new customers are provided with white glove treatment to ensure their initial implementation and setup goes smoothly. Customers also have direct access to our threat analysts to obtain help, which provides peace of mind as the threat landscape evolves. Customers have access to Zix via phone or email night-and-day to address any questions or concerns.\nWe view our primary competitors in the email security space to be Proofpoint, Mimecast, and Barracuda Networks. Technically, while these companies also offer advanced threat protection, encrypted email and archiving, we believe that Zix offers superior customer service and ease-of-use not matched by the competition. Nevertheless, some of these competitors are large enterprises with substantial financial and technical resources that exceed ours. We are also competing against (a) other value-added cloud distributor platforms such as PAX8, Datto, and Sherweb; and (b) other providers with product offerings that compete with products in our portfolio such as Virtru (known for email encryption), Agari (known for threat protection), Smarsh (known for archive), and Veeam (known for cloud data backup). In addition, while our products provide an additional layer of protection, some customers settle for the email security features and customer support offered by Microsoft for its Office 365 email solution.\nRegulatory Drivers\nWe have been successful in securing market penetration in our target vertical markets of healthcare, finance services and government primarily due to regulations that address the need for data privacy and security.\nIn addition to the need to protect personal data and sensitive business communication, demand for email security in the healthcare sector, including business associates of healthcare providers, is augmented by regulatory requirements under HIPAA and HITECH Act. The Privacy and Security rules under those acts provide severe penalties for violations, including strict breach notification requirements, and allow states to pursue HIPAA violations. In the financial services industry, financial institutions and their service providers are subject to the GLBA, which is enforced by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (\u201cFTC\u201d). The FTC has issued guidance saying that businesses that transmit sensitive data by email should ensure that data is encrypted.\nExpanded privacy regulations at the state-level and in international jurisdictions, such as the EU General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d), serve as additional regulatory drivers for our product offerings.\nIn choosing an email security provider, companies are influenced by the solutions chosen by their regulators. Our customers include the federal regulators in the FFIEC as well as state banking regulators. Our service has been a recommended solution of the Conference of State Bank Supervisors, whose members regulate state-chartered banks across the U.S.\nSales and Marketing\nWe sell our email encryption, DLP, advanced threat protection, unified archiving, and cloud data backup services through a direct sales force that focuses on larger businesses and a telesales force that focuses on small to medium-sized accounts. We also use a network of resellers and other distribution partners, including other managed service providers (\u201cMSP\u201d) seeking security, productivity, and compliance offerings. Approximately 76% of our new business transacted in 2020 resulted from our partner relationships. As of December 31, 2020, we had nearly 5,000 monthly transacting MSP partners.\nResearch and Development\nWe incurred research and development (\u201cR&D\u201d) expenses of $22.8 million, $20.4 million, and $11.3 million for the twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.\nOver the course of 2020, we continued to make investments toward strengthening and expanding our platform and service portfolio. We completed initial development of and introduced the Secure Cloud multi-tenant infrastructure with fully integrated new and refreshed versions of encryption, unified archiving, secure file sharing, and advanced threat protection. We released a new Microsoft Teams connection for use with the Archiving subsystem. We integrated into Secure Cloud Comprehensive Reporting, Security Information and Event Management (SIEM), Professional Services Automation (PSA) interface provisioning capabilities and Mailbox Security Auditing. We designed service components to be flexibly configured and integrated with productivity services, such as Microsoft Office 365 mailboxes or offered separately. The closing months of the year saw us working on features related to expansion efforts, such as enabling multiple languages support and data residency outside of the US.\nThis year, we also developed Advanced Email Encryption for Secure Cloud, providing the full best-in-class suite of Zix Encryption features to Secure Cloud including our next-generation cloud-native multi-tenant DLP Quarantine service. Advanced Email Encryption provides senders and supervisors detailed information about policy decisions which caused an email to encrypt, helping promote compliance awareness and flagging potential compliance issues. It is designed to work seamlessly with other Security, Compliance, and Productivity Secure Cloud subsystems, with a focus on ease of provisioning.\nOver the closing months of the year, we developed reusable design constructs that connect Secure Cloud with legacy Zix Encryption services. This creates a path for our loyal encryption customers to add new Secure Cloud capabilities through a single management interface that requires minimal service support engagement. We began developing a new, distributed Enterprise Bus backbone for Secure Cloud that promises to link future Lifecycle Management, Customer Tech Touch, Distributed Learning and Business Intelligence, Data Warehouse and other advanced service intelligence functions by way of an API-enabled open architecture.\nIntellectual Property\nWe depend upon our ability to develop, maintain and protect our proprietary technology and our related intellectual property rights. We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, trade secret and copyright law and contractual restrictions to protect the proprietary aspects of our technology and related property rights and to defend against infringement and/or misappropriation claims from others. As of December 31, 2020, we owned 48 U.S. patents with various expiration dates through 2036, and 10 pending U.S. applications. We have a program to file applications for and obtain patents and trademarks in the United States and in specific foreign countries where we believe filing for such protection is appropriate. While intellectual property rights are generally important to our business, we do not believe that our business is dependent on any single item of intellectual property, or that any single item of intellectual property is material to the operation of our business. Rather, we believe that our intellectual property rights provide us with a competitive advantage, and from time to time we have taken steps to enforce our intellectual property rights as a means of protecting that competitive advantage.\nOur Company and certain of our subsidiaries are the owners of trademarks and service marks registered with the United States Patent & Trademark Office. These marks are renewable indefinitely, contingent upon continued use and payment of applicable renewal fees. Additionally, our Company and certain of our subsidiaries own several pending trademark applications with the United States Patent & Trademark Office as well as a number of United States common law trademarks, several service marks and trademarks and service marks registered in foreign countries. We consider our trademark and service marks as valuable assets of the Company due to their recognition by our customers. We are not aware of any valid claims of infringement or challenges to our right to use any of our trademarks or service marks in the United States.\nPlease see generally the risks that are more fully disclosed in \u201c",
    "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe following is a cautionary discussion of risks, uncertainties and assumptions that we believe are significant to our business, financial condition and financial results. In addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the following are some of the important factors that, individually or in the aggregate, we believe could make our results differ materially from those described in any forward-looking statements. It is impossible to predict or identify all such factors and, as a result, you should not consider the following factors to be a complete discussion of risks, uncertainties and assumptions.\nRisks Related to our Business\nWe face various risks related to health epidemics, pandemics and similar outbreaks, which may have material adverse effects on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur business and financial results may be negatively impacted by health epidemics, pandemics, and similar outbreaks. The ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic has had and may continue to have negative impacts on our business, including causing volatility in demand for our products, changes in customer behavior and spending patterns, disruptions in the operations of our global third party suppliers and business partners, limitations on our employees\u2019 ability to work and travel, as well as significant changes in the economic and/or political conditions in the markets in which we operate. In addition, such a crisis could significantly increase the probability or consequences of the risks our business faces in ordinary circumstances. Despite our ongoing efforts to manage these impacts, the ultimate effect of the COVID-19 pandemic or any similar health epidemic, pandemic or outbreak on us depends on factors beyond our knowledge or control, including the duration and severity of any such outbreak and federal, state, local and foreign governmental actions taken to contain the spread and mitigate its public health effects.\nOur business depends upon customers using email and certain social media platforms to exchange confidential information, and a significant shift of those messages to other communication channels could impair our growth prospects and negatively affect our business, financial condition and financial results.\nOur customers deploy and use our products and services to easily, securely and confidentially send and receive electronic messages, by way of internet communications channels including email and certain social media platforms. Our business and revenue substantially depend on our current and potential customers using email and social media to exchange sensitive information electronically. New technologies, products, or business models that could support migration to alternative means of secure communications could be disruptive to our business. If prospective or current customers were to send and receive sensitive information using technology or communication channels other than email or the social media platforms that we support, our growth prospects and our business, financial condition and financial results could be materially adversely affected.\nOur business relies on securing new customer subscriptions and subscription renewals from existing customers and, because we recognize subscription revenue over the term of the applicable customer agreement, a decline in subscription renewals or new service agreements may not be reflected immediately in our operating results.\nThe vast majority of our revenue is derived from customer subscriptions, and existing customers have no contractual obligations to purchase beyond the initial subscription or contract period. Our ability to grow our business is dependent in part on customers renewing their existing subscriptions and purchasing additional solutions or services after the initial term of their agreement. Though we maintain and analyze historical data with respect to rates of customer renewals, upgrades and expansions, those rates may not accurately predict future trends in renewal of certain products and services offered by us. If our customers cancel or amend their agreements with us during their term, do not renew their agreements, renew on less favorable terms or do not purchase additional solutions or products during renewal periods, our revenue may grow more slowly than expected or decline and our profitability may be harmed.\nAdditionally, we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, some level of attrition with existing customers and we may not maintain historical subscription rates, and we may be unable to accurately predict our customer renewal rates. Although we have historically retained approximately 90% of our recurring revenue on an annual basis, there has been some sustained decline in such retention in certain service areas and our customers\u2019 renewal rates may further decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including the level of their satisfaction with our products and technical support services, customer merger or acquisition activity, customer budgets, the pricing of our products compared with those offered by our competitors, technology trends, the prevailing regulatory regime and general market conditions. If new subscriptions or subscription renewals decline from their current levels, our revenue or revenue growth may decline, and our business may suffer which could have a materially adverse effect on our financial performance.\nWe recognize revenue from some customers ratably over the terms of their customer agreements, which may be one year or two years. As a result, much of the revenue we report in each quarter is deferred revenue from customer agreements entered into during previous quarters. Consequently, a decline in new or renewed client agreements in any one quarter will not be fully reflected in our revenue or our results of operations until future periods. Accordingly, this revenue recognition model also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue through additional sales in any period, as revenue from new clients must be recognized over the applicable subscription term.\nThe security of our networks and data centers is critical to our business and an actual or perceived breach of security through a cyber-attack or otherwise could cause us to lose customers and could negatively affect our reputation, business, financial condition and financial results.\nWe are dependent on our networks and data centers to provide our products and services. Due to the nature of the products and services we provide and the sensitive nature of the information we collect, process, store, use and transmit, we might be targets of cyber-attacks from unauthorized parties attempting to penetrate our networks and data centers. We are also susceptible to inadvertent data protection breaches, computer viruses and other similar disruptions from process, coding or human error that could harm our networks and data centers. Our business depends on customers having and maintaining confidence that we provide effective network and security protection. To reduce the risk of a successful cyber-attack or similar event, we have implemented significant physical and logical security measures to detect, identify and mitigate threats as well as to monitor for and respond to potential breaches and incidents. Despite these security measures, we may be unable to anticipate malicious techniques or implement adequate measures to prevent an intrusion and our networks and data centers may remain vulnerable. We may not be able to correct a security flaw or particular vulnerability promptly, or at all. Further efforts to limit the ability of malicious third parties to disrupt or undermine our security efforts may be costly to implement and may not be successful. Also, many of our products are cloud-based, and the amount of data we store for our customers on our servers has been increasing as our business has grown. The risk that these types of events could seriously harm our business has increased as we have expanded the number of cloud-based products we offer and begun operating in more countries. Despite the implementation of security measures, if a cyber-attack or other breach of security occurs, or is perceived to have occurred, in our internal systems or at our data centers and networks, it could cause negative publicity, interruption of our services, damage to our reputation, unauthorized disclosure of our customers\u2019 confidential or proprietary information (including personally identifiable information), disclosure of our intellectual property, disclosure, modification or removal of our confidential or sensitive information, theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets, loss of customers, lost revenue and increased expense (including potentially indemnification or warranty costs), any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and financial results.\nIn addition, while we maintain cyber liability insurance coverage that may cover certain liabilities in connection with a cybersecurity incident, we cannot be certain that our insurance coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred, that insurance will continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, or that any insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claim. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage, or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, financial results and reputation.\nPublic key and other cryptographic technologies used in our businesses are subject to technology risks that could reduce demand for our products and services and could negatively affect our business, financial condition and financial results.\nMaterial components of our business employ public key cryptography technology and other encryption technologies to encrypt and decrypt sensitive data. The security afforded by encryption depends on the strength of the private key, which is predicated on the assumption that it is very difficult to mathematically derive the private key from the related public key. Successful decryption of intercepted encrypted email, or public reports of successful decryption, whether or not true, could reduce demand for our products and services. As new methods or technologies, such as quantum computing, make it easier to derive the private key from the related public key, the security of encryption services using public key cryptography technology could be impaired and our products and services could become less marketable. That could require us to make significant changes to our products and services, which could increase our costs, damage our reputation, or otherwise harm our business. Any of these events could reduce our revenues, increase our expenses and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and financial results.\nOur business depends substantially on our data center facilities, public cloud services from Amazon and Microsoft, and other systems and infrastructure provided by third parties, and their unreliability or unavailability for a significant period could cause us to lose customers and could negatively affect our business, financial condition and financial results.\nOur business relies on third-party suppliers of computer, cloud and telecommunications infrastructure to provide our products and services through the global internet and to provide network access between our data centers, our customers and end-users of our products and services. Much of the computer and communications hardware upon which our businesses depend is located in our data center facilities in North America and Europe. In addition to our data centers, as our business has grown, we have increased the use of co-located data centers managed by third parties to support our computer and communications hardware. If we are unable to maintain our contractual relationships with existing co-located data center providers or establish new contractual relationships with co-located data center providers on favorable terms, or at all, we could be required to move our equipment to a new facility and may experience delays, increased costs or downtime for our customers. Our company-owned and co-located data centers might be damaged or interrupted as a result of numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including epidemics, fire, flood, hurricanes, natural disasters, climate change (such as sea level rise, drought, and increased storm severity), power loss, mechanical failure, telecommunications failure, break-ins, cyber-attacks, sabotage, vandalism, earthquakes, terrorist attacks, hostilities or war or other events. Computer viruses, equipment failure, denial of service attacks, and similar disruptions affecting the internet, infrastructure\nsupplied by third parties or our systems might cause service interruptions, delays and loss of critical data, and could prevent us from providing our services. Problems affecting our data center operations or the networks on which we rely, whether or not in our control, could result in loss of revenues, increased expenses, failure to achieve market acceptance, diversion of resources, injury to our reputation, liability and increased costs, and may cause our customers to terminate or elect not to renew their agreements. We do not carry sufficient insurance to compensate us for all losses that may occur as a result of any of these events. Though our products generally tolerate isolated supplier failures, the occurrence of any of these events, including multiple supplier outages or problems, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and financial results.\nIn addition, we use various communications service suppliers and the global internet to provide network access between our data centers, our customers and end-users of our products and services. If those suppliers do not enable us to provide our customers with reliable, real-time access to our systems, we may be unable to gain or retain customers. These suppliers periodically experience outages or other operational problems as a result of internal system failures or external third-party actions. They might be damaged or interrupted as a result of numerous factors, many of which are beyond our or their control, including fire, flood, hurricanes, natural disasters, climate change (such as sea level rise, drought, and increased storm severity), power loss, mechanical failure, telecommunications failure, break-ins, cyber-attacks, sabotage, vandalism, earthquakes, terrorist attacks, hostilities or war or other events. Computer viruses, equipment failure, denial of service attacks, and similar disruptions affecting the internet, infrastructure supplied by third parties or our systems might cause service interruptions, delays and loss of critical data, and could prevent us from providing our services. Further, striving to protect email recipients from phishing and other exports, such suppliers email and web page security protection systems outside of our control may randomly and inadvertently delay or block important customer email streams or interfere with linkages between emails and web page access. Though our products generally tolerate isolated supplier failures, multiple supplier outages, problems providing reliable, real-time access or inadvertent delays or blocking of access could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and financial results.\nDevelopment of our products depends on software service and maintenance and information systems provided by third parties, and their unreliability, system failures, interruptions or breaches of security could cause us to lose customers and could negatively affect our business, financial condition and financial results.\nWe rely on third-party contractors, often located outside of the U.S., to perform certain services and maintain our software and develop our products. If we are unable to maintain our contractual relationships with existing third parties that facilitate our business or establish new contractual relationships with third parties that facilitate our business on favorable terms, or at all, it could adversely affect our ability to provide products and services to our customers. The third parties upon which we rely may fail to operate properly or experience operational disruption, failure, termination, or capacity constraints which might cause service interruptions, delays and loss of critical data, and could prevent us from timely development of our products or from providing our services. Such parties could also be the source or cause of an attack on, or breach of, our operational systems, data or infrastructure. Problems with respect to such third parties, whether or not in our control, could result in loss of revenues, increased expenses, inability to bill our customers, failure to achieve market acceptance, diversion of resources, injury to our reputation, liability and increased costs, and may cause our customers to terminate or elect not to renew their agreements.\nOur failure to keep pace with rapid technology changes could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and financial results.\nThe markets for our products and services are characterized by rapid technological developments and frequent changes in customer requirements. We must continually improve the performance, features and reliability of our products and services, particularly in response to competitive offerings, to keep pace with these developments. We must ensure that our products and services address evolving operating environments, devices, industry trends, certifications and standards. We also may need to develop products that are compatible with new operating systems while remaining compatible with existing, popular operating systems. We spend considerable resources on technology research and development. In addition, we are also focused on addressing new and accelerating market trends, such as the continued decline of on premise email security and advance threat protection solution(s) and the continued transition towards cloud-based solutions, which requires us to continue to improve our product and service offerings. We may experience delays in the anticipated timing of activities related to our efforts to address these challenges and higher than expected or unanticipated execution costs. Our failure to introduce new or enhanced products on a timely basis, to keep pace with rapid industry, technological or market changes or to gain customer acceptance for our new and existing products and services, such as Advanced Threat Protection, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and financial results.\nMobile devices are increasingly used to access the internet, and our cloud-based and mobile support products may not operate or be as effective when accessed through these devices, which could harm our business.\nHistorically, we designed our web-based products for use on a desktop or laptop computer; however, mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablets, are increasingly being used as the primary means for accessing the internet and conducting e-commerce. We are dependent on the interoperability of our products with third-party mobile devices and mobile operating systems, as well as web browsers we do not control. Any changes in such devices, systems or web browsers which degrade the functionality of our products or give preferential treatment to competitive products could adversely affect usage of our products. In the event our customers have difficulty accessing and using our products on mobile devices, our customer growth, business and operating results could be adversely affected.\nFailure to effectively manage our product and service lifecycles could harm our business.\nAs part of the natural lifecycle of our products and services and synergies resulting from our recent acquisitions, we periodically inform customers that products or services will be reaching their end of life or end of availability and will no longer be supported or receive updates and security patches. To the extent these products or services remain subject to a service contract with the customer, we offer to transition the customer to alternative products or services. Failure to effectively manage our product and service lifecycles and effectively convert to alternative products and services could result in us losing customers and revenues, or incurring contractual liabilities, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and financial results.\nWe face strong competition, which could negatively affect our business, financial condition and financial results.\nThe markets in which we compete are characterized by rapid change and converging technologies and are very competitive. With rising demand for private and secure email communications, there is strong competition for our products and services. Our Email Encryption, Threat Protection, Archive, Data Loss Prevention, Information Archive, and Information Backup business competes with products and services offered by companies such as Barracuda Networks, Proofpoint, and Mimecast. Strong competition requires us to develop new technology solutions and service offerings to expand the functionality and value that we offer to our customers. Our competitors may develop products and services that are perceived by customers as equivalent to, or having advantages over, our products and services. We are also competing against other value-added cloud distributor platforms such as PAX8, Datto, and Sherweb, and our ability to maintain our managed service provider partners is dependent on our success in successfully competing with such competitors. Other competitors include companies with product offerings that compete with products in our portfolio such as Virtru (known for email encryption), Agari known for threat protection), Smarsh (known for archive), and Veeam (known for cloud data backup). In addition, Microsoft, one of our main partners, also creates products that they offer on their own that may compete with us, including encryption services. Competitors could capture a significant share in our markets, causing our sales and revenue to decline or grow more slowly. Barriers to entry are relatively low, and new ventures are often formed that create products and platforms competitive with our products and platforms. Further, a large player such as Microsoft could make additional substitute products and services and bundle them with their basic products and services, such as Office 365. Competitive pressures could lead to price discounting or to increases in expenses such as advertising and marketing costs. Increased competition could also decrease demand for our products and services. Competition could reduce our revenues and net income and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and financial results.\nSome of our competitors have longer operating histories, more extensive operations, greater name recognition, larger technical staffs, bigger product development and acquisition budgets, established relationships with more distributors and hardware vendors, and greater financial and marketing resources than we do. These advantages might enable them (independently or through alliances) to develop and expand functionality of products and services faster than we can, to spend more money to market and distribute products and services than we can, or to offer their products and services at prices lower than ours. These advantages could reduce our revenues and net income and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and financial results.\nWe rely on marketing efforts of our direct sales force and indirect sales channels to promote our brand and acquire new customers. If we do not effectively expand and train our sales force or lose access to these channels, we may be unable to add new customers or increase sales to our existing customers and our business may be negatively affected.\nWe rely on our direct sales force, our MSP partners and a variety of channels, including online keyword search, television, email and social media marketing, to promote our brand, to obtain new customers and to sell additional solutions to our existing customers. We believe that there is significant competition for sales personnel with the skills and technical knowledge that we require and our ability to achieve significant revenue growth will depend, in large part, on our success in recruiting, training and retaining sufficient numbers of sales personnel to support our growth. New hires require significant training and, in most cases, take significant time before they achieve full productivity. If we lose access to one of more of our marketing channels, either because the costs of advertising become prohibitively expensive or we change our marketing practices, or for other reasons, we may become unable to promote our brand effectively, limiting our ability to grow the business. Our marketing channels and our recent and planned hires may not become as productive or cost-effective as we expect in generating traffic to our website, attracting customers and renewing sales of our products. If we are unable to hire and train sufficient numbers of effective sales personnel or maintain access to sufficient channels, or the sales personnel and marketing channels are not successful in obtaining new clients or increasing sales to our existing client base, our business will be harmed.\nWe enlist MSP\u2019s and other third-party distributors and resellers to market our products and services, and our failure to succeed in those relationships could negatively affect our business, financial condition and financial results.\nWe distribute a significant percentage of our products and services by entering into alliances with third parties, including MSP\u2019s and other third-party distributors and resellers (collectively referred to as \u201cdistributors), who can offer our products and services along with their own or our competitors\u2019 products and services. Increased reliance on third parties to market and distribute our products and services exposes us to a variety of risks. For example, we have limited control over and visibility into the sales cycles of third-party distributors, which could increase the length of our sales cycle, cause our revenue to fluctuate unpredictably and make it difficult to accurately forecast our revenue. Further, our distributors\u2019 operations may also be negatively impacted by other effects the COVID-19 pandemic is having on the global economy, such as increased credit risk of end customers and uncertain credit markets. In addition, we may not succeed in developing or maintaining marketing alliances. Companies with which we have distributorship or marketing alliances may in the future discontinue their relationships with us, form alliances with our competitors, or develop and market their own products and services that compete with ours. If a significant distributor were to discontinue its relationship with us, we could experience an interruption in the distribution of our products and services and our revenues could decline. Our failure to develop, maintain and expand strategic distribution relationships could reduce our revenues and net income and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and financial results.\nOur relationship with Microsoft is non-exclusive and our failure to effectively manage and maintain this relationship or to successfully compete with other providers of Microsoft could negatively affect our business, financial condition and financial results.\nBecause we provide our products to customers with Microsoft products, including Office 365, as well as the fact that a significant portion of our revenue is reliant on Microsoft products, Microsoft has a significant direct and indirect influence on our business. If we do not maintain our relationship with Microsoft as a reseller, or if they decide to stop utilizing resellers in distribution of their products, make an adverse change in their reseller program, change their product offerings or experience a major cyber-attack or similar event, it could reduce our revenues and net income and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and financial results.\nMicrosoft can change its product pricing and discounting to us at any time, and unless we are able to pass through such changes to our customers, our revenue, gross profit and operating results would be negatively impacted. Further, Microsoft currently offers co-op and rebate programs in conjunction with our resale activities in which we earn money for certain purposes or achieving certain predefined objectives. If Microsoft changed the way that co-op or rebates are earned by eliminating or negatively modifying the programs, our gross profit and operating results distribution of our products and services and our revenues could decline.\nOur relationship with Microsoft is non-exclusive and there are other resellers that also provide Microsoft products, including Office 365. Currently, we maintain a portion of the discount provided by Microsoft in the reseller program and pass along part of the discount to our distributors. Other resellers may be passing along to their third-party distributors the discount provided by Microsoft differently than us, which may increase competition for third-party distributors. Our failure to effectively compete with other Microsoft resellers could reduce our revenues and net income and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and financial results.\nOur future growth and success may be affected by acquisitions. If we are not able to successfully identify, negotiate, complete and integrate acquisitions, our operating results and prospects could be negatively affected.\nWe have acquired and expect to continue to acquire new products and technology, as well as customers, through acquisitions. The success of our future acquisition strategy will depend on our ability to identify suitable acquisition candidates, negotiate on favorable terms, successfully complete and fully integrate such acquisitions. We may have to pay cash, incur debt or issue equity securities to pay for future acquisitions, each of which could adversely affect our financial condition or the value of our common stock. Equity issuances in connection with potential future acquisitions may also result in dilution to our stockholders. Acquisitions are inherently risky, and any acquisition we complete may not be successful. Acquisitions we pursue, including our recent AppRiver, DeliverySlip, and CloudAlly acquisitions, involve numerous risks, including the following:\n\u2022\ndifficulties in integrating and managing the operations and technologies of the companies and assets we acquire, including the diversion of management\u2019s attention from normal daily operations of our business;\n\u2022\ndifficulty and high costs associated with management and disposition of legacy non-core products and services;\n\u2022\nour inability to maintain or changes in relationships with the key customers, the key employees, the key business relationships and the reputations of the businesses and products we acquire and the migration to our own products and solutions, particularly with travel limitations during the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in predicting or achieving synergies and cost savings between our existing businesses and acquired businesses;\n\u2022\nour responsibility for the liabilities of the businesses we acquire, including liabilities arising out of their failure to operate correctly, maintain effective data security, data integrity, disaster recovery and privacy controls prior to acquisition, or their infringement or alleged infringement of third-party intellectual property, contract or data access rights prior to acquisition, tax liabilities, litigation claims from terminated employees, customers, former stockholders or other third parties and other known or unknown liabilities; and\n\u2022\ndelays in our ability to implement internal standards, controls, procedures and policies in the businesses we acquire increasing our vulnerability to network attacks security incidents, or similar events, particularly when onboarding and training processes are remote or online programs as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nUnanticipated events and circumstances occurring in future periods may affect the realizability of intangible assets that we are required to record on our balance sheet as a result of acquisitions. These events and circumstances could include significant under-performance relative to projected future operating results and significant changes in our overall business or product strategies. Such events and circumstances may cause us to revise our estimates and assumptions used in analyzing the value of our intangible assets, and any such revision could result in a non-cash impairment charge that could have a material impact on our financial results.\nWe might not be able to fully realize our deferred tax assets (including our NOL\u2019s).\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had deferred tax assets, primarily consisting of U.S. federal tax net operating loss (\u201cNOL\u201d) carryovers, of $57.9 million, against which we provided a valuation allowance of $25.2 million, reflecting the estimated value of that portion of our NOL\u2019s and other deferred tax assets we currently believe we cannot use. The ultimate realization of our deferred tax assets is dependent upon generating future taxable income to utilize our NOL carryovers before they expire. While we have recorded valuation allowances against certain of our deferred tax assets, the valuation allowances are subject to change as facts and circumstances change. In addition, the value of our deferred tax assets and liabilities are dependent upon the tax rates and other tax laws expected to be in effect at the time they are realized. A change in U.S. federal corporate tax rates or other tax laws impacting NOL carryovers would change the value of our deferred taxes, which could be material.\nSection 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (\u201cSection 382\u201d), generally imposes an annual limitation on the amount of NOLs and other pre-change tax attributes (such as tax credits) that may be used to offset taxable income (and reduce taxes) of a corporation that has undergone a \u201cSection 382 ownership change.\u201d A Section 382 ownership change generally occurs if one or more shareholders (or groups of shareholders) that are each deemed to own at least 5% of our stock increase their ownership by more than 50 percentage points over their lowest ownership percentage during a rolling three-year period. As of December 31, 2020, we have not experienced a Section 382 ownership change. Therefore, our utilization of NOL carryforwards was not then subject to an annual limitation. While we are continually monitoring changes in ownership of our stock, many such changes are not within our control and we can provide no assurance that a Section 382 ownership change will not occur. If we were to experience a Section 382 ownership change in the future as a result of subsequent shifts in our stock ownership, our ability to use our pre-change NOLs to offset future taxable income (and pre-change tax credits to offset future federal income tax liability) may be subject to limitations, which could potentially result in increased future tax liability to us. In any case, our NOL and tax credit carryforwards are subject to review and potential disallowance upon audit by the tax authorities.\nUnfavorable economic environments, particularly in the U.S., could negatively affect our business, financial condition and financial results.\nChallenging economic conditions worldwide have from time to time contributed, and may contribute to future slowdowns in the technology and networking industries at large, as well as in the email/data security market and in specific geographic markets in which we operate. If economic growth in those markets, particularly in the U.S., which accounts for a substantial majority of our revenue, slows, or credit is unavailable at a reasonable cost, current and potential customers may delay or reduce technology purchases, including the deployment or expansion of our products and services and make it difficult to accurately forecast and plan our future business activities. Additionally, as our business grows in international markets, we may become more susceptible to unfavorable economic environments outside the U.S. and that could compound the negative effects of unfavorable economic environments in markets in which we currently operate.\nIf our products have defects or security vulnerabilities, our reputation, business, financial condition and financial results could be negatively affected and we could experience negative publicity, declining sales and legal liability.\nThe threats facing our customers are constantly evolving and the techniques used by experienced hackers to access or sabotage data change frequently, often are not recognized until launched against a target, and may originate from less regulated or remote areas around the world. As a result, we must constantly update our product solutions to respond to these threats. We produce complex solutions that incorporate leading-edge technology, including both hardware and software that must operate in a wide variety of technology environments. Software may contain defects or \u201cbugs\u201d that can interfere with expected operations or introduce security vulnerabilities that can lead to unauthorized use or data loss. Through our acquisitions, we have acquired some technology that we did not produce that may be particularly vulnerable to defects or \u201cbugs\u201d. There can be no assurance that our testing programs will be adequate to detect all defects prior to the product being introduced, which might decrease customer satisfaction with our products and services. The product reengineering cost to remedy a product defect or mitigate vulnerabilities could be material to our operating results. Our inability to cure a product defect could result in the temporary or permanent withdrawal of a product or service from the market, a security breach, negative publicity, damage to our reputation, failure to achieve market acceptance, lost revenue and increased expense, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition and financial results.\nIf our products do not work properly and customers do not receive high-quality customer service and support, our reputation, business, financial condition and financial results could be negatively affected and we could experience negative publicity and declining sales.\nAfter implementing our product offerings, customers depend on our customer service and support team to quickly resolve any issues relating to those offerings. Further, as we continue to broaden our portfolio of solutions and increase the size of our customer base, the customer service issues have become more complex and we must continue to adapt our customer support organization to ensure our customers continue to receive the high level of customer service which they have come to expect. Notwithstanding our commitment to customer support, our customers will occasionally encounter defects or \u201cbugs\u201d that can interfere with expected operations or introduce security vulnerabilities that can lead to unauthorized use or data loss and other technical challenges and it is therefore critical we are there to provide ongoing, high-quality support to help our customers. Further, while we are working to update our technical infrastructure, our customer service and support teams are not generally automated, which could lead to manual, individual user errors. If we do not provide effective ongoing customer service and support, our ability to sell our products to new and existing customers could be harmed, and our subscription renewal rates and cross-selling of our products may decline, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition and financial results.\nIf our cloud platform does not interoperate with our customers\u2019 network and security infrastructure or with third-party products, websites or services, our cloud platform may become less competitive and our results of operations may be harmed.\nOur cloud platform must interoperate with our customers\u2019 existing network and security infrastructure. These complex systems are developed, delivered and maintained by the customer and a myriad of vendors and service providers. As a result, the components of our customers\u2019 infrastructure have different specifications, rapidly evolve, utilize multiple protocol standards, include multiple versions and generations of products and may be highly customized. We must be able to interoperate and provide our security services to customers with highly complex and customized networks, which requires careful planning and execution between our customers, our customer support teams and our channel partners. Further, when new or updated elements of our customers\u2019 infrastructure or new industry standards or protocols, such as IPv6, are introduced, we may have to update or enhance our cloud platform to allow us to continue to provide service to customers. Our competitors or other vendors may refuse to work with us to allow their products to interoperate with our solutions, which could make it difficult for our cloud platform to function properly in customer networks that include these third-party products.\nIf we fail to maintain compatibility of our cloud platform and products with our customers\u2019 network, cloud services, and security infrastructures, our customers may not be able to fully utilize our solutions, and we may, among other consequences, lose or fail to increase our market share and experience reduced demand for our services, which would materially harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur transmission and storage of personally identifiable information, including the personal data of European data subjects and other confidential information, and the potential for inadvertent exposure of PII or CI by us or our partners, could cause us to violate data privacy laws or lose customers and could negatively affect our business, financial condition and financial results.\nWe transmit and store large amounts of personally identifiable information (\u201cPII\u201d) about individuals, which may include healthcare or financial information, and other confidential information (\u201cCI\u201d). In addition, our reseller and distribution partners have access to customer data through our platform to provide service to end-customers. Data privacy and protection is highly regulated in many jurisdictions and may become the subject of additional regulation in the future. For example, lawmakers and regulators worldwide are considering proposals that would require companies, like us that encrypt users\u2019 data to ensure access to such data by law enforcement authorities. Although we have established, and continue to develop and enhance, security measures and controls to help protect against unauthorized disclosure of such PII and other CI and comply with applicable laws, an inadvertent disclosure of, or unauthorized third-party access to, PII or CI, or failure to comply with applicable laws could disrupt our operations, damage our reputation and subject us to claims, fines or other liabilities. Further, while we have a two-factor authentication and other security measures and controls in place on our platforms and portals and are engaging in a campaign to increase awareness and use of such security measures and controls, our reseller and distribution partners may choose to not utilize such security measures and controls increasing the risk of an in inadvertent disclosure of, or unauthorized third-party access to, PII or CI, which could disrupt our operations, damage our reputation and subject us to claims, fines or other liabilities\nIn addition, our processing and storage of certain types of data is subject to confidentiality agreements with our clients and handling PII is increasingly subject to a variety of changing privacy and data security regulations around the world. For example, the collection and use of personal data in the European Union is governed by the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, which became effective in May 2018. GDPR also maintains the European Union\u2019s strict rules limiting the transfer of personal data out of the European Economic Area. Failure to comply with the requirements of GDPR and the applicable national data protection laws of the European Union Member States may result in fines and other administrative penalties. GDPR imposes substantial potential fines for violations and increased our responsibility and liability in relation to personal data that we process. We historically relied upon the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield frameworks, and the use of certain standard contractual clauses approved by the European Commission, to address these requirements. In July 2020, the CJEU, Europe\u2019s highest court, held that the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield was invalid, and imposed additional obligations in connection with the use of contractual clauses governing cross-border transfers of personal data. As a result, we may need to implement different or additional measure to establish or maintain legitimate means for the transfer and receipt of personal data from the European Union to the U.S. If the measures we implement are later determined to be insufficient, we may face enforcement actions by data protection authorities. Further, the recently enacted California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), which took effect in January 2020, provides for enhanced consumer protections for California residents and statutory fines for data security breaches or other CCPA violations. The GDPR and CCPA are just examples of privacy regulations that are emerging in locations where we operate. Such laws and privacy regulations may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and to incur substantial costs and expenses in an effort to comply. Future restrictions on the collection, use, sharing or disclosure of our users\u2019 data or additional requirements for express or implied consent of users for the use and disclosure of such information could require us to modify our products, possibly in a material manner, stop offering certain products and could limit our ability to develop and implement new product features.\nRecent well-publicized security breaches at other companies have led to enhanced government and regulatory scrutiny of the measures taken by companies to protect against cyber-attacks, and may in the future result in heightened cyber security requirements, including additional regulatory expectations for oversight of vendors and service providers.\nAny new laws, regulations, or other legal obligations or industry standards, or future changes in requirements or interpretations under these regulations may be inconsistent with our existing data management practices. If so, we could be required to fundamentally change our business activities and practices or modify our software, which could have an adverse effect on our business, including increased cost of compliance, negative publicity to us and limitations on data transfer for us and our customers.\nAny inability by us or our partners to adequately address privacy concerns, even if unfounded, or to comply with applicable privacy or data protection laws, regulations and policies, could result in additional costs and liability to us, damage our reputation, inhibit sales, and harm our business. Furthermore, any inadvertent disclosure of, or unauthorized access (including due to a cyber-attack) to, PII or other CI or other failure by us to comply with data privacy requirements could subject us to significant penalties, damages, remediation and other expenses, and damage our reputation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and financial results.\nProblems with protecting, enforcing and defending our intellectual property rights, and the potential that we could be found to infringe the intellectual property rights of others could negatively affect our business, financial condition and financial results and be disruptive and expensive to our business.\nWe rely on a combination of contractual rights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents and copyrights to establish and protect intellectual property rights and other proprietary rights in our products and services. These intellectual property rights or other proprietary rights might be challenged, invalidated or circumvented and may not prevent the misuse, theft or misappropriation of our proprietary information. We may choose not to seek patent or trademark protection for certain innovations or not to pursue patent or trademark protection in certain jurisdictions, and may choose to abandon patents and trademarks that are no longer of strategic value to us. The process of obtaining patent and trademark protection is expensive and time-consuming, and we may not be able to prosecute all necessary or desirable patent and trademark applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner.\nDespite our efforts to protect our proprietary information, competitors may inappropriately incorporate our intellectual property rights or other proprietary technology into their products or hire our former employees who may misappropriate our intellectual property rights or other proprietary technology. Policing unauthorized use of our proprietary information is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, particularly in some jurisdictions which may not provide adequate legal protection of our intellectual property rights or other proprietary technology and where mechanisms for enforcement of intellectual property rights may be weak. As we continue to grow our international business, our exposure to unauthorized copying and use of our products and proprietary information may increase.\nWe may have to defend against claims that we or our customers are infringing the rights of third parties in patents, copyrights, trademarks and other intellectual property. If we acquire technology to include in our products and services from third parties, our exposure to infringement actions may increase because we must rely upon these third parties to verify the origin and ownership of such technology. Also, we may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights, including initiating claims or litigation against third parties for infringement or misappropriation. Intellectual property litigation and controversies are disruptive and expensive, whether or not resolved in our favor and may be particularly difficult, expensive and time-consuming in some jurisdictions which do not afford as strong of legal protections of our intellectual property rights or other proprietary technology and where mechanisms for enforcement of intellectual property rights may be weak. Even unmeritorious claims brought against us or our customers may harm our reputation and customer relationships, may cause us to incur significant legal and other fees to defend, and may have to be settled for significant amounts. Infringement claims against us could require us to develop non-infringing products and services or enter into expensive royalty or licensing arrangements.\nWe may face risks from using \u201copen source\u201d software that could negatively affect our business, financial condition and financial results.\nLike many other software companies, we use \u201copen source\u201d software in order to take advantage of common industry building blocks and to add functionality to our products quickly and inexpensively. Open source software license terms could adversely affect our intellectual property rights in our products that include open source software. We have processes and controls in place that are designed to address these risks and concerns, but we cannot be sure that our process or controls will be sufficient to mitigate all risk in this regard. Open source software might also introduce security vulnerabilities or defective functionality. The open source community may not always respond with adequate urgency to mitigate the impacts of such defects.\nWe rely on the availability of third-party intellectual property, which may not be accessible to us on reasonable terms or at all.\nSome of our products include third-party intellectual property, which may require licenses for our use. For example, a significant portion of the revenue generated by our Erado business is dependent on the licensing of certain electronic message API\u2019s, such as those made available by LinkedIn Corporation, SMS providers, Facebook, and other social media channels, and a significant portion of the revenue generated by our business is dependent on the licensing of Microsoft products such as Office 365. We also rely on the licensing of certain third-party APIs with respect to our billing systems for customers. Based on past experience and industry practice, we believe that such licenses can be obtained on reasonable terms; however, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain or maintain the necessary licenses for new or current products on acceptable terms or at all. Changes in the terms of such licenses may decrease our product margins and our failure to obtain or maintain such licenses may limit our ability to sell our products, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and financial results.\nWe may be a party to litigation in the normal course of business or otherwise, which could affect our financial position and liquidity.\nFrom time to time, we are a party to or otherwise involved in legal proceedings, claims and litigation, law enforcement investigations and other legal matters, both inside and outside the U.S., arising in the ordinary course of our business or otherwise. We are currently subject to legal proceedings, claims, and litigation involving our business, and additional claims may arise in the future. Legal proceedings can be complex and take many months, or even years, to reach resolution, with the final outcome depending on a number of variables, some of which are not within our control. Litigation is subject to significant uncertainty and may be expensive, time-consuming, and disruptive to our operations. If a legal proceeding is resolved against us, it could result in significant damages, and if our existing insurance does not cover the amount or types of damages awarded, or if other resolution or actions taken as a result of the legal proceeding were to restrain our ability to operate or market our products and services, our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows could be materially adversely affected. In addition, legal proceedings, and any adverse resolution thereof, can result in adverse publicity and damage to our reputation, which could adversely impact our business.\nWe may fail to recruit, retain and motivate key personnel, which could impair our ability to meet key objectives.\nOur success depends on our ability to attract, retain and motivate highly-skilled technical, managerial, sales, and marketing personnel, to promote and maintain a diverse and inclusive workforce and to maintain our corporate culture. Competition for these personnel is intense and there is high demand for employees who have highly technical skills and experience, increasing difficulty in recruiting, hiring and retaining such key employees and maintaining our corporate culture to continue to foster innovation, creativity, diversity, collaboration, loyalty and a customer-centric focus. As our product offerings have increased, our need for additional highly-skilled technical, managerial, sales and marketing personnel has only increased, and our inability to retain such personnel could be difficult, time-consuming and expensive. In addition, COVID-19 and work from home policies have increased the competition for such personnel and there is no guarantee that we can effectively transition our employee onboarding and training processes to remote or online programs during the COVID-19 pandemic and efficiently integrate these new hires into our organization. Although we have entered into employment agreements with certain key personnel, our employees generally work for us on an \u201cat-will\u201d basis, which means they may terminate their employment with us at any time and, as highly skilled and experienced personnel, would be difficult to replace. Changes in key personnel may be disruptive to our business. Volatility, lack of positive performance in our stock price or changes to our overall compensation program including our stock incentive program may adversely affect our ability to retain key employees, many of whom are compensated, in part, based on the performance of our stock price. The loss of services of any of our key personnel, the inability to retain and attract qualified personnel in the future or delays in hiring required personnel could make it difficult to meet key objectives and could negatively affect our business, financial condition and financial results.\nGovernmental restrictions on the sale of our products and services in non-U.S. markets could negatively affect our business, financial condition and financial results.\nExports of software solutions and services using encryption technology such as ours are generally restricted by the U.S. government. Although we have obtained U.S. government approval to export our service to almost all countries, the list of countries to which we (and our distributors) cannot export our products and services could be expanded in the future. In addition, some countries impose restrictions on the importation and use of encryption solutions and services such as ours. The cost of compliance with U.S. and other export laws, or our failure to obtain governmental approvals to offer our products and services in non-U.S. markets, could affect our ability to sell our products and services and could impair our international expansion.\nAs a result of our increasing international operations, we could be adversely affected by additional risks, including violations of the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar foreign anti-corruption laws.\nOver the last several years, we have expanded into more markets outside of the U.S., including through our acquisition of AppRiver and CloudAlly. Our international expansion efforts may be slow or unsuccessful to the extent we experience difficulties in recruiting, training, managing and retaining qualified personnel with international experience, language skills and cultural competencies in the geographic markets we target, which could negatively impact our bookings and operating results. Furthermore, as we continue to expand internationally, it may prove difficult to maintain our corporate culture, which we believe has been critical to our success. Conducting and expanding international operations subjects us to risks we generally do not face in the U.S., including language barriers, cultural differences, geographic dispersion of our customers and personnel, compliance with foreign laws, greater difficulty in enforcing contracts, greater risk of unexpected change in regulatory practices, tariffs, trade disputes and tax laws and treaties, increased exposure to foreign currency risk and the potential for political, social or economic unrest, terrorism, hostilities or war. In addition, the expansion of our existing international operations and entry into additional international markets has required and will continue to require significant management attention and financial resources. In particular, we have invested, and intend to continue to invest, in product marketing, infrastructure and personnel to support our international expansion efforts. These and other factors associated with our international operations could impair our growth prospects and adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. Given the risks associated with our international operations, we may decide to relocate international operations either to other foreign countries or domestically. Any such relocation would require significant management attention and financial resources, could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition, and may not prove to be successful.\nFurther, the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar foreign anti-corruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments or providing anything of value to improperly influence foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, or obtaining an unfair advantage. Recent years have seen a substantial increase in the global enforcement of anti-corruption laws. Our continued operation and expansion outside the U.S., including in developing countries, could increase the risk of such violations. Violations of these laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, could disrupt our business, and result in a material adverse effect on our reputation, business and financial results.\nOur sales to government entities are subject to a number of challenges and risks.\nSales to U.S. federal, state and local governmental agency customers have accounted for a significant portion of our revenue in past periods, and we may in the future increase sales to government agencies. Sales to government entities are subject to a number of challenges and risks. Selling to government entities can be highly competitive, expensive and time consuming, often requiring significant upfront time and expense without any assurance that these efforts will generate a sale. Government contractual requirements often carry a high compliance risk. Government certification requirements for solutions like ours may change and in doing so restrict our ability to sell into the federal government sector until we have attained the revised certification. Government demand and payment for our solutions may be impacted by public sector budgetary cycles and funding authorizations, with funding reductions or delays adversely affecting public sector demand for our solutions. Government entities also may have statutory, contractual or other legal rights to terminate contracts for convenience or due to a default, and any such termination may adversely impact our future operating results.\nRisks Related to our Indebtedness, Capital Structure and Ownership of our Common Stock\nOur indebtedness could adversely affect our business and limit our ability to expand our business or respond to changes, and we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt service obligations.\nIn February 2019, we entered into a credit agreement with the lenders party thereto under which we established (i) a senior secured term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $175 million, (ii) a senior secured delayed draw term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $10 million and (iii) a senior secured revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $25 million. In November, 2020, we amended our Credit Agreement to, among other things, borrow under an incremental $35.0 million term loan (collectively, the \u201cCredit Facilities\u201d). The Credit Facilities are guaranteed by certain wholly-owned subsidiaries of Zix. The Credit Facilities are secured by substantially all assets of Zix and the guarantors, subject to certain customary exceptions. The Credit Facilities will mature in February of 2024. The incurrence of this indebtedness could have adverse consequences, including the following:\n\u2022\nreducing the availability of our cash flow for our operations, capital expenditures, future business opportunities, stock buybacks and other purposes;\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;\n\u2022\nmaking it more difficult to pay or refinance our debts as they become due during periods of adverse economic, financial market or industry conditions;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, acquisitions or other purposes, particularly since substantially all of our assets are subject to security interests relating to existing indebtedness;\n\u2022\nrequiring our debt to become due and payable upon a change in control;\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; and\n\u2022\nlengthening or otherwise adversely affecting our sales process as customers evaluate our financial viability.\nOptional prepayments of borrowings under the Credit Facilities will be permitted at any time, without premium (other than customary LIBOR breakage costs). We must prepay the term loan facility in equal quarterly installments of $551,332 on the last day of each March, June, September and December until maturity in February of 2024. In addition to other customary mandatory prepayment requirements, the term loan facility requires annual prepayments based on a percentage of Zix\u2019s excess cash flow, which percentage will reduce as Zix\u2019s total net leverage ratio decreases. We depend on cash on hand and cash flows from operations to make scheduled debt payments. To a significant extent, our ability to do so is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. If our business does not generate sufficient cash flow from operating activities or if future borrowings are not available to us in amounts sufficient to enable us to fund our liquidity needs, our operating results, financial condition and ability to expand our business may be adversely affected.\nThe interest rate on our Credit Facilities will float over time and is currently LIBOR plus 3.0%, with future step downs in the interest rate margin as our total net leverage reduces. The floating rate nature of this interest rate exposes us to interest rate risk. Changes in economic conditions outside of our control could result in higher interest rates, thereby increasing our interest expense even though the amount borrowed remains the same.\nRestrictive covenants in our credit agreement may adversely affect our financial and operational flexibility.\nThe credit agreement governing our Credit Facilities contains certain financial, operational and legal covenants. The financial covenant requires Zix to maintain a maximum total net leverage ratio (as defined in the credit agreement) and is tested on a quarterly basis, based on the rolling four-quarter period that ends on the last day of each fiscal quarter. The non-financial covenants restrict our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to, among other things, incur indebtedness, incur liens, merge with or acquire other entities, make investments, dispose of assets, enter into sale and leaseback transactions, make dividends, distributions or stock repurchases, prepay junior indebtedness, enter into transactions with affiliates, enter into restrictive agreements, and amend our organizational documents or the terms of junior indebtedness.\nThese restrictions may make it more difficult or discourage a takeover of Zix, whether favored or opposed by our management and/or our Board of Directors.\nOur ability to comply with some of these restrictive covenants can be affected by events beyond our control, and we may be unable to do so. Failure to comply could require us to seek waivers or amendments of covenants or alternative sources of financing, or to reduce expenditures. We cannot guarantee that such waivers, amendments or alternative financing could be obtained or, if obtained, would be on terms acceptable to us.\nUpon the occurrence of a default, or if we are unable to make the representations and warranties in the credit agreement governing our Credit Facilities, we will not be able to borrow funds or issue letters of credit under our Credit Facilities. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, our lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under our Credit Facilities to be immediately due and payable. If we are unable to repay that amount, our lenders could seize our assets securing the loans and our business and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (the \u201cSeries A Preferred Stock\u201d) and investment agreement restrict our ability to incur certain indebtedness which limits our flexibility in operating our business.\nIn February 2019, we issued Series A Preferred Stock established by a Certificate of Designations (the \u201cSeries A Certificate of Designations\u201d) and Series B Preferred Stock established by a Certificate of Designations (the \u201cSeries B Certificate of Designations\u201d), which contain covenants that, among other things, require the consent of the holders of a majority of each of the then-outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock before we can incur indebtedness in excess of a specified leverage ratio.\nIn January 2019, we entered into an investment agreement with an investment fund managed by True Wind Capital (the \u201cInvestor\u201d), which contains customary covenants, including among others, that for so long as any shares of preferred stock issued pursuant to the investment agreement are outstanding, the consent of the Investor will be necessary for us to issue, subject to certain exceptions, any debt securities convertible into any of our capital stock.\nAt our Annual Meeting of Shareholders in June 2019, our shareholders voted to approve, in accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635, (i) the conversion of our then-outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock into shares of our Series A Preferred Stock and (ii) the issuance of shares of our common stock in connection with any future conversion or redemption of our Series A Preferred Stock into common stock, or any other issuance of common stock to the Investor pursuant to the terms of the investment agreement that, absent such approval, would violate Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635 (the \u201cNasdaq Proposal\u201d). Following shareholder approval of the Nasdaq Proposal, the 35,086 then-outstanding shares of our Series B Preferred Stock converted into 35,292 shares of Series A Preferred Stock and we paid to the holders of Series B Preferred Stock cash in lieu of any fractional shares. We currently do not have any shares of Series B Preferred Stock outstanding.\nWe may need additional capital, and we cannot be certain that additional financing will be available on favorable terms, or at all, and such additional financing may adversely affect our financial and operational flexibility or cause dilution to existing stockholders.\nWe may require additional financing in the future to operate or expand our business, acquire assets or repay or refinance our existing debt. Our ability to obtain financing will depend, among other things, on our business development efforts, business plans, operating performance and the condition of the capital markets at the time we seek financing, as well as other factors beyond our control. We cannot provide any assurance that additional financing will be available to us on favorable terms when required, or at all. Additionally, under the terms of our credit agreement, preferred stock and investment agreement, respectively, we are restricted from incurring additional debt, subject to certain exceptions. Any additional funding we obtain may include similar restrictive covenants, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity, equity-linked or debt securities, those securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to the rights of our common stock or preferred stock, and our stockholders may experience dilution.\nIf we need additional capital and cannot raise it on acceptable terms, we may not be able to, among other things:\n\u2022\ndevelop or enhance our solutions;\n\u2022\ncontinue to expand our sales and marketing and research and development organizations;\n\u2022\nrepay or refinance our existing debt;\n\u2022\nacquire complementary technologies, solutions or businesses;\n\u2022\nexpand operations, in the U.S. or internationally;\n\u2022\nhire, train and retain employees; or\n\u2022\nrespond to competitive pressure or unanticipated working capital requirements.\nOur failure to do any of these things could seriously impact our business, negatively affecting financial condition and operating results.\nWe may be able to incur more debt and take other actions that could diminish our ability to make payments on our indebtedness when due, which could further exacerbate the risks associated with our current level of indebtedness.\nDespite our current indebtedness level, we may be able to incur more indebtedness in the future. We are not completely prohibited under the terms of the credit agreement, preferred stock, investment agreement or other agreements governing our current indebtedness from incurring additional debt, securing existing or future debt, recapitalizing our debt or taking a number of other actions, any of which could diminish our ability to make payments on our indebtedness when due and further exacerbate the risks associated with our current level of indebtedness. If new debt is added to our or any of our existing and future subsidiaries' current debt, the related risks that we now face could intensify.\nOur preferred stockholders can exercise significant control over the Company, which could limit the ability of our common stockholders to influence the outcome of key transactions, including a change of control.\nThe Investor holds approximately 26% of our outstanding voting capital stock based on the number of shares of common stock and convertible Series A Preferred Stock outstanding as of March 3, 2021, on an as-converted basis. The Investor\u2019s aggregate voting power will increase further in connection with future accretion of the Series A Preferred Stock for as long as the Series A Preferred Stock remains outstanding. The holders of our Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to vote their shares, on an as-converted basis, together with holders of our common stock on all matters submitted to a vote of the holders of our common stock. As a result, the holders of shares of the Series A Preferred Stock have the ability to significantly influence the outcome of any matter submitted for the vote of the holders of our common stock. The Investor is entitled to act separately in its own respective interests with respect to its ownership interests in the Company and has the ability to substantially influence the election of the members of our Board of Directors, thereby potentially controlling our management and affairs. In addition, the Investor has significant influence over all matters that require approval by our stockholders, including the approval of significant corporate transactions.\nAdditionally, holders of a majority of the then-outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock are required to approve certain matters as a class, voting separately from the common stock, such as (1) any amendment, alteration or repeal to our Restated Articles of Incorporation (the \u201cArticles of Incorporation\u201d) or the Series A Certificate of Designations in a manner that would adversely affect the rights, preferences, privileges or power of the Series A Preferred Stock; (2) any amendment or alteration to our Articles of Incorporation or any other action to authorize or create, or increase the number of authorized or issued shares of, or any securities convertible into shares of, or reclassify any security into, or issue any parity stock or senior stock as to dividend or liquidation rights; (3) the issuance of shares of Series A Preferred Stock; (4) any action that would cause us to cease to be treated as a domestic corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes; or (5) the incurrence of indebtedness that would cause us to exceed a specified leverage ratio.\nAny issuance of common stock upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock will cause dilution to existing stockholders and may depress the market price of our common stock.\nThe Series A Preferred Stock has an initial stated value of $1,000 per share, which stated value will accrete at an annual rate of 8% per annum, compounded quarterly. Each share of Series A Preferred Stock is convertible, at the option of the holders, into (i) the number of shares of common stock equal to the product of (A) the stated value per share as it has accreted as of such date multiplied by (B) the Conversion Rate as of the applicable conversion date divided by (C) 1,000 plus (ii) cash in lieu of fractional shares. The Conversion Rate is currently equal to 166.11 shares of our common stock and is subject to adjustment from time to time upon the occurrence of certain customary events in accordance with the terms of the Series A Certificate of Designations. Each share of Series A Preferred Stock is entitled to participate in dividends paid in respect of the common stock on an as-converted basis.\nThe issuance of common stock upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock will result in immediate and substantial dilution to the interests of our common stockholders, and such dilution will increase over time in connection with the future accretion of the Series A Preferred Stock.\nTexas law and our Articles of Incorporation and bylaws contain certain provisions, including anti-takeover provisions, that limit the ability of stockholders to take certain actions and could delay or discourage takeover attempts that stockholders may consider favorable.\nThe Texas Business Organizations Code, as amended (\u201cTBOC\u201d), and our Articles of Incorporation and second amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that could have the effect of rendering more difficult, delaying, or preventing an acquisition deemed undesirable by our Board of Directors and therefore depress the trading price of our common stock. These provisions could also make it difficult for stockholders to take certain actions, including electing directors who are not nominated by the current members of our Board of Directors or taking other corporate actions, including effecting changes in our management. Among other things, our certificate of incorporation and bylaws include provisions which could preclude stockholders from bringing matters before annual or special meetings of stockholders, delay changes in our Board of Directors and inhibit the ability of an acquirer to facilitate an unsolicited takeover.\nIn addition, as a Texas corporation, we are subject to provisions of Texas law, including Section 21.606 of the TBOC, which may prohibit certain stockholders holding 20% or more of our outstanding capital stock from engaging in certain business combinations with us for a specified period of time.\nAny provision of Texas law or our Articles of Incorporation or bylaws that has the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our capital stock and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock.\nOther Risks Related to our Series A Preferred Stock\nFuture resales of our common stock held by our significant stockholders or of the shares of common stock issuable upon conversation of the Series A Preferred Stock may cause the market price of our common stock to drop significantly.\nPursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement, we registered the resale of the Series A Preferred Stock as well as common stock issuable upon conversion of, or issued as dividends upon, the Series A Preferred Stock, and we are obligated to take certain actions to facilitate the transfer and sale of such shares. Such shares of Series A Preferred Stock and the common stock into which the Series A Preferred Stock may be converted have been registered on a Form S-3 registration statement and are freely tradable. The common stock issuable upon conversion may represent overhang that may also adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Overhang occurs when there is a greater supply of a company\u2019s stock in the market than there is demand for that stock. When this happens, the price of the company\u2019s stock will decrease, and any additional shares which stockholders attempt to sell in the market, or the perception that such sales might occur, will only further decrease the share price. If the share volume of our common stock cannot absorb converted shares sold by the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock, then the value of our common stock will likely decrease.\nAny sale of large amounts of our common stock on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions could have the effect of increasing the volatility in the price of our common stock or putting significant downward pressure on the price of our common stock.\nOur Series A Preferred Stock has rights, preferences and privileges that are not held by, and are preferential to, the rights of our common stockholders, which could adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition, and may result in the interests of the holders of our Series A Preferred Stock differing from those of our common stockholders.\nIn the event of our liquidation, dissolution or the winding up of our affairs, the holders of our Series A Preferred Stock have the right to receive a liquidation preference entitling them to be paid out of our assets generally available for distribution to our equity holders, before any payment may be made to holders of any other class or series of capital stock (including our common stock), in an amount equal to the greater of (i) $1,000 plus all accreted but unpaid dividends and (ii) the amount such holder would have been entitled to receive if the Series A Preferred Stock had converted into common stock immediately prior to such liquidation.\nIn addition, the $1,000 stated value per share of our Series A Preferred Stock will accrete at a fixed rate of 8.0% per annum, compounded quarterly. The holders Series A Preferred Stock are also entitled to receive any dividends paid in respect of our common stock on an as-converted basis.\nFurther, the Series A Preferred Stock is mandatorily redeemable upon a change of control (as defined in the Series A Certificate of Designations), at a price per share of Series A Preferred Stock in cash equal to the greater of (i) the Series A Change of Control Redemption Price (as defined below) and (ii) (A) the amount of cash such holder of Series A Preferred Stock would have received plus (B) the fair market value of any other assets such holder would have received, in each case had such holder of the Series A Preferred Stock, immediately prior to such change of control, converted such shares of Series A Preferred Stock into shares of common stock. The \u201cSeries A Change of Control Redemption Price\u201d per share of Series A Preferred Stock is the product of the accreted value of such share as of the date of determination multiplied by (1) 1.30 (if the change of control occurs before the first anniversary of the date of issuance); (2) 1.35 (if the change of control occurs on or after the first anniversary of the date of issuance but before the second anniversary of the date of issuance); (3) 1.40 (if the change of control occurs on or after the second anniversary of the date of issuance but before the third anniversary of the date of issuance); (4) 1.45 (if the change of control occurs on or after the third anniversary of the date of issuance but before the fourth anniversary of the date of issuance); and (5) 1.50 (if the change of control occurs on or after the fourth anniversary of the date of issuance).\nFinally, any time after the fourth anniversary of the date of issuance of the Series A Preferred Stock, we have the right to redeem the Series A Preferred Stock for cash at a redemption price equal to the accreted value per share of Series A Preferred Stock to be redeemed multiplied by 1.50.\nThese dividend and redemption payment obligations could significantly impact our liquidity and reduce the amount of our cash flows that are available for working capital, capital expenditures, growth opportunities, acquisitions, and other general corporate purposes. Our obligations to the holders of Series A Preferred Stock could also limit our ability to obtain additional financing or increase our borrowing costs, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition. The preferential rights described above could also result in divergent interests between the holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock and the holders of our common stock.",

Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements about trends, uncertainties and our plans and expectations of what may happen in the future. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events or results to differ materially from the events or results described in the forward-looking statements, including risks and uncertainties described above in \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors.\u201d Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements in this report are based upon information available to us on the date of this report. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements. See \u201cNOTE ON FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS AND RISK FACTORS\u201d in \u201cItem 1. Business.\u201d\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes beginning on page.\nOverview\nWe are a leader in providing cloud email security, productivity, and compliance solutions. We provide easy-to-use solutions for email encryption, data loss prevention (\u201cDLP\u201d), advanced email threat protection, unified archiving, and cloud data backup. As a leading provider of cloud-based security, compliance, and productivity solutions for businesses of all sizes, we are focused on securing data and meeting the compliance needs of organizations with particular emphasis on the healthcare, finance, and government sectors. One of our core competencies is our ability to deliver this complex service offering with a high level of availability, reliability, integrity and security.\nOur 2020 results included record revenues attributable to our ongoing efforts to build a solid and predictable business based on our recurring revenue subscription business model. For 2020, we continued to benefit from growing concerns about data security and integrity issues as well as the growing acceptance of cloud-based offerings and the growing regulatory compliance burdens on many businesses.\nFor 2020, we reported revenue of $218.5 million, an increase of $45.1 million, or 26% over the prior year. This increase was driven by recognition of twelve full months of sales for the year ended December 31, 2020, attributable to our AppRiver business acquired in February 2019 and by steady additions to the subscriber base, a high rate of existing customer renewals and the realization of previously contracted revenue in our backlog.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, our gross profit of $105.7 million increased 10% compared to 2019. This increase was driven by new sales. Our 2020 operating profit of $4.6 million increased $13.7 million over the prior year, as the gross profit increase and reductions in general and administrative expenses related to acquisition and integration fees, along with targeted reductions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, were offset by increased research and development and selling and marketing expenses.\nOur $6.4 million net loss in 2020 is an improvement of $8.2 million compared to our $14.6 million net loss in 2019. Our 2019 net loss includes a $4.5 million income tax benefit resulting from that year\u2019s net loss.\nOther Financial Highlights\n\u2022\nBacklog was $83.4 million at the end of 2020, compared to $89.4 million at the end of 2019.\n\u2022\nTotal billings for 2020 were $219.1 million, compared to $170.2 million for 2019, representing an increase of 28.7%.\n\u2022\nThe annual recurring revenue value of our customer subscriptions as of December 31, 2020, was $237.7 million, compared with $209.7 million for the same period in 2019, representing an increase of $28.0 million.\n\u2022\nOur deferred revenue at the end of 2020 was $41.5 million, compared with $43.3 million at the end of 2019.\n\u2022\nWe generated cash flows from operations of $31.3 million during fiscal 2020. Our cash and cash equivalents were $21.4 million at the end of 2020, compared with $13.3 million at the end of 2019.\nOur services are sold on a subscription basis with contract terms historically ranging from one to five years billed annually. We are increasingly moving toward a monthly billing model. This shift has been largely driven by our recent acquisition activity. We recognize revenue ratably on a monthly basis over the term of the subscription once service commences.\nWe attempt to grow our business by signing new customers to subscription services and/or selling new or higher volume services to existing customers (i.e., \u201cupsell\u201d) while retaining existing customers through renewal of their subscriptions for successive periods.\nOur backlog consists of the total order value of contracted business that has not yet been recognized into revenue. Backlog is calculated by adding to the existing contracted order value the total value of all orders booked in the period (e.g., quarterly) less the value of revenue recognized for that period. Although orders historically have been non-cancellable, occasionally we adjust backlog for customer bankruptcy or change of term, but these instances are rare and do not materially impact the backlog amount. The backlog will grow if the value of total orders added in a period exceeds the value of revenue recognized in that period. Conversely, the backlog amount will decline if revenue recognized exceeds the total order value added for the period. A decline in backlog may result from fluctuations in total orders caused by timing of renewal orders or by the shortening of the average term of our contracts from a multi-year to an annual commitment or to a monthly billing and subscription model.\nAs of December 31, 2020, our net dollar customer retention percentage was 100%. We calculate this percentage by first identifying our current period renewal and upsell orders secured from existing customers and then combining these totals with billings for the period. We then compare this amount to the total orders that were due to renew and were then combined with scheduled billings. Increasing retention is a key driver for the company to increase overall revenue and annual recurring revenue. Deferred revenue is the value of contracted business that has been paid but has not been recognized as revenue. See description of the components of the backlog following in \u201cResults of Operations - Backlog\u201d in this \u201cItem 7, Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d\nAs of December 31, 2020, our annual recurring revenue (ARR) was $237.7 million. We calculate ARR by determining the annual or monthly revenue of subscription agreements that are active as of the end of the applicable period and multiplying by 1 or 12 depending on the term of such agreements. We monitor this metric to aid in determining to what extent individual customer relationships, considered in the aggregate, are growing or declining in financial magnitude.\nOur operations and future prospects are further discussed throughout this \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d\nThere are no assurances we will be successful in our efforts to achieve continued growth. Our continued growth depends on the timely development and market acceptance of our products and services. See \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors\u201d for more information on the risks relative to our operations and future prospects.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nIn preparing our consolidated financial statements, we make estimates, assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on revenue, income from operations and net income, as well as the value of certain assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. The application of our critical accounting policies requires an evaluation of a number of complex criteria and significant accounting judgements by us. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances (including but not limited to the potential impacts arising from the recent COVID-19 pandemic and public and private sector policies and initiatives aimed at reducing its transmission), the results of which form the basis for making judgements about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. We evaluate our estimates on a regular basis and make changes accordingly. Senior management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of these estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. Actual results may materially differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. If actual results were to materially differ from these estimates, the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nWe consider accounting policies to be critical when they require us to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made and when different estimates that our management reasonably has used have a material effect on the presentation of our financial condition, changes in financial condition or results of operations. Management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nOur critical accounting policies included the following:\n\u2022\nRevenue recognition\n\u2022\nCommission amortization\n\u2022\nIncome taxes\n\u2022\nValuation of goodwill and other intangible assets\n\u2022\nStock-based compensation costs\n\u2022\nRight-of-use assets and lease obligations\n\u2022\nInternal-use software\nFor additional discussion of the Company\u2019s significant accounting policies, refer to Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nIn May 2014, The Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) issued ASC 606 which requires revenue recognition when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled to those goods and services. The standard became effective for us in 2018, but did not have a material impact to our revenue recognition process. For additional information regarding our adoption of ASC 606 please see \u201cNew Accounting Standards.\u201d\nWe earn our revenue from subscription fees for rights related to the use of our software. Approximately 78% of our revenue in 2020 was derived from hosted solutions. While some contracts include one or more performance obligations, the revenue recognition pattern generally is not impacted by separate allocations of these obligations because the services are generally satisfied over the same period of time and revenue is recognized ratably over the contract term.\nOur subscription terms historically have ranged from one to five years. We are increasingly moving to a monthly subscription model. This shift has been largely driven by our recent acquisition activity. As we further integrate our business, we expect to focus on a monthly subscription model.\nRevenue is recognized by applying the following steps:\n\u2022\nStep 1: Identify the contract(s) with a customer,\n\u2022\nStep 2: Identify the performance obligations in the contract,\n\u2022\nStep 3: Determine the transaction price,\n\u2022\nStep 4: Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and\n\u2022\nStep 5: Recognize revenue when (or as) the performance obligation is satisfied.\nStep 1: Identify the contract(s) with a customer:\nWe consider the terms and conditions of the contract and our customary business practice in identifying our contracts. We determine we have a contract with a customer when (i) the contract is approved, (ii) we can identify each party\u2019s rights regarding the services and products transferred, (iii) we can identify the payment terms for the services and products, (iv) the contract has commercial substance, and (v) it is probable we will be paid.\nStep 2: Identifying the performance obligations in the contract:\nASC 606 requires identification and disclosure of performance obligations within a revenue contract. A good or service is considered distinct if the customer can both benefit from the good or service on its own or with other resources that are readily available to the customer, and the promise to transfer the good or service is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract.\nStep 3: Determine the transaction price:\nThe transaction price is determined based on the consideration we expect to be entitled to receive in exchange for transferring goods and services to the customer. We include variable consideration in the transaction price if we view it probable that a significant future reduction of cumulative revenue under the contract will not occur.\nStep 4: Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract:\nWe allocate transaction prices to each performance obligation based on the stand-alone selling price of our component services.\nStep 5: Recognize revenue when (or as) the performance obligation is satisfied:\nWe recognize revenue when the customer obtains control of the product or services, at the amount allocated to the satisfied performance obligation. Our performance obligations are generally satisfied over time.\nWhile some contracts include one or more performance obligations (including the combined elements noted above along with additional ongoing customer support and other hosted services), the revenue recognition pattern generally is not impacted by the separate allocations of these obligations because the services are generally satisfied over the same period of time and revenue is recognized over the contract period. Discounts provided to customers are recorded as reductions in revenue.\nCommission Amortization\nWe amortize our commission costs to expense on a systemic basis over the period of expected benefit to the customer. Determination of the amortization period requires significant judgement. We apply the practical expedient noted in ASC 606-10-104 to account for our commission costs and related amortizations at the portfolio level. Additionally, the Company has evaluated commissions earned upon contract renewal as compared to initial commissions paid and determined that because commissions paid were not reasonably proportional to their respective contract values, our renewal commissions could not be considered commensurate with the initial commissions paid.\nWe considered our average contract term length and historical customer retention rates to determine an average length of our customer relationships. We also concluded our add-on sales generally occur halfway into our customer relationships, and evaluated our average customer renewal terms. Based on these factors we have determined that 8 years, 4 years and 18 months are the appropriate amortization periods for our new, add-on, and renewal sales commission expenses, respectively. We also perform subsequent assessments for impairment of the related deferred cost asset when indicators of impairment are present.\nFollowing our acquisition of AppRiver in February 2019, we additionally evaluated AppRiver\u2019s sales program to determine whether capitalization of these expenses was appropriate. While we determined certain costs to acquire met the capitalization criteria, we also determined renewal commissions earned were commensurate to the initial sales. Based on AppRiver\u2019s primarily month-to-month commitments the Company has chosen to apply the practical expedient approach to immediately recognize such commensurate commission expenses associated with the AppRiver program.\nIncome Taxes\nDeferred tax assets are recognized if it is \u201cmore likely than not\u201d that our benefit of the deferred tax assets will be realized on future federal or state income tax returns. At December 31, 2020, we provided a valuation allowance against a significant portion, $25.2 million, of our accumulated deferred tax assets. This significant valuation allowance reflects our historical losses and the uncertainty of future taxable income sufficient to utilize net operating loss carryforwards prior to their expiration. Our total deferred tax assets not subject to a valuation allowance are valued at $32.6 million, and consist of $26.9 million for federal net operating loss carryforwards, $4.4 million relating to temporary timing differences between U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d) and tax-related expense, $1.9 million in federal R&D credits, and $1.0 million relating to U.S. state income tax and other credits. These items are offset by a $1.6 million deferred tax liability associated with our CloudAlly acquisition. If our U.S. taxable income increases from its current level in a future period or if the facts and circumstances on which our estimates and assumptions are based were to change, thereby impacting the likelihood of realizing our deferred tax assets, judgment would have to be applied in determining the amount of valuation allowance no longer required. Reversal of all or a part of this valuation allowance could have a significant positive impact on operating results in the period that it becomes more likely than not that certain of the Company\u2019s deferred tax assets will be realized. Alternatively, should our future income decrease from current levels, a resulting increase to all or a part of this valuation allowance could have a significant negative impact on our operating results.\nValuation of Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nWe account for the valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets after classifying intangible assets into three categories: (1) intangible assets with finite lives subject to amortization; (2) intangible assets with indefinite lives not subject to amortization; and (3) goodwill. For intangible assets with finite lives, tests for impairment must be performed if conditions exist that indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. For intangible assets with indefinite lives and goodwill, tests for impairment must be performed at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that assets might be impaired.\nGoodwill was $195.0 million, or 43%, and $171.2 million, or 41% of total assets, in each of the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nWe evaluate goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter, or when there is reason to believe that the value has been diminished or impaired. Evaluations for possible impairment are based upon a comparison of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill has been assigned, versus the sum of the carrying value of the assets and liabilities of that unit including the assigned goodwill value. We include our entire Company as the reporting unit. The fair values used in this evaluation are estimated based on the Company\u2019s market capitalization, which is based on the Company\u2019s outstanding common stock and market price of the stock. Impairment is deemed to exist if the net book value of the unit exceeds its estimated fair value. We evaluated our goodwill in the fourth quarter of 2020 and determined no impairment adjustment is required.\nOur intangible assets with finite lives are amortized using a straight-line basis over their economic useful lives.\nStock-based Compensation\nOur share-based awards include stock options, restricted stock awards and restricted stock units. We have non-qualified stock options outstanding to employees and directors under various stock option plans. The plans require the exercise price of options granted under these plans to equal or exceed the fair market value of the Company\u2019s common stock on the date of grant. The options, subject to termination of employment, generally expire ten years from the date of grant. Employee stock options typically vest pro-rata and annually over three or four years. Restricted stock is issued to the employee at grant but is subject to vesting and transfer restrictions. Stock is issued in exchange for restricted stock units when vesting conditions are met. The transfer restrictions and vesting conditions may be time or performance-based. Restricted stock and restricted stock units with time-based vesting typically vest pro-rata annually over three or four years. We use the straight-line amortization method for recognizing stock-based compensation costs. The weighted average grant-date fair value of awards of restricted stock and restricted stock units is based on the quoted market price of the Company\u2019s common stock on the date of grant. Option, restricted stock and restricted stock unit grants to employees, officers and directors frequently contain accelerated vesting provisions upon the occurrence of a change of control, as defined in the applicable grant agreements.\nRight-of-use Assets and Lease Obligations\nOn January 1, 2019, we adopted Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (ASU 2016-02) using the modified retrospective transition approach by applying the new standard to all leases existing at the date of initial application. Results and disclosure requirements for reporting periods beginning after January 1, 2019, are presented under Topic 842, while prior period amounts have not been adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with our historical accounting under Topic 840.\nWe elected to combine our lease and non-lease components and to keep leases with an initial term of 12 months or less off the balance sheet and recognize the associated lease payments in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Additionally, for certain equipment leases, we apply a portfolio approach to effectively account for the finance lease right-of-use (ROU) assets and lease liabilities.\nUnder Topic 842, we determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of remaining lease payments over the lease term. For this purpose, we consider only payments that are fixed and determinable at the time of commencement. As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. Our incremental borrowing rate is the financing rate of our long-term debt at the commencement date. The ROU asset also includes any lease payments made prior to commencement and is recorded net of any lease incentives received. Our lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise such options. When determining the probability of exercising such options, we consider contract-based, asset-based, entity-based, and market-based factors. Our lease agreements may contain variable costs such as common area maintenance, insurance, real estate taxes or other costs. Variable lease costs are expensed as incurred on the consolidated statements of income. Our lease agreements generally do not contain any residual value guarantees or restrictive covenants.\nOperating leases and finance leases are included in operating lease assets and property and equipment, respectively, on the consolidated balance sheets. Operating lease and finance lease liabilities are separately presented on our consolidated balance sheets.\nInternal-use Software\nThe Company capitalizes costs related to its cloud email security, productivity and compliance solutions and certain projects for internal use incurred during the application development stage. Costs related to preliminary project activities and post implementation activities are expensed as incurred. Internal-use software is amortized on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life, which is generally three years. Management evaluates the useful lives of these assets on an annual basis and tests for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets.\nImpacts of COVID-19\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of a novel strain of the coronavirus (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) to be a pandemic. The pandemic has resulted in significant, unpredictable, and rapidly changing impacts on the United States and global economies. The COVID-19 crisis and government responses have included limiting the operations of non-essential businesses and may result in long-term harm or permanent closures impacting our customers and our vendors. While COVID-19 had a minimal impact on our 2020 financial results, Zix has taken steps to ensure the resilience of our company, while protecting the email security of our customers and the health of our employees, including the following actions:\n\u2022\nOffering healthy email checks and evaluating other efficiency solutions for our customers;\n\u2022\nWorking with partners and customers to provide more flexible billing schedules;\n\u2022\nMoving over 95% of our employees to remote work arrangements while maintaining the integrity of our data center operations and providing continued support for our customers;\n\u2022\nMaintaining effective governance and internal controls in a remote work environment;\n\u2022\nReducing executive salaries and fees to our Board of Directors;\n\u2022\nImplementing a reduction in force of approximately 6%, completed through both voluntary and involuntary separation;\n\u2022\nSlowing our hiring plans, and reducing planned travel and conference expenses; and\n\u2022\nContinued review and adjustment of other operating expenses for potential savings, including reduction of excess capacities in our network data centers.\nWe have continued to provide our cloud email security, productivity and compliance solutions services to our customers and vendors during this ongoing pandemic. The full extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company\u2019s operational and financial performance is currently uncertain and will depend on many factors outside the Company\u2019s control, including, without limitation, the timing, extent, trajectory and duration of the pandemic, the development and availability of effective treatments and vaccines, the imposition of protective public safety measures, and the impact of the pandemic on the global economy and demand for consumer products. See the COVID-19 related risk factor included herein in Part I - Item 1A \u201cRisk Factors.\u201d\nFull Year 2020 Summary of Operations\nFinancial\n\u2022\nRevenue for 2020 was $218.5 million compared with $173.4 million in 2019 and $70.5 million in 2018.\n\u2022\nGross margin for 2020 was $105.7 million or 48% of revenues compared with $96.5 million or 56% of revenues in 2019 and $55.3 million or 78% of revenues in 2018. Our decrease in gross margin over the past two years is related to lower margin of revenue associated with Microsoft Office365 and hosted exchange products following the acquisition of AppRiver.\n\u2022\nNet income (loss) for 2020 was $(6.4) million in 2020 compared with $(14.6) million in 2019 and $15.4 million in 2018. The year-over-year improvement in our net loss was primarily due to revenue growth and the completion of prior year acquisition and integration related costs associated with our AppRiver purchase, as well as cost reductions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Our 2019 net loss is attributed to significant transaction and integration-related costs incurred to acquire AppRiver and DeliverySlip in 2019, amortization of intangible assets recognized from the same acquisitions as well as higher operating expenses and interest expense. Our 2018 net income includes a $7.8 million tax benefit resulting from a decrease to our deferred tax asset valuation allowance based on our expected future profitability and ability to use net operating losses.\n\u2022\nNet income (loss) attributable to common shareholders for 2020 was $(15.5) million compared with $(24.6) million in 2019 and $15.4 million in 2018. Our 2020 and 2019 net loss attributable to common shareholders includes deemed and accrued dividends of $9.0 million, and $9.9 million, respectively, to preferred shareholders.\n\u2022\nNet income (loss) per diluted share was $(0.29) for 2020 compared to $(0.46) for 2019 and $0.29 for 2018.\n\u2022\nUnrestricted cash was $21.4 million on December 31, 2020.\nResults of Operations\nRevenue\nThe following table sets forth a year-over-year comparison of our total revenues:\nYear Ended December 31,\nVariance\n2020 vs. 2019\nVariance\n2019 vs. 2018\n(In thousands)\n$\n%\n$\n%\nRevenues\n$\n218,478\n$\n173,428\n$\n70,478\n$\n45,050\n%\n$\n102,950\n%\nThe $45.1 million, or 26%, increase in revenue in 2020 over 2019 was related in part to recognition of twelve full months in sales for the year ended December 31, 2020, attributable to our AppRiver business acquired in February 2019. The $103.0 million or 146% increase in revenue in 2019 over 2018 was primarily related to our AppRiver acquisition in February 2019, which contributed $97.8 million for the year-end December 31, 2019. We additionally grew our revenue for these periods with continued success in our subscription-based business model with both steady additions to the subscriber base and with a high rate of existing customer renewals and the realization of previously contracted revenue in our backlog. In the year ended December 31, 2020, excluding our CloudAlly sales, we categorized our revenue in the following core industry verticals: 21% healthcare, 17% financial services, 3% government sector and 59% as other. In the year ended December 31, 2019, we categorized our revenue in the following core industry verticals: 23% healthcare, 19% financial services, 4% government sector and 54% as other.\nAdditionally, sales continued from a wide base of distributors. Approximately 76% and 74% of our new business transacted in the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, resulted from our partner relationships.\nWhile we have continued to add new bundled price offerings to our product portfolio, our list pricing has remained generally consistent during the periods shown above. However, there are no assurances that potential increased competition in this market or other factors, including inflation, will not result in future price erosion. Price erosion, should it occur, could have a dampening effect on order growth and the revenue derived from our new orders.\nRevenue Outlook:\nWe expect continued growth in our existing offering and in our new products, along with increased sales from our partner channels to increase our business in 2021 and increase our year-over-year revenue.\nAnnual Recurring Revenue\nWe measure the health of our subscriber base by the growth of our Annual Recurring Revenue (\u201cARR\u201d), which is defined as the aggregate annualized contract value attributable to recurring revenue contracts as of the end of the applicable reporting period. We calculate ARR by determining the annual or monthly revenue of subscription agreements that are active as of the end of the applicable period and multiplying by 1 or 12, depending on the term of such agreements. ARR aids us in determining to what extent individual customer relationships, considered in the aggregate, are growing or declining in financial magnitude. ARR is summarized in the table below:\nYear Ended December 31,\n(In thousands)\nAnnual Recurring Revenue\n$\n237,701\n$\n209,715\n$\n75,819\nBacklog\nOur backlog was $83.4 million at December 31, 2020, compared to $89.4 million at December 31, 2019. The backlog is comprised of contractual commitments that we expect to amortize into revenue. As of December 31, 2020, the backlog was comprised of the following elements: $41.5 million of deferred revenue that has been billed and paid, $12.9 million billed but unpaid, and approximately $29.0 million of unbilled contracts. The decline in backlog resulted from the shortening of the average term of our contracts from a multi-year to an annual commitment or to a monthly billing and subscription model.\nThe backlog is recognized into revenue ratably as the services are performed. Approximately 75% of the total backlog is expected to be recognized as revenue during the next twelve months.\nCost of Revenue\nThe following table sets forth a year-over-year comparison of the cost of revenue.\nYear Ended December 31,\nVariance\n2020 vs. 2019\nVariance\n2019 vs. 2018\n(In thousands)\n$\n%\n$\n%\nCost of revenue\n$\n112,763\n$\n76,908\n$\n15,186\n$\n35,855\n%\n$\n61,722\n%\nCost of revenues is comprised of Microsoft fees mostly associated with the resale of Microsoft Office365 and hosted exchange products, costs related to operating and maintaining the ZixData Center, third party data center costs, a field deployment team, customer service and support, and depreciation expense of computer equipment and amortization of acquired technology. The $35.9 million increase in 2020 compared to 2019 reflected in the table above resulted primarily from continued sales of Microsoft Office365 and hosted exchange products, which comprised 83% of AppRiver-related revenue earned for the year ended December 31, 2020. As a reseller of Microsoft Office 365 and hosted exchange products, we expect our costs of revenue to remain at higher levels than we have historically incurred.\nThe $61.7 million or 406% increase in 2019 compared to 2018 reflected in the table above resulted primarily from our acquisition of AppRiver in February 2019. Microsoft Office365 and hosted exchange products comprised approximately 75% of AppRiver-related revenue earned for the year ended December 31, 2019. We additionally incurred increases in average headcount and other expenses to accommodate revenue growth.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nThe following table sets forth a year-over-year comparison of our research and development expenses:\nYear Ended December 31,\nVariance\n2020 vs. 2019\nVariance\n2019 vs. 2018\n(In thousands)\n$\n%\n$\n%\nResearch and development expenses\n$\n22,813\n$\n20,431\n$\n11,323\n$\n2,382\n%\n$\n9,108\n%\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of salary, benefits and stock-based compensation for our development staff, independent contractor expense, and other direct and indirect costs associated with enhancing our existing products and services and developing new products and services.\nThe $2.4 million, or 12% increase in 2020 compared with 2019 in the table above was primarily the result of increased amortization associated with the completion of capitalized projects supporting new functionality for our hosted service arrangements.\nThe $9.1 million or 80% increase in research and development expense in 2019 compared with 2018 reflected in the table above resulted from the combined $15.6 million cost from increases in headcount and consulting attributable to our AppRiver acquisition in February 2019 and the expansion of our core Zix team, offset by additional $6.5 million of capitalized costs related to development of internal-use software, as compared to 2018.\nSelling and Marketing Expenses\nThe following table sets forth a year-over-year comparison of our selling and marketing expenses:\nYear Ended December 31,\nVariance\n2020 vs. 2019\nVariance\n2019 vs. 2018\n(In thousands)\n$\n%\n$\n%\nSelling and marketing expenses\n$\n56,479\n$\n54,903\n$\n20,380\n$\n1,576\n%\n$\n34,523\n%\nSelling and marketing expenses consist primarily of salary, commissions, travel, stock-based compensation and employee benefits for selling and marketing personnel as well as costs associated with promotional activities and advertising.\nThe $1.6 million or 3% increase in selling and marketing expense in 2020 compared with 2019 reflected in the table above was primarily due to increases in commissions and headcount expense and the amortization of acquisition related intangible assets. These increases were offset by COVID-19 related reductions in travel and advertising expenditures, as well as decreases in integration related spending that were associated with our AppRiver acquisition in 2019.\nThe $34.5 million or 169% increase in selling and marketing expense in 2019 compared with 2018 reflected in the table above was primarily due to our AppRiver acquisition in February 2019 as well as related integration activities including rebranding and website development. We additionally increased in headcount expense and spending for marketing programs.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nThe following table sets forth a year-over-year comparison of our general and administrative expenses:\nYear Ended December 31,\nVariance\n2020 vs. 2019\nVariance\n2019 vs. 2018\n(In thousands)\n$\n%\n$\n%\nGeneral and administrative expenses\n$\n21,866\n$\n30,327\n$\n13,619\n$\n(8,461\n)\n(28\n%)\n$\n16,708\n%\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of salary and bonuses, travel, stock-based compensation and benefits for administrative and executive personnel as well as fees for professional services and other general corporate activities.\nThe $8.5 million, or 28% decrease in general and administrative expense from 2020 compared with 2019 resulted primarily from reduction in acquisition and integration costs that were associated with our acquisitions of AppRiver and DeliverySlip in February 2019 and May 2019, respectively. The Company additionally incurred COVID-19 related reductions in headcount, executive salaries and travel expenses in 2020. These savings were offset by additional fees associated with our acquisition of CloudAlly and in increases in our stock-based compensation expense, including accelerated equity award vesting with voluntary terminations.\nThe $16.7 million or 123% increase in general and administrative expense from 2019 compared with 2018 resulted primarily from AppRiver acquisition in February 2019 and transaction and integration costs, as well as transactions and integration costs associated with DeliverySlip acquisition in May 2019. We additionally incurred increases in headcount expense, stock-based compensation expense as well as advisory and audit fees.\nIncome Taxes\nOur Company or one of our subsidiaries files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various states as well as in international jurisdictions. We recognize and measure uncertain tax positions using a two-step approach. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement.\nOur Company incurred tax expense of $1.7 million in 2020, and incurred a tax benefit of $4.5 million and $4.7 million, in 2019 and 2018, respectively. Our $1.7 million income tax expense in 2020 includes an increase of $2.2 million to our deferred tax asset valuation allowance based on expected future profitability. The $4.5 million income tax benefit in 2019 is primarily attributable to current year loss, which increased our deferred tax asset. Our 2018 tax benefit includes a $7.8 million release to our deferred tax asset valuation allowance based on expected future profitability. On December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted the Tax Act which significantly changed U.S. tax law. The Tax Act lowered the Company\u2019s statutory tax rate from 34% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. For all years presented, tax expense represented deferred tax expense, refundable U.S. Alternative Minimum Tax, U.S. research and development credits, non-U.S. taxes payable related to the operations of the Company\u2019s international subsidiaries, and state income taxes.\nSignificant judgement is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider available evidence, including past earnings, estimates of future taxable income, and the feasibility of tax planning strategies. At December 31, 2020, the Company partially reserved its U.S. net deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty of future taxable income sufficient to utilize net loss carryforwards prior to their expiration. The portion of the Company\u2019s deferred tax asset not reserved was $32.6 million. The majority of this unreserved portion related to $26.9 million U.S. net operating losses (\u201cNOLs\u201d) because we believe the Company will generate sufficient taxable income in future years to utilize these NOLs prior to their expiration. The remaining balance consists of $4.4 million relating to temporary timing differences between GAAP and tax-related expense, $1.9 million in federal R&D credits, and $1.0 million relating to state tax income and other credits. These items are offset by a $1.6 million deferred tax liability associated with our CloudAlly acquisition.\nWe have determined that utilization of existing NOLs against future taxable income is not limited by Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. Future ownership changes, however, may limit the Company's ability to fully utilize its existing net operating loss carryforwards against any future taxable income. See the risk factor concerning our ability to utilize our NOL\u2019s included herein in Part I - Item 1A \u201cRisk Factors.\u201d\nIf we begin to generate additional U.S. taxable income in a future period or if the facts and circumstances on which our current estimates and assumptions are based were to change, thereby impacting the likelihood of realizing a greater or lesser amount of our deferred tax assets, judgement would have to be applied in determining the amount of valuation allowance required. Adjusting our valuation allowance could have a significant impact on operating results in the period that it becomes more likely than not that an additional portion of our deferred tax assets will or will not be realized.\nOur provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely impacted by earnings being lower or higher than anticipated; by tax effects of nondeductible compensation; or by changes in tax laws, regulations, or accounting principles, including accounting for uncertain tax positions or interpretations. Significant judgment is required to determine the recognition and measurement applicable to all income tax positions. This includes the potential recovery of previously paid taxes, which if settled unfavorably could adversely affect our provision for income taxes or additional paid-in capital. In addition, our income tax returns are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income.\nNet Income (Loss)\nThe Company generated a net loss of $6.4 million in 2020 compared with a net loss of $14.6 million in 2019 and net income of $15.4 million in 2018. The year-over-year improvement in our net loss was primarily due to revenue growth and the completion of prior year acquisition and integration related costs associated with our AppRiver acquisition, as well as targeted cost reductions due to the COVID-19 pandemic. These improvements were offset by current year increases in our cost of revenue, research and development expense, and selling and marketing expense.\nOur net income decreased in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to transaction costs associated with our AppRiver and DeliverySlip acquisitions and related integration costs, as well as higher operating expense and interest expense. Additionally, a $4.5 million income tax benefit improved our net loss in 2019. Our 2018 net income included a tax benefit resulting from the decrease to our deferred tax asset valuation allowance as compared to the tax expense incurred following the 2017 tax-reform legislation, as discussed above.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nBased on our 2020 financial results and current expectations, including our assessment of the COVID-19 pandemic potential impact on our Company, we believe our cash and cash equivalents, cash generated from operations, and availability under our $25 million Revolving Facility (which, as of December 31, 2020, was repaid in full and the entire undrawn balance of $25 million was available to fund working capital and for other general corporate purposes, including the financing of permitted acquisitions, investments and restricted payments, subject to the conditions contained in the Credit Agreement) will satisfy our working capital needs, capital expenditures, investment requirements, contractual obligations, commitments, and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations through at least the next twelve months. We plan for and measure our liquidity and capital resources through an annual budgeting process and quarterly reviews, and we will continue to monitor our position to protect our Company against uncertainties related to the COVID-19 crisis.\nDuring 2020, our cash flow from operations was $31.3 million, an increase of $17.3 million from the $14.0 million cash flow from operations during 2019. At December 31, 2020, our cash and cash equivalents totaled $21.4 million, an increase of $8.1 million from the December 31, 2019 balance. The $8.1 million increase in our cash position is primarily attributable to our improved cash flow from operating activities in 2020 including management actions to reduce spending in response to the COVID-19 crisis, as well as from increased spending in the prior year associated with due diligence, banking and other fees associated with our AppRiver acquisition in February 2019.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, we achieved 26% growth in revenue, 48% gross margin and strong cash collections which increased our cash on hand level after investing back for business integration. In 2021, we expect cash provided by operations to improve with amortization of acquired deferred revenue, continued growth in existing and new customers and our expansion of business in the United Kingdom and Europe. While future results cannot be guaranteed, we expect these trends to continue in the foreseeable future, and believe a significant portion of our spending is discretionary and flexible and that we have the ability to adjust overall cash spending and raise additional funds in order to react, as needed, to any shortfalls in projected cash.\nCredit Facilities\nOn February 20, 2019, the Company entered into a credit agreement (the \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d) with a syndicate of lenders and SunTrust Bank as administrative agent, which (1) provided for borrowing in the form of a senior secured term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $175 million (the \u201cTerm Loan\u201d), (2) provided for a senior secured delayed draw term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $10 million (the \u201cDelayed Draw Term Loan Facility\u201d), and (3) provided for a senior secured revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $25 million, up to $5 million of which is available for letters of credit (the \u201cRevolving Facility\u201d and, together with the Term Loan and the Delayed Draw Term Loan Facility, the \u201cCredit Facilities\u201d). On February 20, 2019, the Term Loan was borrowed in full to pay a portion of the purchase price in connection with the AppRiver acquisition (described below in Note 22 \u201cAcquisitions\u201d), including certain fees, costs and expenses related thereto. On May 2, 2019, the Delayed Draw Term Loan Facility was borrowed in full to pay a portion of the purchase price in connection with the DeliverySlip acquisition (described below in Note 22 \u201cAcquisitions\u201d), including certain fees, costs and expenses related thereto.\nOn November 5, 2020, the Company amended its Credit Agreement to, among other things, to borrow under an incremental $35.0 million term loan (the \u201cIncremental Term Loan\u201d). The Incremental Term Loan has the same interest rate, maturity date, amortization schedule, collateral and other terms as the existing Term Loan and Delayed Draw Term Loan. The Company used the proceeds of the Incremental Term Loan to fund the acquisition of CloudAlly (described below in Note 22 \u201cAcquisitions\u201d) and to repay all existing borrowing under the Revolving Facility. The Credit Facilities are secured by substantially all the assets of Zix and its wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries and guaranteed by substantially all of Zix\u2019s wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries.\nSources and Uses of Cash\nYear End December 31,\n(In thousands)\nNet cash provided by operations\n$\n31,280\n$\n13,951\n$\n16,671\nNet cash used in investing activities\n$\n(48,056\n)\n$\n(296,243\n)\n$\n(15,952\n)\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities\n$\n25,545\n$\n268,740\n$\n(6,593\n)\nOur primary source of liquidity from operations was the collection of revenue in advance from our customers, accounts receivable from our customers, and the management of the timing of payments to our vendors and service providers.\nInvesting activities in 2020 consist of $30.0 million, net of cash acquired, used in the acquisition of CloudAlly and $18.0 million for capital expenditures, which include $14.2 million in internal-use software costs, $3.6 million for computer and networking equipment and $0.2 million of other acquired technology. These investments in new equipment and cloud hosting infrastructure are to renovate our business processes and product offerings.\nInvesting activities in 2019 consist of $284.6 million, net of cash acquired, used in the acquisitions of AppRiver and DeliverySlip and $11.7 million for capital expenditures, which include $8.2 million in internal-use software costs, and $3.5 million for computer and networking equipment. These investments in new equipment and cloud hosting infrastructure are to renovate our business processes and product offerings.\nFinancing activities in 2020 includes proceeds from long term debt of $30.4 million, net of issuance costs of $653 thousand and repayment of $9.9 million in debt and $334 thousand received from the exercise of stock options. The proceeds from our debt were used to fund our CloudAlly acquisition in November 2020 and to repay all our existing borrowings under the Revolving Facility. We also used $2.7 million to repurchase common stock related to the tax impact of vesting employee restricted stock awards, $1.1 million for a contingent consideration payment associated with our acquisition of Erado and $1.3 million to satisfy finance lease liabilities.\nFinancing activities in 2019 includes proceeds from long term debt of $179.2 million, net of issuance costs of $6.4 million and repayment of $1.4 million, as well as $96.6 million, net of issuance costs, raised through our private placement of preferred stock, and $415 thousand received from the exercise of stock options. The proceeds from our debt and preferred stock issuances were used to fund our AppRiver acquisition in February 2019 and our DeliverySlip acquisition in May 2019. We also used $3.8 million for contingent consideration payments associated with our acquisitions of Greenview, Erado and DeliverySlip. In addition to these items, we paid $1.7 million to satisfy finance lease liabilities and $1.9 million to repurchase common stock related to the tax impact of vesting employee restricted stock awards in 2019.\nOptions of Zix Common Stock\nWe have significant options outstanding that are currently vested. There is no assurance that any of these options will be exercised; therefore, the extent of future cash inflow and related dilution from additional option activity is not certain. The following table summarizes the options that were outstanding as of December 31, 2020. The vested options are a subset of the outstanding options. The value of the options is the number of options exercisable into shares multiplied by the exercise price for each share.\nSummary of Outstanding Options\nExercise Price Range\nOutstanding\nOptions\nTotal Value of\nOutstanding\nOptions\n(In thousands)\nVested\nOptions\n(included in\noutstanding\noptions)\nTotal Value of\nVested\nOptions\n(In thousands)\n$2.00 - $3.49\n180,000\n481,000\n180,000\n481,000\n$3.50 - $4.99\n462,010\n1,754,467\n462,010\n1,754,467\n$5.00 - $6.49\n-\n-\n-\n-\n$6.50 - $7.99\n100,000\n670,000\n-\n-\n$8.00 - $9.50\n100,000\n803,000\n18,750\n150,563\nTotal\n842,010\n$\n3,708,467\n660,760\n$\n2,386,030\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nNone.\nContractual Obligations and Contingent Liabilities and Commitments\nOur principal commitments consist primarily of obligations under operating and financing leases, which include among others, certain leases of our offices, colocations and servers as well as contractual commitment related network infrastructure and data center operations.

Upon adoption, we changed our impairment model to utilize a forward-looking current expected credit losses (CECL) model in pace of the incurred loss impairment model for our accounting receivable balance. The cumulative effect adjustment from adoption was immaterial to our condensed consolidated financial statements.\nIntangibles - Goodwill and Other\nOn January 1, 2020, we adopted Accounting Standard Update No. 2017-04 Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment prospectively. The guidance removes Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test, which requires a hypothetical purchase price allocation. A goodwill impairment will now be the amount by which a reporting unit's carrying value exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. The adoption of ASU 2017-04 did not have an impact on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements.\nIncome Taxes\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued Accounting Standard Update No. 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes (ASU 2019-12), which simplifies the accounting for income taxes. This guidance will be effective for us in the first quarter of 2021 on a prospective basis, and early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of the new guidance on our consolidated financial statements.",
    "item_7A": "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nWe do not believe that we face exposure to material market risk with respect to our cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash investments, which totaled $21.4 and $13.3 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We held no marketable securities as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe are exposed to interest rate risk with respect to our Credit Facilities. At December 31, 2020, we had $216.7 million aggregated principal amount of long term debt. We are subject to the risk of higher interest cost if either the LIBOR or the applicable margin increases. The applicable margin varies depending on the Company\u2019s total net leverage ratio. A hypothetical 50 basis point increase in margin from the current margin as of December 31, 2020 to the maximum level would not result in a material change in the interest rate. We do not currently hedge our variable interest debt, but we may do so in the future.\nLIBOR is used as a reference rate for borrowings under our Revolving Facility, which had $25 million undrawn balance as of December 31, 2020. LIBOR is set to be phased out at the end of 2021. We are currently reviewing how the LIBOR rate phase out will affect us, but we do not expect the impact to be material.\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk\nWe are growing our business internationally and will be subject to foreign currency risks related to our revenue and operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, primarily the Canadian dollar, British Pound and Israeli New Shekel. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates have negatively affected, and may continue to negatively affect, our revenue and other operating results as expressed in U.S. dollars.\nWe will experience fluctuations in our net income as a result of transaction gains or losses related to revaluing monetary asset and liability balances that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entities in which they are recorded. At this time, we have not entered into, but in the future we may enter into, derivatives or other financial instruments in an attempt to hedge our foreign currency exchange risk. Foreign currency losses recognized in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively as investment and other income in our consolidated statement of income are immaterial.",

Controls and Procedures\nEffectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedure\nIn accordance with Rule 13a-15(b) of the Exchange Act, as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, management evaluated, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company\u2019s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based on their evaluation of these disclosure controls and procedures, they have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the date of such evaluation.\nCertifications of our principal executive officer and our principal accounting officer, which are required in accordance with Rule 13a- 14 of the Exchange Act, are attached as exhibits to this Annual Report. This \u201cEffectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\u201d section includes the information concerning the controls evaluation referred to in the certifications, and it should be read in conjunction with the certifications for a more complete understanding of the topics presented.\nManagement\u2019s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nManagement assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth in 2013 by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in \u201cInternal Control-Integrated Framework\u201d. Based on this assessment, our management concluded that, as of December 31, 2020, our internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria.\nThe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, has been audited by Whitley Penn LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included herein.\nChanges in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting\nDuring the three months ended December 31, 2020, there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation described above that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect internal control over financial reporting.\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nBoard of Directors and Stockholders\nZix Corporation\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Zix Corporation and subsidiaries\u2019 (the \u201cCompany\u201d) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in 2013 Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (\u201cCOSO\u201d). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in 2013 Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by COSO.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (\u201cPCAOB\u201d), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company, as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the related consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss), stockholders\u2019 equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2020, and our report dated March 5, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company\u2019s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management\u2019s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the entity\u2019s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nAn entity\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. An entity\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the entity; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the entity are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the entity; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the entity\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ WHITLEY PENN LLP\nPlano, Texas\nMarch 5, 2021",

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (\u201cPCAOB\u201d), the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in 2013 Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (\u201cCOSO\u201d), and our report dated March 5, 2021, expressed an unqualified opinion.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company\u2019s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nAssessment of Realizability of Deferred Tax Assets\nDescription of the Matter\nAs discussed in Note 19 to the financial statements, the Company records a valuation allowance based on their assessment of the realizability of the Company\u2019s deferred tax assets. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had net deferred tax assets, before valuation allowance, of approximately $57.9 million. A significant portion of the deferred tax assets are subject to future expirations. Management uses subjective estimation to determine whether sufficient future taxable income will be generated to support the realization of the existing deferred tax assets before expiration.\nAuditing management\u2019s assessment of recoverability of deferred tax assets for U.S Federal income tax purposes involved a high degree of auditor judgment in evaluating the estimates and assumptions used in the projections of future taxable income.\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of internal controls that address the risks of material misstatement relating to the realizability of deferred tax assets, including controls over management\u2019s projections of future taxable income.\nThe primary procedures performed included evaluating the assumptions used by the Company to develop projections of future taxable income and testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used in the projections. For example, we compared the support for future taxable income with prior period results and management\u2019s projections. We also compared the projections of future taxable income with other forecasted financial information prepared by the Company. In addition, we evaluated the impact on taxable income of temporary differences including the expected timing of when these temporary differences would be realized.\nWe have served as the Company\u2019s auditor since 2006.\n/s/ WHITLEY PENN LLP\nPlano, Texas\nMarch 5, 2021\nZIX CORPORATION\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\nDecember 31,\n(In thousands, except share and par value

Company Overview\nZix Corporation (\u201cZix,\u201d the \u201cCompany,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cour,\u201d \u201cus\u201d) is a leading cloud provider of email security, compliance and productivity solutions, with easy-to-use solutions for email encryption, data loss prevention (\u201cDLP\u201d), advanced email threat protection, unified archiving, and cloud data backup to meet the data protection and compliance needs of our customers in a variety of industries.\n2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation - The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of all our wholly-owned subsidiaries and are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d). All inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nUse of Estimates - The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported period. Our significant estimates include primarily those required in the valuation or impairment analysis of goodwill and intangibles, property and equipment, revenue recognition, amortization period of our commission amortization, allowances for doubtful accounts, stock-based compensation, litigation accruals, valuation allowances for deferred tax assets and tax accruals. Although we believe that adequate accruals have been made for unsettled issues, additional gains or losses could occur in future years from resolutions of outstanding matters. These estimates and assumptions take into account historical and forward-looking factors that the Company believes are reasonable, including, but not limited to the potential impacts arising from the recent coronavirus (COVID-19) and public and private sector policies and initiatives aimed at reducing its transmission. As the extent and impacts of the COVID-19 virus remain unclear, the Company\u2019s estimates and assumptions may evolve as conditions change. Actual results could differ materially from original estimates.\nCash Equivalents - Cash investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased are considered cash equivalents.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments -The Company does not measure the fair value of any financial instrument other than cash equivalents, options, and other equity awards. The carrying values of other financial instruments (receivables and accounts payable) are not recorded at fair value but approximate fair values primarily due to their short-term nature. The carrying values of other current assets and accrued expenses are also not recorded at fair value, but approximate fair values primarily due to their short-term nature. In addition, the Company measures its long-term debt at fair value which approximates book value as the long-term debt bears market rate.\nValuation of Property and Equipment - The accounting policies and estimates relating to property and equipment are considered significant because of the potential impact that impairment, obsolescence, or change in an asset\u2019s useful life could have on the Company\u2019s operating results.\nWe record an impairment charge on the assets to be held and used when we determine based upon certain triggering events that the carrying value of property and equipment may not be recoverable based on expected undiscounted cash flows attributable to such assets. The amount of a potential impairment is determined by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to either the value determined from a projected discounted cash flow method, using a discount rate that is considered to be commensurate with the risk inherent in the Company\u2019s current business model or the estimated fair market value. Assumptions are made with respect to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the related asset. An impairment charge would be recorded for an amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeded the discounted projected net cash flows or estimated fair market value. Also, even where a current impairment charge is not necessary, the remaining useful lives are evaluated. No impairment was recorded for any of the periods presented.\nProperty and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated or amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives as follows: computer and office equipment and software - three years; leasehold improvements - the shorter of five years or the lease term; and furniture and fixtures - five years. We recorded depreciation expense of $5.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. We allocated $4.4 million of the expense to cost of revenue, $377 thousand to research and development expense, and $253 thousand to selling, marketing, and general and administrative expenses.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets - We account for the valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets after classifying intangible assets into three categories: (1) intangible assets with finite lives subject to amortization; (2) intangible assets with indefinite lives not subject to amortization; and (3) goodwill. For intangible assets with finite lives, tests for impairment must be performed if conditions exist that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. For intangible assets with indefinite lives and goodwill, tests for impairment must be performed at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that assets might be impaired.\nGoodwill was $195.0 million, or 43%, and $171.2 million, or 41%, of total assets as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nWe evaluate the goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter, or when there is reason to believe that the value has been diminished or impaired. Evaluations for possible impairment are based upon a comparison of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill has been assigned, versus the sum of the carrying value of the assets and liabilities of that unit including the assigned goodwill value. We include our entire Company as the reporting unit. The fair values used in this evaluation are estimated based on the Company\u2019s market capitalization, which is based on the outstanding stock and market price of the stock. Impairment is deemed to exist if the net book value of the unit exceeds its estimated fair value. No impairment was recorded for any of the periods presented.\nOur intangible assets with finite lives are amortized using a straight line basis over their economic useful lives.\nDeferred Tax Assets - Deferred tax assets are recognized if it is \u201cmore likely than not\u201d that the benefit of our deferred tax assets will be realized on future federal or state income tax returns. At December 31, 2020, we provided a valuation allowance against a significant portion, $25.2 million, of our accumulated deferred tax assets, reflecting our historical losses and the uncertainty of future taxable income sufficient to utilize net operating loss carryforwards prior to their expiration. Our total deferred tax assets not subject to a valuation allowance are valued at $32.6 million, and consist of $26.9 million of federal net operating loss carryforwards, $4.4 million relating to temporary timing differences between U.S. GAAP and tax-related expense, $1.9 million in federal R&D credits, and $1.0 million relating to U.S. state income tax and other credits. These items are offset by a $1.6 million deferred tax liability associated with our CloudAlly acquisition. If our U.S. taxable income increases from its current level in a future period or if the facts and circumstances on which our estimates and assumptions are based were to change, thereby impacting the likelihood of realizing our deferred tax assets, judgment would have to be applied in determining the amount of valuation allowance no longer required. Reversal of all or a part of this valuation allowance could have a significant positive impact on operating results in the period that it becomes more likely than not that certain of the Company\u2019s deferred tax assets will be realized. Alternatively, should our future income decrease from current levels, a resulting increase to all or a part of this valuation allowance could have a significant negative impact on our operating results.\nUncertain Tax Positions - Our Company recognizes and measures uncertain tax positions using a two-step approach. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement.\nRight-of-use Assets and Lease Obligations - On January 1, 2019, we adopted Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (ASU 2016-02) using the modified retrospective transition approach by applying the new standard to all leases existing at the date of initial application. Results and disclosure requirements for reporting periods beginning after January 1, 2019, are presented under Topic 842, while prior period amounts have not been adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with our historical accounting under Topic 840.\nWe elected to combine our lease and non-lease components and to keep leases with an initial term of 12 months or less off the balance sheet and recognize the associated lease payments in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Additionally, for certain equipment leases, we apply a portfolio approach to effectively account for the finance lease right-of-use (ROU) assets and lease liabilities.\nUnder Topic 842, we determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of remaining lease payments over the lease term. For this purpose, we consider only payments that are fixed and determinable at the time of commencement. As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. Our incremental borrowing rate is the financing rate of our long-term debt at the commencement date. The ROU asset also includes any lease payments made prior to commencement and is recorded net of any lease incentives received. Our lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise such options. When determining the probability of exercising such options, we consider contract-based, asset-based, entity-based, and market-based factors. Our lease agreements may contain variable costs such as common area maintenance, insurance, real estate taxes or other costs. Variable lease costs are expensed as incurred on the consolidated statements of income. Our lease agreements generally do not contain any residual value guarantees or restrictive covenants.\nOperating leases and finance leases are included in operating lease assets and property and equipment, respectively, on the consolidated balance sheets. Operating lease and finance lease liabilities are separately presented on our consolidated balance sheets.\nRevenue Recognition- In May 2014, The Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) issued ASC 606 which requires revenue recognition when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled to those goods and services. The standard became effective for us in 2018 but did not have a material impact to our revenue recognition process.\nWe earn our revenue from subscription fees for rights related to the use of our software. Approximately 78% of our revenue in 2020 was derived from hosted solutions. While some contracts include one or more performance obligations, the revenue recognition pattern generally is not impacted by separate allocations of these obligations because the services are generally satisfied over the same period of time and revenue is recognized ratably over the contract term.\nOur subscription terms historically have ranged from one to five years. We are increasingly moving to a monthly subscription model. This shift has been largely driven by our recent acquisition activity. As we further integrate our business, we expect to focus on a monthly subscription model.\nRevenue is recognized by applying the following steps:\n\u2022\nStep 1: Identify the contract(s) with a customer,\n\u2022\nStep 2: Identify the performance obligations in the contract,\n\u2022\nStep 3: Determine the transaction price\n\u2022\nStep 4: Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and\n\u2022\nStep 5: Recognize revenue when (or as) the performance obligation is satisfied.\nStep 1: Identify the contract(s) with a customer:\nWe consider the terms and conditions of the contract and our customary business practice in identifying our contracts. We determine we have a contract with a customer when the contract is approved, we can identify each party\u2019s rights regarding the services and products transferred, we can identify the payment terms for the services and products, the contract has commercial substance, and it is probable we will be paid.\nStep 2: Identify the performance obligations in the contract:\nASC 606 requires identification and disclosure of performance obligations within a revenue contract. A good or service is considered distinct if the customer can both benefit from the good or service on its own or with other resources that are readily available to the customer, and the promise to transfer the good or service is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract.\nStep 3: Determine the transaction price:\nThe transaction price is determined based on the consideration we expect to be entitled to receive in exchange for transferring goods and services to the customer. We include variable consideration in the transaction price if we view it as probable that a significant future reduction of cumulative revenue under the contract will not occur.\nStep 4: Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract:\nWe allocate transaction prices to each performance obligation based on the stand-alone selling price of our component services.\nStep 5: Recognize revenue when (or as) the performance obligation is satisfied:\nWe begin recognize revenue when the customer obtains control of the product or services, at the amount allocated to the satisfied performance obligation. Our performance obligations are generally satisfied over time.\nWhile some contracts include one or more performance obligations (including the combined elements noted above along with additional ongoing customer support and other hosted services), the revenue recognition pattern generally is not impacted by the separate allocations of these obligations because the services are generally satisfied over the same period of time and revenue is recognized over the contract period. Discounts provided to customers are recorded as reductions in revenue.\nCommission Amortization - We amortize our commission costs to expense on a systemic basis over the period of expected benefit to the customer. Determination of the amortization period requires significant judgement. We apply the practical expedient noted in ASC 606-10-10-4 to account for our commission costs and related amortizations at the portfolio level. Additionally, the Company has evaluated commissions earned upon contract renewal as compared to initial commissions paid and determined that because commissions paid were not reasonably proportional to their respective contract values, our renewal commissions could not be considered commensurate with the initial commissions paid.\nWe considered our average contract term length and historical customer retention rates to determine an average length of our customer relationships. We also concluded our add-on sales generally occur halfway into our customer relationships and evaluated our average customer renewal terms. Based on these factors we have determined that 8 years, 4 years and 18 months are the appropriate amortization periods to our new, add-on, and renewal sales commission expenses, respectively. We also perform subsequent assessments for impairment of the related deferred cost asset when indicators present.\nFollowing our acquisition of AppRiver in February 2019, we additionally evaluated AppRiver\u2019s sales program to determine whether capitalization of these expenses was appropriate. While we determined certain costs to acquire customers met the capitalization criteria, we also determined renewal commissions earned were commensurate to the initial sales. Based on AppRiver\u2019s primarily month-to-month commitments the Company has chosen to apply the practical expedient approach to immediately recognize such commensurate commission expenses associated with the AppRiver program.\nInternal Use Software - The Company capitalizes costs related to its cloud email security, productivity and compliance solutions and certain projects for internal use incurred during the application development stage. Costs related to preliminary project activities and post implementation activities are expensed as incurred. Internal-use software is amortized on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life, which is generally three years. Management evaluates the useful lives of these assets on an annual basis and tests for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets.\nIn 2020, we capitalized $14.2 million of costs related to internal-use software. The Company expects our capitalization of these costs to increase in the future.\nAdvertising Expense - Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Our operations include advertising expense of $2.4 million, $4.3 million, and $1.1 million in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.\nStock-Based Compensation - We currently use the straight-line amortization method for recognizing stock option and restricted stock compensation costs. The measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share-based payment awards made to our employees and directors are based on the estimated fair value of the awards on the grant dates. The grant date fair value is estimated using either an option-pricing model which is consistent with the terms of the award or a market observed price, if such a price exists. Such cost is recognized over the period during which an employee or director is required to provide service in exchange for the award, i.e., \u201cthe requisite service period\u201d (which is usually the vesting period). We also estimate the number of instruments that will ultimately be earned, rather than accounting for forfeitures as they occur.\nEarnings Per Share (\u201cEPS\u201d) - Basic EPS is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during each period. Diluted EPS adjusts Basic EPS for the effects of dilutive common stock equivalents outstanding during each period using the treasury stock method.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncement\nCredit Losses\nOn January 1, 2020, we adopted Accounting Standard Update No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Top 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments with a net increase of our receivables allowance and a related cumulative adjustment to our retained earnings recorded at the beginning of adaption. Upon adoption, we changed our impairment model to utilize a forward-looking current expected credit losses (CECL) model in pace of the incurred loss impairment model for our accounting receivable balance. The cumulative effect adjustment from adoption was immaterial to our condensed consolidated financial statements.\nIntangibles - Goodwill and Other\nOn January 1, 2020, we adopted Accounting Standard Update No. 2017-04 Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment prospectively. The guidance removes Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test, which requires a hypothetical purchase price allocation. A goodwill impairment will now be the amount by which a reporting unit's carrying value exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. The adoption of ASU 2017-04 did not have an impact on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nIncome Taxes\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued Accounting Standard Update No. 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes (ASU 2019-12), which simplifies the accounting for income taxes. This guidance will be effective for us in the first quarter of 2021 on a prospective basis, and early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of the new guidance on our consolidated financial statements.\n3. Stock Options and Stock-Based Employee Compensation\nBelow is a summary of common stock options outstanding at December 31, 2020:\nAuthorized Shares\nOptions\nOutstanding\nOptions Vested\nAvailable\nfor Grant\nEmployee and Director Stock Equity Plans:\n2004 Stock Option Plan\n5,000,000\n80,000\n80,000\n-\n2006 Director\u2019s Stock Option Plan\n1,100,000\n25,000\n25,000\n-\n2012 Incentive Plan\n6,300,000\n537,010\n537,010\n-\n2018 Omnibus Incentive Plan\n6,000,000\n100,000\n18,750\n2,222,521\nIsrael Plan\n400,000\n-\n-\n400,000\nTotal Employee and Director Stock Option Plans:\n18,800,000\n742,010\n660,760\n2,622,521\nOther Executive Inducement Stock Equity Award\n250,000\n100,000\n-\n-\nTotal\n19,050,000\n842,010\n660,760\n2,622,521\nUnder all of our stock option plans, new shares are issued when options are exercised.\nEmployee and Director Stock-Based Plans\nWe have non-qualified stock options outstanding to employees and directors under various stock option plans. The plans require the exercise price of options granted under these plans to equal or exceed the fair market value of the Company\u2019s common stock on the date of grant. The options, subject to termination of employment, generally expire ten years from the date of grant. Historically, our employee options and equity awards typically vested pro-rata and annually over three or four years. Stock-based grants to employees, officers and directors frequently contain accelerated vesting provisions upon the occurrence of a change of control, as defined in the applicable option agreements.\nIn connection with the acquisition of CloudAlly (as defined herein), on November 5, 2020, the board authorized a new, non-shareholder-approved equity plan under Nasdaq rules that permit the grant of \u201cinducement\u201d equity award (\u201cIsrael Plan\u201d) to employees of CloudAlly who joined Zix as part of the acquisition. Under the terms of the plan, 400,000 awards are available for issuance. These awards are expected to be granted in January 2021 and vest over two to four years.\nUnder the terms of the 2018 Omnibus Incentive Plan approved by our shareholders during our annual meeting held on June 6, 2018, (the \u201c2018 Plan\u201d), 6,000,000 shares are available for issuance. Awards issued under the 2018 Plan typically vest pro-rata and annually over three or four years.\nUnder the terms of the 2012 Incentive Plan adopted by our Board of Directors on April 13, 2012 (the \u201c2012 Plan\u201d), 2,700,000 shares were available for issuance, plus a number of additional shares (not to exceed 1,327,000) underlying options outstanding under certain of the Company\u2019s prior equity plans that thereafter terminate or expire unexercised, or are cancelled, forfeited, or lapse for any reason. Our shareholders approved an Amended and Restated 2012 Incentive Plan during our annual meeting held June 24, 2015, increasing the number of shares available for grant by 3,600,000. Awards issued under the 2012 Plan typically vest pro-rata and annually over three or four years.\nOther Executive Inducement Stock Equity Award\nFrom time to time, we may grant stock equity to key company executives, consultants, and other third parties. In 2020, in connection with a key executive\u2019s joining the company, Zix\u2019s board authorized non-shareholder-approved \u201cinducement\u201d equity awards to him consisting of (a) 100,000 shares of restricted stock, which will vest over four years, (b) 25,000 shares of restricted stock, which will vest in accordance with Zix\u2019s achievement of certain financial performance metrics in 2021 and 2022, and (c) options to acquire 100,000 shares of Zix common stock, which will vest over four years.\nAccounting Treatment\nWe use the straight-line amortization method for recognizing stock option compensation costs. Our share-based awards include (i) stock options, (ii) restricted stock awards, some of which are subject to time-based vesting (\u201cRestricted Stock\u201d) and some of which are subject to performance-based vesting (\u201cPerformance Stock\u201d), and (iii) restricted stock units, some of which are subject to time-based vesting (\u201cRSUs\u201d) and some of which are subject to performance-based vesting (\u201cPerformance RSUs\u201d).\nFor the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively, the total stock-based compensation expense resulting from stock options, Restricted Stock, RSUs, Performance RSUs, and Performance Stock was recorded to the following line items of our consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss):\nYear Ended December 31,\n(In thousands)\nCost of revenue\n$\n1,201\n$\n$\nResearch and development expenses\n1,641\n1,056\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\n6,868\n4,626\n2,522\nStock-based compensation expense\n$\n9,710\n$\n6,251\n$\n3,318\nOur stock-based compensation expense has increased yearly due to program expansion associated with our Company growth. A deferred tax asset of $1.9 million, $1.2 million, and $673 thousand resulting from stock-based compensation expense associated with awards relating to the Company\u2019s U.S. operations, was recorded for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, there was $16.7 million of total unrecognized stock-based compensation related to non-vested share-based compensation awards granted under the stock award plans. This cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.9 years.\nWe use the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model (\u201cBSOPM\u201d) to determine the fair value of option grants. The Company uses the \u201chistorical\u201d method to calculate the estimated life of any options that may be granted. The expected stock price volatility is calculated by averaging the historical volatility of the Company\u2019s common stock over a term equal to the expected life of the options. We granted 200,000 options in 2020. We did not grant options in 2019 or 2018.\nThe following weighted average assumptions were applied in determining the fair value of options granted during the respective periods:\nYear Ended December 31,\nRisk-free interest rate\n0.63\n%\n-\n-\nExpected option life (years)\n5.7\n-\n-\nExpected stock price volatility\n%\n-\n-\nExpected dividend yield\n-\n-\n-\nFair value of options granted\n$\n3.15\n$\n-\n$\n-\nThe assumptions used in the BSOPM valuation are critical as a change in any given factor could have a material impact on the financial results of the Company. The weighted average grant-date fair value of awards of restricted stock and restricted stock units is based on quoted market price of the Company\u2019s common stock on the date of grant.\nStock Option Activity\nThe following is a summary of all stock option transactions for the three years ended December 31, 2020:\nShares\nWeighted\nAverage\nExercise\nPrice\nWeighted Average Remaining Contractual Term (Yrs)\nOutstanding at January 1, 2018\n1,021,314\n$\n3.11\nGranted at market price\n-\n$\n0.00\nCancelled or expired\n(7,480\n)\n$\n4.04\nExercised\n(90,011\n)\n$\n1.83\nOutstanding at December 31, 2018\n923,823\n$\n3.23\nGranted at market price\n-\n$\n0.00\nCancelled or expired\n-\n$\n0.00\nExercised\n(167,438\n)\n$\n2.48\nOutstanding at December 31, 2019\n756,385\n$\n3.39\nGranted at market price\n200,000\n$\n7.37\nCancelled or expired\n-\n$\n0.00\nExercised\n(114,375\n)\n$\n2.90\nOutstanding at December 31, 2020\n842,010\n$\n4.40\n5.14\nOptions exercisable at December 31, 2020\n660,760\n$\n3.61\n3.93\nAt December 31, 2020, all 842,010 options outstanding and all 660,760 options exercisable had an exercise price lower than the market value of the Company\u2019s common stock.

We maintained an allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable for estimated losses resulting from the failure or inability of our customers to make required payments. Subsequent to January 1, 2020, accounts receivable are recorded at cost less an allowance for credit losses. We estimated losses on receivables at the reporting date based on expected losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments, including our historical experience of actual losses and the aging of such receivables. These receivables have been pooled by shared risk characteristics. Based on known information, we may also establish specific reserves for customers in an adverse financial condition or adjust our expectations of changes in conditions that may impact the collectability of outstanding receivables. As of December 31, 2020, based on available information to date, the Company has assessed no material impact related to potential losses caused by COVID-19. The reduction for the unpaid portion of deferred revenue represents future customer service or maintenance obligations which have been billed to customers, but remain unpaid as of the respective balance sheet dates. Deferred revenue on our consolidated balance sheets represents future customer service or maintenance obligations which have been billed and collected as of the respective balance sheet dates.\nThe note receivable represents the remaining outstanding balance of an original note related to the sale of a product line in 2005 in the amount of $540 thousand.

Leases\nEffective January 1, 2019, the Company adopted ASC 842, which requires recognition of a right-of-use asset and lease liability for all leases at the commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. Additional qualitative and quantitative disclosures regarding the Company's leasing arrangements are also required. The Company adopted ASC 842 prospectively and elected the package of transition practical expedients that does not require reassessment of (1) whether any existing or expired contracts are or contain leases, (2) lease classification and (3) initial direct costs. In addition, the Company has elected other available practical expedients to not separate lease and non-lease components, which consist principally of common area maintenance charges, for all classes of underlying assets and to exclude leases with an initial term of 12 months or less.\nThe Company determines if a contract is or contains a lease at inception. The Company has operating leases for office spaces and data centers and finance leases for equipment. The Company has entered into lease contracts ranging from 1 to 12 years with the majority of leases having remaining terms one to five years, many of which include options to extend in various increments. Variable lease costs consist primarily of variable common area maintenance, taxes, insurance, parking and utilities. The Company\u2019s leases do not have any residual value guarantees or restrictive covenants.\nAs the implicit rate is not readily determinable for most of the Company\u2019s lease agreements, the Company uses an estimated incremental borrowing rate to determine the initial present value of lease payments. These discount rates for leases are calculated using the Company's weighted average interest rate of the term loan and delayed draw term loan.\nThe components of lease costs are as follows:\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n(In thousands)\nFinance lease costs:\nAmortization of right-of-use asset\n$\n1,181\n$\n1,330\nInterest on lease liabilities\nOperating lease costs\n4,061\n3,490\nShort-term lease costs\n2,089\n2,236\nVariable lease costs\nTotal lease costs\n$\n8,245\n$\n7,980\nSupplemental cash flow information related to leases is as follows:\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n(In thousands)\nCash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities:\nOperating cash flows related to operating leases\n$\n4,130\n$\n2,410\nOperating cash flows related to finance leases\nFinancing cash flows related to finance leases\n1,339\n1,707\nRight-of-use assets obtained in exchange for lease obligations:\nOperating leases\n7,538\n7,999\nFinance leases\n-\n3,362\nSupplemental balance sheet information related to leases is as follows:\nDecember 31,\n(In thousands)\nBalance Sheet Classification\nOperating Leases\nOperating lease right-of-use asset\nOperating lease assets\n$\n14,259\n$\n10,128\nTotal operating lease assets\n$\n14,259\n$\n10,128\nDecember 31,\n(In thousands)\nBalance Sheet Classification\nFinance Leases\nFinance lease right-of-use assets\n$\n3,362\n$\n3,362\nAccumulated depreciation -\nfinance leases\n(2,490\n)\n(1,320\n)\nFinance lease right-of-use\nassets, net\nProperty and equipment, net\n$\n$\n2,042\nWeighted average remaining lease term and weighted average discount rate are as follows:\nWeighted Average Remaining Lease Term (Years)\nOperating leases\n3.09\nFinance leases\n1.34\nWeighted Average Discount Rate\nOperating leases\n4.31\n%\nFinance leases\n6.13\n%\nMaturities of lease liabilities are as follows:\nPayments Due by Year Ending December 31, 2021\n(In thousands)\nTotal\nYear 1\nYears 2 & 3\nYears 4 & 5\nBeyond 5 Years\nOperating leases\n$\n16,382\n$\n5,748\n$\n8,356\n$\n2,278\n$\n-\nLess imputed interest\n(1,132\n)\nTotal\n$\n15,250\nFinance leases\n$\n$\n$\n$\n-\n$\n-\nLess imputed interest\n(26\n)\nTotal\n$\nDuring the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, we entered into an operating lease for an additional data center, which has not yet commenced and approximately $109 thousand ROU and lease liabilities are expected to be added upon commencement.

Long-term Debt\nOn February 20, 2019, the Company entered into a credit agreement (the \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d) with a syndicate of lenders and SunTrust Bank as administrative agent, which (1) provided for borrowing in the form of a senior secured term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $175 million (the \u201cTerm Loan\u201d), (2) provided for a senior secured delayed draw term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $10 million (the \u201cDelayed Draw Term Loan Facility\u201d), and (3) provided for a senior secured revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $25 million, up to $5 million of which is available for letters of credit (the \u201cRevolving Facility\u201d and, together with the Term Loan and the Delayed Draw Term Loan Facility, the \u201cCredit Facilities\u201d). On February 20, 2019, the Term Loan was borrowed in full to pay a portion of the purchase price in connection with the AppRiver acquisition (described below in Note 22 \u201cAcquisitions\u201d), including certain fees, costs and expenses related thereto. On May 2, 2019, the Delayed Draw Term Loan Facility was borrowed in full to pay a portion of the purchase price in connection with the DeliverySlip acquisition (described below in Note 22 \u201cAcquisitions\u201d), including certain fees, costs and expenses related thereto. On November 5, 2020, the Company amended its Credit Agreement to, among other things, to borrow an incremental $35.0 million term loan (the \u201cIncremental Term Loan\u201d). The Incremental Term Loan has the same interest rate, maturity date, amortization schedule, collateral and other terms as the existing Term Loan and Delayed Draw Term Loan. The Company used the proceeds of the Incremental Term Loan to fund the acquisition of CloudAlly (described below in Note 22 \u201cAcquisitions\u201d) and to repay all existing borrowing under the Revolving Facility. The Credit Facilities are secured by substantially all the assets of Zix and its wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries and guaranteed by substantially all of Zix\u2019s wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries.\nBorrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest, at the Company\u2019s option, at either (1) the adjusted LIBOR rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement) plus a margin ranging from 2.50% to 3.50% or (2) the alternate base rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement) plus a margin ranging from 1.50% to 2.50%. The applicable margin varies depending on the Company\u2019s total net leverage ratio.\nThe Credit Facilities are scheduled to mature on February 20, 2024, unless extended in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement includes procedures for additional financial institutions to become lenders, or for any existing lender to increase its commitments thereunder, subject to the limits and conditions set forth in the Credit Agreement.\nOptional prepayments of borrowings under the Credit Facilities are permitted at any time and do not require any prepayment premium (other than reimbursement of the lenders\u2019 breakage and redeployment costs in the case of a prepayment of LIBOR borrowings).\nThe Credit Agreement contains various financial, operational, and legal covenants. The financial covenant is tested on a quarterly basis, based on the rolling four-quarter period that ends on the last day of each fiscal quarter. The financial covenant requires the Company to maintain a maximum total net leverage ratio of:\n\u2022\n4.75:1.00 for the fiscal quarters ending September 30, 2020 through March 31, 2021;\n\u2022\n4.50:1.00 for the fiscal quarters ending June 30, 2021 through December 31, 2021; and\n\u2022\n4.25:1.00 for the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2022 and each fiscal quarter thereafter.\nThe non-financial covenants restrict the Company\u2019s ability and the ability of the Company\u2019s restricted subsidiaries to, among other things, incur indebtedness, incur liens, merge with or acquire other entities, make investments, dispose of assets, enter into sale and leaseback transactions, make dividends, distributions or stock repurchases, prepay junior indebtedness, enter into transactions with affiliates, enter into restrictive agreements, and amend organizational documents or the terms of junior indebtedness.\nThe Credit Agreement contains events of default that Zix believes are customary for a secured credit facility. If an event of default relating to bankruptcy or other insolvency events occurs, all obligations under the Credit Agreement will immediately become due and payable. If any other event of default exists under the Credit Agreement, the lenders may accelerate the maturity of the Credit Facilities and exercise other rights and remedies, including foreclosure or other actions against the collateral. If any default exists under the Credit Agreement, or if the Company is unable to make any of the representations and warranties in the Credit Agreement at the applicable time, Zix will be unable to borrow additional funds or have letters of credit issued under the Credit Agreement.\nTerm Loan and Incremental Term Loan\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company had $206.8 million in principal outstanding under the Term Loan and the Incremental Term Loan. The Term Loan was fully drawn on February 20, 2019 in the amount of $175 million, and requires quarterly payments of principal of $437.5 thousand beginning on June 30, 2019. The Incremental Loan was fully drawn on November 5, 2020 in the amount of $35.0 million, and requires quarterly payments of principal of $89 thousand beginning on December 31, 2020. In addition to other customary mandatory prepayment requirements, the Term Loan and the Incremental Term Loan requires annual prepayments based on a percentage of Zix\u2019s excess cash flow, which percentage will reduce if Zix\u2019s total net leverage ratio decreases.\nAt December 31, 2020, the Company had an outstanding debt balance of $202.0 million attributable to the Term Loan based on the 4.88% interest rate in effect during the period from December 31, 2019 through December 31, 2020. Included in the balance at December 31, 2020 is $4.8 million of unamortized debt issuance costs.\nBased on the calculation of excess cash flow and total net leverage ratio and for the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company is not required to make prepayment in addition to the quarterly installment.\nFuture scheduled principal payments under the Term Loan as of December 31, 2020 are as follows:\n(In thousands)\nYear Ending December 31,\nAmount\n2,105\n2,105\n2,105\n200,534\nTotal\n206,849\nDelayed Draw Term Loan Facility\nAt December 31, 2020, the Company had $9.9 million in principal outstanding under the Delayed Draw Term Loan Facility. The Delayed Draw Term Loan Facility was fully drawn on May 2, 2019 in the amount of $10 million to fund the DeliverySlip acquisition. The Delayed Draw Term Loan Facility requires 1.00% per annum amortization of the original principal amount borrowed, payable in equal quarterly installments of $25 thousand beginning on September 30, 2019. In addition to other customary mandatory prepayment requirements, the Delayed Draw Term Loan Facility requires annual prepayments based on a percentage of Zix\u2019s excess cash flow, which percentage reduces if Zix\u2019s total net leverage ratio decreases.\nAt December 31, 2020, the Company had an outstanding debt balance of $9.8 million attributable to the Delayed Draw Term Loan Facility based on the 4.3% interest rate in effect during the period from December 31, 2019 through December 31, 2020. Included in the balance at December 31, 2020 is $34 thousand of unamortized debt issuance costs.\nBased on the calculation of excess cash flow and total net leverage ratio and for the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company is not required to make prepayment in addition to the quarterly installment.\nFuture scheduled principal payments under the Delayed Draw Term Loan Facility as of December 31, 2020 are as follows:\n(In thousands)\nYear Ending December 31,\nAmount\n9,550\nTotal\n9,850\nRevolving Facility\nThe Company also has a Revolving Facility with the lenders, pursuant to which the lenders agreed to make a Revolving Facility available to the Company in an aggregate amount of up to $25 million. Proceeds from the Revolving Facility may be used for working capital and general business purposes, including the financing of permitted acquisitions, investments and restricted payments, subject to the conditions contained in the Credit Agreement. Zix is charged a commitment fee ranging from 0.25% to 0.50% per year on the daily amount of the unused portions of the commitments under the Revolving Facility.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company had no outstanding debt balance attributable to the Revolving Facility. The undrawn balance of $25 million is available to fund working capital and for other general corporate purposes, including the financing of permitted acquisitions, investments and restricted payments, subject to the conditions contained in the Credit Agreement. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company has incurred $78 thousand of commitment fees.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the estimated fair value of the Credit Facilities approximated their carrying value and the Company was in compliance with all covenants in the Credit Agreement.\n12. Preferred Stock\nOn February 20, 2019, (the \u201cOriginal Issuance Date\u201d or \u201cClosing Date\u201d), Zix consummated a private placement pursuant to an investment agreement with an investment fund managed by True Wind Capital and issued an aggregate of $100 million of shares of convertible Preferred Stock (as defined below) at a price of $1,000 per share (the \u201cStated Value\u201d). 64,914 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (the \u201cSeries A Preferred Stock\u201d) were issued for proceeds of $62.7 million, net of issuance costs of $2.3 million, and 35,086 shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock (the \u201cSeries B Preferred Stock\u201d and, together with the Series A Preferred Stock, the \u201cPreferred Stock\u201d) were issued for proceeds of $33.9 million, net of issuance costs of $1.2 million. The Preferred Stock is classified outside of stockholders\u2019 equity in temporary equity because the shares contain certain redemption features which require redemption upon a change in control. The Series A Preferred Stock can be immediately converted to common stock.\nOn June 5, 2019, Shareholders approved the conversion of the outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock into shares of Series A Preferred Stock. Each share of Series B Preferred Stock was converted into the number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock equal to the liquidation preference of such share of Series B Preferred Stock divided by the accreted value of a share of Series A Preferred Stock on the date of conversion plus cash in lieu of fractional shares. On June 6, 2019, all the outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock were converted into 35,292 shares of Series A Preferred Stock. As of December 31, 2020, no shares of Series B Preferred Stock are outstanding.\nThe conversion option of the Series A Preferred Stock was determined to have a beneficial conversion feature valued at $2.5 million, excluding the additional beneficial conversion feature accrued for the deemed dividend and was recorded to additional paid-in capital and as a discount to the Series A Preferred Stock. This resulting discount was immediately amortized as the Series A Preferred Stock has no set redemption date but is currently convertible.\nDividends\nThe Stated Value of the Series A Preferred Stock accretes at a fixed rate of 8% per annum, compounded quarterly (\u201cSeries A Preferred Dividend\u201d). Apart from the Series A Preferred Dividend, the holders of Series A Preferred Stock are also entitled to receive any dividends paid on our common stock on an \"as converted\" basis. No dividend may be paid on our common stock until such dividend is paid on the Series A Preferred Stock. All calculations of the Accreted Value (as defined below) of Series A Preferred Stock will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the accretion of the Stated Value of Series A Preferred Stock is valued at $15.0 million, including the accretion attributable to the converted Series A Preferred Stock from Series B Preferred Stock, and the accretion of the beneficial conversion feature is valued at $325 thousand. As of June 6, 2019, the accrued dividend on the Series B Preferred Stock, valued at $1.2 million, was converted to Series A Preferred Stock along with the Stated Value of the Series B Preferred Stock. Upon conversion of Series B Preferred Stock to Series A Preferred Stock on June 6, 2019, all remaining dividend calculations are based on the terms of the Series A Preferred Dividend for the converted Series A Preferred Stock.\nVoting Rights\nHolders of Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to vote, together with the holders of common stock on all matters submitted to a vote of the holders of our common stock. Each holder of Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled to the number of votes equal to the largest number of whole shares of common stock into which all shares of Series A Preferred Stock held by such holder could be converted. The vote or consent of the holders of at least a majority of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock outstanding will be necessary for effecting or validating any of the following actions: (i) any amendment, alteration or repeal of Zix\u2019s Articles of Incorporation or Series A Certification of Designations that would adversely affect the rights, preferences, privileges or power of the Series A Preferred Stock\u037e (ii) any amendment or alteration to Zix\u2019s Articles of Incorporation or any other action to authorize or create, or increase the number of authorized or issued shares of capital stock of the Company convertible into shares of, or ranking senior to, or on a parity basis with, the Series A Preferred Stock as to dividend rights or liquidation rights; (iii) the issuance of shares of Series A Preferred Stock after the Original Issuance Date other than in connection with the conversion of Series B Preferred Stock that was issued on the Original Issuance Date; (iv) any action that would cause the Company to cease to be treated as a domestic corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes; and (v) the incurrence of any indebtedness of the Company that would cause Zix to exceed a specified leverage ratio.\nLiquidation Preference\nThe Series A Preferred Stock has a liquidation preference equal to the greater of (i) the Stated Value per share as it has accreted as of such date (the \u201cAccreted Value\u201d) and (ii) the amount such holder would have received if the Series A Preferred Stock had converted into common stock immediately prior to such liquidation.\nConversion\nAt any time, each Series A Preferred Stock holder may elect to convert each share of such holders\u2019 then-outstanding Series A Preferred Stock into (i) the number of shares of common stock equal to the product of (a) the Accreted Value with respect to such share on the conversion date multiplied by (b) the conversion rate (currently 166.11) as of the applicable conversion date divided by (c) 1,000 plus (ii) cash in lieu of fractional shares.\nOptional Redemption by Zix\nAt any time after the fourth anniversary of the Closing Date, Zix may redeem the Series A Preferred Stock for an amount per share of Series A Preferred Stock equal to the Accreted Value per share of the Series A Preferred Stock to be redeemed as of the applicable redemption date multiplied by 1.50.\n13. Revenue from Contracts with Customers\nAccounting policies\nOur Company provides message security solutions as subscription services in which we recognize revenue as our services are rendered. Our customer contracts historically have ranged from one to three-year contracts billed annually. We are increasingly moving to a monthly subscription model. This shift has been largely driven by our recent acquisition activity, including CloudAlly and AppRiver. We exclude from the measurement of the transaction price all taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction and collected by our Company from a customer (e.g., sales, use, value added, and some excise taxes).\nDisaggregation of Revenue\nIn 2020, excluding our CloudAlly sales, we recorded revenue for our services in the following core industry verticals: 21% healthcare, 17% financial services, 3% government sector, and 59% as other.\nWe operate as a single operating segment. Revenue generated from our email encryption and security solutions represented 100% of our revenue in 2020 and 2019.\nContract balances\nOur contract assets include our accounts receivable, discussed in Footnote 5 above, and the deferred cost associated with commissions earned by our sales team on securing new, add-on, and renewal contract orders. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we increased our noncurrent deferred contract asset by $4.7 million, and $5.5 million, respectively, resulting from commissions earned by our sales team during the twelve month periods ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we also amortized $3.7 million and $3.0 million, respectively of deferred cost, as a selling and marketing expense in the related periods. Our deferred cost asset is assessed for impairment on a periodic basis. There were no impairment losses recognized on deferred contract cost assets for each of the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nOur contract liabilities consist of deferred revenue representing future customer services which have been billed and collected. The $1.8 million decrease to our net deferred revenue in the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, is primarily related to the timing of orders and payments in the normal course of business and our continued trend toward monthly subscription offset by increase of $1.3 million deferred revenue acquired through CloudAlly (as defined herein) acquisition. The $11.1 million increase to our net deferred revenue in the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, is primarily related to our AppRiver acquisition in February 2019.\nPerformance obligations\nAs of December 31, 2020, the aggregate amount of the transaction prices allocated to remaining service performance obligations, which represents the transaction price of firm orders less inception to date revenue, was $83.4 million. We expect to recognize approximately $62.7 million of revenue related to this backlog in 2021, and $20.7 million in periods thereafter. Approximately $62.4 million of our $218.5 million revenue recognized in the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, was included in our performance obligation balance at the beginning of the period.\n14. Fair Value Measurements\nFASB guidance regarding fair value measurement establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. These tiers include: Level 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; Level 2, defined as inputs other than quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs for which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions.\nThe following table represents a reconciliation of our acquisition-related contingent earn-out liability measured at fair value on a recurring basis, using Level 3 inputs for the year ended December 31, 2020:\n(In thousands)\nFair Value Measurements Using Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3)\nBalance at December 31, 2019\n$\nAdditions during the period\nPayments during the period\n-\nAdjustments to fair value during the period recorded in General and\nAdministrative expenses\n-\nBalance at December 31, 2020\n$\n15. Earnings Per Share and Potential Dilution\nBasic earnings per share are computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period under the Treasury Stock method. The dilutive effect of potential common shares outstanding is included in diluted earnings per share. The computations for basic and diluted earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, are as follows:\nYear Ended December 31,\nBasic weighted average shares\n54,024,162\n53,025,152\n52,591,714\nEffect of dilutive securities:\nEmployee and director stock options\n-\n-\n347,167\nRestricted Stock\n-\n-\n409,871\nRSUs\n-\n-\n24,369\nPerformance RSUs\n-\n-\n9,367\nPerformance Stock\n-\n-\n98,807\nPotential dilutive common shares\n54,024,162\n53,025,152\n53,481,295\nThe following table presents the potentially dilutive common shares outstanding that were excluded from the computation of dilutive net loss per share of common stock for the periods presented because including them would have been anti-dilutive:\nYear Ended December 31,\nStock options to purchase common stock\n842,010\n756,385\n73,313\nRestricted Stock\n2,091,382\n1,912,082\n131,774\nRSUs\n126,191\n140,075\n6,084\nPerformance RSUs\n69,349\n55,499\nPerformance Stock\n851,852\n474,568\n18,536\nPreferred Stock\n19,135,862\n17,668,363\n-\nPotential dilutive common shares\n23,116,646\n21,006,972\n230,624\n16. Significant Customers\nIn 2020, 2019, and 2018, no single customer accounted for 10% or more of our revenues.\n17. Commitments and Contingencies\nOur principal commitments consist primarily of obligations under operating and financing leases, which include among others, certain leases of our offices, colocations and servers as well as contractual commitment related network infrastructure and data center operations. Refer to Note 8 \u201cLeases\u201d for our commitments to settle contractual obligations in cash as of December 31, 2020.\nClaims and Proceedings\nWe are subject to legal proceedings, claims, and litigation against our business. While the outcome of these matters is currently not determinable and the costs and expenses of defending these matters may be significant, we currently do not expect that the ultimate costs to resolve these matters will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements.\n18. Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)\nThe assets and liabilities of international subsidiaries are translated from the respective local currency to the U.S. dollar using exchange rates at the balance sheet date. Related translation adjustments are recorded as a component of the accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Our Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income (Loss) of international subsidiaries are translated from the local currency to the U.S. dollar using average exchange rates for the period.\nWe are exposed to fluctuations in the foreign currency exchange rates as a result of our net investments and international operations. For fiscal year 2020, movements in currency exchange rates and the related impact on the translation of the balance sheets of our subsidiaries in Canada, Israel and the United Kingdom, were the primary cause of our foreign currency translation gain of $1.4 million, net of $440 thousand in income taxes. For fiscal year 2019, movements in currency exchange rates and the related impact on the translation of the balance sheets of our subsidiary in Canada was the primary cause of our foreign currency translation gain of $215 thousand, net of $16 thousand in income taxes. For fiscal year 2018, foreign currency translation adjustments were immaterial.\n19.

The Company has U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $232 million which begin to expire in 2021. The Company has state credits totaling $1.5 million which can be utilized through 2026 and state net operating losses that have various expiration dates. The Company also has tax credit carryforwards of approximately $3.4 million consisting of business tax credits that begin to expire in 2021. The Company\u2019s net deferred tax assets include a $1.6 million deferred tax liability with Israel associated with the purchase of CloudAlly (see note 22 below).\nWe have determined that utilization of existing net operating losses against future taxable income is not limited by Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. Future ownership changes, however, may limit the Company's ability to fully utilize its existing net operating loss carryforwards against any future taxable income.\nThe Company or one of our subsidiaries files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various states and in the Canadian federal and provincial jurisdictions. We have not taken a tax position that, if challenged, would have a material effect on the financial statements or the effective tax rate for the twelve-months ended December 31, 2020, or during the prior three years. We have determined it is not reasonably possible for the amounts of unrecognized tax benefits to significantly increase or decrease within the next twelve months. We are currently subject to a three-year statute of limitations by major tax jurisdictions.\n20. Employee Benefit Plan\n401(k) Plan - We have a retirement savings plan structured under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code covering substantially all of our U.S. employees. Under the plan, contributions are voluntarily made by employees, and we may provide contributions based on the employees\u2019 contributions. Our operating income includes $2.0 million, $1.2 million, and $618 thousand in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively, for net contributions from operations to this plan.\n21. Zix Repurchase Program\nOn April 24, 2017, the Company\u2019s Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program that enabled the Company to purchase up to $10 million of its shares of common stock. The shares repurchase program expired on May 31, 2018. The Company did not repurchase shares during the years ended December 31, 2020 or 2019. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company repurchased 1,206,994 shares at an aggregate cost of $5.4 million.\n22. Acquisitions\nAcquisition of CloudAlly\nOn November 5, 2020, Zix acquired 100% of the equity interest of CloudAlly Ltd. (\u201cCloudAlly\u201d) and its parent holding company for a total purchase price of $30.5 million, following a working capital adjustment. The purchase price included cash consideration of $30.0 million, net of cash acquired. The Company used a portion of the proceeds of the Incremental Term Loan (as defined in Note 11) to fund the acquisition of CloudAlly.\nFounded in 2011, CloudAlly, based in Israel, is a pioneer of enterprise-grade, software-as-a-service (SaaS) cloud backup and recovery solutions. The company offers a robust suite of award-winning, ISO 27001 certified and GDPR/HIPAA compliant solutions for Microsoft Office 365, Google Workspace (formerly G Suite), SharePoint, OneDrive, Salesforce, Box and Dropbox. CloudAlly is a channel-first provider, serving more than 5,000 customers, 500,000 users and supported by 300 Managed Service Provider (MSP) partners.\nThe Company incurred $1.8 million in acquisition-related costs for the year ended December 31, 2020. Revenue from CloudAlly was $1.2 million from the acquisition date November 5, 2020 to December 31, 2020, and due to the continued integration of the combined business, it was impractical to determine earnings attributable to CloudAlly.\nWe accounted for the acquisition as the purchase of a business and recorded the excess purchase price as goodwill. The goodwill from this transaction is not yet finalized. The majority of the goodwill balance is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. The intangible assets we acquired from CloudAlly consist of technology, customer relationships, and trademarks/names which we are amortizing over 4 years, 4 years and 9 years respectively. The results of operations and the provisional fair values of the acquired assets and liabilities have been included in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements since the CloudAlly acquisition closed on November 5, 2020.\nThe following table summarizes the current estimated fair value of acquired assets and liabilities:\n(In thousands)\nProvisional\nFair Value\nAssets:\nCurrent assets\n$\n1,385\nProperty and equipment\nROU assets\n5,080\nTrademark/names\nTechnology\n6,000\nCustomer relationships\n3,900\nGoodwill\n22,312\nTotal assets\n39,183\nLiabilities:\nCurrent liabilities\nDeferred revenue\n$\n1,300\nOperating lease liabilities\n5,080\nDeferred tax liability\n1,646\nTotal liabilities\n8,680\nNet assets recorded\n$\n30,503\nDeliverySlip\nOn May 7, 2019, the Company acquired certain assets of Cirius Messaging Inc. (\u201cSeller\u201d) and its wholly owned subsidiary DeliverySlip Inc.(\u201cDeliverySlip\u201d), related to the DeliverySlip product for a total purchase price of $13.8 million, including cash consideration of $11.4 million and a contingent consideration with an estimated fair value of $2.3 million at the acquisition date. The contingent consideration was paid in full upon the completion of certain agreed upon requirements and a related $0.2 million loss on the contingent consideration was recognized in the year ended December 31, 2019. Included in the cash consideration, a holdback amount of $1.5 million was transferred to an escrow agent for the satisfaction of the Seller\u2019s indemnity and other obligations under the purchase agreement. The acquisition was partially financed with proceeds of $10 million from the Delayed Draw Term Loan Facility. The purchase of DeliverySlip expanded the Company\u2019s product offering including email encryption, e-signatures and secure file solutions.\nThe Company incurred $1.2 million in acquisition-related costs with respect to the DeliverySlip acquisition, which were recorded within operating expenses during the twelve months end December 31, 2019. Prior to the acquisition, approximately 90% of DeliverySlip\u2019s revenue was generated from AppRiver Canada Inc, which became a subsidiary of the Company upon closing of the AppRiver acquisition (as described below). Revenue from additional acquired customers of DeliverySlip for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were immaterial.\nWe accounted for the acquisition as the purchase of a business and recorded the excess purchase price as goodwill. The goodwill from this transaction is not yet finalized. The majority of the goodwill balance is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. The intangible asset we acquired from DeliverySlip is technology which we are amortizing over 6 years. The results of operations and the fair values of the acquired assets and liabilities have been included in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements since the DeliverySlip acquisition closed on May 7, 2019. Certain estimated values are not yet finalized and subject to revision as additional information becomes available and more detailed analyses are completed.\nThe following table summarizes the current estimated fair value of acquired assets and liabilities:\n(In thousands)\nEstimated Fair\nValue\nAssets:\nTechnology\n$\n4,200\nGoodwill\n9,603\nTotal assets\n13,803\nLiabilities:\nDeferred revenue\n$\nTotal liabilities\nNet assets recorded\n$\n13,751\nAppRiver Companies\nOn February 20, 2019, Zix acquired 100% of the equity interest of AR Topco, LLC and its subsidiaries, including AppRiver LLC (\u201cAppRiver\u201d and collectively, the \u201cAppRiver Companies\u201d), for a total purchase price of $277.7 million, following a working capital adjustment. The purchase price included cash consideration of $273.1 million, net of cash acquired. This acquisition complements our strategy to accelerate our offerings into the cloud at the point of initial cloud application purchase and expand our customer base.\nWe financed the acquisition with proceeds from (1) cash on hand, (2) the proceeds from the Term Loan, and (3) a private placement with an investment fund managed by True Wind Capital consisting of (i) 64,914 newly issued shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, $1.00 par value per share, and (ii) 35,086 newly issued shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, $1.00 par value per share, in exchange for cash consideration in an aggregate amount of $100 million (which was reduced by $3 million in True Wind Capital\u2019s costs that were reimbursed by the Company).\nAppRiver is a channel-first provider of cloud-based cyber security and productivity services, offering web protection, email encryption, secure archiving, and email continuity solutions. AppRiver also provides Microsoft Office 365 and Secure Hosted Exchange services, which serve as an effective lead generation tool for AppRiver\u2019s solutions. The acquisition of AppRiver can accelerate our offerings into the cloud at the point of initial cloud application purchase. Because AppRiver currently services over 60,000 worldwide customers using a network of 4,500 Managed Service Providers, this acquisition can also help us expand our customer base.\nThe Company incurred $10.8 million in acquisition-related costs which included $1.1 million, $9.6 million and $98 thousand recorded within operating expenses for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2020, respectively. Revenue from AppRiver was $137.3 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, and was $97.8 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, since the acquisition date. Due to the continued integration of the combined businesses, it was impracticable to determine earnings attributable to AppRiver.\nWe accounted for the acquisition as the purchase of a business and recorded the excess purchase price as goodwill. The goodwill from this transaction is not yet finalized. The majority of the goodwill balance is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. The intangible assets we acquired from AppRiver consist of customer relationships, vendor relationships, trademarks/names, and internally developed software, which we are amortizing over 8 years, 3 years, 10 years, and 5-6 years, respectively. The results of operations and the fair values of the acquired assets and liabilities have been included in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements since the AppRiver acquisition closed on February 20, 2019.\nThe following table summarizes the current estimated fair value of acquired assets and liabilities:\n(In thousands)\nEstimated Fair\nValue\nAssets:\nCurrent assets\n$\n12,200\nProperty and equipment\n3,235\nROU assets\n8,778\nCustomer relationships\n91,000\nVendor relationships\n1,000\nTrademark/Names\n4,400\nInternally developed software\n41,100\nDeferred tax asset\n3,453\nGoodwill\n147,518\nTotal assets\n312,684\nLiabilities:\nCurrent liabilities\n$\n13,378\nDeferred revenue\n12,424\nOperating lease liabilities\n9,178\nTotal liabilities\n34,980\nNet assets recorded\n$\n277,704\nErado\nOn April 2, 2018, the Company acquired all the outstanding capital stock of CM2.COM, Inc., d/b/a Erado (\u201cErado\u201d) for a total purchase price of $14.4 million, including cash consideration of $11.8 million, net of cash acquired. The purchase of Erado strengthens Zix\u2019s comprehensive archiving solutions with unified archiving, supervision, security, and messaging solutions for customers that demand bundled services. Erado\u2019s long standing focus on helping its customers comply with FINRA and SEC regulations will help further strengthen Zix\u2019s offering for customers with compliance requirements. This acquisition also expands Zix\u2019s cloud-based email archiving capabilities into more than 50 content channels, including social media, instant message, mobile, web, audio, and video.\nThe purchase price includes a holdback of $2.3 million for the satisfaction of certain indemnification claims by the Company, if any, during the two-year period following the closing of the acquisition. An amount equal to $1.1 million of the holdback amount, less any amounts paid or otherwise subject to an outstanding claim for indemnification, was released to the selling shareholders upon the one year anniversary of the closing of the acquisition, and the balance of the holdback amount, if any, will be distributed to the Selling Shareholders following the two year anniversary of the closing of the acquisition.\nThe Company incurred $334 thousand in acquisition-related costs which were recorded within operating expenses during the twelve months ended December 30, 2018.\nWe accounted for the acquisition as the purchase of a business and recorded the excess purchase price as goodwill. The goodwill from this transaction is deductible for tax purposes. The intangible assets we acquired from Erado consist of trademarks, internally developed software, and customer relationships, which we are amortizing over an estimated useful life of 5 years, 10 years, and 15 years, respectively. The results of operations and the estimated fair values of the acquired assets and liabilities have been included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements since our April 2, 2018, acquisition date. Revenue from Erado was $3.7 million, and $3.8 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Revenue was $2.1 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, since the acquisition date. Due to the continued integration of the combined businesses, it was impracticable to determine the earnings.\nThe following table summarizes the estimated fair value of acquired assets and liabilities:\n(In thousands)\nEstimated Fair\nValue\nAssets:\nCurrent assets\n$\nProperty and equipment\nTrademark/names\nTechnology\n3,030\nCustomer relationships\n4,760\nGoodwill\n6,215\nTotal assets\n15,282\nLiabilities:\nDeferred revenue\n$\nOther current liabilities\nTotal liabilities\nNet assets recorded\n$\n14,380\nPro Forma Financial Information (Unaudited)\nThe following unaudited pro forma financial information presents the combined results of operations for the twelve month periods ending December 31, 2020, and 2019, respectively, as though the CloudAlly, DeliverySlip and AppRiver acquisitions that occurred during the reporting period had occurred as of the beginning of the earliest period presented, with adjustments to give effect to pro forma events that are directly attributable to the acquisition, such as amortization expense of intangible assets and acquisition-related transaction costs.
