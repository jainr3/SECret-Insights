    "item_1": "ITEM 1. BUSINESS\nOverview\nWe are a leading global provider of connected fleet and mobile asset solutions delivered as Software as a Service (\u201cSaaS\u201d). Our solutions deliver a measurable return by enabling our customers to manage, optimize and protect their investments in commercial fleets or personal vehicles. We generate actionable insights that enable a wide range of customers, from large enterprise fleets to small fleet operators and consumers, to reduce fuel and other operating costs, improve efficiency, enhance regulatory compliance, enhance driver safety, manage risk and mitigate theft. Our solutions mostly rely on our proprietary, highly scalable technology platforms, which allow us to collect, analyze and deliver information based on data from our customers\u2019 vehicles. Using an intuitive, web-based interface, dashboards or mobile apps, our fleet customers can access large volumes of real-time and historical data, monitor the location and status of their drivers and vehicles and analyze a wide number of key metrics across their fleet operations.\nWe have a large global presence, with vehicle subscriptions in over 120 countries across six continents. We currently serve a highly diverse customer base, including 4,800 fleet operators, which represented 70% of our subscription revenue for fiscal year 2021. We target sales of our enterprise fleet management solutions to customers who desire a premium solution, generally for large fleets, which we define as fleets of 50 or more vehicles. Large fleets accounted for over 86% of our fleet subscriptions at March 31, 2021. We believe we have a satisfied customer base and, among our more than 950 large fleet operator customers, we experienced an annual customer retention rate of 94% in fiscal year 2021. In addition, for large fleets with 500 or more vehicles, we experienced an annual customer retention rate in excess of 98% in fiscal year 2021. We have multinational enterprise fleet customer deployments with companies such as Baker Hughes, BP, Chevron, DHL, G4S, Halliburton, Nestl\u00e9, PepsiCo, Schlumberger, Shell, The Linde Group, Total and Weatherford. We also offer a range of subscription-based fleet and vehicle management solutions to meet the needs and price points of small fleet operators and consumers. Our safety and security features, including driver performance and vehicle monitoring, are important attributes of our solutions for these customers.\nWith the exception of fiscal year 2021, we have consistently grown our customer base. As evidence of this growth, subscribers, one of our key operating metrics and a factor influencing our rate of subscription revenue growth, increased at a compound annual growth rate of 9.5% from April 1, 2013 to March 31, 2021, and as of March 31, 2021, we tracked and managed over 744,000 subscribers. As a further indicator of our scale, in fiscal year 2021, we collected data on approximately 137 million trips per month and recorded approximately 9 billion vehicle positions per month. The monthly price charged per subscriber varies among our customers depending on the services and features they require, hardware options, customer size, route to market and geographic location of the customer. Consequently, our rate of subscription revenue growth is influenced by not only the rate of growth in the number of subscribers but also by the evolving mix of our subscriber base.\nThe worldwide spread of the COVID-19 virus and the various efforts to contain the spread resulted in a prolonged slowdown of global economic activity. In fiscal 2021, this impacted demand for a broad variety of goods and services, including from many of our customers, while also disrupting sales cycles, marketing activities and supply chains for an extended period of time. This has had an adverse impact on our sales and operations, largely affecting the consumer, passenger transport and oil and gas verticals. Conversely, as we service a broad range of clients across diverse industries, some are experiencing an increased demand from their customers. Recognizing the uncertainty of the market, we continue to proactively monitor the impact of the pandemic on all aspects of our business.\nDespite the significant reduction in vehicle movements across many industries during the government imposed \u2018lockdowns\u2019 across our various geographies, we have continued to provide our full range of solutions and premium service to many of our customers across a number of industries who continued to operate due to them being deemed essential service providers. During this pandemic, our solutions have been integral in helping these businesses enhance the quality of their services by increasing safety, efficiency and enabling optimized use of their fleets.\nIn addition, a significant portion of our employees worldwide have worked remotely for an extended period of time, and while we have gradually started to re-open facilities with appropriate social distancing and health practices when and as permitted by local governmental authorities, we are allowing some employees to work from home for the foreseeable future.\nIndustry Overview\nChallenges Facing Fleet Operators Worldwide\nFleet managers operate in an increasingly competitive and highly regulated global environment. Timely and accurate decision-making enabled by solutions that provide real-time visibility into vehicle location and driver performance is critical to managing a safe, efficient fleet. In some developing areas of the world, ensuring driver and vehicle safety and security is also particularly challenging given high crime rates, which have resulted in automotive insurance mandates and regulatory requirements for vehicle tracking. Consequently, fleet managers and consumers demand solutions that promote driver and passenger safety, mitigate risk, drive operational efficiencies, improve security and reduce automotive insurance costs. The business environment for fleet managers is further complicated by the large number of transportation-related regulatory and compliance requirements worldwide, and the frequency with which rules and regulations change.\nLegacy fleet management solutions inadequately address industry needs as many businesses use discrete manual processes, such as spreadsheet and paper-based systems and telephones, to monitor vehicle and driver activity. These approaches are labor intensive, prone to error, do not provide continuous monitoring of fleets, make it difficult to optimize fleet utilization, manage operating costs and generate minimal business intelligence. Additionally, legacy fleet management technology frequently provides limited functionality beyond basic location-based tracking and makes it difficult for fleet operators to fully benefit from the cost savings and efficiency improvements associated with more robust fleet management offerings.\nFleet operators face many significant challenges, which can include:\n\u2022Significant operating costs. Fuel spend represents a significant cost for fleet operators. For example, the American Transportation Research Institute estimates that fuel and oil, driver wages and benefits, repair and maintenance and truck insurance premium costs collectively represented approximately 79% of total trucking operational costs per mile in 2019. Certain driving behaviors, such as speeding, harsh acceleration, harsh braking and excessive idling contribute to poor fuel efficiency as well as increased wear and tear and maintenance costs.\n\u2022Poor visibility into fleet operations. Fleet operators frequently maintain vehicles across multiple geographic regions and often lack visibility into their fleets and oversight of their drivers. Poor fleet visibility makes it challenging to optimize fleet utilization, vehicle fleet size and miles driven while still meeting core business and customer servicing requirements. Poor driver oversight makes it difficult for operators to validate hours worked or customers visited, incentivize greater efficiency and discourage unproductive, undesirable or dangerous worker behavior.\n\u2022Challenges in maintaining regulatory compliance. Internal compliance and reporting is driven by legislative and regulatory requirements, which are often subject to change, from regulatory authorities in nearly every jurisdiction globally. This can be particularly burdensome for fleet operators managing large vehicle fleets in multiple jurisdictions. For example, in the United States, fleet operators can face numerous complex regulatory requirements, including mandatory hours of service compliance and fuel tax reporting and more recently electronic logging devices (\u201cELD\u201d) legislation that requires truck drivers to log their hours of service electronically.\n\u2022Challenges in managing risk. Fleet operators are responsible for hiring, training and identifying risks associated with their drivers. Vehicle crashes are a leading cause of workplace injury and lead to significant costs for fleet operators, including financial liability and increased insurance premiums. Fleet operators need visibility into driving behavior to proactively identify and remediate drivers with poor driving habits.\n\u2022Inefficient data management. Fleet operators receive operational information from many disparate sources, including communications from their technicians and customers, paper-based reports, third-party receipts for items such as fuel purchases, vehicle maintenance logs and customer invoices. While simply collecting this unstructured data is burdensome, organizing and analyzing the data to identify trends and other actionable business intelligence can be even more challenging.\nChallenges Facing Fleet Operators and Consumers in Developing Markets\nIn certain developing regions of the world, driver safety and vehicle security are significant concerns given high crime rates and the impact these higher crime rates have on consumers, insurance costs and regulatory requirements. More specifically, fleet operators and consumers often need to address challenges including:\n\u2022Managing the impact of crime. Vehicle crime rates in developing regions of the world often far exceed those in the United States and Western Europe, resulting in potentially significant costs for fleet operators and consumers. For example, we estimate that the rate of vehicle theft in South Africa is more than double than that in the United States.\n\u2022Reducing insurance costs. In developed and developing regions, insurers often provide incentives for fleet operators and consumers who subscribe to a safety and security mobile asset management solution. Some insurance providers will not insure vehicles that lack a tracking solution, or will make the insurance premium cost prohibitive without one. Furthermore, insurance provider interest in safety and security solutions has increased following the introduction of driver performance monitoring solutions, which can enable innovative usage-based insurance and claims management initiatives.\n\u2022Complying with regulatory mandates. The growing introduction of stringent occupational health and safety legislation in developing markets is adding pressure to fleet operators, who need to fulfill their duty of care while also complying with laws regulating driving hours, rest time, fuel taxes, etc.\nIndustry Trends\nThere have been substantial advances in the capabilities, reliability and affordability of technologies that can be used to cost-effectively collect and disseminate large amounts of vehicle data and video footage. GPS positioning and advanced on-board systems generate valuable, objective real-time information, which provides the basis for driver and vehicle management solutions. Similarly, significant advances in the performance, reliability and affordability of fixed and wireless networks, computing power and data storage capabilities have supported the rise of cloud computing that enables the delivery of SaaS. These technological advances and market shifts have helped to foster demand for subscription-based fleet and mobile asset management solutions like ours.\nWhile fleet and mobile asset management solutions can offer a wide range of features and benefits, the reasons for adopting these solutions often vary by customer type and geography. In developed regions, including North America and Western Europe, many fleet operators adopt fleet management software solutions in order to obtain greater visibility over their vehicles and mobile workforces, to achieve cost savings through efficiency improvements, including reduced fuel consumption, and to reduce regulatory compliance burdens. In many developing regions, including Eastern Europe, Latin America, Africa, the Middle East and parts of Asia, the security of personnel and asset protection features afforded by vehicle tracking and monitoring, resulting in greater asset visibility and a lower impact of theft, are also important reasons for the adoption of fleet and mobile asset management solutions. In Australia and parts of Africa, Asia, Europe and the Middle East, compliance with health and safety standards and policies are a key reason for adoption of these systems. Recognizing the variety of motivations influencing our existing and potential customers is an important aspect of developing and marketing our solutions.\nGlobal and multinational companies are increasingly looking to consolidate their fleet management systems by moving to providers that have global reach. This is primarily driven by the desire to have a secure centralized view across their fleets and impose set global standards specifically relating to driver management and safety. These companies also recognize the advantages of gathering vast quantities of data to draw new insights into their global fleet operations.\nMarket Opportunity\nWe believe that the addressable market for our fleet management solutions is large, growing and under-penetrated. According to a report by ABI Research (\u201cABI\u201d), there were approximately 225 million commercial vehicles registered globally by the end of December 2020. Global fleet management penetration was estimated to be around 18.6%. ABI forecasts that by 2026, the number of registered commercial vehicles will be approximately 304 million.\nIn addition to the growing market opportunity in commercial fleet vehicles, we believe there is a large and under-penetrated market to provide a tailored set of safety and security solutions to non-commercial passenger vehicles. Worldwide, the pool of motor vehicles is large and growing, particularly in developing markets. We estimate that there are approximately 7.8 million non-commercial passenger vehicles in operation in South Africa, as of August 2020, utilizing latest vehicle\npopulation information available from the National Traffic Information Systems. We believe the potential rate of consumer adoption of mobile asset management solutions is highest in developing regions where vehicle tracking and monitoring features can help to improve driver and passenger safety, reduce the impact of theft by improving stolen vehicle recovery rates and reduce consumer automotive insurance rates.\nOur Solutions\nOur subscription-based solutions enable our customers to manage, optimize and protect their investments in their commercial fleets and personal vehicles efficiently. Our highly scalable multi-tenant architecture leverages GPS and other data transmitted from in-vehicle devices, primarily over cellular networks.

Our distribution partners include automobile dealers, aftermarket automotive parts and service suppliers, automobile insurers and retailers. We believe our indirect distribution strategy for the small fleet operator and consumer markets provides us with a differentiated, cost-effective customer acquisition and sales model.\nOur global network of independent dealers and distributors is an important component of our sales strategy. Our dealers and distributors account for a substantial percentage of our total sales, and sales generated by certain dealers and distributors individually represent a meaningful percentage of our revenue. The terms of our agreements with our dealers do not usually include minimum purchase obligations, are specific to a geographic territory and are primarily non-exclusive. They generally have a fixed initial term, after which they may be renewed or continue indefinitely if not terminated. This is subject to the right of either party to terminate on specified notice generally ranging from 90 days to one year, or for breach. Similarly, our distributor agreements do not include minimum purchase obligations and consist principally of a commission agreement applicable to sales generated by the distributor.\nOur revenue by geographic segment is set out in note 13 of the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report.\nCustomers\nWe currently serve a highly diverse customer base, including approximately 4,800 fleet operators which represented 70% of our subscription revenue for fiscal year 2021, as well as individual consumers. We target sales of our enterprise fleet management solutions to customers who desire a premium solution, generally for large fleets, which we define as being fleets of 50 or more vehicles. Large fleets comprised 86% of our fleet customer subscriptions as of March 31, 2021. We also offer a range of subscription-based fleet and mobile asset management solutions optimized for the needs and price points demanded by small fleet operators and consumers.\nOur current customer base spans numerous industry categories and customer segments, including oil and gas, transportation and logistics, government and municipal, bus and coach, and rental and leasing. No individual customer represented more than 7.0% of our subscription revenues for fiscal year 2021. For fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, our top 10 fleet customers represented 21.8%, 23.7%, and 24.9%, respectively, of our total subscription revenue.\nThe following is a representative list of some of our largest customers:\n\u2022Baker Hughes\n\u2022Barloworld\n\u2022Basic Energy\n\u2022Bidvest Group\n\u2022Chevron\n\u2022DHL\n\u2022Eskom\n\u2022G4S\n\u2022Halliburton\n\u2022Imperial\n\u2022Schlumberger\n\u2022Super Group\n\u2022Total\n\u2022Unitrans\nWe believe that we have a satisfied customer base as evidenced by our customer retention rate and the favorable results of our customer surveys. In fiscal year 2021, among our more than 950 large fleet operator customers, we experienced an annual customer retention rate of 94%. We maintain a strong focus on monitoring and continuously enhancing our customer satisfaction levels.\nService and Support\nInstallation of our solutions in our customers\u2019 vehicles is generally provided by us or our third-party network, which includes dealers and distributors and installation partners. Customer care and technical support services are provided by our offices in Australia, Brazil, South Africa, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, Thailand, Romania and the United States. In many cases, our dealers and distributors also provide customers with tier-one customer support services. Our regional offices and dealers and distributors are, in turn, supported by our central technical support team in South Africa that handles any escalated issues. Existing customers can also access customer and technical support directly through our web or mobile applications. Our technical support department is composed of a team of highly skilled staff who are familiar with all of our products, including our entire range of software and service solutions as well as our hardware. The MiX Learning Centre is used by staff and customers around the world to undertake online training to learn about new products and enhancements.\nWe offer warranties of varying duration on our products. Product warranties are predominantly for a one-year period but periods of up to three years are provided in certain geographic locations. Our Beam-e product carries a lifetime warranty (to the extent that the unit remains in the vehicle into which it was installed for the original subscriber). Warranty expenses are not a significant portion of our total costs.\nResearch and Development\nAs of March 31, 2021, our development group consists of 132 full-time staff responsible for software, hardware and firmware development and quality assurance. Our primary development group is based in Stellenbosch, South Africa, and we have additional development resources in Johannesburg, South Africa, as well as the United States. Our software development teams employ an agile development methodology, while our engineering teams use traditional waterfall project management methods. During fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, we invested $7.2 million, $8.8 million and $9.6 million, respectively, in research and development.\nOur investment in development is core to our business strategy. Our research and development efforts principally involve software development, firmware development, hardware design and related test equipment. In addition, we have enhanced certain of our hardware components to extend their functionality and reduce component and manufacturing costs.\nWe have been successful in expanding our product offerings over time through internal development and select acquisitions. Highlights from the fiscal year 2021 include:\n\u202274 software releases were deployed to the live environments including 18 system-wide releases and 40 mobile app updates;\n\u2022The completion of a large scale migration of all premium fleet customers to a new back-end database system to reduce costs while supporting scalability and growth;\n\u2022Updates for our hardware platforms: MiX2000, MiX4000 & MiX6000;\n\u2022Major software updates for MiX Rovi in-cab display, MiX Hours of Service, MyMiX mobile app, MiX Integrate and MiX Fleet Manager;\n\u2022Integration with telematics services provided by Original Equipment Manufacturers (truck makers) including Scania and Navistar; and\n\u2022Launch of Fringe Benefit Tax solution for Australia.\nOur Research and Development business is ISO 9001 certified with a formalized quality policy and consistent monitoring of internal processes, supplier and solution performance. We outsource all hardware manufacturing to third parties.\nTechnology\nOur solutions are offered using a multi-tenant SaaS architecture that scales rapidly to support additional new subscribers through the addition of incremental data processing and storage capacity. This architecture flexibility allows us to sustain high levels of uptime without degradation of system performance, despite significant subscriber growth. Our existing architecture and infrastructure has been designed with sufficient capacity to meet our current and anticipated future needs. Our\nsubscription-based fleet and consumer service offerings are designed to be accessible via a standard web browser or mobile device application.\nOur solutions typically include a proprietary in-vehicle device that incorporates off-the-shelf components, generally including a cellular modem, GPS receiver and memory capacity sufficient to run our firmware, which gathers vehicle location, time, speed, ignition status, miles driven and various vehicle and driver statistics. This information is collected at a predefined frequency and then sent to our receivers at secure third-party data centers, generally via a commercial cellular network. The information is then processed and delivered to our customers through our web-based and mobile device applications. Our solutions enable our fleet customers to access large volumes of historical and real-time data, monitor the location and status of their fleet vehicles and drivers, view a wide selection of reports and key performance indicator dashboards and generate valuable, actionable business intelligence.\nWe store data, host our solutions and serve all of our customers from third-party data centers located in Algiers in Algeria, Sydney in Australia, Muscat in Oman, Dublin in Ireland, Dubai in the United Arab Emirates and Virginia in the United States. In addition to data hosted at third party data centers, we have transitioned the vast majority of our data to cloud-based hosting service platforms such as AWS and Azure. Our data management facilities provide us with both physical security, including manned security, biometric access controls and systems security, including firewalls, encryption, redundant power and environmental controls. We believe that our third-party hosting facilities are adequate for our current needs and that suitable additional capacity will be available as needed to accommodate planned expansion of our operations.\nIntellectual Property\nWe rely primarily on trade secret laws, confidentiality agreements, confidentiality procedures and contractual restrictions to establish and protect our intellectual property rights. We also rely to a limited extent on patent, trademark and copyright law. A patent covering certain aspects of our Beam-e product was issued in South Africa during fiscal year 2014 and a patent covering a method for driver verification was issued during fiscal year 2015. A further patent for an asset tracking system and method was issued in Brazil on May 4, 2021.\nWe typically enter into non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with our employees, licensees and independent consultants and other advisors. We also seek these protective agreements from some of our suppliers and subcontractors who have access to sensitive information regarding our intellectual property.\nCompetition\nThe rapidly evolving market for our solutions is competitive and highly fragmented, particularly by geography and customer segment. We currently compete with numerous providers of fleet and mobile asset management solutions that range from small, regional providers to midsized multinational providers, such as Teletrac Navman and Geotab, to large global providers, such as Trimble, Omnitracs and Samsara. While we currently only compete with Trimble and Omnitracs on a limited basis, these two competitors are well established companies with significantly greater financial and other resources than we have. Many of our competitors offer fleet or mobile asset management software solutions to particular industry segments or in limited geographic regions. For example, we compete with Webfleet and Michelin (Masternaut) in Europe, we compete with FMS-Tech for oil and gas fleet opportunities in the Middle East, and we compete with Netstar and Ctrack by Inseego, Tracker and Cartrack for consumer and small fleet mobile asset management deployments in South Africa, respectively.\nWe believe the principal competitive factors in our market include the following:\n\u2022functionality and reliability;\n\u2022total cost of ownership;\n\u2022breadth and depth of application functionality for fleet deployments;\n\u2022product performance;\n\u2022interoperability;\n\u2022brand and reputation;\n\u2022customer service;\n\u2022distribution channels, including a global footprint and the ability to service multinationals;\n\u2022regional geographic expertise including localized language support and support for applicable government regulations;\n\u2022size of customer base and reference accounts within key industry segments;\n\u2022ability to deliver ongoing value and return on investment;\n\u2022ease of deployment and ease of use;\n\u2022relevant industry domain expertise and functionality; and\n\u2022the financial resources of the vendor.\nWe believe that we compete favorably on the basis of these factors.\nEmployees\nThe following table presents the breakdown of our employees at the date indicated:\nAs of March 31,\n2019 2020 2021\nSouth Africa 853 860 811\nUnited States 71 79 69\nUnited Kingdom 56 57 53\nUnited Arab Emirates 26 29 21\nAustralia 37 39 39\nBrazil 23 27 26\nUganda 4 4 4\nRomania 5 5 5\nThailand 3 3 3\nTotal 1078 1103 1031\nFull-time 989 1035 946\nPart-time 89 68 85\nTotal 1078 1103 1031\nGovernment Regulation\nWe are subject to laws and regulations relating to our business operations, including laws applicable to providers of Internet and mobile services both domestically and internationally, as we collect data, including personal data, disseminate data and, in some cases, sell data. The application of existing domestic and international laws and regulations relating to issues such as user privacy and data protection, marketing, advertising, inadvertent disclosure and consumer protection in many instances is unclear or unsettled.\nThe transmission of data over the Internet and cellular networks is a critical component of our SaaS business model. Additionally, as cloud computing continues to evolve, increased regulation by federal, state or foreign agencies becomes more likely, particularly in the areas of data privacy and data security. In particular, the dynamic regulatory environment in the European Union and the United Kingdom, made more uncertain due to Brexit, is resulting in additional and increasingly complex regulation in these areas and we believe that the similarly dynamic regulatory environment of the United States, will follow suit. New laws governing data privacy and data security will furthermore be enacted in many other regions. Laws governing the solicitation, collection, processing or use of data could impair our ability to manage and report on customer data, which is integral to the delivery of our SaaS solutions. Increased regulation and the expansion of our business and operations globally have required us to devote legal and other resources to address this regulation. We continuously update and will continue to evaluate our group data protection and security policies, charters and procedures, to assist in maintaining data privacy and data security in line with international practices.\nData privacy regulations and applicable laws in the United States, the European Union or elsewhere will regulate our ability to use the data we gather from our customers and increase the cost of doing business and could result in claims being brought by our customers or third parties. As discussed below, South Africa, which is currently our largest market, has its own data protection and security law which will be in force from July 1, 2021.\nSouth African Regulatory Environment\nThe Protection of Personal Information Act, No. 4 of 2013 (the \u201cPOPI Act\u201d) was promulgated into law in November 2013 in South Africa. Certain sections of the POPI Act came into effect on April 11, 2014. The majority of the remaining sections (especially the sections that create compliance requirements) came into effect on July 1, 2020. The POPI Act allows for a one-year transition period from its commencement for all persons to comply with its requirements, being until June 30, 2021. The last remaining sections, and thus the full POPI Act, will come into effect on July 1, 2021. We have evaluated the potential impact of the POPI Act, taking into account our existing and planned privacy and data security practices and procedures. We expect that the POPI Act\u2019s implementation will have an impact on our data security and business costs, practices and procedures in South Africa. We are, with the assistance of a third party project specialist, in the final stages of our POPI Act implementation and compliance project.\nA number of existing South African statutes regulate electronic communications, including the Electronic Communications Act, No. 36 of 2005 as amended, and the Electronic Communications and Transactions Act, No. 25 of 2002, which apply to a number of aspects of our business. These statutes regulate the generation, communication, production, processing, sending, receiving, recording, retaining, storing, displaying and use of any information, document or signature by or in electronic form.\nThe Private Security Industry Regulation Act, No. 56 of 2001 (the \u201cPSIRA Act\u201d) also applies to our South African business and governs the vehicle recovery industry in South Africa. The PSIRA Act was enacted for the purposes of, for example: (i) the achievement and maintenance of a trustworthy and legitimate private security industry which acts in terms of the principles contained in the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, Act No. 108 of 1996, and other applicable law, and is aimed at ensuring that there is greater safety and security in the country and; (ii) to regulate the private security industry and to exercise effective control over the practice of the occupation of security service providers in the public and national interest and the interest of the private security industry itself.\nBroad-Based Black Economic Empowerment\nThe South African government established a legislative framework for the promotion of Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment (\u201cB-BBEE\u201d). Achievement of B-BBEE objectives is measured by a scorecard which establishes a weighting for the various components of B-BBEE which relates to Ownership, Management Control, Skills Development, Enterprise and Supplier Development and Socio-Economic Development. The B-BBEE codes have a continuous review process which resulted in new B-BBEE Codes coming into effect on May 1, 2015, with more onerous compliance requirements, and proposed amendments. In addition, 2018 was a very active year in terms of additional proposed and actual changes to the Revised Codes of Good Practice (\u201cRCoGP\u201d) which were published by the DTI for public comment. In March 2018 the DTI gazetted the Youth Employment Service (\u201cY.E.S\u201d) initiative as well as proposals on some changes to the Skills Development scorecard. The Y.E.S. Initiative was promulgated on August 28, 2018 by Minister Dr. Rob Davies and amongst others provide opportunities to corporates to improve their B-BBEE contributor level by virtue of participation in the Y.E.S. Initiative. Amendments to the RCoGP were also signed by the Minister of Trade and Industry on May 31, 2019 for implementation on December 1, 2019. These have an impact on the Skills Development and Enterprise and Supplier Development (including Preferential Procurement) pillars. In addition, some definitions and interpretations were further clarified and a few General Principles amended. MiX Telematics for one had to adjust its bursary program to ensure alignment with the amendments and invest significantly more towards tertiary studies of Black students.\nIt is important for us to achieve applicable B-BBEE objectives to ensure sustainability and contribute towards the realization of the National Development Plan 2030. In addition, B-BBEE objectives are pursued, in significant part, by requiring parties who contract with corporate, governmental and State Owned Enterprises in South Africa to achieve B-BBEE compliance through satisfaction of an applicable scorecard. Parties improve their B-BBEE contributor level when contracting with businesses that have earned good B-BBEE contributor levels in relation to their scorecards. In 2019 the Minister of Labor also declared his intention to promulgate Section 53 of the Employment Equity Act (\u201cEE Act\u201d) which means that every employer that makes an offer to conclude an agreement with any Organ of State for the furnishing of supplies or services to that Organ of State must comply to certain chapters of the EE Act and attach to the offer either a certificate proving compliance with the relevant Chapters of the EE Act; or a declaration by the employer that it complies with the relevant Chapters of the EE Act which when verified by the Director-General is conclusive evidence of compliance.\nWe have three material end-customers, which require MiX Telematics Enterprise SA Proprietary Limited to maintain at least a B-BBEE contributor level 3 as measured under the new B-BBEE Codes in addition to at least one requiring additional commitments in terms of Skills Development and Sub-Contracting of at least 30% of the contract value to a Small Black\nOwned Supplier. The value of these contracts represented 2.7% of our total revenue for fiscal year 2021. MiX Telematics Enterprise SA Proprietary Limited has attained the agreed compliance targets in fiscal year 2021 and furthermore improved not only their position on the scorecard to the highest level possible but also its Black ownership in particular that of Black Women following the conclusion of the sales of assets (properties) as allowed for in the B-BBEE Codes. Failing to achieve applicable B-BBEE objectives could jeopardize our ability to maintain existing business or to secure future business from corporate, governmental or State Owned Enterprises that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nU.S. Regulatory Environment\nIn addition to its regulation of Internet and, by extension, many SaaS providers, the Federal Trade Commission (\u201cFTC\u201d), has been asked by consumer groups to identify practices that may compromise privacy and consumer welfare; examine opt-in procedures to ensure consumers are aware of the type of data being collected and how it will be used; and create policies to halt abusive practices. The FTC has expressed interest in particular in the mobile environment and services that collect sensitive data, such as location-based information, which could conceivably be expanded to include transceiver products such as our in-vehicle devices. Although much of the FTC\u2019s focus is on consumer protection, to the extent that our clients use our systems to monitor employee movement, the FTC may assert jurisdiction. In addition to FTC scrutiny on the consumer side, many fleet drivers in the U.S. may belong to a union, which triggers some degree of oversight from the National Labor Relations Board (\u201cNLRB\u201d). The NLRB has taken increasing notice of the privacy rights on unionized employees, and future NLRB rules could affect our business model or the way in which our corporate clients use our solutions.\nOur business is affected by U.S. federal and state laws and regulations governing the collection, use, retention, sharing and security of data that we receive from and about our users. In recent years, regulation has focused on the collection, use, processing, disclosure and security of information that may be used to identify or is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer, such as a name, address, email address, geolocation, biometric information, and/or professional or employment-related information (\u201cpersonal information\u201d or \u201cpersonal data\u201d). While several states are considering new privacy legislation, California was the first state to enact its own privacy law, the California Consumer Privacy Act (the \u201cCCPA\u201d), which took effect on January 1, 2020. The CCPA is applicable to certain businesses that collect personal information about California residents, requiring businesses to provide privacy notices to individuals and enhanced consumer rights (e.g., consumers may request deletion of, access to, or a copy of their personal information, as well as opt-out of the sale of their personal information). However, the CCPA carves out a B2B exemption so that most of its requirements do not apply to the personal information of employees or applicants held by the employing entity and used only to administer the employment relationship or applicant process; currently, the B2B exemption expires on January 1, 2023. The CCPA also creates a private right of action and statutory damages of $100-750 per violation in the event of data breach of unencrypted or \u201cun-redacted\u201d personal information, if the company does not have \u201creasonable\u201d security. In addition, the California Attorney General has enforcement power and may issue penalties of up to $2,500 ($7,500 if intentional) per violation.\nThe California Privacy Rights Act (the \u201cCPRA\u201d), which amends the CCPA, will take effect on January 1, 2023. Most notably, under the CPRA, the definition of \u201cpersonal information\u201d is expanded to include \u201csensitive personal information\u201d which includes government identifiers, account and login information, precise geolocation data, racial or ethnic origin, religious or philosophical beliefs, union membership, contents of mail, email and text messages, genetic data, and certain sexual orientation, health and biometric information. If collected, certain notices and choices to limit the use of sensitive personal information must be provided to consumers.\nVirginia became the second state to enact its own privacy law, the Virginia Consumer Protection Act (the \u201cVCDPA\u201d) which will become effective on January 1, 2023. The VCDPA is applicable to certain businesses that collect personal data about Virginia residents, requiring businesses to provide privacy notices to individuals and enhanced consumer rights (e.g., consumers may request confirmation that their personal data is processed and opt out of targeted ads, sales of their personal data, and profiling, as well as request correction of, deletion of, and a copy of their personal data.) The definition of \u201cpersonal data\u201d also includes \u201csensitive data\u201d which includes precise geolocation data. If collected, businesses must obtain prior consent to process a consumer\u2019s sensitive data. While there is no private right of action under the VCDPA, the Virginia Attorney General may issue fines for the failure to cure a violation after notice of up to $7,500 per violation.\nThese state privacy laws may apply to mobile and Internet advertising privacy practices, depending on whether or not there is a sale or sharing of personal information pursuant to these laws. In addition, the FTC has conducted numerous discussions on this subject and suggested that more rigorous privacy regulation is appropriate, possibly including regulation of non-personally identifiable information which could, with other information, be used to identify an individual. The commercial\nuse of our mobile technology may reduce exposure to FTC regulation and enforcement, but geo-location and similar services are receiving increased regulatory interest and as such may affect how we conduct our business in the future.\nCalifornia was the first state to enact an Internet of Things (IoT) cybersecurity law, which took effect on January 1, 2020. The law requires manufacturers of any internet-connected devices to equip them with \u201creasonable\u201d security features that are: appropriate for the nature and function of the device; appropriate for the information it may collect, contain, or transmit; and designed to protect the device and any information contained within the device from unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification or disclosure. While there is no private right of action, this law may subject us to potential governmental enforcement actions for noncompliance.\nFinally, we use GPS satellites to obtain location data for our in-vehicle devices. The satellites and their ground control and monitoring stations are maintained and operated by the U.S. Department of Defense, which does not currently impose regulations on the ability to access location data. We cannot assure that it will not do so in the future. Any regulatory hurdles could impede the functionality and/or cost of our solutions, which could adversely affect our business. The communication systems that we use to host and transmit data may be subject to security incidents, which may also subject the Company to regulatory enforcement and client pressures.\nEuropean Union Regulatory Environment\nWe are subject to regulation under the laws of the European Union. Of particular relevance with regard to the regulation of our solutions are matters of data protection and privacy. More broadly, any processing of personal data in the course of the provision of services is governed by the European Union data protection regime. The framework legislation at a European Union level in respect of data protection, Directive 95/46/EC, was superseded by the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (\u201cGDPR\u201d), effective May 25, 2018. In addition, local State data protection and privacy laws apply as well. Some of these place obligations additional to the GDPR on organizations operating in the European Union, such as express suppression of positioning and speeding data when vehicles are used for private trips. The GDPR creates a single legal framework that applies across all EU member states, and in some circumstances, to processors in a state outside of the European Union where this activity affected EU citizens. The GDPR has compliance obligations for data controllers and data processors (we regard our solutions as falling within the processor obligations, on behalf of our customers, the controller). National Data Protection Authorities (\u201cNDPAs\u201d) are able to impose fines for violations ranging from 2% to 4% of annual worldwide turnover, or 10 million to 20 million Euro, whichever is greater. NDPAs have the power to carry out audits, request information, obtain access to premises and compel implementation of specific business practices where there are compliance concerns and risks. Data Controllers must be able to demonstrate that the personal data of any data subject can be lawfully processed on one of the six specified grounds, and flow down compliance obligations onto a processor.\nThe GDPR adopts a risk-based approach to compliance, under which controllers and processors bear responsibility for assessing the degree of risk that their processing activities pose to data subjects. A Controller may be required to perform data protection impact assessments before any processing that uses new technology and is likely to result in a high risk to data subjects. The GDPR requires controllers and processors to maintain records of their processing activities, and deal with a data security breach in a specific manner. Under the GDPR, data subjects have specific rights in certain circumstances, for example, the right to request that businesses delete their personal data (the right to be forgotten); to object to their personal data being processed; and to obtain a copy of their personal data within a set time frame.\nData flows within the European Union are not restricted, but some data out flows from the European Union are subject to restrictions to ensure an adequate protection for EU citizen\u2019s personal data.\nUnited Kingdom Regulatory Environment\nAs a result of its departure from the European Union, the United Kingdom is no longer subject to the EU GDPR framework. In the United Kingdom, data protection is governed by the Data Protection Act 2018 and the UK GDPR (which adopts the EU GDPR and procedures as at December 31, 2020 only) into UK law. At present, the United Kingdom and European Union regimes are similar. The UK framework places equivalent obligations on controllers and processors to those set out in the EU GDPR, including obligations on controllers to ensure lawful grounds for processing data, adequate security measures are in place to secure it, and equivalent rights are available to UK citizens to protect their personal data.\nCross-border Data Flows between the United Kingdom and the European Union\nAs a non-EU member state, the United Kingdom falls outside the free-data flow area between EU member states.\nThe UK Information Commissioner (as regulator instead of NDPAs) has recognized data transfers from the United Kingdom into the European Union as lawful, on the grounds that the EU GDPR offers \u201cadequate and equivalent protection\u201d for personal data. The European Union has established a temporary \u201cadequacy bridge\u201d (set out in the UK-EU Trade and Cooperation Agreement 2020) to enable the continuation of data flows on an interim basis from the European Union to the United Kingdom, pending a formal decision from the European Union to accept the adequacy of the United Kingdom data protection regime post-brexit. This acceptance is anticipated to be approved during 2021. In the event that the adequacy is not approved, standard contract clauses can be implemented to manage transfers without significant disruption to compliance.\nAustralian Regulatory Environment\nThe Australian Privacy Principles contained in the Privacy Act of 1988 (the \u201cPrivacy Act\u201d) regulate the collection, use, retention, disclosure and security of personal information. Personal information is defined as \u201cinformation or an opinion about an identified individual, or an individual who is reasonably identifiable, whether the information or opinion is true or not or is recorded in a material form or not\u201d. Personal information includes location-based information where the information enables the location of an individual to be ascertained. Australian privacy laws in general prohibit the transfer of personal information outside Australia unless an exemption applies, such as the individual to whom the information relates has consented to the transfer. In some circumstances, the disclosure will be permissible if there is a data transfer agreement in place between the transferor and the transferee under which the transferee agrees to handle the information in accordance with the Australian Privacy Principles. Subject to a few exemptions, the Australian Privacy Principles require the transferor to take such steps as are reasonable in the circumstances to ensure that an overseas recipient does not breach the Australian Privacy Principles and the transferor may be held responsible for any breaches of Australian privacy laws when personal information is transferred outside Australia, regardless of whether there is a data transfer agreement in place.\nThe Notifiable Data Breach (\u201cNDB\u201d) scheme requires companies to notify individuals whose personal information is involved in a data breach that is likely to result in serious harm and includes recommendations about steps individuals should take in response to the breach.\nHistory and development of the company\nMiX Telematics Limited is a public company incorporated in the Republic of South Africa. Our principal executive office is located at 750 Park of Commerce Blvd., Suite 100, Boca Raton, Florida 33487. Our telephone number is +1-877-585-1088, and our web address is www.mixtelematics.com. We are regarded as being primary listed on the JSE and categorized as a domestic filer with regard to our ADSs on the NYSE.\nWe were founded in 1996 in Johannesburg, South Africa as Matrix Vehicle Tracking Proprietary Limited, and since that time, we have grown both organically and through acquisitions. Matrix Vehicle Tracking Proprietary Limited was renamed TeliMatrix Proprietary Limited in 2001, TeliMatrix Limited in 2007 and finally MiX Telematics Limited in 2008, subsequent to our listing on the JSE.\nIn 2007, we acquired Control Instruments OmniBridge Proprietary Limited and certain affiliated entities (collectively, \u201cOmniBridge\u201d), which provided fleet management services in both the South African and international markets. In November 2007, we listed our shares on the JSE, in order to facilitate the OmniBridge acquisition. In 2008, we acquired Tripmaster Corporation, located in the United States, Safe Drive (including Safe Drive International Proprietary Limited), located in Australia and Safe Drive FZE, located in the United Arab Emirates. These acquisitions extended our geographic reach, broadened our customer relationships and expanded our driver safety and training solution offerings. In May 2012, we acquired Intellichain, located in South Africa, as part of our strategy to broaden our transportation management software functionality. On August 9, 2013, following a successful United States IPO, the Company\u2019s ADSs were listed on the NYSE and are traded under the symbol MIXT. In December 2013, we acquired a proprietary software development business from Roitech Proprietary Limited, located in South Africa. The acquisition enhanced and broadened our fleet management smart phone application offerings. On November 1, 2014, we acquired the operating business of Compass Fleet Management (\u201cCompass\u201d), a South Africa based provider of specialized fleet management solutions in Southern Africa, that are delivered using the Company\u2019s hardware and software platforms. These specialized fleet management solutions complement the Company\u2019s existing fleet management solutions, and the acquisition broadens the array of services offered to current and future fleet management customers.\nWe currently have offices in South Africa, the United Kingdom, the United States, Uganda, Brazil, Australia, Romania, Thailand and the United Arab Emirates as well as a network of more than 130 fleet partners worldwide.\nOur agent for service of process in the United States is MiX Telematics North America, Inc., 750 Park of Commerce Blvd., Suite 100, Boca Raton, Florida 33487.\nFor further information on our principal investments and capital expenditures, see \u201cItem 7.

    "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nImportant factors that could cause actual financial, business or operating results to differ materially from expectations are disclosed in this annual report, including without limitation, the following risk factors. In addition to the risks listed below, we may be subject to other material risks that, as of the date of this report, are not currently known to us or that we deem immaterial at this time.\nSUMMARY OF RISK FACTORS\nOur business is subject to a number of risks, including risks that may prevent us from achieving our business objectives or may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, and future prospects. The following is a summary of the principal risks that should be considered before investing in our securities. The list below is not exhaustive, and investors should read this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section in full. These and other risk are described in more detail in this Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nRisks related to Our Business\n\u2022We may be unable to maintain our relationships with our existing customers, which could result in a loss of subscription revenue.\n\u2022The extent to which the coronavirus (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) outbreak and measures taken in response thereto impact our business, results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and are difficult to predict.\n\u2022Any inability to adapt to rapid technological change in our industry could impair our ability to remain competitive and result in a decline in market acceptance of our products.\n\u2022Industry consolidation may result in increased competition, which could result in a loss of customers and/or a reduction in revenue.\n\u2022The loss of one or more of our key personnel, or our failure to attract, train and retain other highly qualified personnel, could prevent us from executing our growth plan.\n\u2022We may expand by acquiring or investing in other companies, which may divert our management\u2019s attention, result in dilution to our shareholders and consume resources that are necessary to sustain our business.\n\u2022We may not be able to increase sales of our solutions, which could materially and adversely affect our ability to grow our business and increase revenue.\n\u2022We depend on certain key suppliers and vendors to manufacture our hardware, and an interruption in the supply of our hardware could impair our production capacity, which would impact our ability to supply hardware to customers.\n\u2022We depend on our network of dealers and distributors to sell our solutions and adverse changes in our relationships with significant dealers and distributors could cause a decline in sales.\n\u2022We depend on our cellular network providers for the transmission of data from installed in-vehicle devices to our data centers and we would incur significant costs if the services of these network providers became unavailable to us.\n\u2022Failure of businesses to adopt fleet management solutions could reduce the demand for our solutions.\n\u2022Changes in practices of insurance companies in the markets in which we provide our solutions could materially and adversely affect demand for products and services.\n\u2022Security or privacy breaches in our electronic transactions, data and asset tracking sensors may expose us to additional liability or result in a loss of customers, either of which events could harm our business.\n\u2022We are subject to U.S. and other anti-corruption laws, trade controls, economic sanctions and similar laws and regulations, including those in the jurisdictions where we operate. Our failure to comply with these laws and regulations could subject us to civil, criminal and administrative penalties and harm our reputation.\n\u2022Laws and regulations relating to the Internet and data privacy in the markets in which we operate are complex and continuously evolving, and compliance costs are high. As these laws and regulations continue to evolve, we may be required to increase our compliance-related expenditures or limit the manner in which we collect information, the types of information that we collect, or the solutions that we offer, which may impede our ability to provide our solutions or may reduce our profit margins in specific geographic regions.\n\u2022We may be exposed to risks related to litigation and administrative proceedings that could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks related to Intellectual Property\n\u2022We have not traditionally relied on patents to protect our intellectual property, and we rely on trade secrecy laws, confidentiality agreements, confidentiality procedures and contractual restrictions to establish and protect our intellectual property rights, which provide only limited protection and may subject us to litigation.\n\u2022An assertion by a third party that we are infringing on its intellectual property rights could subject us to costly and time-consuming litigation or expensive licenses.\nRisks related to South Africa\n\u2022Fluctuations in the value of the South African Rand have had, and will continue to have, a significant impact on our reported revenues and results of operations, which may make it difficult to evaluate our business performance between reporting periods and may also adversely affect the price of our ADSs.\n\u2022A lack of growth, high inflation or increased interest rates in the South African economy could reduce our anticipated revenue and increase our operating costs.\nRisks related to an Investment in our Ordinary Shares and ADSs\n\u2022Certain provisions of South African law may limit our ability to issue securities and access the capital markets in the future, which could hinder our ability to raise capital in the future.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe may be unable to maintain our relationships with our existing customers, which could result in a loss of subscription revenue.\nWe provide our solutions principally on a subscription basis, typically with an initial subscription term of three to five years and renewal terms varying from one to five years, or, for certain customers, on a month-to-month basis. However, our fleet customers have no obligation to renew their subscriptions after the initial term or after any renewal term expires. Consumer contracts, unless the contract is a prepaid contract, will continue indefinitely unless cancelled by the customer based on one calendar months' notice. We may be unable to retain existing customers and, as a result, our revenue would be adversely affected. Customers may choose to cancel or not to renew their subscriptions for many reasons, including:\n\u2022the belief that our solutions are not required for their needs or are not cost-effective;\n\u2022a desire to reduce discretionary spending;\n\u2022a belief that our competitors\u2019 solutions provide a better value;\n\u2022changes in our customers\u2019 businesses, and regulations impacting our customers\u2019 businesses that may decrease the need for our fleet and mobile asset management solutions;\n\u2022economic downturn in our customers\u2019 industries;\n\u2022economic downturn in the geography in which our customers operate;\n\u2022a reduction in discounts offered by insurers to vehicle owners who have installed our products; or\n\u2022a belief that a return on investment cannot be demonstrated.\nOur enterprise fleet management customers, whose contracts are due for renewal, may also not renew for reasons entirely out of their control, such as the dissolution of their businesses. Enterprise customers may also decrease the number of vehicles covered by subscription contracts if their fleet sizes decrease.\nOur subscription contracts generally do not provide our customers with an early termination option without penalty. However, if customers do not honor subscriptions for the full term, our remedies may be limited to re-negotiation of contract terms or legal recourse through the courts, which may not be successful or cost-effective, and we may not be able to recoup all of our costs.\nA significant loss of or failure to renew our subscription-based contracts, or significantly different contract terms could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe extent to which the COVID-19 outbreak and measures taken in response thereto impact our business, results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and are difficult to predict.\nThe global impact of the COVID-19 outbreak and measures taken to reduce the spread of the virus have had an adverse effect on the global macroeconomic environment and have significantly increased economic uncertainty and reduced economic activity. Governments globally, including the foreign jurisdictions in which we have offices, have declared a state of emergency related to the spread of COVID-19. The outbreak has resulted in authorities implementing numerous measures to try to contain the virus, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place or total lock-down orders, and business limitations and shutdowns. Although governments around the globe have taken steps to mitigate some of the more severe economic effects of the virus and the impact of the outbreak on the economic activity globally is unfolding, there can be no assurance that such steps will be effective or achieve their desired results in a timely and sustainable manner or at all.\nNearly all of our employees were required to work remotely, with the exception of our staff working in our monitoring centers, which were classified as an essential service. Some employees have subsequently returned to our offices; however, a number of employees continue to work from home. In addition, we have modified certain business and workforce practices (including suspension of the majority of business travel and cancellation of physical participation in certain meetings, events and conferences) and implemented new protocols to promote social distancing and enhance sanitary measures in our offices and facilities to conform to government restrictions and best practices encouraged by governmental and regulatory authorities. There is no certainty that such measures will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by the virus, in which case our employees or other individuals may become sick, our ability to perform critical functions could be harmed, and we may be unable to respond to some of the needs of our global business. Further, our increased reliance on remote access to our information systems increases our exposure to potential cybersecurity breaches. We continue to monitor the design and effectiveness of internal controls, taking into account that employees may be working remotely. We may take further actions as government authorities require or recommend or as we determine to be in the best interests of our employees, customers, suppliers and other business counterparties.\nThe extent to which the COVID-19 outbreak impacts our business, results of operations and financial condition in the longer term will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and are difficult to predict, including, but not limited to, the duration, spread and severity of the outbreak, the actions taken to contain the virus or treat its impact, and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions broadly resume.\nIn particular, we may experience reduced revenues and/or financial losses as a result of a number of operational factors, including:\n\u2022Customer pricing pressure, payment term extensions, contract amendments and insolvency risk - As our customers face reduced demand for their products and services, reduce their business activity and face increased financial pressure on their businesses, we have faced downward pressure on our pricing and gross margins as a result of making pricing concessions to customers. In addition, in response to the requests of some of our customers, we have granted extended payment terms. We expect that some of our customers will continue to make such requests, which may have an adverse effect on our cash flows from operations. We may also face a significantly elevated risk of customer insolvency, bankruptcy or liquidity challenges, which may result in a failure to be paid for services we have performed and expenses we have incurred, which could in turn result in us having to take a charge in the period in which the related receivable was written down or written off.\n\u2022Reduced customer demand for services - As a result of the pandemic\u2019s impact on our customers, we have experienced reduced demand for our services. Among other things, a number of our customers have postponed, canceled or scaled back existing and potential projects with us.\n\u2022Increased costs - We face increased costs from the pandemic, including as a result of mitigation efforts such as enabling increased work-from-home capabilities and additional health and safety measures.\n\u2022Reduced/delayed supply of components - We rely on contract manufacturers and other companies to provide electronic components and products that we use. The ongoing impact of COVID-19 on the global economy could impact the operations at our third-party manufacturers, which could result in delays or disruptions in the supply of our products and could impact our ability to meet customer demand. If we are unable to implement\nalternatives or other mitigations with respect to suppliers that may have potential delivery impacts due to COVID-19, our sales and financial results could be negatively impacted.\n\u2022Diversion of and strain on management and other corporate resources - Addressing the significant personnel and business challenges presented by the pandemic, including various business continuity measures and the need to enable work-from-home arrangements for our employees, has demanded significant management time and attention and strained other corporate resources, and is expected to continue to do so. Among other things, this may adversely impact our recruitment and retention, our customers and employee development and our ability to execute our strategy and various transformation initiatives and may increase our exposure to security breaches or cyberattacks.\nIn addition, COVID-19 has resulted in, and may continue to result in, significant economic volatility and uncertainty in U.S. and international financial markets, which could adversely affect our access to capital markets and investment activity, negatively impacting the availability of capital, the terms and conditions of financing arrangements and the related costs of such financing. This could result in situations where financing may not be available to us at all, or at terms formerly available to us.\nThere are no comparable recent events that provide guidance as to the effect the spread of COVID-19 and the measures taken in response thereto may have on our business, and, as a result, the ultimate impact of the outbreak is highly uncertain and subject to change. The nature and extent of the crisis, the public health measures to contain it, and the economic impact remain uncertain. We continue to monitor the effects of the outbreak on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity as well as on our risk factors and the effectiveness of the control environment.\nAny inability to adapt to rapid technological change in our industry could impair our ability to remain competitive and result in a decline in market acceptance of our products.\nThe industry in which we compete is characterized by rapid technological change, frequent introductions of new products and evolving industry standards. In addition to the mobile asset management industry, we are subject to changes in the automotive, mobile handset, Global Positioning System (\u201cGPS\u201d) navigation device, information technology, telecommunications and enterprise software industries. As the technology used in each of these industries evolves, we will face new integration and competition challenges. For example, as truck and automobile manufacturers continue to develop in-vehicle technology, GPS-based tracking solutions may become standard equipment and result in new sources of competition. If we are unable to adapt to rapid technological change, it could impair our ability to remain competitive and result in a decline in market acceptance of our products.\nThe development of new or improved products, systems or technologies that compete with our products may render our products less competitive and we may not be able to enhance our technology in a timely manner. In addition to the competition resulting from new products, systems or technologies, our future product enhancements may not adequately meet the requirements of the developing marketplace, and may not achieve the broad market acceptance necessary to generate significant revenues. Any of the foregoing could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIndustry consolidation may result in increased competition, which could result in a loss of customers and/or a reduction in revenue.\nSome of our competitors have made, or may make, acquisitions or enter into partnerships or other strategic relationships to offer more comprehensive services or achieve greater economies of scale. In addition, new entrants not currently considered competitors may enter our market through acquisitions, partnerships or strategic relationships. We expect these trends to continue as companies attempt to strengthen or maintain their market positions. Many potential entrants may have competitive advantages over us, such as greater name recognition, longer operating histories, more varied services and larger marketing budgets, as well as greater financial, technical and other resources. Industry consolidation may result in competitors with more compelling service offerings or greater pricing flexibility than we have, or business practices that make it more difficult for us to compete effectively, including on the basis of price, sales and marketing programs, technology or service functionality. These pressures could result in a loss of subscribers and/or a reduction in revenue.\nThe loss of one or more of our key personnel, or our failure to attract, train and retain other highly qualified personnel, could prevent us from executing our growth plan.\nWe depend on the continued service and performance of our key personnel. The loss of one or more key members of our senior management team could materially and adversely affect our operations. In addition, the loss of other key sales, product development or technology personnel could disrupt our operations and have a materially adverse effect on our ability to grow our business.\nTo execute our growth plan, we must continue to attract and retain highly qualified personnel. Competition for these employees is intense, and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel. We may experience difficulty in hiring and retaining highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications. Our failure to attract and train new personnel, or our failure to retain, focus and motivate our current personnel, could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may expand by acquiring or investing in other companies, which may divert our management\u2019s attention, result in dilution to our shareholders and consume resources that are necessary to sustain our business.\nWe may acquire complementary products, services, technologies or businesses. We also may enter into relationships with other businesses to expand our portfolio of solutions or to expand our ability to provide our solutions in foreign jurisdictions. Negotiating these transactions can be time-consuming, difficult and expensive, and our ability to complete these transactions may be subject to conditions or approvals that are beyond our control, including anti-takeover and antitrust laws in various jurisdictions. We may seek to acquire other companies or businesses using our shares as consideration. Under the South African Companies Act, No. 71 of 2008, as amended (the \u201cCompanies Act\u201d), we are prohibited from issuing shares representing 30% or more of our outstanding equity in connection with an acquisition without shareholder approval by way of special resolution. In terms of Johannesburg Stock Exchange (\u201cJSE\u201d) Listings Requirements, an acquisition or disposal constituting 30% or more of our market capitalization, will require shareholder approval. In addition, we are subject to New York Stock Exchange Listing Rules which, subject to limited exceptions, require shareholder approval of a transaction involving the sale, issuance, or potential issuance by a company of common stock (or securities convertible into or exercisable for common stock) equal to 20% or more of the common stock, or 20% or more of the voting power outstanding before the issuance, and in certain other circumstances. Consequently, these transactions, even if undertaken and announced, may not close.\nAn acquisition, investment or new business relationship may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures. In particular, we may encounter difficulties assimilating or integrating the businesses, technologies, products, personnel or operations of acquired companies, particularly if the key personnel of the acquired company choose not to work for us, the acquired company\u2019s technology is not easily compatible with ours or we have difficulty retaining the customers of any acquired business due to changes in management or otherwise. Acquisitions may also disrupt our business, divert our resources and require significant management attention that would otherwise be available for the development of our business. Moreover, the anticipated benefits of any acquisition, investment or business relationship may not be realized or any such acquisition, investment or business relationship may expose us to unknown liabilities, including litigation against the companies we may acquire, invest in or otherwise consummate a business relationship with. For one or more of those transactions, we may:\n\u2022issue additional equity securities that would dilute our shareholders;\n\u2022use cash that we may need in the future to operate our business;\n\u2022incur debt on terms unfavorable to us or that we are unable to repay or that may place burdensome restrictions on our operations;\n\u2022incur large charges or substantial liabilities; or\n\u2022become subject to adverse tax consequences, or substantial depreciation or amortization, deferred compensation or other acquisition-related accounting charges.\nAny of these risks could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may not be able to increase sales of our solutions, which could materially and adversely affect our ability to grow our business and increase revenue.\nWe intend to increase sales of our solutions by increasing penetration in our existing markets and by entering new markets that represent a large potential source of demand for these solutions. Our success in increasing sales may be tied to a wide variety of factors, including demand for our services, price and service competition, our relationships with third party distributors and dealers, the rate of new vehicle sales, the oil price, general economic conditions and, in the case of our safety and security solutions, the perceived threat of vehicle theft and discounts offered by insurers.\nSome car and truck manufacturers have begun installing factory fitted substitute products and services, such as certain GPS-based products, in new vehicles prior to their initial sale, which may preclude us from increasing sales to subscribers purchasing such vehicles. Our inability to market and sell our solutions to new customers, at or prior to the initial sale by the manufacturer, could materially and adversely affect our ability to grow our business and increase revenue.\nIn the Middle East and Australasia segment and the Americas segment, we generate significant revenues from the oil and gas sector, and we may not be able to diversify and/or successfully enter into new verticals, which could materially and adversely affect our ability to grow our business and increase revenue.\nWe depend on certain key suppliers and vendors to manufacture our hardware, and an interruption in the supply of components or of our hardware could impair our production capacity, which would impact our ability to supply hardware to customers.\nWe currently purchase key GSM (Global System for Mobile communications) module components of our hardware from two key suppliers. These modules and other electronic components used in the manufacture of our products, have extended lead times on orders. An interruption in the supply of components from these suppliers or a failure to identify the need to re-order components in a timely manner would significantly impact our operations and require us to identify and integrate our manufacturing and supply logistics with an alternate supplier, or use a substitute component, which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe components we use to manufacture hardware are predominately supplied by manufacturers and suppliers in China. The COVID-19 outbreak has adversely affected manufacturing capacity of electronic components. The component supply shortage and extended lead times may impact our business in terms of increased pricing and additional engineering projects to implement alternative components, however, we have so far been able to supply our customer demand and maintain commitments to customers.\nWe contract two vendors in South Africa to manufacture and assemble hardware, one of which changed during fiscal 2020. Each of these contracts is terminable on 12 months\u2019 written notice. We have no financial control over, and limited operational influence on these vendors and the conduct of their businesses. These vendors could negatively impact our business by, among other things, extending delivery times, raising prices and limiting supply due to their own shortages and business requirements. Our two contract manufacturers produce different products for us and if the facilities at one of these contract manufacturers suffer a mass casualty event, it could take as much as three to five months, or longer, to replace production capacity. An extended interruption in the supply of hardware from our contract manufacturers could materially and adversely affect our production capacity and hence our ability to fulfill sales orders which could have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nWe depend on our network of dealers and distributors to sell our solutions and adverse changes in our relationships with significant dealers and distributors could cause a decline in sales.\nWe currently distribute our products to small fleet operators and consumers both directly and through various distribution channels, including automobile dealers, aftermarket automotive parts and service suppliers, and automobile insurers and retailers, which we collectively refer to as \u201cdistributors\u201d.\nWe currently distribute our products to enterprise fleet customers, including large enterprise fleets and small fleet operators, both directly and through third parties, who are assigned specific geographic territories in which they can sell, which we refer to as \u201cdealers\u201d.\nWe are dependent on our dealers and distributors, who account for a substantial percentage of our total sales, and sales generated by certain dealers and distributors individually represent a meaningful percentage of our revenue. The terms of our agreements with our dealers do not usually include minimum purchase obligations, are specific to a geographic territory and are primarily non-exclusive. Our dealer agreements generally have a fixed initial term, after which they may be renewed or continue indefinitely if not terminated. This is subject to the right of either party to terminate on specified notice, generally ranging from 90 days to one year, or for breach. Similarly, our distributor agreements do not generally include minimum purchase obligations and consist principally of a commission agreement applicable to sales generated by the distributor. If our relationships with our dealers and distributors deteriorate, or if a dealer or distributor, or group of related dealers and distributors, accounting for a material portion of our sales elects not to do business with us in the future, our sales could decline materially, which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe depend on our cellular network providers for the transmission of data from installed in-vehicle devices to our data centers and we would incur significant costs if the services of these network providers became unavailable to us.\nWe contract with cellular network providers in each of our markets to provide cellular network services. These cellular networks transmit data from our customers\u2019 in-vehicle devices to our data centers, where it is managed for the benefit of our customers. Certain of our installed in-vehicle devices contain a SIM card that is compatible with a specific cellular network provider. If a cellular network provider in one of our markets were to refuse to continue contracting with us for any reason or were to go out of business, we could incur significant costs related to the replacement of SIM cards for our customers and could suffer damage to our reputation and customer relationships. Any of the foregoing could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe markets in which we participate are highly fragmented and competitive, with relatively low barriers to entry, and increased competition could result in reduced operating margins, increased sales and marketing expenses, and the loss of market share.\nThe market for our solutions is highly fragmented, consisting of a significant number of vendors, with relatively low barriers to entry. Competition in our market is based primarily on:\n\u2022functionality and reliability;\n\u2022total cost of ownership;\n\u2022breadth and depth of application functionality for fleet deployments;\n\u2022product performance;\n\u2022interoperability;\n\u2022brand and reputation;\n\u2022customer service;\n\u2022distribution channels, including a global footprint and ability to service multinationals;\n\u2022regional geographic expertise, including localized language support, support for applicable government regulations and the ability to comply with local Internet and data privacy regulations;\n\u2022size of customer base and reference accounts within key industry segments;\n\u2022ability to deliver ongoing value and return on investment;\n\u2022ease of deployment and use;\n\u2022relevant industry domain expertise and functionality; and\n\u2022the financial resources of the vendor.\nWe compete with a number of companies in each of the geographic markets in which we operate. Such competition could result in reduced operating margins, increased sales and marketing expenses and the loss of market share, any of which would harm our operating results. We expect competition to intensify in the future with the introduction of new technologies, the use of mobile devices and new market entrants from outside the telematics industry, such as enterprise software vendors.\nThe market for safety and security solutions is highly competitive. We compete in the safety and security solutions market primarily on the basis of the technological innovation, value-added services offered, brand recognition, rate of successful recoveries of mobile assets, and quality and price of our products and services. Our most competitive market is the vehicle and mobile asset tracking and recovery solutions market, due to the existence of a wide variety of competing products and services, and alternative technologies that offer various levels of protection and tracking capabilities. Some of these competing products and services, such as certain GPS-based products, are installed in new cars by vehicle manufacturers prior to their initial sale, which may make it more difficult to compete for such subscribers. Furthermore, providers of competing services or products may extend their offerings to the locations in which we operate, or new competitors may enter the safety and security solutions market.\nWe could be exposed to product liability claims, which could result in significant damage to our reputation and material economic loss.\nOur products, and the batteries that many of them contain, could malfunction and cause damage to our customers\u2019 property. In particular, the rechargeable batteries in our in-vehicle devices may be prone to leakage due to environmental factors, such as extreme weather conditions or overuse. Leaks in these batteries could damage our customers\u2019 in-vehicle devices and vehicles. Our safety and security solutions may be disabled or prove to be ineffective as a result of techniques employed by car thieves, or the discovery of technological weaknesses by such persons. If there were a systematic failure of any of our products, we could suffer significant damage to our reputation, and any insurance we maintain might not be sufficient to prevent us from suffering a material economic loss.\nFailure of businesses to adopt fleet management solutions could reduce the demand for our solutions.\nWe derive, and expect to continue to derive, substantial revenue from the sale of subscriptions for fleet management solutions to commercial customers. Widespread acceptance and use of fleet management solutions is critical to our future revenue growth and success. If the market for fleet management solutions fails to grow, or grows more slowly than we currently anticipate, demand for our solutions would be negatively affected.\nThe market for fleet management solutions is subject to changing customer demand and trends in preferences. Some of the potential factors that could affect interest in and demand for fleet management solutions include:\n\u2022the effectiveness and reliability of solutions;\n\u2022fluctuations in fuel and vehicle maintenance costs, which are significant drivers of customer demand for fleet management solutions;\n\u2022assumptions regarding general mobile workforce inefficiency and the extent to which efficiency can be improved through fleet management solutions;\n\u2022the level of governmental and regulatory burden on the fields of transportation and occupational health and safety;\n\u2022the price, performance, features and availability of products and services that compete with ours;\n\u2022our ability to maintain high levels of customer satisfaction; and\n\u2022the rate of acceptance of web-based solutions generally.\nFailure of businesses to adopt fleet management solutions could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nA decline in vehicle sales and/or an increase in the sales of factory-fitted GPS solutions in new vehicles in our markets could result in reduced demand for our solutions, which could materially and adversely affect our revenue.\nA reduction in sales of new vehicles and/or an increase in factory-fitted GPS solutions in new vehicles could reduce our addressable market for solutions. New vehicle sales may decline for various reasons, including adverse changes in the general economic environment, a reduction in our customers\u2019 discretionary spending, or an increase in new vehicle tariffs, taxes or gas prices. A decline in vehicle production levels or labor disputes affecting the automobile industry in the markets where we operate, may also impact the volume of new vehicle sales. A decline in sales of new vehicles in the markets in which we provide our solutions would result in reduced demand for such products and services, which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nDemand for our fleet management solutions decreases when prices for crude oil and natural gas decrease, which could materially and adversely affect our revenue.\nDemand for our fleet management solutions can fluctuate with the prices for crude oil and natural gas, which impact the attractiveness of our services and also directly affects our customers in the oil and gas industry, from whom we derive a significant portion of our revenues. Subscription revenues from oil and gas customers in fiscal year 2021 represented 24.5% of our total subscription revenue. Generally, lower oil and gas prices reduce the return on investment for many of our customers. Gains in fuel efficiency may lead to a relative decrease in the return on investment of our solutions perceived by our customers. The oil and gas industry is complex, and numerous geopolitical, economic, environmental and other factors affect pricing. Expectations for future crude oil and natural gas prices may affect our customers\u2019 spending habits. Prolonged or substantial declines in crude oil and/or natural gas prices, or the perception that such prices will remain low, could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nChanges in practices of insurance companies in the markets in which we provide our solutions could materially and adversely affect demand for products and services.\nWe depend in part on the practices of insurance companies in some of our markets to support demand for certain of our products and services. For example, in South Africa, which is currently the largest market for our products and services, insurance companies either mandate the installation of tracking devices as a prerequisite for providing insurance coverage to owners of certain vehicles, or provide discounts on insurance premiums to encourage vehicle owners to subscribe to vehicle tracking and mobile asset recovery solutions such as ours. We benefit from insurance companies\u2019 continued practice in the South African and certain other markets:\n\u2022accepting mobile asset location technologies such as ours as a preferred security product;\n\u2022providing premium discounts for using location and recovery products and services such as ours; and\n\u2022mandating the use of our products and services, or similar products and services, for certain vehicles.\nIf any of these policies or practices change, revenues from the sale of our products and services could decline, which would materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe face many risks associated with our existing and potential new international operations, which could prevent us from successfully expanding into new geographic markets, or operating successfully in existing geographic markets.\nWe are a global company with substantial assets located in a number of countries. We provide our services in more than 120 countries with 16 offices in 9 countries. In some international markets, customer preferences and buying behavior may be different, and we may use business or pricing models that are different from our traditional subscription model to provide fleet management solutions to customers in those markets, or we may be unsuccessful in implementing the appropriate business model. Our revenue from new foreign markets may not exceed the costs of establishing, marketing, and maintaining our international offerings.\nIn addition, expanding international operations into new territories may subject us to risks with which we have limited experience. These risks include:\n\u2022lack of familiarity with local markets, including legal and regulatory requirements;\n\u2022difficulties in finding and maintaining, or potentially replacing, local dealers and distributors;\n\u2022competing with established local competitors;\n\u2022laws favoring local competitors;\n\u2022the cost and burden of monitoring and complying with legal and regulatory requirements in new territories, and/or changes to existing legal and regulatory requirements, including those relating to the Internet and data privacy and security;\n\u2022fluctuations in currency exchange rates or restrictions on currency exchange;\n\u2022availability of US Dollars in countries highly dependent on resource exports;\n\u2022potentially adverse tax consequences, including the complexities of transfer pricing, value added or other tax systems, double taxation and restrictions and/or taxes on the repatriation of earnings;\n\u2022dependence on third parties, including some commercial partners with whom we may not have extensive experience;\n\u2022increased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities;\n\u2022political, social, and economic instability, terrorist attacks, and security concerns in general;\n\u2022reduced or varied protection for intellectual property rights in some countries; and\n\u2022increased exposure and vulnerability to claims that we have infringed on the intellectual property of third parties.\nOperating in international markets requires significant management attention and financial resources. The investment and additional resources required to establish operations and manage growth in additional territories may not produce desired levels of revenue or profitability.\nOur business and results of operations may be negatively impacted by the United Kingdom\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union.\nExposure to United Kingdom political developments, including the impact of the United Kingdom exiting from the European Union (also known as \u201cBrexit\u201d), could have a material adverse effect on our operations, specifically in Europe. The United Kingdom\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union on January 31, 2020 created an uncertain political and economic environment in the United Kingdom and potentially across other EU member states for the foreseeable future, including while the United Kingdom reviews and reforms regulations derived from its prior membership in the European Union.\nThe results of our operations may be affected in a number of ways, including increasing currency exchange risk, generating instability in the global financial markets or negatively impacting the economies of the United Kingdom and Europe. The cost of servicing Europe from the United Kingdom may no longer be a viable option, and we may need to consider alternative options. The costs of having a UK-headquartered business may increase as a result of the potential weakening of the British Pound. Changes to existing trade agreements between Europe and the United Kingdom could lead to increased customs duties, tariffs and withholding taxes for the sale of our hardware and services from the United Kingdom into Europe, and may result in us being less profitable.\nSecurity or privacy breaches in our electronic transactions, data and asset tracking sensors may expose us to additional liability or result in a loss of customers, either of which events could harm our business.\nAny inability on our part to protect the information security of our networks, data processing systems, software products and platforms could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and profitability by exposing us to additional liability, increasing our expenses relating to resolution of these breaches and deterring users from using our products and services. Our systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from human error, a breach in cybersecurity, computer viruses, distributed denial of service attacks, spurious spam attacks, intentional acts of vandalism and similar events. We cannot assure you that our current security methods and measures will effectively counter evolving security risks, prevent future slowdowns or disruptions, protect against extraordinary attacks while addressing the security and privacy requirements of existing and future users. Any system failures, slowdowns or disruptions will likely result in unanticipated disruptions in service to our users, decreased levels of user satisfaction and significant negative effects on our reputation, which could materially and adversely affect our business.\nWe utilize third-party encryption and authentication technology providers to secure and review transmission of confidential information over the Internet, including private customer data such as bank account numbers and asset tracking data. Advances in technological capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography, and a continually changing landscape of cybersecurity threats as well as other events or developments, could result in a compromise or breach of the technology we use to protect sensitive transaction data, including the technology provided by third-parties. If any such compromise of our data security, or the data security of our customers, were to occur, it could result in misappropriation of proprietary information or interruptions in operations, and have an adverse impact on our reputation or the reputation of our customers. If we are unable to detect and prevent unauthorized access to or use of confidential information including bank account numbers and asset tracking data, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. Any such interruption or breach of our systems could also result in legal and reputational damage to our business, including legal claims and proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, government enforcement actions and regulatory penalties, as well as remediation costs. We maintain cyber liability insurance; however, this insurance may not be sufficient to cover legal, reputational and financial losses that may occur as a result of an interruption or a breach of our systems.\nOur operating results may be harmed if we are required to collect sales, use, services or other related taxes for our solutions in jurisdictions where we have not historically done so.\nWe do not believe that we are ordinarily required to collect sales, use, services or other similar taxes from our customers in certain jurisdictions. However, one or more countries or states may seek to impose sales, use, services, or other tax collection obligations on us, including for past sales. For example, the European Commission introduced proposals addressing taxation of digital business operating within the European Union, but has not yet reached an agreement on a sales tax with a scope limited to digital advertising services. As a result, certain countries, including the United Kingdom, Italy and France moved to introduce their own digital service tax. A successful assertion by one or more jurisdictions that we should collect sales or other taxes on the sale of our solutions, could result in substantial tax liabilities, including interest and penalty charges for past sales and decrease our ability to compete for future sales. We review applicable rules and regulations periodically and, when we believe sales and use taxes apply in a particular jurisdiction, we voluntarily engage tax authorities in order to determine how to comply with their rules and regulations. We cannot assure you that we will not be subject to sales and use taxes or related penalties for past sales in jurisdictions where we presently believe sales and use taxes are not due. Furthermore, we cannot be certain that we have recorded sufficient provisions on our consolidated financial statements to cover taxes.\nAlthough our client contracts ordinarily provide that our clients must pay all applicable sales and similar taxes, they may be reluctant to pay back taxes, and may refuse responsibility for interest or penalties associated with those taxes. If we are unable to collect and pay back taxes and the associated interest and penalties, we will incur unplanned expenses that may be substantial.\nDue to the nature of our business, our services are provided within multiple jurisdictions, including certain jurisdictions in which we may not have anticipated our services being provided or within which we may not have had prior dealings. Accordingly, there may be unforeseen obligations related to certain jurisdictions that were not identified or not adequately provided for in our contracts. These obligations could materially and adversely affect our financial position.\nAn actual or perceived reduction in vehicle theft and crime rates, may adversely impact demand for certain of our solutions, which could result in a loss of customers and a decline in growth.\nDemand for our vehicle tracking and asset recovery solutions is influenced by prevailing or expected vehicle theft rates. Vehicle theft rates may decline as a result of various factors, such as the availability of improved security systems, implementation of improved or more effective law enforcement measures, and improved economic or political conditions in markets that have high theft rates. If vehicle theft rates in our markets decline significantly, or if vehicle owners or insurance companies believe that vehicle theft rates have declined or are expected to decline, demand for some of our products and services may decline, which could result in a loss of customers and a decline in growth.\nWe are subject to U.S. and other anti-corruption laws, trade controls, economic sanctions and similar laws and regulations, including those in the jurisdictions where we operate. Our failure to comply with these laws and regulations could subject us to civil, criminal and administrative penalties and harm our reputation.\nDoing business on a worldwide basis requires us to comply with the laws and regulations of various foreign jurisdictions. These laws and regulations place restrictions on our operations, trade practices, partners and investment decisions. In particular, our operations are subject to U.S. and foreign anti-corruption and trade control laws and regulations, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the \u201cFCPA\u201d), various export controls and economic sanctions programs, including those administered by the U.S. Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (\u201cOFAC\u201d), as well as Australian and European sanctions. We monitor compliance in accordance with the ten principles as set out in the United Nations Global Compact Principles, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development recommendations relating to corruption, and the International Labor Organization Protocol in terms of certain of the items to be monitored. As a result of doing business in foreign countries and with foreign partners, we are exposed to a heightened risk of violating anti-corruption and trade control laws as well as sanctions regulations.\nThe FCPA prohibits us from providing anything of value to foreign officials for the purposes of obtaining or retaining business, or securing any improper business advantage. It also requires us to keep books and records that accurately and fairly reflect our transactions. As part of our business, we may deal with state-owned business enterprises, the employees of which are considered foreign officials for purposes of the FCPA. In addition, the United Kingdom Bribery Act (the \u201cBribery Act\u201d) which came into effect on July 1, 2011, extends beyond bribery of foreign public officials and also applies to transactions with individuals not employed by a government. The Bribery Act further punishes both\nthe giving and receiving of bribes, whereas the FCPA only prohibits payment of a bribe. The provisions of the Bribery Act are also more onerous than the FCPA in a number of other respects, including jurisdiction, non-exemption of facilitation payments and penalties. Some of the international locations in which we operate, lack a developed legal system and have higher than normal levels of corruption.\nEconomic sanctions programs restrict our business dealings with certain sanctioned countries, persons and entities. In addition, because we act through dealers and distributors, we face the risk that our dealers, distributors and customers might further distribute our products to a sanctioned person or entity, or an ultimate end-user in a sanctioned country, which might subject us to an investigation concerning compliance with OFAC or other sanctions regulations.\nViolations of anti-corruption laws, trade control laws and sanctions regulations are punishable by civil penalties, including fines, denial of export privileges, injunctions, asset seizures, debarment from government contracts and revocations or restrictions of licenses, as well as criminal fines and imprisonment. We have developed policies and procedures as part of a company-wide compliance program that is designed to assist our compliance with applicable U.S. and international anti-corruption and trade control laws and regulations, including the FCPA, the Bribery Act and trade controls and sanctions programs administered by OFAC, and provide regular training to our employees to comply with these laws and regulations. However, there can be no assurance that all of our employees, consultants, partners, agents or other associated persons will not take actions in violation of our policies and these laws and regulations, or that our policies and procedures will effectively prevent us from violating these regulations in every transaction in which we may engage, or provide a defense to any alleged violation. In particular, we may be held liable for the actions that our local, strategic or joint venture partners take inside or outside of the United States, even though our partners may not be subject to these laws. Such a violation, even if our policies prohibit it, could materially and adversely affect our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition. Our continued international expansion, including in developing countries, and our development of new partnerships and joint venture relationships worldwide, could increase the risk of FCPA, OFAC or Bribery Act violations in the future.\nOperating in emerging markets subjects us to greater risks than those we would face if we only operated in more developed markets, which could increase our operating costs and inhibit our growth plan.\nEmerging markets, including Africa, Eastern Europe, Mexico, the Middle East, Asia and South America, are subject to greater risks than more developed markets. The Middle East region is experiencing ongoing instability, which has affected and may continue to affect our growth in the region. The Brazilian market continues to experience political and economic issues such as high unemployment rates, high inflation rates and corruption allegations, which affect our growth in the region and our ability to introduce new services to the region. South Africa is experiencing political and economic issues, as well as high unemployment rates, which could affect our ability to maintain our existing customer base as well as our ability to grow our existing customer base. The political, economic and market conditions in many emerging markets present risks that could make it more difficult to operate our business successfully. These risks include:\n\u2022political and economic instability, including higher rates of inflation and currency fluctuations;\n\u2022higher levels of corruption, including bribery of public officials;\n\u2022loss due to civil strife, acts of war or terrorism, guerrilla activities and insurrection;\n\u2022a lack of well-developed legal systems which could make it difficult for us to enforce our intellectual property and contractual rights;\n\u2022logistical and communications challenges;\n\u2022potential adverse changes in laws and regulatory practices, including import and export license requirements and restrictions, tariffs, legal structures and tax laws;\n\u2022difficulties in staffing and managing operations and ensuring the safety of our employees;\n\u2022restrictions on the right to convert or repatriate currency or export assets;\n\u2022greater risk of uncollectible accounts and longer collection cycles; and\n\u2022introduction or changes to indigenization and empowerment programs.\nLaws and regulations relating to the Internet and data privacy in the markets in which we operate are complex and continuously evolving, and compliance costs are high. As these laws and regulations continue to evolve, we may be required to increase our compliance-related expenditures or limit the manner in which we collect information, the types of information that we collect, or the solutions that we offer, which may impede our ability to provide our solutions or may reduce our profit margins in specific geographic regions.\nVarious laws and regulations associated with the Internet and data privacy are complex and increase our cost of doing business. Furthermore, these laws and regulations expose us to fines and penalties if we fail to comply with them. Although we have implemented procedures designed to comply with international practices and have established additional group policies, charters and procedures to assist in maintaining data privacy and data security, we have not undertaken a formal legal review to determine our compliance with data privacy and data security laws in jurisdictions outside of the UK, the European Union and South Africa.\nFurthermore, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors and agents will comply with the policies and procedures we establish regarding data privacy and data security, particularly as we expand our operations through organic growth and acquisitions. While our employees may violate our policies and procedures, the Company remains responsible for, and obligated to implement, policies and procedures and enter into contracts with service providers that require appropriate protection. Any violations could subject us to civil or criminal penalties, including substantial fines or prohibitions on our ability to offer our products in one or more countries, and could also materially damage our reputation, our brand, our international expansion efforts, our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe transmission of data over the Internet and cellular networks is a critical component of our software-as-a-service (\u201cSaaS\u201d) business model. Additionally, as cloud computing continues to evolve, increased regulation by federal, state or foreign agencies becomes more likely, particularly in the areas of data privacy and data security. In addition, taxation of services provided over the Internet or other charges imposed by government agencies, or by private organizations for accessing the Internet, may be imposed. Any regulation imposing greater fees for Internet use or restricting information exchange over the Internet, could result in a decline in the use of the Internet and the viability of Internet-based services, which could harm our business.\nOur solutions and products enable us to collect, manage and store a wide range of data related to fleet management such as mobile asset location and fuel usage, speed and mileage. We obtain our data from a variety of sources, including our customers and third-party providers. The United States and various state governments have adopted or proposed limitations on the collection, distribution and use of personal data, as well as requirements that must be followed if a breach of such personal data occurs. The California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d), effective January 1, 2020, was the first consumer privacy law in the United States. The CCPA created new privacy rights for California consumers which will be expanded by the newly passed California Privacy Rights Act (\u201cCPRA\u201d), effective January 1, 2023. Virginia recently became the second state to enact a consumer privacy law, the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act (\u201cCDPA\u201d). Effective January 1, 2023, the CDPA will also provide Virginia consumers with new privacy rights. Failure to comply to the CCPA or in future with the CPRA and CDPA (to the extent required) could result in penalties.\nIn the European Union, the General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d) came into effect on May 25, 2018. GDPR contains robust obligations on data processors and heavy documentation requirements for data protection compliance by companies. Amongst other requirements, GDPR governs data collection, use, storage and disclosure of personal data in the European Union. GDPR requires informed consent for the use of cookies and direct electronic marketing and imposes conditions on obtaining valid consent. Failure to comply with GDPR could result in penalties and fines for noncompliance. In addition to GDPR, the EU has another draft regulation in the approval process that focuses on the right to privacy. The proposed regulation, known as the ePrivacy Regulation would replace the member state laws that implement the current European Union ePrivacy Directive. The ePrivacy Regulation will significantly increase fines for non-compliance.\nIn the United Kingdom, data protection is governed by the Data Protection Act 2018 and the UK GDPR (which adopts the EU GDPR and procedures as at 31 December 2020 only). At present, the UK and EU regimes are similar. The UK framework places equivalent obligations on Controllers and Processors to those set out in the EU GDPR including obligations on Controllers to ensure lawful grounds for processing data, adequate security measures are in place to secure it, and equivalent rights are available to UK citizens to protect their personal data. As a non-EU Member state, the UK falls outside the free-data flow area between EU Member states. The UK Information Commissioner (as regulator instead of National Data Protection Authorities (\u201cNDPAs\u201d)) has recognized data transfers from the UK into the EU as lawful, on the grounds that the EU GDPR offers \u201cadequate and equivalent protection\u201d for personal data. The EU has established a temporary \u201cadequacy bridge\u201d (set out in the UK-EU Trade and Cooperation Agreement 2020) to enable the continuation\nof data flows on an interim basis from the EU to the UK, pending a formal decision from the EU to accept the adequacy of the UK data protection regime post-Brexit. This acceptance is anticipated to be approved during 2021. In the event that the adequacy is not approved, Standard Contractual Clauses can be implemented to manage transfers without significant disruption to compliance.\nThe Protection of Personal Information Act, No. 4 of 2013 (the \u201cPOPI Act\u201d) was promulgated into law in South Africa in November 2013. Certain sections of the POPI Act came into effect on April 11, 2014. The majority of the remaining sections (especially the sections that create compliance requirements) came into effect on July 1, 2020. The POPI Act allows for a one year transition period from its commencement for all persons to comply with its requirements, being until June 30, 2021, where after the last remaining sections, and thus the full POPI Act, will come into effect. Any failure to comply with the POPI Act may result in a fine not exceeding R10 million and/or imprisonment of up to 10 years, depending on the severity of such failure.\nWe continuously update and will continue to evaluate our group data protection and security policies, charters, and procedures to assist in maintaining data privacy and data security in line with international practices.\nWe may also be subject to costly notification and remediation requirements if we, or a third party, determines that we have been the subject of a data breach involving personal data of individuals. Data breach notification regulations vary among the countries where we conduct business, and also vary among the states of the United States, and any such breach involving personal data could be subject to any number of these requirements.\nAs noted above, we have sought to implement internationally recognized practices regarding data privacy and data security. If our privacy or data security measures fail to comply, or are perceived to fail to comply, with current or future laws and regulations, we may be subject to litigation, regulatory investigations, fines or other liabilities. Moreover, if future laws and regulations limit our customers\u2019 ability to use and share this data or our ability to store, process and share data with our customers over the Internet, demand for our solutions could decrease and our costs could increase. We might also have to limit the manner in which we collect data, the types of personal data that we collect, or the solutions we offer. Any of these risks would materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nA governmental challenge to our transfer pricing policies or practices could impose significant costs on us.\nThe group has intercompany transactions and consequently closely monitors the appropriateness of its transfer pricing policies and compliance therewith. The global transfer pricing environment, including with respect to operational and reporting requirements, is continuously evolving and subject to input from multiple sources and jurisdictions. These complexities require management to closely monitor new developments, which it does.\nMany countries routinely examine transfer pricing policies of taxpayers subject to their jurisdiction, and authorities challenge transfer pricing policies aggressively where there is potential non-compliance and impose interest and penalties where non-compliance is determined. Although the documentation of and support for our transfer pricing policies has not been the subject of a governmental proceeding beyond examination to date, there can be no assurance that a governmental authority will not challenge these policies more aggressively in the future or, if challenged, that we will prevail. We could suffer costs related to one or more challenges to our transfer pricing.\nAlthough South Africa signed the Multilateral Competent Authority Agreement on the Exchange of Country-by-Country (\u201cCbC\u201d) Reports on January 27, 2016, and published its CbC Reporting Regulations on December 23, 2016 (\u201cCbC Regulations\u201d), the Company is not under any obligation to file a CbC Report as its turnover is below the required threshold. In terms of the CbC Regulations, the ultimate parent entity of Multinational Enterprise Groups (\u201cMNE Group\u201d) with total consolidated group revenue of at least R10 billion (or \u20ac750 million should the MNE Group be headquartered outside of South Africa), must submit a CbC Report to the South African Revenue Service (\u201cSARS\u201d).\nIn addition to the CbC Regulations, any entity which has entered into cross-border related party transactions, which exceed or are reasonably expected to exceed R100 million per year in the aggregate, must submit a \u201cMaster File\u201d and \u201cLocal File\u201d to SARS.\nMiX Telematics International meets this threshold and therefore is required to submit Master File and Local File returns.\nReduction in regulation in certain markets may adversely impact demand for certain of our solutions by reducing the necessity for, or desirability of, our solutions.\nRegulatory compliance and reporting is driven by legislation and requirements, which are often subject to change, from regulatory authorities in nearly every jurisdiction globally. For example, in the United States, fleet operators can face numerous complex regulatory requirements, including mandatory Compliance, Safety and Accountability driver safety scoring, hours of service, compliance and fuel tax reporting. The reduction in regulation in certain markets may adversely impact demand for certain of our solutions, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFailure to correctly implement a new Enterprise Resource Planning (\u201cERP\u201d), Customer Relationship Management System (\u201cCRM\u201d) and billing system could have a material and adverse effect on our operations.\nWe have completed the implementation of a new fully-integrated ERP, CRM and billing system in the African Fleet Subsidiaries. The overall aim of these new systems is to enable management to achieve enhanced quality, reliability and timeliness of information; improve integration and visibility of information stemming from different management functions and countries; and optimize global management of corporate processes.\nThe adoption of a new ERP, CRM and billing system, which will replace the various accounting systems within our individual operations, poses several challenges relating to, among other things, project governance, migration of data, potential instability of the new system, communication of new rules and procedures, training of personnel and maintaining effective internal controls. We are aware of the potential risks associated with a global system implementation and intend to adopt mitigation plans and contingency plans, in order to ensure business continuity, this includes mitigating issues noted during the pilot implementation before embarking on the full roll-out. However, there can be no assurance that a new ERP, CRM and billing system will be successfully implemented and failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our operations and ability to execute on our growth strategy.\nIf the accounting estimates we make, and the assumptions on which we rely, in preparing our consolidated financial statements prove inaccurate, our actual results may be adversely affected.\nOur consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions about, among other things, the assessment of expected cash flows used in evaluating goodwill and long-lived assets for impairment, the amortization period for deferred commissions, the determination of useful lives of the Company\u2019s customer relationships, maintenance and warranty accruals, contingencies, expected credit losses, the classification of devices and other hardware as in-vehicle devices (equipment) versus inventory based on the future expectation of the different types of customer contracts, income and deferred taxes, unrecognized tax benefits, valuation allowances on deferred tax assets and stock-based compensation. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of our assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, the amounts of charges accrued by us, and related disclosure of contingent liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances and at the time they are made. If our estimates or the assumptions underlying them are not correct, actual results may differ materially from our estimates and we may need to, among other things, accrue additional charges that could adversely affect our results of operations, which in turn could adversely affect our stock price. In addition, new accounting standards, amendments and interpretations of accounting standards have occurred and may occur in the future that could adversely affect our reported financial results.\nWe may be exposed to risks related to litigation and administrative proceedings that could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business may expose us to litigation and administrative proceedings relating to labor, regulatory, tax proceedings, governmental investigations, tort claims, contractual disputes and criminal prosecution, among other matters, that could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. In the context of these proceedings, we may not only be required to pay fines or monetary damages but also be subject to sanctions or injunctions affecting our ability to continue our operations. While we may contest these matters vigorously and make insurance claims when appropriate, litigation and other proceedings are inherently costly and unpredictable, making it difficult to accurately estimate the outcome of actual or potential litigation or proceedings. Although we will establish provisions in accordance with the requirements of GAAP, the amounts that we reserve could vary significantly from any amounts we actually pay due to the inherent uncertainties in the estimation process. In addition, litigation and administrative proceedings can involve significant management time and attention and be expensive, regardless of\noutcome. During the course of any litigation and administrative proceedings, there may be announcements of the results of hearings and motions and other interim developments. If securities analysts or investors regard these announcements as negative, the trading price of our ordinary shares and ADSs may decline. For more information, see \u201cItem 3. Legal Proceedings.\u201d\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\nWe have not traditionally relied on patents to protect our intellectual property, and we rely on trade secrecy laws, confidentiality agreements, confidentiality procedures and contractual restrictions to establish and protect our intellectual property rights, which provide only limited protection and may subject us to litigation.\nOur future success and competitive position depend in part on our ability to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technologies. We rely primarily on trade secrecy laws, confidentiality agreements, confidentiality procedures and contractual restrictions to establish and protect our intellectual property rights, all of which provide only limited protection and may not currently, or in the future, provide us with a competitive advantage. Our confidentiality agreements with our employees, licensees, independent contractors and other advisers may not effectively prevent disclosure of confidential information and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. In addition, others may independently discover our trade secrets or develop similar technologies and processes, and, in either event we would not be able to assert trade secret rights.\nWe also rely, to a limited extent, on patent, trademark and copyright law. A patent covering certain aspects of our Beam-e product was issued in South Africa during fiscal year 2014 and a patent covering a method for driver verification was issued during fiscal year 2015. A further patent for an asset tracking system and method was issued in Brazil on May 4, 2021. We have traditionally not sought patent protection over our intellectual property. As a result, we may not be able to successfully defend our intellectual property from third-party infringement.\nWe cannot assure you that any future trademark registrations will be issued for pending or future applications, or that any registered trademarks will be enforceable, or provide adequate protection of our proprietary rights, or that any such trademarks will not be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented.\nEffective patent, trademark, copyright, and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which our solutions are available, or where we have employees or independent contractors. In addition, the legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability, and scope of protection of intellectual property rights in Internet-related industries are uncertain and continue to evolve. The steps we have taken, and will take, may not prevent unauthorized use, reverse engineering, or misappropriation of our technologies and we may not be able to detect any of the foregoing. Any of the foregoing events could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAn assertion by a third party that we are infringing on its intellectual property rights could subject us to costly and time-consuming litigation or expensive licenses.\nThe fleet management, mobile asset management and technology industries are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets and by frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. Much of this litigation involves patent-holding companies or other adverse patent owners who have no relevant product revenues of their own, and against whom our own limited patent portfolio may provide little or no deterrence. We have been subject to such claims in the past and may face additional claims in the future.\nWe have not historically conducted comprehensive art searches to determine whether our solutions infringe the patent rights of third parties in our current markets, or those markets we may enter in the future. Third parties may assert that we are infringing on patents, of which we are currently unaware and that would have been disclosed by prior art searches if they had been conducted. Our status as a public company in the United States has raised our visibility and may invite holders of patents who have not previously sought to enforce them against us, to bring or threaten claims for infringement or seek to negotiate royalty or other payments from us. The fact that we have relatively few patents associated with our intellectual property means that we may not be able to successfully defend our intellectual property from third-party infringement. Any of the foregoing could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe cannot assure you that we will prevail in any future intellectual property infringement litigation given the complex technical issues and inherent uncertainties in such litigation. Defending such claims, regardless of their merit,\ncould be time-consuming and distracting to management, result in costly litigation or settlement, cause development delays, or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements. In addition, we are obligated to indemnify some of our customers and other contract counterparties against third parties\u2019 claims of intellectual property infringement based on our solutions. If our solutions violate any third-party intellectual property rights, we could be required to withdraw those solutions from the market, re-develop those solutions or seek to obtain licenses from third parties, which might not be available on reasonable terms, or at all. Any efforts to redevelop our solutions, obtain licenses from third parties on favorable terms or license a substitute technology might not be successful and, in any case, might substantially increase our costs and harm our business, financial condition and operating results. Withdrawal of any of our solutions from the market could harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\nOur software may contain undetected defects or software errors, which could result in damage to our reputation or market rejection of our products.\nWe must update our solutions quickly to keep pace with the rapidly changing market, including the third-party software and devices with which our solutions integrate, and we have a history of frequently introducing new releases. Our solutions and/or updates to our solutions could contain errors or defects, which were not detected during our review processes, especially when first introduced or when new versions are released. Our software may not be free from errors or defects, which could result in damage to our reputation or harm to our operating results.\nWe warrant that our hardware will be free of defects for various periods of time. The operation of the hardware is controlled by the firmware loaded on the hardware. We generally provide firmware updates to our fleet customers by \u201cover-the-air\u201d wireless communication of the updated firmware directly to our customers\u2019 in-vehicle devices. If the firmware does not function as expected and it prevents the uploading of updated firmware, then the problem can not be corrected by an over-the-air update and will require direct servicing of the installed on-board computer by trained personnel, which imposes a very significant cost on us. Variations among communications protocols in the markets in which we operate increase the risk of error in the remote installation of firmware. Although we attempt to manage this risk by introducing firmware updates in stages, so that the success of deployment can be assessed on a small number of in-vehicle devices before the deployment risk is expanded to a larger customer base, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in detecting firmware operation and integration problems or otherwise in managing our exposure to remediation expense related to the deployment of firmware updates.\nOur \u201cover-the-air\u201d transmission of firmware updates could permit a third party to disable our customers\u2019 in-vehicle devices or introduce malware into our customers\u2019 in-vehicle devices, which could expose us to widespread loss of service and customer claims.\n\u201cOver-the-air\u201d transmission of our firmware updates may provide the opportunity for a third party, who has deep inside knowledge of our systems, to modify or disable our customers\u2019 in-vehicle systems or introduce malware into our customers\u2019 in-vehicle systems. No such incidents have occurred to date, but there can be no assurance that they will not occur in the future. Damage to our customers\u2019 in-vehicle devices as a result of such incidents could only be remedied through direct servicing of their installed in-vehicle devices by trained personnel, which would impose a very significant cost on us, particularly if the incidents are widespread. Moreover, such incidents could expose us to widespread loss of service and claims by our customers under various theories of liability, the outcome of which would be uncertain. Third party interference with our over-the-air transmission of firmware, or with our customers\u2019 in-vehicle devices during such process, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAny significant disruption in service on, or security breaches of, our SaaS platform or computer systems, could compromise our information, damage our reputation and result in a loss of customers.\nOur brand, reputation, and ability to attract, retain, and serve our customers depend upon the reliable performance of our service and our customers\u2019 ability to access our solutions at all times. Our customers rely on our solutions to make operating decisions related to their fleet, as well as to measure, store and analyze valuable data regarding their businesses. We collect and store sensitive data, including data transmitted from our customers\u2019 in-vehicle devices concerning the location of their mobile assets, as well as personally identifiable information concerning our customers and employees. Our solutions are vulnerable to interruption and our data centers are vulnerable to damage or interruption from human error, intentional malicious acts, computer viruses or hackers, pandemics, earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, fires, war, terrorist attacks, power losses, hardware failures, systems failures, telecommunications failures and similar events, any of which could limit our customers\u2019 ability to access our solutions. Prolonged delays or unforeseen difficulties in connection with adding capacity or upgrading our network architecture may cause our service quality to suffer. Any event that significantly disrupts our service or exposes our data to misuse could damage our\nreputation and harm our business and operating results, including causing us to issue credits to customers, subjecting us to potential liability, reducing our customer retention rates, or increasing our cost of acquiring new customers, any of which would have the effect of reducing our revenue and could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAny breach of our data or system security could result in our customer data being accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen, our business and operations being interrupted, a loss of confidence in our products and services and other negative consequences such as civil liability, including under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, and regulatory penalties, any or all of which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, we store data, host our solutions and serve all of our customers from our servers, which are located at third-party data center facilities in Algiers in Algeria, Sydney in Australia, Muscat in Oman, Dublin in Ireland, Dubai in UAE and Virginia in the United States. While we control and have access to the servers and some of the physical components that are located in these external data centers, we do not control the operation of these facilities or certain equipment. Problems faced by our third-party data center locations, with the telecommunications network providers with whom they or we contract, or with the systems by which our telecommunications providers allocate capacity among their customers, including us, could adversely affect the experience of our customers. Third-party operators of our data centers could decide to close their facilities without adequate notice. In addition, any financial difficulties, such as bankruptcy, faced by our secure third-party data center operators or any of the service providers with whom they or we contract may have negative effects on our business, the nature and extent of which are difficult to predict.\nIn addition to data hosted at third party data centers, we have transitioned the vast majority of our data to cloud-based service platforms such as Amazon Web Services (\u201cAWS\u201d) and Azure. The use of such service presents similar risks to the use of a conventional third party hosted environment, although at a level that is viewed internally as considerably lower. The use of cloud-based servicing may however present additional complexity which may be more easily managed using physical data centers, for example the jurisdiction of data and applicability of various laws and regulations denoting the transfer of data between jurisdictions is more complex in a cloud based environment.\nCertain of our customer agreements currently, and may in the future, provide minimum service level commitments regarding items such as uptime, functionality or performance. If we are unable to meet the stated service level commitments for these customers, or suffer extended periods of service unavailability, we are or may be contractually obligated to provide these customers with credits for future subscriptions, provide services at no cost or pay other penalties, which could adversely impact our profitability. Additionally, if our contracted or physical capacity is unable to keep up with our growing needs, this could have an adverse effect on our business. Our disaster recovery systems are located at our third-party hosting facilities. We use a redundant architecture and regularly review and increase capacity. However, our systems have not been tested under all disaster conditions and may not have sufficient capacity to recover all data and services in the event of an outage. In the event of a disaster in which our disaster recovery systems are irreparably damaged or destroyed, we would experience interruptions in access to our services. Any changes in third-party service levels at our data centers or any errors, defects, disruptions, or other performance problems with our solutions could harm our reputation and may damage our data. Interruptions in our services could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition, cause us to issue refunds to customers, subject us to potential liability, or adversely affect our subscriber retention rates.\nIn South Africa we are reliant on Eskom (South African Power Utility), which has had challenges in meeting the country\u2019s power demand, resulting in load shedding and intermittent power outages. Although it has not resulted in our operations being impacted directly, not having power in some of the Global System for Mobile Communications (\u201cGSM\u201d) signal towers may impact our ability to locate and track vehicles in that area.\nOur solutions rely on third-party software and any inability to license such software from third parties could render our solutions ineffectual.\nWe rely on software and other intellectual property licensed from third parties, including mapping software and data from Google and Here, to develop and provide solutions to our customers. In addition, we may need to obtain future licenses from third parties to use software or other intellectual property associated with our solutions. We cannot assure you that these licenses will be available to us on acceptable terms, without significant price increases or at all. Any loss of the right or inability to obtain the right to use any such software or other intellectual property required for the development and maintenance of our solutions could result in interruptions in the provision of our solutions until\nequivalent technology is either developed by us, or, if available from others, is identified, obtained, and integrated, which could harm our business.\nIn addition, we incorporate some open source software into our platform. The terms of many open source licenses to which we are subject have not been interpreted by U.S. courts or courts of other jurisdictions, and there is a risk that those licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our solutions. In that event, we could be required to seek licenses from third parties in order to continue offering our solutions, to re-develop our solutions, to discontinue sales of our solutions, or to release our proprietary software source code under the terms of an open-source license, any of which could adversely affect our business.\nWe depend on third-party technology, including cellular and GPS networks, and any disruption, failure or increase in costs could impede the functionality of our solutions.\nTwo critical links in our current solutions are between in-vehicle devices and GPS satellites, and between in-vehicle devices and cellular networks, which allow us to obtain location data and transmit it to our system. Increases in the fees charged by cellular carriers for data transmission or changes in the cellular networks, such as a cellular carrier discontinuing support of the network currently used by our in-vehicle devices, requiring retrofitting of our in-vehicle devices, could increase our costs and impact our profitability. We have initiated activities to migrate new installations to the next generation of cellular network compatibility, in order to maximize expected useful life of our in-vehicle devices. However, cellular carriers could in the future discontinue support for our currently utilized cellular technologies. Also, while we have included the ability to store GPS data in our in-vehicle devices in case of temporary cellular network connectivity failure, widespread disruptions or extended failures of the cellular networks would adversely affect our solutions\u2019 functionality and utility and harm our financial results.\nGPS is a satellite-based navigation and positioning system consisting of a network of orbiting satellites. These satellites and their ground support systems are complex electronic systems, subject to electronic and mechanical failures and possible sabotage and it is not certain that the U.S. government will remain committed to the operation and maintenance of GPS satellites in the future. In addition, technologies that rely on GPS depend on the use of radio frequency bands and any modification of the permitted uses of these bands may adversely affect the functionality of GPS and, in turn, our solutions. The satellites and their ground control and monitoring stations are maintained and operated by the U.S. Department of Defense, which does not currently charge users for access to the satellite signals and does not impose on the ability to access location data. We cannot assure you that it will not do so in the future. Any disruption, failure, increase in costs or regulatory hurdles could impede the functionality and/or cost of our solutions, which could adversely affect our business. The communication systems that we use to host and transmit data may be subject to security incidents, which may also subject the Company to regulatory enforcement and client pressures.\nOur solutions integrate with third-party technologies and if our solutions become incompatible with these technologies, our solutions would lose functionality and our customer acquisition and retention could be adversely affected.\nOur solutions integrate with third-party software and devices to allow our solutions to perform key functions. We cannot guarantee that this ease of integration will continue or that we will be able to integrate with other products at all or without additional cost. Additionally, previously unidentified errors, viruses or bugs may also be present in third-party software that our customers use in conjunction with our solutions. Changes to third-party software that our customers use in conjunction with our solutions could also render our solutions ineffective. Customers may conclude that our software is the cause of these errors, bugs or viruses and terminate their subscriptions. The inability to easily integrate with, or the presence of any defects in, any third-party software could result in increased costs, or in delays in software releases or updates to our products until such issues have been resolved, which could damage our reputation and materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to South Africa\nFluctuations in the value of the South African Rand have had, and will continue to have, a significant impact on our reported revenues and results of operations, which may make it difficult to evaluate our business performance between reporting periods and may also adversely affect the price of our ADSs.\nThe majority of our subscription agreements and operating expenses are incurred outside the United States and denominated in foreign currencies and are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly changes in the South African Rand. Currency fluctuations, particularly those in respect of the South African\nRand, may positively or negatively impact our reported income and expenses due to the effects of translating the functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries into our reporting currency of U.S. Dollars.\nThe majority of our revenues are derived from currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. Dollar, will negatively impact our revenues and income as reported in U.S. Dollars. The depreciation of the Rand may also negatively impact the prices at which our ADR\u2019s trade.\nDue to the significant fluctuation in the value of the South African Rand and its impact on our results, you may find it difficult to compare our results of operations between financial reporting periods. This difficulty may have a negative impact on the price of our ADSs and/or increase their volatility. During fiscal year 2021, the South African Rand weakened by 10.8% against the U.S. Dollar (Rand/U.S. Dollar exchange rate averaged R16.37 and fluctuated between a high of R18.59 and a low of R14.78). This compared to an average exchange rate of R14.78 during fiscal year 2020 (which fluctuated between a high of R17.92 and a low of R13.90). The South African Rand exchange rate is affected by various international and South African political factors and economic conditions resulting since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAs stated above we operate internationally and are exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currency exposures, primarily with respect to the South African Rand, the Euro, the Australian Dollar, Brazilian Real and the British Pound. These exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows. Fluctuation in currency exchange rates impacts our operating results. We have implemented a foreign currency hedging policy to reduce our net exposure, on certain recognized assets and liabilities, to fluctuations in foreign currencies. Our policy is primarily based on economic hedging principles of managing certain of our on balance sheet risk, as opposed to using derivative financial instruments. We do not attempt to hedge currency translation risk. Our future attempts to hedge against foreign currency risk could be unsuccessful and expose us to losses.\nIf we do not achieve applicable black economic empowerment objectives in our South African businesses, we risk not being able to renew certain of our existing contracts which service South African government and quasi-governmental customers, as well as not being awarded future corporate and governmental contracts which would result in the loss of revenue.\nThe South African government established a legislative framework for the promotion of Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment (\u201cB-BBEE\u201d). Achievement of B-BBEE objectives is measured by a scorecard which establishes a weighting for the various components of B-BBEE which relate to ownership, enterprise and supplier development and socio-economic development. The B-BBEE codes are regularly updated.\nIt is important for us to achieve applicable B-BBEE objectives to ensure sustainability and contribute towards the realization of the National Development Plan 2030. In addition, B-BBEE objectives are pursued, in significant part, by requiring parties who contract with corporate, governmental and state owned enterprises in South Africa to achieve B-BBEE compliance through satisfaction of an applicable scorecard. Parties improve their B-BBEE contributor level when contracting with businesses that have earned good B-BBEE contributor levels in relation to their scorecards.\nWe have three material end-customers, which require MiX Telematics Enterprise SA Proprietary Limited to maintain at least a B-BBEE contributor level 3 as measured under the new B-BBEE codes in addition to at least one requiring additional commitments in terms of skills development and sub-contracting of at least 30% of the contract value to a Small Black Owned Supplier. The value of these contracts represented 2.7% of our total revenue for fiscal year 2021. MiX Telematics Enterprise SA Proprietary Limited has attained the agreed compliance targets in fiscal year 2021 and furthermore improved not only their position on the scorecard to the highest level possible but also its Black ownership in particular that of Black Women following the conclusion of the sales of assets as allowed for in the B-BBEE codes. Failing to achieve applicable B-BBEE objectives could jeopardize our ability to maintain existing business or to secure future business from corporate, governmental or state-owned enterprises that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe currently have continued recognition of Black ownership by previous shareholders, until the end of fiscal 2022. The continuing consequences principle enables companies to continue claiming points for ownership based on the number of years the Black participants held shares before selling them. With a portion of the continuing consequences recognition coming to an end during fiscal year 2022, it is important for MiX Telematics to explore a Black shareholder opportunity at the Group level in order to recognize flow-through to all South African entities.\nThe B-BBEE reporting requirements are extremely onerous around the preferential procurement aspect, in that companies must now submit detailed information of suppliers with the compliance report.\nWe face the risk of disruption from labor disputes and changes to South African labor laws, which could result in significant additional operating costs or alter our relationship with our employees.\nOur operations may be materially affected by changes to labor laws. South African laws relating to labor that regulate work time, provide for mandatory compensation in the event of termination of employment for operational reasons, and impose monetary penalties for non-compliance with administrative and reporting requirements in respect of affirmative action policies, could result in significant costs. In addition, future changes to South African legislation and regulations relating to labor may increase our costs or alter our relationship with our employees. The resulting disruptions could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nSocio-economic inequality in South Africa or regionally may subject us to political and economic risks which may affect the ownership or operation of our business.\nWe are incorporated and own significant operations in South Africa. As a result, we are subject to political and economic risks relating to South Africa. South Africa was transformed from a racially based government into a democracy in 1994, with successful rounds of democratic elections held under a modern constitution during 1994, 1999, 2004, 2009, 2014 and most recently, in May 2019. The next national elections are scheduled to be held in 2024. We fully support government policies aimed at redressing the disadvantages suffered by the majority of citizens under the previous non-democratic dispensation and recognize that in order to implement these policies, our operations and profits may be impacted. However, South Africa faces many challenges in overcoming substantial racial differences in levels of economic and social development among its people. While South Africa features highly developed and sophisticated business sectors and financial and legal infrastructure at the core of its economy, large parts of the country\u2019s black population, particularly in rural areas, do not have access to adequate education, health care, housing and other services, including water and electricity. In addition, South Africa also has a higher level of unemployment than the United States.\nThe ruling party which has controlled the South African government since democracy has committed itself to creating a stable, democratic, free market economy, which it has achieved to a great extent. It remains difficult however, to predict the future political, social and economic direction of South Africa or the manner in which any future government will attempt to address the country\u2019s inequalities. It is also difficult to predict the impact that addressing these inequalities will have on our business. Furthermore, there has been regional, political and economic instability in countries neighboring South Africa, which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAlthough political conditions in South Africa are generally stable, changes may occur in the composition of its ruling party or in its political, fiscal and legal systems which might affect the ownership or operation of our business, which may, in turn, materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. These risks may include changes in legislation, arbitrary interference with private ownership of contract rights, and changes to exchange controls, taxation and other laws or policies affecting foreign trade or investment and could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Any changes in investment ratings, regulations and policies or a shift in political attitudes both within and towards South Africa are beyond our control and could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA lack of growth, high inflation or increased interest rates in the South African economy could reduce our anticipated revenue and increase our operating costs.\nThe South African Reserve Bank estimated and expects gross domestic product (\u201cGDP\u201d) to grow by 3.8% in 2021. The same report indicated that GDP is expected to grow by 2.4% in 2022 and 2.5% in 2023. The International Monetary Fund, in April 2021, indicated that the South African economy is expected to grow by 3.1% per annum in 2021.\nCurrent economic projections are uncertain as a result of the unpredictable evolution of COVID-19, potential further lockdowns globally, delays in the rollout of vaccination programs and different rates of economic recovery globally. The South African economy has in the past and may in the future continue to be characterized by rates of inflation and interest rates that are substantially higher than those prevailing in the United States and other developed economies. The Reserve Bank is expecting inflation to rise to the midpoint between 3% and 6% of the target band, reaching 4.5% in 2023.\nThese economic conditions may be further impacted by the South African credit ratings from the three major credit rating agencies, All three major rating agencies kept the South African credit ratings on Non-Investment Grade Speculative, however all three rating agencies have downgraded South Africa one rating on their rating scale. All rating agencies had a negative outlook.\n\u2022Standard & Poor\u2019s lowered the South African sovereign credit rating to BB- into non-investment grade on April 29, 2020;\n\u2022Fitch maintained a sub-investment grade from BB to BB- and maintained a negative outlook on November 21, 2020; and\n\u2022Moody\u2019s maintained sub-investment grade with a negative outlook on November 21, 2020, however they lowered the rating from Ba1 to Ba2.\nConsequently, economic conditions in South Africa could reduce our anticipated revenue growth, increase our South African-based costs, decrease our operating margins and adversely affect our ability to obtain cost-effective debt financing in South Africa.\nOur financial flexibility could be constrained by South African currency restrictions, which, in turn, could hinder our normal corporate functioning.\nSouth African companies are subject to exchange control limitations, which could hinder our normal corporate functioning, particularly given our significant expansion outside of South Africa in recent years. Exchange controls have been relaxed in recent years and may continue to be relaxed. However, South African companies remain subject to certain restrictions on their ability to raise and deploy capital outside of the Southern African Common Monetary Area, which includes South Africa, Namibia, Lesotho and Swaziland. These restrictions have affected the manner in which we have financed our acquisitions outside South Africa. These restrictions or any adverse changes to these restrictions could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to an Investment in our Ordinary Shares and ADSs\nSales of our ordinary shares may adversely affect the prices of our ordinary shares and ADSs.\nSales of substantial amounts of our ordinary shares in the public market, including sales by our officers, directors and principal shareholders, or the perception that such sales may occur, could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our ordinary shares or our ADSs as well as our ability to raise capital through an offering of our securities. In the future, we may also sponsor the sale of shares currently held by some of our shareholders, or issue new shares. We can make no prediction as to the timing of any such sales or the effect, if any, that future sales of our ordinary shares, or the availability of our ordinary shares for future sale, will have on the market price of our ordinary shares or ADSs prevailing from time to time.\nThe price of our ordinary shares or ADSs may be volatile and fluctuate significantly, which could result in substantial losses for investors.\nMarket prices for our securities may be volatile in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. Such volatility could negatively impact the perceived value and market prices of our ordinary shares or ADSs. In addition to the risks described in this \u2018Risk Factors\u2019 section of the annual report, some of the factors that may cause these market prices to fluctuate include:\n\u2022actual or anticipated fluctuations in our financial results or the financial results of our competitors;\n\u2022loss of existing customers or inability to attract new customers;\n\u2022actual or anticipated changes in our growth rate;\n\u2022our announcement of results for a financial reporting period that are lower than expected, whether caused by our results of operations or by currency fluctuations;\n\u2022changes in estimates of our financial results or recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u2022failure of any of our solutions to achieve or maintain market acceptance;\n\u2022changes in market valuations of similar companies;\n\u2022changes in our capital structure, including issuances or repurchases of securities or the incurrence of debt;\n\u2022announcements by us or our competitors of significant products, technologies, services, contracts, acquisitions, or strategic alliances;\n\u2022success of competitive products or services;\n\u2022regulatory developments in South Africa, the United States or other countries;\n\u2022actual or threatened litigation involving us or our industry;\n\u2022additions or departures of key personnel;\n\u2022breaches of security;\n\u2022general perception of the future of the fleet and mobile asset management market or our solutions;\n\u2022sales of ADSs or ordinary shares by our shareholders;\n\u2022the outbreak of COVID-19 globally and the impact thereof on our results, economic activities, the business of various sectors and the adverse market conditions created as a result of the pandemic;\n\u2022ADS price and volume fluctuations attributable to inconsistent trading volume levels of our ADSs; and\n\u2022changes in general economic, industry, and market conditions.\nWe issue quarterly press releases and other disclosure of our financial results. Our quarterly operating results will fluctuate in the future as a result of a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, impact of COVID-19 on our business and the businesses of our customers, our ability to accurately forecast revenue and appropriately plan our expenses, long sales cycles for our enterprise fleet management solutions, service outages or security breaches and any related occurrences which could impact our reputation as well as fluctuations in currency exchange rates. If our quarterly operating results or guidance fall below the expectations of research analysts or investors, the price of our ordinary shares and ADSs could decline substantially.\nIn addition, the stock market in general, and the market for technology companies in particular, has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. These broad market and industry factors may materially harm the market price of our ordinary shares and ADSs. Securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the overall market and in the market price of a company\u2019s securities. This litigation, if instituted against us, could result in very substantial costs, divert our management\u2019s attention and resources, and harm our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nExchange rate volatility may adversely affect the market price of our ADSs and any dividends payable to ADS holders.\nAs discussed above and further discussed below, there have been significant fluctuations in the exchange rate between the South African Rand and the U.S. Dollar, specifically since the outbreak of COVID-19 and the adverse market conditions created as a result. Unforeseen events in international markets, fluctuations in interest rates, changes in capital flows, political developments or inflation rates may cause further exchange rate instability that could, in turn, depress the value of the South African Rand, thereby decreasing the U.S. Dollar value of our ADSs and any dividends or distributions paid on the ordinary shares underlying the ADSs.\nOur shares trade on more than one market and this may result in price variations.\nOur ordinary shares have been traded on the JSE since 2007, and our ADSs have been traded on the New York Stock Exchange (the \u201cNYSE\u201d) since August 2013. Trading in our ordinary shares and ADSs on these markets takes place in U.S. Dollars on the NYSE and South African Rand on the JSE, and at different times, resulting from different time zones, trading days and public holidays in the United States and South Africa. The trading prices of our ordinary shares and ADSs on these two markets may differ due to these and other factors. Any decrease in the price of our ordinary shares on the JSE could cause a corresponding decrease in the trading price of our ADSs on the NYSE.\nWe reported a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting in the prior fiscal year. Although we have remediated the material weakness, we cannot assure you that other material weaknesses will not occur. An ineffective control environment might impair our ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements, which could adversely affect our operating results, our ability to operate our business and investors\u2019 and customers\u2019 view of us.\nUnder Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we are required to furnish a management certification and auditor attestation regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. We are required to report, among other things, control deficiencies that constitute a \u201cmaterial weakness\u201d or changes in internal control that materially affect, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, internal control over financial reporting. A \u201cmaterial weakness\u201d is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nIn 2020, we identified a material weakness related to ineffective financial close and reporting controls in the areas of management review of financial statement information and independent review of journal entries in our South African-based reporting segments. For a discussion of the material weakness and our remediation efforts, see Item 9A, Controls and Procedures, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Although we have remediated the previously reported material weakness, we cannot assure you that that other material weaknesses will not occur. The material weakness that was reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2020, related to the ineffective design and operation of the financial statement close and reporting controls in the areas of management review of financial statement information and independent review of journal entries in our South African-based reporting segments, was remediated as of March 31, 2021.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective internal control environment, our ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements could be impaired, which could adversely affect our operating results, our ability to operate our business, and investors\u2019 and customers\u2019 views of us. In addition, if we identify any additional material weaknesses in the future, the disclosure of that fact, even if quickly remediated could reduce the market\u2019s confidence in our financial statements and negatively affect the trading price of our ADSs.\nInherent limitations on the effectiveness of the system of disclosure controls and procedures could result in misstatement due to error or fraud going undetected.\nThere are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of the controls or the procedures. Accordingly, even disclosure controls and procedures designed and operating effectively, can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost effective system of internal controls, misstatement due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.\nCertain provisions of South African law may limit or otherwise discourage a takeover or business combination that could otherwise benefit our shareholders.\nVarious transactions including, without limitation, those which result in a person, or a group of persons acting in concert, holding shares entitled to exercise or cause to be exercised 35% or more of the voting rights at meetings of our shareholders will be subject to the Fundamental Transactions and Takeover Regulations (the \u201cTakeover Regulations\u201d), promulgated in terms of Section 196 of the Companies Act, which are regulated by the Takeover Regulation Panel. The Takeover Regulations impose various obligations in such circumstances including the requirement of an offer to minority shareholders.\nA transaction will be subject to the approval of the competition authorities in terms of the Competition Act, No. 89 of 1998, as amended (the \u201cCompetition Act\u201d), if it results in the acquisition of \u201ccontrol\u201d, as defined in the Competition Act and otherwise falls within the scope of the Competition Act. The Competition Act prohibits a transaction within its scope from being implemented without the necessary approvals.\nTo the extent applicable, a transaction may be subject to the JSE Listings Requirements as well as the approval of the Exchange Control Department of the South African Reserve Bank, and other applicable regulatory bodies. In addition, certain fundamental transactions such as mergers, amalgamations, schemes of arrangements and sales of a majority of a company\u2019s assets, require the approval of shareholders exercising 75% of the voting rights at a shareholders meeting, and\nif 15% or more of a company\u2019s shareholders vote against the transaction, any dissenting shareholder may, within five days, require the company, at its expense, to obtain court approval before implementing the resolution. Even if less than 15% of the shareholders vote against the resolution, any dissenting shareholder may apply to court for a review of the transaction. Such regulations, including the Takeover Regulations and the Competition Act, may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of us including an extraordinary transaction (such as a merger, tender offer, scheme of arrangement or sale of all or substantially all of our assets) that might provide a premium price for our shareholders.\nWe are a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d, and the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to smaller reporting companies may make our ordinary shares or ADSs less attractive to investors.\nWe are a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d as defined in the Exchange Act and have elected to take advantage of certain of the scaled disclosures available to smaller reporting companies, including simplified executive compensation disclosures in our filings. We cannot predict whether investors will find our ordinary shares or ADSs less attractive because of our reliance on any of these exemptions. If some investors find our ordinary shares or ADSs less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for such securities. As a result, investors in our ordinary shares or ADSs may experience a decrease, which could be substantial, in the value of such securities, including decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects, or a complete loss of their investment.\nThe concentration of ownership of our capital stock limits your ability to influence corporate matters.\nAt May 28, 2021, our executive officers, directors, current 5% or greater shareholders and entities affiliated with them, beneficially own 32,4% of our ordinary shares. This significant concentration of share ownership may adversely affect the trading price for our ordinary shares and ADSs because investors often perceive disadvantages in owning stock in companies with concentrated share ownership. In addition, these shareholders, acting together, may be able to control our management and affairs and matters requiring shareholder approval, including the election of directors and the approval of significant corporate transactions, such as mergers, consolidations or the sale of substantially all of our assets. Shareholders owning greater than 25% of our outstanding ordinary shares will have the ability to block certain corporate actions, including the issuance of additional equity securities for cash. See \u201cCertain provisions of South African law may limit our ability to issue securities and access the capital markets in the future, which could hinder our ability to raise capital in the future.\u201d Consequently, this concentration of ownership may have the effect of exacerbating the delays and limitations on capital market transactions and could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nCertain provisions of South African law may limit our ability to issue securities and access the capital markets in the future, which could hinder our ability to raise capital in the future.\nThe authority of our Board of Directors to issue additional securities is limited by the JSE Listings Requirements and certain provisions of the Companies Act and our Memorandum of Incorporation, and as a result we may be unable to access the capital markets on a timely basis when it is opportune to do so. Under the JSE Listings Requirements, the issuance of equity securities, or securities convertible into equity securities, for cash by our Board of Directors requires shareholder approval, either by means of a specific authority for a specific transaction or by way of a general authority, for a limited time period. If a general authority is not in place, we may experience extended delays and uncertainty in seeking shareholder approval for financing transactions and as a result we may be unable to execute financing transactions with available investors, on advantageous terms or at all. Moreover, while a general authority could allow our Board of Directors to issue for cash additional ordinary shares representing up to 30% of the ordinary shares outstanding at the time of the general authorization, as a practical matter, shareholders in the South African market are often reluctant to grant general authorities up to the 30% threshold. The Company has sought a general authority to issue equity securities, or securities convertible into equity securities, for cash, limited to 5% of the ordinary shares outstanding at the time the general authorization is sought. A general authorization would not permit our Board of Directors to issue ordinary shares for cash with a greater than 10% discount to the 30-day volume-weighted average price, as of the issuance date, which, if we were to experience significant financial difficulties in the future, could prevent us from obtaining funds when needed. Shareholders owning greater than 25% of our outstanding ordinary shares have the ability to block an issuance of ordinary shares for cash. The Company has sought a further limited authority approving the placement of the authorized but unissued shares of the Company under the control of directors who may issue such shares in their discretion. This authority, if approved by a majority of shareholders, is only valid until the Company\u2019s next annual general meeting or until renewed; is in line with the Memorandum of Incorporation and provides limited flexibility to execute financing transactions or any approval of a general authorization to our Board of Directors. While we will be able to issue non-\nconvertible debt securities without shareholder approval, we will not be able to grant any voting rights to debt holders, which would be likely to increase the cost of any such debt issuance to the Company.\nThe relative volatility and illiquidity of the South African securities markets may substantially limit your ability to sell the ordinary shares underlying our ADSs at the price and time you desire.\nOur ordinary shares are listed for trading on the JSE. Investing in securities that trade in emerging markets, such as South Africa, often involves greater risk than investing in the securities of issuers in the United States, and such investments are generally considered to be more speculative in nature. The South African securities market is substantially smaller, less liquid, more concentrated and can be more volatile than major securities markets in the United States. The South African securities market was also severely impacted by the outbreak of COVID-19. There is also significantly greater concentration in the South African securities markets than in major securities markets in the United States. On May 28, 2021, the JSE total market capitalization amounted to R18,949.5 billion ($1,376.7 billion) and this market capitalization was represented by 331 companies. Accordingly, although you are entitled to withdraw the ordinary shares underlying our ADSs from the depositary at any time, your ability to sell such shares at a price and time you desire may be substantially limited. The Bank of New York Mellon (\u201cBNYM\u201d) serves as the depositary (the \u201cdepositary\u201d) with respect to the ADSs.\nHolders of our ADSs in the United States may have difficulty bringing actions and enforcing judgements, against us, our directors and our executive officers based on the civil liabilities provisions of the federal securities laws or other laws of the United States or any state thereof.\nWe are incorporated in South Africa; however, half of our directors and the majority of our senior management reside within of the United States. The rest of the directors, senior management and certain experts names herein, either reside in South Africa or other jurisdictions. A portion of the assets of these persons and substantially all of the Company\u2019s assets are therefore located outside of the United States. As a result, it may not be possible for investors to enforce against these persons or us a judgement obtained in a United States court predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the federal securities or other laws of the United States or any state thereof. South Africa is also not party to any international treaty or convention relating to the enforcement of foreign judgements.\nA foreign judgement is not directly enforceable in South Africa, but constitutes a cause of action which will be enforced by South African courts provided that:\n\u2022the court that pronounced the judgement had jurisdiction (under its own laws) to entertain the case according to the principles recognized by South African law with reference to the jurisdiction of foreign courts;\n\u2022the defendant was a resident subject to the foreign court\u2019s jurisdiction or was at least present in the foreign court\u2019s jurisdiction at the commencement of the action, or must have submitted to that court\u2019s jurisdiction either contractually or by conduct, in the latter instance, by defending the case on its merits;\n\u2022the judgement is final and conclusive (that is, it cannot be altered by the court which pronounced it);\n\u2022the judgement has not lapsed or been satisfied;\n\u2022the recognition and enforcement of the judgement by South African courts would not be contrary to public policy, including observance of the rules of natural justice which require that the documents initiating the United States proceeding were properly served on the defendant and that the defendant was given the right to be heard and represented by counsel in a free and fair trial before an impartial tribunal;\n\u2022the judgement was not obtained by fraudulent means;\n\u2022the judgement does not involve the enforcement of a penal or revenue law of the foreign state; and\n\u2022the enforcement of the judgement is not otherwise precluded by the provisions of the South African Protection of Businesses Act of 1978, as amended.\nIt is the policy of South African courts to award compensation for the loss or damage actually sustained by the person to whom the compensation is awarded. Although the award of punitive damages is generally unknown to the South African legal system that does not mean that such awards are necessarily contrary to public policy. Whether a judgement was contrary to public policy depends on the facts of each case. Exorbitant, unconscionable, or excessive awards will\ngenerally be contrary to public policy. South African courts cannot enter into the merits of a foreign judgement and cannot act as a court of appeal or review over the foreign court. South African courts will usually implement their own procedural laws and, where an action based on an international contract is brought before a South African court, the capacity of the parties to the contract will usually be determined in accordance with South African law.\nIt is doubtful whether an original action based on U.S. federal securities laws may be brought before South African courts. A plaintiff who is not a resident in South Africa may be required to provide security for costs in the event of proceedings being initiated in South Africa. Furthermore, the Rules of the High Court of South Africa require that documents executed outside South Africa must be notarially authenticated for the purpose of use in South Africa.\nHolders of our ADSs may not receive dividend payments, which could cause you to lose some or all of the value of any dividend distribution.\nUnder the terms of our deposit agreement with the depositary for our ADSs, the depositary will convert any cash dividend or other cash distribution we pay on the ordinary shares underlying the ADSs into U.S. Dollars, if it can do so on a reasonable basis and can transfer the U.S. Dollars to the United States. If this conversion is not possible or if any government approval becomes necessary and cannot be obtained, the deposit agreement allows the depositary to distribute the foreign currency only to those ADS holders to whom it is permissible to do so. If the exchange rate fluctuates significantly during a time when the depositary cannot convert the foreign currency or distribute a payment to you, you may lose some or all of the value of any dividend distribution. We consider the issuance of such dividends on a quarter-by-quarter basis.\nHolders of our ADSs may be subject to additional risks related to holding ADSs rather than ordinary shares.\nADS holders do not hold ordinary shares directly and thus are subject to, among others, the following additional risks:\n\u2022as an ADS holder, we will not treat you as one of our shareholders and you will not be able to exercise shareholder rights, except through the depositary as permitted by the deposit agreement;\n\u2022distributions on the ordinary shares represented by your ADSs will be paid to the depositary, and before the depositary makes a distribution to you on behalf of your ADSs, any withholding taxes that must be paid will be deducted. Additionally, if the exchange rate fluctuates during a time when the depositary cannot convert the foreign currency, you may lose some or all of the value of the distribution; and\n\u2022we and the depositary may amend or terminate the deposit agreement without the ADS holders\u2019 consent in a manner that could prejudice ADS holders.\nYou must act through the depositary to exercise your voting rights, as a result of which you may be unable to exercise your voting rights on a timely basis.\nAs a holder of ADSs, and not the ordinary shares underlying your ADSs, we will not treat you as one of our shareholders and you will not be able to exercise shareholder rights. The depositary will be the holder of the ordinary shares underlying your ADSs, and ADS holders will be able to exercise voting rights with respect to the ordinary shares represented by the ADSs only in accordance with the deposit agreement relating to the ADSs. There are practical limitations on the ability of ADS holders to exercise their voting rights due to the additional procedural steps involved in communicating with these holders. For example, holders of our ordinary shares will receive notice of shareholders\u2019 meetings by mail, the securities exchange news service of the JSE or by other means and will be able to exercise their voting rights by either attending the meeting in person or voting by proxy. ADS holders, by comparison, will not receive notice directly from us. Instead, in accordance with the deposit agreement, we will provide notice of any applicable meeting date to the depositary as soon as practicable. If we ask it to do so, as soon as practicable after receiving notice from us of any such meeting, the depositary will mail to holders of ADSs the notice of the meeting and a statement as to the manner in which voting instructions may be given by holders. Subject to satisfaction of the foregoing standard, there is no specified number of days within which the depositary must mail ADS holders the notice of meeting and voting instructions. To exercise their voting rights, ADS holders must then instruct the depositary as to voting the ordinary shares represented by their ADSs. Due to these procedural steps involving the depositary, the process for exercising voting rights may take longer for ADS holders than for holders of ordinary shares. The ordinary shares represented by ADSs for which the depositary fails to receive timely voting instructions may not be voted at all.\nJudgements of South African courts with respect to our ADSs will be payable only in South African Rand, which could expose any prevailing party to exchange rate risk until the judgement is collected.\nIf proceedings are brought in a South African court seeking to enforce the rights of holders of the ADSs, any judgement made in favor of such holders, even if the judgement is on an obligation deemed to be denominated in U.S. Dollars, could only be made or awarded in South African Rand based on the exchange rate in effect at the time the judgement is entered. The prevailing party in such proceeding would therefore bear exchange rate risk until the judgement could be collected and converted into another currency.\nBy purchasing ADSs, holders will irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of state or federal courts in New York, New York in connection with any legal suit, action or proceeding relating to the deposit agreement or our ADSs.\nBy purchasing ADSs or an interest therein, holders of ADSs irrevocably agree that any legal suit, action or proceeding against or involving us or the depositary, arising out of or based upon the deposit agreement or the ADSs, may only be instituted in a state or federal court in New York, New York, and by purchasing ADSs or an interest therein holders irrevocably waive any objection to the laying of venue of any such proceeding. We have agreed to indemnify the depositary and its agents under certain circumstances. Neither the depositary nor any of its agents will be liable to holders or beneficial owners of ADSs or interests in ADSs for any indirect, special, punitive or consequential damages (including, without limitation, lost profits) of any form incurred by any person or entity, whether or not foreseeable and regardless of the type of action in which such a claim may be brought.\nThere is a risk that we will be classified as a passive foreign investment company (\u201cPFIC\u201d), which could result in adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences to U.S. holders of ordinary shares or our ADSs.\nWe may be classified as a PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes, which could result in adverse U.S. federal income tax consequence to U.S. holders.\nBased on the current price of our ADSs and the composition of our income and assets, we do not believe that we are a PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes for our current taxable year ended March 31, 2021. However, a separate determination must be made after the close of each taxable year as to whether we are a PFIC. We cannot assure you that we will not be a PFIC for any future taxable year. If we were treated as a PFIC for any taxable year during which a U.S. holder held an equity share or an ADS, certain adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences could apply to the U.S. holder.",

During fiscal 2020, we acquired property located in Midrand, South Africa, which we previously leased from TPF Investments Proprietary Limited, a company over which Robin Frew (non-executive Chairperson of the Company) exercised significant influence.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nCompetition Commission Matter\nOn April 15, 2019, the Competition Commission of South Africa (the \u201cCommission\u201d) referred a matter to the Competition Tribunal of South Africa (\u201cTribunal\u201d). The Commission contends that the Company and a number of its channel partners have engaged in market division. Should the Tribunal rule against MiX Telematics, the Company may be liable for an administrative penalty under the Competition Act, No. 89 of 1998. The Company had cooperated fully with the Commission during its preliminary investigation. We cannot predict the timing of a resolution or the ultimate outcome of the matter, however, the Company and its external legal advisers continue to believe that we have consistently adhered to all applicable laws and regulations and that the referral from the Commission is without merit. We have therefore not made any provisions for this matter as yet as we do not believe that an outflow of economic resources is probable.\nThe Ugandan Value Added Tax (\u201cVAT\u201d) matter\nThe Ugandan Revenue Authorities (\u201cURA\u201d) have reviewed MiX Telematics\u2019 cross-border services and assert that VAT is payable on these imported services in terms of the place of supply rules included within its local VAT legislation. On January 18, 2018, MiX East Africa instituted proceedings in the Tax Appeals Tribunal to challenge the URA\u2019s decision on this matter based on the interpretation of the law and calculation errors by the URA. MiX East Africa appeared in front of the Tax Appeals Tribunal on a number of occasions to present its defense, but the Tax Appeals Tribunal ruled in favor of the URA. On September 19, 2019, MiX East Africa appealed the decision to the High Court of Uganda. This matter is ongoing, and provisions have been made based on current information at hand.\nPatent Infringement matter\nPerDiemCo, LLC v. MiX Telematics Limited and MiX Telematics North America, Inc. (Case No. 2:21-cv-00190, United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas): This patent infringement case was filed on May 29, 2021, in United States federal court in the Eastern District of Texas. In the complaint, PerDiemCo alleges that MiX Telematics\u2019 \u201cELD and geo-fencing products and services\u201d including \u201cMiX On-Board Computers (e.g. 3000 or 4000 Series products),\u201d MiX Rovi II, MiX Fleet Manager, and MiX Telematics\u2019 related Software as a Service infringe United States patent numbers 10,382,966; 10,021,198; 9,871,874; 9,680,941; 10,277,689; 10,602,364; 10,284,662; 10,397,789; 10,819,809; 10,171,950.

MiX Telematics is preparing its response to the complaint.\nFrom time to time, we have been and may become involved in further legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business and, while there can be no assurance, the Company currently believes that the ultimate outcome of these other legal actions will not have a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.",

MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included in Item 8 of this annual report on Form 10-K.\nThis discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our future results may vary materially from those indicated as a result of the risks that affect our business, including, among others, those identified in \u201cForward-Looking Statements\u201d and \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors\u201d.\nOverview\nWe are a leading global provider of connected fleet and mobile asset solutions delivered as Software as a Service (\u201cSaaS\u201d). Our solutions deliver a measurable return by enabling our customers to manage, optimize and protect their investments in commercial fleets or personal vehicles. We generate actionable insights that enable a wide range of customers, from large enterprise fleets to small fleet operators and consumers, to reduce fuel and other operating costs, improve efficiency, enhance regulatory compliance, enhance driver safety, manage risk and mitigate theft. Our solutions mostly rely on our proprietary, highly scalable technology platforms, which allow us to collect, analyze and deliver information based on data from our customers\u2019 vehicles. Using an intuitive, web-based interface, dashboards or mobile apps, our fleet customers can access large volumes of real-time and historical data, monitor the location and status of their drivers and vehicles and analyze a wide number of key metrics across their fleet operations.\nWe were founded in 1996 and we have offices in South Africa, the United Kingdom, the United States, Uganda, Brazil, Australia, Romania, Thailand and the United Arab Emirates as well as a network of more than 130 fleet partners worldwide. MiX Telematics shares are publicly traded on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE: MIX) and MiX Telematics American Depositary Shares are listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE: MIXT).\nWe derive the majority of our revenues from subscriptions to our fleet and mobile asset management solutions. Our subscriptions generally include access to our SaaS solutions, connectivity, and in many cases, use of an in-vehicle device. We also generate revenues from the sale of in-vehicle devices, which enable customers to use our subscription-based solutions, installation services of our in-vehicle-devices and driver training for fleet customers. We generate sales through the efforts of our direct sales teams, staffed in our regional sales offices, and through our global network of distributors and dealers. Our direct sales teams focus on marketing our fleet solutions to global and multinational enterprise accounts and to other large customer accounts located in regions of the world where we maintain a direct sales presence. Our direct sales teams have industry expertise across multiple industries, including oil and gas, transportation and logistics, government and municipal, bus and coach, rental and leasing, and utilities. In some markets, we rely on a network of distributors and dealers to sell our solutions on our behalf. Our distributors and dealers also install our in-vehicle devices and provide training, technical support and ongoing maintenance for the customers they support.\nImpact of COVID-19\nIn December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus was reported in China (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d). In January 2020, the World Health Organization (\u201cWHO\u201d) declared this outbreak a Public Health Emergency of international concern and, subsequently, it was declared a pandemic in March 2020. The outbreak continued to spread globally, affecting global economic activity and financial markets. We have considered the impact of COVID-19 including its impact on expected credit losses and potential goodwill impairments, however numerous uncertainties remain, including the severity of the disease, the duration of the outbreak, actions that may be taken by governmental authorities, the impact on our customers and other factors identified in Item 1A. \u201cRisk Factors - The extent to which the COVID-19 outbreak and measures taken in response thereto impact our business, results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and are difficult to predict.\u201d in this Form 10-K.\nBusiness, employees and operations\nDue to extensive measures implemented by various governments, all of our employees were required to work remotely, with the exception of our staff working in our monitoring centers, which were classified as an essential service. We have implemented appropriate safeguards for these centers. In addition, we have modified certain business and\nworkforce practices (including extended work from home requirements, suspension of certain business travel and cancellation of certain physical participation in meetings, events and conferences) and implemented new protocols to promote social distancing and enhance sanitary measures in our offices and facilities to conform to government restrictions and best practices encouraged by governmental and regulatory authorities.\nDuring the first quarter of fiscal year 2021, we implemented various cost-saving measures, including headcount reductions, deferred salary increases, a hiring freeze across the business, and significant reductions in discretionary spending. We started to realize the benefit of these actions in the second quarter. As part of the headcount reductions in fiscal 2021, we incurred a $1.1 million restructuring charge as we committed to plans to restructure certain parts of our business as a measure to minimize the adverse economic and business effect of the COVID-19 pandemic and to re-align resources to our current business outlook and cost structure. The restructuring activities mainly related to the CSO, Africa Middle East and Australasia and North America reporting segments.\nCOVID-19 has disrupted the operations of our customers and channel partners, our operations and the results of our operations. COVID-19 currently has had and, we believe, will continue to have an adverse impact on global economies and financial markets. For example, the continued economic uncertainty in the oil and gas sector has resulted in significant declines in our customer\u2019s fleet sizes whilst similar disruption is evident in our bus and coach vertical following significantly reduced demand for public transport as a result of various governmental shut downs in multiple jurisdictions where we operate. This has and will continue to have a negative impact on our revenue and our results of operations, the size and duration of which we are currently unable to predict. During fiscal year 2021, we experienced a contraction of 73,800 subscribers as a result of the economic conditions attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic. The net contraction in subscribers resulted in a decrease in reported subscription revenues.\nCash resources and liquidity\nBased on our internal projections we believe that we have sufficient cash reserves to support us for the foreseeable future. Further details on our cash resources and borrowings available under our credit facilities are provided in the liquidity and capital resources section below.\nFinancial position and impairments\nWe have taken into account the impact of COVID-19, to the extent possible, on our financial statements as of reporting date. However, future changes in economic conditions related to COVID-19 could have an impact on future estimates and judgements used, particularly those relating to Goodwill sensitivities and impairment assessments, as well as expected credit losses. Refer to note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding Goodwill sensitivities. We will continue to evaluate the nature and extent of the impact to our business, consolidated results of operations, and financial condition.\nKey Financial Measures and Operating Metrics\nIn addition to financial measures based on our consolidated financial statements, we monitor our business operations using various financial and non-financial metrics.\nSubscription Revenue\nSubscription revenue represents subscription fees for our solutions, which include the use of our SaaS fleet management solutions, connectivity, and in many cases, our in-vehicle devices. Our subscription revenue is driven primarily by the number of subscribers and the monthly price per subscriber, which varies depending on the services and features customers require, hardware options, customer size and geographic location.\nSubscription revenue has increased as a percentage of total revenue due to a reduction in hardware and other revenue. In fiscal years 2019, 2020 and 2021, subscription revenue represented 85.7%, 87.6% and 89.3% respectively, of our total revenue. In fiscal years 2019, 2020 and 2021, our top 10 customers represented 24.9%, 23.7% and 21.8% respectively, of our subscription revenue.\nSubscribers\nSubscribers represent the total number of discrete services we provide to customers at the end of the period.\nFiscal Year Ended March 31,\n2019 2020 2021\nSubscribers 750,455 818,487 744,677\nFactors Affecting Our Performance\nLevel of Subscription Revenue and Hardware Revenue\nWe have historically been focused on growing our recurring subscription revenue base and entering into more fully bundled deals. As a result of an increase in the total subscriber base, and due to new and existing subscribers moving to fully-bundled subscriptions, subscription revenue has increased as a percentage of revenue. In fiscal year 2021, subscription-based revenues accounted for 89.3% of our total revenues, up from 87.6% in 2020 and 85.7% in 2019. Due to the uncertainty surrounding the level of business disruption as a result of the spread of COVID-19, the Company suspended its practice of issuing financial guidance during fiscal 2021 and has also not provided guidance for fiscal 2022.\nAs market conditions improve globally, we believe that we will be well positioned to grow our base of subscribers, by adding both fully-bundled subscriptions; subscriptions where the hardware has been purchased upfront and various add-on solutions that can drive incremental average revenue per user (\u201cARPU\u201d) expansion over time. We intend to maintain our investment in sales and marketing and continue to attract new subscribers by introducing attractive new features and services.\nAdditionally, we believe we have the opportunity to expand our fleet management market share among our existing customer base by demonstrating our value proposition, growing with the customer, introducing new and innovative value-added solutions and displacing legacy fleet management solutions.\nFluctuations in Exchange Rates\nRevenue from our international operations has historically represented a substantial portion of our total revenue. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. Dollar, will negatively affect our reported income and expenses as expressed in U.S. Dollars (our reporting currency). The South African Rand is the functional currency for the Company. Currency fluctuations in the South African Rand may positively or negatively impact our reported income and expenses due to the effects of translating the functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries into Rand at different average exchange rates and then translating into our reporting currency of U.S. Dollars.\nIn fiscal year 2021, the Rand weakened by 10.8% against the U.S. Dollar and by 13.7% against the British Pound, as shown in the table below.\nAverage exchange rate for Fiscal Year Ended March 31,\n2019 2020 2021\nSouth African Rand for U.S. Dollars (per $1.00) 13.75 14.78 16.37\n% movement 5.9 % 7.5 % 10.8 %\nSouth African Rand for British Pound (per \u00a31.00) 18.03 18.78 21.35\n% movement 4.8 % 4.2 % 13.7 %\nWe expect continued exchange rate volatility in the South African Rand against other major currencies. The South African Rand has been even more volatile due to the uncertain economic conditions including the effect of COVID-19 and it is uncertain how long this will continue. As of June 10, 2021, the South African Rand/U.S. Dollar exchange rate was 13.65, 16.6% stronger than the average exchange rate for fiscal 2021.\nMix of Subscribers with Different Revenue and Cost Economics\nWe offer services to a wide range of customers, from large enterprise vehicle fleets to small fleet operators and consumers. The subscription revenue and cost per subscriber and the subscriber retention pattern differ by type of subscriber. For example, our entry-level consumer solution, Beam-e, is characterized by lower revenue and lower cost per subscriber compared to our large enterprise solutions. Small fleet and consumer customers will enter into and terminate contracts much more frequently than our enterprise customers, thereby affecting subscriber retention. As the mix of our subscriber base evolves, the average revenue per subscriber and average cost per subscriber is likely to change.\nVarying Economic Conditions in our Markets\nWe seek to capitalize on opportunities and manage risks in our key markets, which are geographically dispersed with subscribers located in more than 120 countries worldwide. Overall, we believe that our presence across multiple geographic markets and our exposure to multiple economies provides us with diversification from the risk of changing economic conditions in any one country or region. Other macroeconomic factors, such as expectations for future crude oil and natural gas prices, affect our customers\u2019 spending habits. Prolonged or substantial declines in crude oil and/or natural gas prices, or the perception that such prices will decrease in the future, negatively impacts our net subscriber growth and hardware sales in this sector. In addition to macroeconomic changes, performance in any given region may vary due to multiple factors, including growth in subscribers, the overall profile of the customer base (for example, in Africa, we have a significant consumer subscriber base), the services and hardware options selected by particular subscribers and our distribution strategy in the region.\nChanges in regional conditions require management to formulate strategic responses that safeguard our financial position and maintain our balanced approach to producing revenue growth, profitability and cash flow.\nChanging Customer Needs and Ongoing Investment in Technology\nWe continuously analyze market trends and opportunities in the various geographies in which we operate and have identified an opportunity to increase subscription revenue growth by the addition of new products and services in certain of the regions in which we operate. Our investment in software development is core to our business strategy. Our software teams employ an agile software development methodology. We have made a significant investment in product development, and we have routinely been among the first to market with innovative solutions and features that cater to the needs of our customers. For example, major updates to the MiX Vision solution were made in fiscal year 2021, with MiX Vision AI poised for launch in calendar year 2021.\nLong Sales Cycle for Our Enterprise Fleet Management Solutions\nFrom period to period, our revenues may fluctuate depending upon the customer contracts we have secured. The typical sales cycle for large enterprise fleet management solutions contracts may be long, especially in comparison to the sales cycle for our consumer solutions. It may also be difficult for us to predict the timing of when we will enter into enterprise fleet management contracts.\nLonger sales cycles for large contracts, for both customers who purchase in-vehicle devices and those who opt for the fully bundled option, may affect the comparability of financial results in certain segments. Our revenue may fluctuate from period to period depending on the level and timing of hardware sales, while subscription revenue growth is also impacted by the timing of the rollout of large enterprise fleets. We are focused on mitigating these long sales cycles and the associated volatility by enhancing our sales pipeline management process, by increasing our sales and marketing investment levels across all geographical segments and by diversifying our customer segment focus.\nInvestment in Sales and Marketing\nWe offer our solutions in over 120 countries through a combination of our direct and indirect marketing efforts. Our sales and marketing strategy is segmented by geographic region and customer type in order to cost effectively target and acquire new customers. In certain regions, we sell subscriptions of our fleet management solutions to large enterprise fleets through our direct sales force. In other regions, and for sales to small fleet operators and consumers, we work with an extensive distribution network of regional partners and national distribution dealers. Through our central services organization headquartered in South Africa, we provide optimized marketing, product management, technical and distribution support to each of our regional sales and marketing operations. We continue to focus on growth and expect to continue to invest in sales and marketing to grow our customer base and to expand within existing customers.\nBasis of Presentation and Key Components of Our Results of Operations\nIn fiscal year 2021, we managed our business in six segments which include Africa, Americas, Brazil, Europe and the Middle East and Australasia (our regional sales offices (\u201cRSOs\u201d)), and our central services organization (\u201cCSO\u201d). CSO is our central services organization that wholesales our products and services to our RSOs which, in turn, interface with our end-customers, distributors and dealers. CSO is also responsible for the development of our hardware and software platforms and provides common marketing, product management, technical and distribution support to each of our other operating segments.\nThe CODM, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the reportable segments, has been identified collectively as the executive committee and the Chief Executive Officer who make strategic decisions. Segment performance is measured and evaluated by the CODM using Segment Adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP measure which uses net income, determined under International Financial Reporting Standards (\u201cIFRS\u201d) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board, as a starting point. Prior to the publication of the financial results for the year ended March 31, 2020, we published results under IFRS only, which is the reason for the CODM using a segment performance measure based on IFRS.\nIn determining Segment Adjusted EBITDA, the margin generated by CSO, net of any unrealized intercompany profit, is allocated to the geographic region where the external revenue is recorded by our RSOs. The costs remaining in CSO relate mainly to research and development of hardware and software platforms, common marketing, product management and technical and distribution support to each of the RSOs.\nEach RSO\u2019s results reflect the external revenue earned, as well as the Segment Adjusted EBITDA earned (or loss incurred) before the remaining CSO and corporate costs allocations. Segment assets are not disclosed as this information is not reviewed by the CODM.\nRevenue\nThe majority of our revenue is subscription-based. Consequently, growth in subscribers influences our subscription revenue growth. However, other factors, including, but not limited to, the types of new subscribers we add and the timing of entry into subscription contracts also play a significant role. The price and terms of our customer subscription contracts vary based on a number of factors, including fleet size, hardware options, geographic region and distribution channel. In addition, we derive revenue from the sale of in-vehicle devices, which are used to collect, generate and transmit the data used to enable our SaaS solutions.\nOur customer contracts typically have a three to five year initial term. Following the initial term, most fleet customers elect to renew for fixed terms ranging from one to five years. Our third party dealers are typically billed monthly based on active connections. Some of our customer agreements, including our consumer subscriptions, provide for automatic monthly or yearly renewals unless the customer elects not to renew its subscription. Our consumer customer contracts in South Africa are governed by the Consumer Protection Act, which allows customers to cancel without paying the full balance of the contract amount. Our fleet contracts and our customer contracts outside of South Africa are generally non-cancellable.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue associated with our subscription revenue consists primarily of costs related to cellular communications, infrastructure hosting, third-party data providers, service contract maintenance costs, commission expense related to third party dealers or distributors (commission is capitalized and amortized unless the amortization period is 12 months or less) and depreciation of our capitalized installed in-vehicle devices. Cost of sales associated with our hardware revenue includes the cost of the in-vehicle devices, cost of hardware warranty, shipping costs, custom duties, and commission expense related to third party dealers or distributors. We capitalize the cost of in-vehicle devices utilized to service customers, for customers selecting our bundled option, and we depreciate these costs from the date of installation over their expected useful lives.\nWe expect that cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue will vary from period to period depending on our revenue mix, including the proportion of our revenue attributable to our subscription-based services. The majority of the other components of our cost of revenue are variable and are affected by the number of subscribers, the composition of our subscriber base, and the number of new subscriptions sold in the period.\nOperating Expenses\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and wages to sales and marketing employees, commissions paid to employees, travel-related expenses, and advertising and promotional costs. We pay our sales employees commissions based on achieving subscription targets and we capitalize commission and amortize it (unless the amortization period is 12 months or less). Advertising costs consist primarily of costs for print, radio and television advertising, promotions, public relations, customer events, tradeshows and sponsorships. We expense advertising costs as incurred. We plan to continue to invest in sales and marketing in order to grow our sales and build brand and category awareness.\nAdministration and Other Charges\nAdministration and other charges consist primarily of salaries and wages for administrative staff, travel costs, professional fees (including audit and legal fees), real estate leasing costs, expensed research and development costs and depreciation of fixed assets including vehicles and office equipment and amortization of intangible assets. We expect that administration and other charges will increase in absolute terms as we continue to grow our business.\nResearch and Development\nFor additional disclosures in respect of research and development, technology and intellectual property please refer to \u201cItem 1. Business\u201d.\nTaxes\nIn fiscal years 2019, 2020 and 2021 our effective tax rates were 39.9%, 47.2% and 15.3% respectively, compared to a South African statutory rate of 28%. Taxation mainly consists of normal statutory income tax paid or payable and deferred tax on any temporary differences.\nOur effective tax rate may vary primarily according to the mix of profits made in various jurisdictions and the impact of certain non-deductible/(non-taxable) foreign exchange movements, net of tax. A reconciliation of the actual tax rate to the South African tax rate of 28% is disclosed in note 10 to the consolidated financial statements. As a result, significant variances in future periods may occur.\nResults of operations\nThe following table sets forth certain Consolidated Statement of Income data:\nFor the year ended March 31,\n2019 2020 2021\n(In thousands)\nTotal revenue $ 143,705 $ 145,650 $ 126,894\nTotal cost of revenue 46,885 53,015 43,865\nGross profit 96,820 92,635 83,029\nSales and marketing 14,489 13,324 11,344\nAdministration and other 58,040 58,263 53,487\nIncome from operations 24,291 21,048 18,198\nOther income/(expense) 101 (299) (897)\nNet interest income/(expense) 233 67 (72)\nIncome tax expense 9,815 9,829 2,634\nNet income for the year 14,810 10,987 14,595\nNet income attributable to MiX Telematics Limited stockholders 14,810 10,987 14,595\nNet income attributable to non-controlling interest - - -\nNet income for the year $ 14,810 $ 10,987 $ 14,595\nThe following sets forth, as a percentage of revenue, Consolidated Statement of Income data:\nFor the year ended March 31,\n2019 2020 2021\n(Percentage)\nTotal revenue 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 %\nTotal cost of revenue 32.6 36.4 34.6\nGross profit 67.4 63.6 65.4\nSales and marketing 10.1 9.1 8.9\nAdministration and other 40.4 40.0 42.2\nIncome from operations 16.9 14.5 14.3\nOther income/(expense) 0.1 (0.2) (0.7)\nNet interest income/(expense) 0.2 - (0.1)\nIncome tax expense 6.8 6.7 2.0\nNet income for the year 10.3 7.5 11.5\nNet income attributable to MiX Telematics Limited stockholders 10.3 7.5 11.5\nNet income attributable to non-controlling interest - - -\nNet income for the year 10.3 7.5 11.5\nResults of Operations for Fiscal Year 2020 Compared to Fiscal Year 2021\nRevenue\nFor the year ended March 31,\n2020 2021 % Change % Change at constant currency\n(In thousands, except for percentages)\nSubscription revenue $ 127,570 $ 113,351 (11.1) % (6.1) %\nHardware and other revenue 18,080 13,543 (25.1) % (23.8) %\n$ 145,650 $ 126,894 (12.9) % (8.3) %\nOur total revenue decreased by $18.8 million or 12.9%, from fiscal year 2020 to fiscal year 2021. The principal factors affecting our revenue contraction included:\n\u2022Subscription revenue decreased by 11.1% to $113.4 million, compared to $127.6 million for fiscal year 2020. Subscription revenue represented 89.3% of our total revenue for fiscal year 2021 compared to 87.6% for the prior year. Subscription revenues decreased by 6.1% on a constant currency basis, year over year. The decline in constant currency subscription revenue was primarily due to the contraction in our subscriber base as a result of economic conditions attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic. During fiscal year 2021, our subscriber base contracted by 73,800 subscribers to 744,700 subscribers at March 31, 2021. We experienced fleet contraction in a number of key verticals such as the oil and gas vertical, consumer vertical and leasing vertical which impacted both our subscriber-count and subscription revenue line, the contraction is mainly attributable to our low ARPU asset tracking subscribers.\nThe majority of our revenues and subscription revenues are derived from currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Accordingly, the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar against these currencies (in particular against the South African Rand) following currency volatility arising from the economic disruption caused by COVID-19, has negatively impacted our revenue and subscription revenues reported in U.S. Dollars. Compared to fiscal year 2020, the South African Rand weakened by 11% against the U.S. Dollar. The Rand/U.S. Dollar exchange rate averaged R16.37 in fiscal year 2021 compared to an average of R14.78 during fiscal year 2020. The impact of translating foreign currencies to U.S. Dollars at the average exchange rates during fiscal year 2021 led to a 5.0% reduction in reported U.S. Dollar subscription revenues.\n\u2022Hardware and other revenue decreased by $4.5 million, or 25.1%, from fiscal year 2020 to fiscal year 2021 primarily as a result of a global economic slowdown following the disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. As shown in the table below, hardware and other revenue was lower across all geographical segments.\nThe impact of translating foreign currencies to U.S. Dollars at the average exchange rates during fiscal year 2021 led to a 4.6% reduction in reported U.S. Dollar revenues.\nA breakdown of third party revenue by segment is shown in the table below:\nFor the Year Ended March 31,\n2020 2021 2020 2021 2020 2021\n(In thousands)\nTotal Revenue Subscription Revenue Hardware and other revenue\nAfrica $76,756 $67,948 $70,886 $62,453 $5,870 $5,495\nAmericas 24,529 18,981 22,322 18,211 2,207 770\nMiddle East and Australasia 23,130 21,237 17,389 16,558 5,741 4,679\nEurope 15,027 14,579 11,682 12,138 3,345 2,441\nBrazil 5,795 4,064 5,181 3,922 614 142\nCSO 413 85 110 69 303 16\nTotal $145,650 $126,894 $127,570 $113,351 $18,080 $13,543\nIn the Africa segment, subscription revenue decreased by $8.4 million or 11.9%. On a constant currency basis, the contraction in subscription revenue was 3.4% as a result of a 10.1% decrease in subscribers since April 1, 2020. Hardware and other revenue decreased by $0.4 million or 6.4%. Total revenue decreased by $8.8 million or 11.5%. On a constant currency basis, total revenue contraction was 3.1%.\nIn the Americas segment, subscription revenue declined by $4.1 million or 18.4% as a result of both a 27.7% decrease in subscribers since April 1, 2020 and as a result of economic conditions in the oil and gas vertical. Included in fiscal year 2021 subscription revenue reported above is revenue of $1.1 million pertaining to the reduction of existing subscriber contracts of a significant energy sector customer, following a reduction of their fleet due to current economic conditions. Hardware and other revenue declined by $1.4 million or 65.1%. Total revenue declined by $5.5 million or 22.6%.\nSubscription revenue in the Middle East and Australasia segment declined by $0.8 million or 4.8%. On a constant currency basis, the decline in subscription revenue was 7.2%. Subscribers decreased by 1.8% since April 1, 2020. Hardware and other revenue declined by $1.1 million or 18.5%. Total revenue declined by $1.9 million or 8.2%. Total revenue in constant currency declined by 10.7%.\nIn the Europe segment, subscription revenue growth was $0.5 million or 3.9%. On a constant currency basis, the growth in subscription revenue was 0.3%. Subscribers increased by 0.5% since April 1, 2020. Total revenue decreased by $0.4 million or 3.0%, due to a decrease in hardware and other revenues of $0.9 million compared to fiscal year 2020. Total revenue decreased by 6.4% on a constant currency basis.\nIn the Brazil segment, subscription revenue declined by $1.3 million or 24.3%. On a constant currency basis, subscription revenue decreased by 0.5%. Subscribers increased by 3.9% since April 1, 2020 which was offset by pricing concessions granted to customers as a result of economic conditions attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic. Hardware and other revenue declined by $0.5 million or 76.9%. Total revenue declined by $1.7 million or 29.9%. On a constant currency basis, total revenue decreased by 7.8%.\nCost of Revenue\nFor the year ended March 31,\n2020 2021\n(In thousands, except for percentages)\nCost of revenue - subscription $ 39,828 $ 33,414\nCost of revenue - hardware and other 13,187 10,451\nGross profit $ 92,635 $ 83,029\nGross profit margin 63.6 % 65.4 %\nGross profit margin - subscription 68.8 % 70.5 %\nGross profit margin - hardware and other 27.1 % 22.8 %\nCompared to a decrease in total revenue of $18.8 million or 12.9%, cost of revenues decreased by $9.2 million or 17.3%, from fiscal year 2020 to fiscal year 2021.\nSubscription revenue, which generates a higher gross profit margin than hardware and other revenue, contributed 89.3% of total revenue in fiscal year 2021 compared to 87.6% in fiscal year 2020. Fiscal 2020 included $2.0 million in-vehicle device accelerated depreciation which resulted in an increased subscription revenue margin in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020.\nDuring fiscal year 2021, hardware and other margins were lower than in fiscal 2021, mainly due to the geographical sales mix and the distribution channels. Hardware sales via our dealer channel attract lower gross margins.\nSales and Marketing\nFor the year ended March 31,\n2020 2021\n(In thousands, except for percentages)\nSales and marketing $ 13,324 $ 11,344\nAs a percentage of revenue 9.1 % 8.9 %\nSales and marketing costs decreased by $2.0 million, or 14.9%, from fiscal year 2020 to fiscal year 2021 against a 12.9% decrease in total revenue. The decrease in fiscal year 2021 was primarily as a result of savings of $1.0 million in employee costs, $0.7 million in travel costs and other decreases of $0.3 million, none of which were individually significant. In fiscal year 2021, sales and marketing costs represented 8.9% of revenue compared to 9.1% of revenue in fiscal year 2020.\nAdministration and Other Expenses\nFor the year ended March 31,\n2020 2021\n(In thousands, except for percentages)\nAdministration and other $ 58,263 $ 53,487\nAs a percentage of revenue 40.0 % 42.2 %\nAdministration and other expenses decreased by $4.8 million, or 8.2%, from fiscal year 2020 to fiscal year 2021.\nThe decrease mainly relates to savings of $4.1 million in salaries and wages, travel costs of $0.8 million and decreases in expected credit loss provision of $1.0 million, offset by restructuring costs of $1.1 million.\nTaxation\nFor the year ended March 31,\n2020 2021\n(In thousands, except for percentages)\nIncome tax expense $ 9,829 $ 2,634\nEffective tax rate 47.2 % 15.3 %\nIncome tax expense decreased by 73.2%.

A reconciliation of our effective tax rate to the South African corporate tax rate of 28% for both fiscal years 2021 and 2020, is presented in note 10 to the consolidated financial statements. In fiscal year 2021 the effective tax rate decreased by 19.7% as a result of certain non-taxable foreign exchange movements on intercompany loans which have led to deferred tax charges being recognized in the Income Statement. In fiscal 2020 non-deductible foreign exchange differences increased the tax rate by 19.6%.\nResults of Operations for Fiscal Year 2019 Compared to Fiscal Year 2020\nRevenue\nFor the year ended March 31,\n2019 2020 % Change % Change at constant currency\n(In thousands, except for percentages)\nSubscription revenue $ 123,150 $ 127,570 3.6 % 8.7 %\nHardware and other revenue 20,555 18,080 (12.0) % (8.5) %\n$ 143,705 $ 145,650 1.4 % 6.3 %\nOur total revenue increased by $1.9 million or 1.4%, from fiscal year 2019 to fiscal year 2020.

Subscription revenue represented 87.6% of our total revenue for fiscal year 2020 compared to 85.7% for the prior year. Our growth in subscription revenue is primarily attributable to an increase in subscribers, which increased by 9.1% from 750,455 at March 31, 2019, to 818,487 at March 31, 2020. There was no material movement in ARPUs from fiscal year 2019 to fiscal year 2020.

Total revenue improved by $0.6 million or 2.5%.\nSubscription revenue in the Middle East and Australasia segment increased by $1.0 million or 5.8%. On a constant currency basis, the increase in subscription revenue was 9.3%. Subscribers increased by 10.5% since April 1, 2019. Total revenue declined by $0.4 million or 1.7%. Hardware and other revenue declined by $1.4 million, or 19.0%. Total revenue in constant currency improved by 1.7%.\nIn the Europe segment subscription revenue growth was $1.5 million or 14.3%. On a constant currency basis, the growth in subscription revenue was 18.0%. Subscribers increased by 10.8% since April 1, 2019 and additional growth is attributable to an increase in high ARPU bundled subscribers. Despite the increase in subscription revenue total revenue declined by $0.2 million or 1.5%, due to $1.7 million lower hardware and other revenues compared to fiscal 2019. Total revenue increased by 1.7% on a constant currency basis.\nIn the Brazil segment subscription revenue increased by $0.5 million or 11.3%. On a constant currency basis, the increase in subscription revenue was 20.9%. The increase was due to an increase in subscribers of 25.9% since April 1, 2019. Total revenue increased by $0.8 million or 16.5%. On a constant currency basis, total revenue increased by 26.5%.\nCost of Revenue\nFor the year ended March 31,\n2019 2020\n(In thousands, except for percentages)\nCost of revenue - subscription $ 34,940 $ 39,828\nCost of revenue - hardware and other 11,945 13,187\nGross profit $ 96,820 $ 92,635\nGross profit margin 67.4 % 63.6 %\nGross profit margin - subscription 71.6 % 68.8 %\nGross profit margin - hardware and other 41.9 % 27.1 %\nCompared to an increase in total revenue of $1.9 million or 1.4%, cost of revenues increased by $6.1 million or 13.1%, from fiscal year 2019 to fiscal year 2020. This resulted in a lower gross profit margin of 63.6% in fiscal year 2020 compared to 67.4% in fiscal year 2019.\nDuring fiscal 2020, subscription revenue gross profit margins were lower than in fiscal 2019, mainly due to accelerated depreciation of in-vehicle devices following contraction in certain fleets in the oil and gas vertical in the Americas segment.\nDuring fiscal 2020, hardware and other margins were lower than in fiscal 2019, mainly due to the geographical sales mix and the distribution channels. Hardware sales via our dealer channel attract lower gross margins. In addition there is pricing pressure on hardware prices as customers look to reduce the upfront cost of their investment.\nSales and Marketing\nFor the year ended March 31,\n2019 2020\n(In thousands, except for percentages)\nSales and marketing $ 14,489 $ 13,324\nAs a percentage of revenue 10.1 % 9.1 %\nSales and marketing costs decreased by $1.2 million or 8.0%, from fiscal year 2019 to fiscal year 2020 against a 1.4% increase in total revenue. The decrease in fiscal year 2020 was primarily as a result of a $0.5 million decrease in bonuses, a $0.5 million decrease in salaries and wages, a $0.1 million decrease in foreign travel costs and other decreases of $0.1 million, none of which were individually significant. In fiscal year 2020, sales and marketing costs represented 9.1% of revenue compared to 10.1% of revenue in fiscal year 2019.\nAdministration and Other Expenses\nFor the year ended March 31,\n2019 2020\n(In thousands, except for percentages)\nAdministration and other $ 58,040 $ 58,263\nAs a percentage of revenue 40.4 % 40.0 %\nAdministration and other expenses increased by $0.2 million or 0.4%, from fiscal year 2019 to fiscal year 2020.\nThe increase mainly relates to increases in expected credit loss provision primarily in the South Africa business of $1.9 million mainly, professional fees of $0.9 million, offset by saving in bonuses of $1.3 million primarily due to lower subscription revenue growth being achieved, salaries and wages of $0.8 million and operating lease costs of $0.4 million.\nTaxation\nFor the year ended March 31,\n2019 2020\n(In thousands, except for percentages)\nIncome tax expense $ 9,815 $ 9,829\nEffective tax rate 39.9 % 47.2 %\nIncome tax expense increased by 0.1%, while our effective tax rate increased by 7.3% to 47.2% in fiscal year 2020. A reconciliation of our effective tax rate to the South African corporate tax rate of 28% for both fiscal years 2020 and 2019, is presented in note 10 to the consolidated financial statements. In fiscal year 2020 the effective tax rate increased by 19.6% as a result of certain non-deductible foreign exchange movements on intercompany loans which have led to deferred tax charges being recognized in the Income Statement. In fiscal 2019 non-deductible foreign exchange differences increased the tax rate by 14.0%.\nInflation Risk\nWe do not believe that inflation had a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations in the last three fiscal years. If our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset these higher costs through price increases. Our inability to do so could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nNon-GAAP Financial Information\nWe use certain measures to assess the financial performance of our business. Certain of these measures are termed \u201cnon-GAAP measures\u201d because they exclude amounts that are included in, or include amounts that are excluded from, the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, or are calculated using financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP measures include Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income per share and constant currency information.\nAn explanation of the relevance of each of the non-GAAP measures, a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP and a discussion of their limitations is set out below. We do not regard these non-GAAP measures as a substitute for, or superior to, the equivalent measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP or those calculated using financial measures that are calculated in accordance with GAAP.\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are two of the profit measures reviewed by the CODM. We define Adjusted EBITDA as the income before income taxes, net interest income, net foreign exchange gains/(losses), depreciation of property and equipment including capitalized customer in-vehicle devices, amortization of intangible assets including capitalized internal-use software development costs and intangible assets identified as part of a business combination, stock-based compensation costs, restructuring costs and profits/(losses) on the disposal or impairments of assets or subsidiaries. We define Adjusted EBITDA margin as Adjusted EBITDA divided by total revenue.\nWe have included Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin in this annual report because they are key measures that our management and Board of Directors use to understand and evaluate our core operating performance and trends; to prepare and approve its annual budget; and to develop short and long-term operational plans. In particular, the exclusion of certain expenses in calculating Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin can provide a useful\nmeasure for period-to-period comparisons of the Company\u2019s core business. Accordingly, we believe that Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results.\nA reconciliation of net income (the most directly comparable financial measure presented in accordance with GAAP) to Adjusted EBITDA for the year is presented below.\nReconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended March 31,\n2019 2020 2021\n(In thousands)\nNet income for the year $14,810 $10,987 $14,595\nPlus: Income tax expense 9,815 9,829 2,634\n(Less)/plus: Net interest (income)/expense (233) (67) 72\n(Less)/plus: Foreign exchange (gains)/losses (28) 610 959\nPlus: Depreciation (1)\n12,492 16,149 12,878\nPlus: Amortization (2)\n3,876 3,823 3,681\nPlus: Impairment of long-lived assets 62 6 8\nPlus: Stock-based compensation costs 511 660 1,273\n(Less)/plus: Net (profit)/loss on sale of property and equipment (43) (270) 13\nPlus/(less): Restructuring costs 221 (1) 1,055\nAdjusted EBITDA $41,483 $41,726 $37,168\nAdjusted EBITDA margin 28.9 % 28.6 % 29.3 %\n(1) Includes depreciation of owned equipment (including in-vehicle devices).\n(2) Includes amortization of intangible assets (including intangible assets identified as part of a business combination).\nOur use of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin have limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered as performance measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, analysis of our results as reported under GAAP.\nSome of these limitations are:\n\u2022although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements;\n\u2022Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;\n\u2022Adjusted EBITDA does not consider the potentially dilutive impact of equity-based compensation;\n\u2022Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us;\n\u2022other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently, which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure; and\n\u2022certain of the adjustments (such as restructuring costs, impairment of long-lived assets and others) made in calculating Adjusted EBITDA are those that management believes are not representative of our underlying operations and, therefore, are subjective in nature.\nBecause of these limitations, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin should be considered alongside other financial performance measures, including income from operations, net income and our other results.\nBasic and Diluted non-GAAP Net Income per share\nNon-GAAP net income is defined as net income excluding net foreign exchange gains/(losses) net of tax divided by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the period.\nWe have included non-GAAP net income per share in this Annual Report because it provides a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our core business by excluding net foreign exchange gains/(losses) net of tax and associated tax consequences from earnings. Accordingly, we believe that non-GAAP net income per share provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results.\nReconciliation of net income to non-GAAP net income\nFor the year ended March 31,\n2019 2020 2021\n(In thousands)\nNet income for the year $ 14,810 $ 10,987 $ 14,595\nNet foreign exchange (gains)/losses (28) 610 959\nIncome tax effect of net foreign exchange (gains)/losses 3,495 4,028 (3,657)\nNon-GAAP net income $ 18,277 $ 15,625 $ 11,897\nWeighted average number of ordinary shares in issue\nBasic (\u2019000) 563,578 553,653 549,415\nDiluted (\u2019000) 583,741 567,879 560,624\nConstant Currency Information\nConstant currency information has been presented in the sections below to illustrate the impact of changes in currency rates on our results. The constant currency information has been determined by adjusting the current financial reporting year\u2019s results to the prior year\u2019s average exchange rates, determined as the average of the monthly exchange rates applicable to the year. The measurement has been performed for each of our currencies, including the South African Rand and British Pound. The constant currency growth percentage has been calculated by utilizing the constant currency results compared to the prior year results.\nThe constant currency information represents non-GAAP information. We believe this provides a useful basis to measure the performance of our business as it removes distortion from the effects of foreign currency movements during the period.\nDue to the significant portion of our customers who are invoiced in non-U.S. Dollar denominated currencies, we also calculate our subscription revenue growth rate on a constant currency basis, thereby removing the effect of currency fluctuation on our results of operations.\nRefer to discussion below for the annual constant currency growth. The following tables provide the constant currency reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measure for the fiscal years shown:\nSubscription Revenue\nFor the year ended March 31,\n2019 2020 % Change 2020 2021 % Change\n(In thousands, except for percentages)\nSubscription revenue as reported $ 123,150 $ 127,570 3.6 % $ 127,570 $ 113,351 (11.1) %\nConversion impact of U.S. Dollar/other currencies - 6,294 5.1 % - 6,437 5.0 %\nSubscription revenue on a constant currency basis $ 123,150 $ 133,864 8.7 % $ 127,570 $ 119,788 (6.1) %\nHardware and Other Revenue\nFor the year ended March 31,\n2019 2020 % Change 2020 2021 % Change\n(In thousands, except for percentages)\nHardware and other revenue as reported $ 20,555 $ 18,080 (12.0) % $ 18,080 $ 13,543 (25.1) %\nConversion impact of U.S. Dollar/other currencies - 728 3.5 % - 230 1.3 %\nHardware and other revenue on a constant currency basis $ 20,555 $ 18,808 (8.5) % $ 18,080 $ 13,773 (23.8) %\nTotal Revenue\nFor the year ended March 31,\n2019 2020 % Change 2020 2021 % Change\n(In thousands, except for percentages)\nTotal revenue as reported $ 143,705 $ 145,650 1.4 % $ 145,650 $ 126,894 (12.9) %\nConversion impact of U.S. Dollar/other currencies - 7,108 4.9 % - 6,667 4.6 %\nTotal revenue on a constant currency basis $ 143,705 $ 152,758 6.3 % $ 145,650 $ 133,561 (8.3) %\nLiquidity and capital resources\nWe believe that our cash and borrowings available under our credit facilities will be sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future. Liquidity risk is reduced as a result of stable income due to the recurring nature of our income, available cash resources, as well as unutilized facilities which are available.\nThe following tables provide a summary of our cash flows for each of the three years ended March 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021:\nFiscal Year Ended March 31,\n2019 2020 2021\n(In thousands)\nNet cash generated from operating activities $ 31,455 $ 28,178 $ 38,570\nNet cash used in investing activities (19,223) (19,422) (8,650)\nNet cash used in financing activities (8,604) (15,451) (5,209)\nNet increase/(decrease) in cash and cash equivalents, and restricted cash 3,628 (6,695) 24,711\nCash, and cash equivalents and restricted cash at the beginning of the year 27,834 27,838 18,652\nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents, and restricted cash (3,624) (2,491) 2,978\nCash, and cash equivalents and restricted cash at the end of the year $ 27,838 $ 18,652 $ 46,341\nWe fund our operations, capital expenditure and acquisitions through cash generated from operating activities, cash on hand and our undrawn borrowing facilities.\nIt is currently our policy to pay regular dividends, and we consider such dividend payments on a quarter-by-quarter basis.\nAs of March 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021, the Company had approved, but not yet contracted, capital commitments for intangible assets of $3.6 million, $3.0 million and $4.7 million respectively.\nAs of March 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021, the Company had approved, and contracted, capital commitments for property and equipment of $2.8 million, $1.8 million and $1.2 million, respectively; and for intangible assets of $1.3 million, $0.9 million and $1.3 million respectively.\nCapital commitments will be funded out of a mixture of working capital and cash and cash equivalents.\nOn May 23, 2017, the MiX Telematics Limited Board approved a share repurchase program of up to R270 million (equivalent of $18.1 million as of March 31, 2021) under which the Company may repurchase its ordinary shares, including ADSs. We expect any repurchases under this share repurchase program to be funded out of existing cash resources. During fiscal year 2021, there were no additional share repurchases. Refer to \u201cItem 5. Market for Registrant\u2019s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities\u201d for information regarding our share repurchase program.\nOperating Activities\nNet cash generated from operating activities during fiscal year 2019 consisted of our net income (after excluding non-cash charges) of $47.6 million, a net investment in operating assets and liabilities of $10.6 million, net interest received of $0.7 million and taxes paid of $6.2 million.\nNet cash generated from operating activities decreased from $31.5 million in fiscal year 2019 to $28.2 million in fiscal year 2020 which is primarily attributable to more net income (after excluding non-cash charges) before operating assets and liabilities changes of $4.8 million offset by negative net operating assets and liabilities changes of $8.2 million, lower net interest received of $0.2 million and lower taxation paid of $0.4 million. Net cash generated from operating activities during fiscal year 2020 consisted of our net income (after excluding non-cash charges) of $52.3\nmillion, a net reduction in operating assets and liabilities investments of $18.8 million, net interest received of $0.5 million and taxes paid of $5.8 million.\nNet cash generated from operating activities increased from $28.2 million in fiscal year 2020 to $38.6 million in fiscal year 2021 which is primarily attributable to improved cash generated from operations of $10.5 million offset by lower net interest received of $0.1 million. The improved cash generated from operations is primarily as a result of improved working capital management of $17.9 million (specifically a decrease in accounts receivables of $9.2 million due to improved management of receivables and lower revenues, an increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities of $8.6 million, foreign currency translation adjustments of $6.0 million, and lower capitalized commissions of $1.4 million, partially offset by a decrease in accounts payables of $5.9 million, prepaid expenses and other current assets of $1.6 million and an increase in inventories of $0.4 million), offset by lower net income (after excluding non-cash charges) of $6.8 million.\nNet cash generated from operating activities during fiscal year 2021 consisted of our net income (after excluding non-cash charges) of $45.6 million, a net reduction in operating assets and liabilities investments of $1.6 million, net interest received of $0.3 million and taxes paid of $5.8 million.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities in fiscal year 2019 was $19.2 million. Net cash used in investing activities during fiscal year 2019 primarily consisted of capital expenditures of $19.4 million. Capital expenditures during the year included purchases of intangible assets of $4.8 million, which included internal-use software of $3.5 million, as well as computer software, technology and other intangibles of $1.3 million, and cash paid to purchase property and equipment of $14.6 million, which included in-vehicle devices of $13.9 million. Offset by proceeds on sale of property and equipment and intangible assets of $0.2 million.\nNet cash used in investing activities in fiscal year 2020 increased to $19.4 million from $19.2 million in fiscal year 2019. Net cash used in investing activities during fiscal year 2020 primarily consisted of capital expenditures of $20.4 million. Capital expenditures during the year included purchases of intangible assets of $5.7 million, which included internal-use software of $3.4 million as well as computer software, technology and other intangibles of $2.3 million, and cash paid to purchase property and equipment of $14.7 million, which included in-vehicle devices of $13.6 million. Net cash used in investing activities also included $0.3 million loan advanced to third parties offset by proceeds on sale of property and equipment and intangible assets of $1.3 million.\nNet cash used in investing activities in fiscal year 2021 decreased to $8.7 million from $19.4 million in fiscal year 2020, primarily due to lower in-vehicle devices capital expenditure as a result of lower revenues during the COVID-19 pandemic. Net cash used in investing activities during fiscal year 2021 primarily consisted of capital expenditures of $8.7 million. Capital expenditures during the year included purchases of intangible assets of $4.0 million, which included internal-use software of $2.8 million as well as computer software, technology and other intangibles of $1.2 million, and cash paid to purchase property and equipment of $4.6 million, which included in-vehicle devices of $4.2 million.\nFinancing Activities\nIn fiscal year 2019, the cash used in financing activities of $8.6 million includes share repurchases of $5.3 million, dividends paid of $4.9 million, offset by proceeds from issuance of shares in respect of employee stock options of $1.0 million and $0.7 million from facilities utilized.\nIn fiscal year 2020, the cash used in financing activities of $15.5 million includes share repurchases of $9.8 million, dividends paid of $6.0 million, offset by $0.3 million from facilities utilized.\nIn fiscal year 2021, the cash used in financing activities of $5.2 million includes dividends paid of $5.4 million and $0.7 million from facilities repaid, offset by proceeds of $0.9 million from the issue of ordinary shares in relation to the exercise of stock options.\nCredit Facilities\nAt March 31, 2021, our principal sources of liquidity were net cash balances of $43.8 million (consisting of cash and cash equivalents of $45.5 million less short-term debt (bank overdraft)) of $1.7 million) and unutilized borrowing capacity of $5.5 million available through our credit facilities. Our principal sources of credit are our facilities with Standard Bank Limited and Nedbank Limited.\nWe have an overdraft facility of R64.0 million (equivalent of $4.3 million as of March 31, 2021), an unutilized working capital facility of R25.0 million (equivalent of $1.7 million as of March 31, 2021) and an unutilized vehicle and asset finance facility of R8.5 million (equivalent of $0.6 million as of March 31, 2021) with Standard Bank Limited that bear interest at South African Prime less 1.2% except for the working capital facility that bears interest at South African Prime less 0.25%.\nAt March 31, 2021, $1.7 million was utilized under the overdraft facility. We use this facility as part of our foreign currency hedging strategy. We draw down on this facility in the applicable foreign currency in order to fix the exchange rate on existing balance sheet foreign currency exposure that we anticipate settling in that foreign currency. Our obligations under the overdraft facility with Standard Bank Limited are guaranteed by MiX Telematics Limited and our wholly-owned subsidiaries, MiX Telematics Africa Proprietary Limited and MiX Telematics International Proprietary Limited, and secured by a pledge of accounts receivable by MiX Telematics Limited and MiX Telematics International Proprietary Limited.\nDuring fiscal year 2020, we entered into a R25.0 million (equivalent of $1.7 million as of March 31, 2021) working capital facility with Standard Bank Limited that bears interest at South African Prime less 0.25%. As of March 31, 2021, the facility was undrawn. We use this facility for working capital purposes in our Africa operations.\nDuring fiscal year 2014, we entered into a R10.0 million (equivalent of $0.7 million as of March 31, 2021) facility with Nedbank Limited that bears interest at South African Prime less 2%. As of March 31, 2021, the facility was undrawn. We use this facility for working capital purposes in our Africa operations.\nOur credit facilities with Standard Bank Limited and Nedbank Limited contain certain restrictive clauses, including without limitation, those limiting our and our guarantor subsidiaries\u2019, as applicable, ability to, among other things, incur indebtedness, incur liens, or sell or acquire assets or businesses. These facilities are not subject to any financial covenants such as interest coverage or gearing ratios.\nContractual and other obligations\nThe following table sets forth our future annual repayment of debt, and our contractual commitments as of March 31, 2021 (U.S. Dollar amounts were translated from South African Rand at the exchange rate of R14.9167 per $1.00, which is the exchange rate as of March 31, 2021):\nFiscal 2022 Fiscal 2023 Fiscal 2024 Fiscal 2025 Fiscal 2026 Thereafter Total\n(In thousands)\nLease liabilities (1)\n$ 1,473 1,171 998 938 912 2,731 $ 8,223\nShort-term debt (2)\n$ 1,674 - - - - - $ 1,674\nApproved, and contracted, capital commitments (3)\n-property and equipment\n$ 1,234 - - - - - $ 1,234\n-intangible assets\n$ 1,321 - - - - - $ 1,321\nOutstanding purchase obligations (4)\n$ 11,398 4,644 5,009 3,183 535 - $ 24,769\nTotal $ 17,100 $ 5,815 $ 6,007 $ 4,121 $ 1,447 $ 2,731 $ 37,221\n(1) Refer to Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements for further information on leases.\n(2) Refer to Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements for further information on short-term debt (bank overdraft).\n(3) Refer to Note 16 to our consolidated financial statements for further information on capital commitments.\n(4) Outstanding purchase obligations primarily represent agreements to purchase goods and services that are enforceable and legally binding and includes amounts relating to production of our products, information technology services and employee benefit administration services.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. Certain of our significant accounting policies and critical accounting estimates are summarized below. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and disclosed. Significant estimates include, but are not limited to, the amortization period for deferred commissions, allowances for doubtful accounts, the assessment of expected cash flows used in evaluating goodwill and long-lived assets for impairment, the determination of useful lives of our customer relationships, contingencies, the classification of devices and other hardware as in-vehicle devices (equipment) versus inventory based on the future expectation of the different types of customer contracts, income and deferred taxes, and valuation allowances on deferred tax assets. Our actual results could differ from those estimates, and such differences may be material to the consolidated financial statements. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis.\nRevenue from Contracts with Customers\nSignificant Judgments\nRevenue is recognized upon transfer of control of distinct promised products and/or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for those products and/or services. We enter into contracts that include the supply of fleet and mobile asset management equipment. For such contracts, we utilize significant judgment to determine whether control of the equipment has transferred to the customer, and in instances where it does, we recognize revenue in accordance with Revenue from Contracts with Customers (\u201cASC 606\u201d). When control of the equipment does not transfer to the customer, which is when legal title does not transfer to the customer, our judgement is that the customer does not have the right to direct the use of the equipment when the customer does not operate the equipment or make any significant decisions about its use. In these instances we use the equipment to provide fleet and mobile asset management services to the customer. Accordingly, these arrangements, which comprise virtually all of the transactions in which legal title does not pass to the customer, are not within the scope of ASC 842, Leases (\u201cASC 842\u201d). Instead, for such contracts we have concluded that they are service contracts comprising a single performance obligation, and revenue is recognized over time pursuant to ASC 606.\nRecognition and measurement\nWe provide fleet and mobile asset management solutions to our customers, and our principal revenue streams are (1) Subscription and (2) Hardware and other. Subscription revenue is recognized over time and hardware and other revenue is recognized at a point-in-time.\nTo provide services to customers, a device is required which collects and transmits information collected from the vehicle or other asset. Fleet customers may also obtain other items of hardware, virtually all of which are functionally-dependent on the device. Some customers obtain control of the device and other hardware (where legal title transfers to the customer); while other customers do not (where legal title remains with the Company). A contract arises on the acceptance of a customer\u2019s purchase order, which is typically executed in writing.\nWe distribute devices and other hardware to certain small fleet operators and consumers through distributors. Distributors act as agents and hardware revenue is only recognized when the distributor sells the hardware unit to the end customer. Once a unit is sold to a customer, the customer enters into a service agreement directly with us. The obligation to supply the service and the credit risk rests with us. The subscription revenue is recognized when the service is rendered.\nWe also sell hardware to motor vehicle dealerships for fitment into their vehicle trading stock. These dealerships purchase the hardware from us and are considered to act as a principal in the contract because they obtain title to the hardware, bear the risks and rewards of ownership and accordingly control the hardware purchased. The buyer of the vehicle then enters into a service-only contract with us. Revenue is recognized upon sale of the hardware to the dealership and subscription revenue is recognized as the services are provided to the customer.\nWe distribute devices and other hardware to enterprise fleet customers through dealers. Dealers are considered to act as a principal for the sale of hardware to the end customer, and revenue is recognized by us upon sale of the hardware unit to the dealer. Dealers are also considered to act as a principal for the provision of the service to end customers because, even though the dealers do not provide the service themselves, the dealers control the right to receive the service before that right is transferred to the end customer, the dealers have the primary responsibility for fulfilling the promise to provide the service to the end customer, and the dealers have full discretion in establishing the prices charged to the end customer. Accordingly, subscription revenue is recognized as the service is provided to the dealers.\nAllowance for doubtful accounts\nThe allowance for doubtful accounts on accounts receivables is calculated by considering all relevant information, internal and external about the collectability of cash flows, including information about past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions to appropriately reflect the risk of losses over the remaining contractual lives of the assets. Historical loss rates, calculated as actual losses over a period as a percentage of revenue, are adjusted for current conditions and management\u2019s expectations about future economic conditions.\nThe allowance is measured on a collective basis where management groups their customers appropriately based on their credit risk characteristics.\nThe allowance for doubtful accounts is a valuation account and the asset\u2019s carrying amount is reduced and the amount of the loss is recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance. Actual write-downs are recorded when the asset is deemed uncollectible after all efforts to recover have yielded no results.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill is not amortized but is tested for possible impairment at least annually, or when circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. Goodwill is allocated to a reporting unit for the purpose of impairment testing. The carrying value of the reporting unit, to which goodwill has been allocated, is compared to its fair value, and a goodwill impairment charge is recognized for the amount (if any) by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value, limited to the amount of the goodwill. No impairments of goodwill existed as of the last testing date, March 31, 2021 or the previous testing, March 31, 2020. The changes in the carrying value of goodwill during fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2021 are attributable only to foreign currency translation adjustments.\nAlthough there were no impairments of goodwill as of March 31, 2020 and 2021, significant judgement was exercised in determining the fair value of each reporting unit, in particular judgements regarding the discount rate used (weighted average cost of capital rate), the expected future cash flows and terminal growth rates. Especially in light of COVID-19, which has had and, we believe, will continue to have an adverse impact on global economies and financial markets. In particular, to the extent that anticipated new contracts do not materialize and the business strategy does not come to fruition, or key personnel are not retained, the forecasts on which the impairment tests were performed could be negatively impacted.\nTaxation\nWe are subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions. During the process of determining our world-wide provision for income taxes, we are required to make judgements in respect of international tax matters, including transfer pricing and controlled foreign company legislation. Where applicable tax legislation is subject to interpretation, management makes assessments, based on expert tax advice, of the relevant tax that is more likely than not to be paid and provides accordingly.\nIncome taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Income tax expense is recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income, except to the extent that it relates to items recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. We use the portfolio approach for releasing income tax effects from accumulated other comprehensive income.\nThe current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws and tax rates enacted by the reporting date in the countries where we operate and generate taxable income. Interest, and penalties, incurred on the underpayment of income taxes is classified as interest expense, and administration expenses, respectively.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax is measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Valuation allowances are provided when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the extent it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. Uncertainty generated by the current economic environment may affect the valuation of our deferred tax assets over time. Our accounting for deferred tax balances and associated valuation allowances represent management\u2019s best estimate of future events that can be appropriately reflected in the accounting estimate.\nDeferred tax liabilities arising on investments in domestic subsidiaries are not recognized to the extent that the investment can be recovered on a tax-free basis; and on investments in foreign subsidiaries to the extent that the undistributed earnings will be invested indefinitely or will be remitted in a tax-free liquidation.\nOff-balance sheet arrangements\nWe do not engage in any off-balance sheet financing activities. We do not have any interest in entities referred to as variable interest entities, which include special purpose entities and other structured finance entities which are not consolidated.",

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nIn connection with the preparation of this report, an evaluation was carried out by certain members of Company management, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer of the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (\u201cSEC\u201d) Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (\u201cExchange Act\u201d)), as of March 31, 2021. Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC\u2019s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.\nBased on the evaluation performed, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of March 31, 2021.\nMANAGEMENT\u2019S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING\nManagement of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP and includes those policies and procedures that: (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions and the dispositions of our assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance that our transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with appropriate authorizations; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nUnder the supervision of and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2021, using the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (\u201cCOSO\u201d) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013). Based on our evaluation under the framework, our management concluded that that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of March 31, 2021.\nThe Company\u2019s independent registered public accounting firm, Deloitte & Touche, has audited the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, has also audited our internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2021, as stated in their audit report that follows below.\nPreviously Reported Material Weakness in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nAs disclosed in Item 9A. Controls and Procedures in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, we identified a material weakness in internal control related to the ineffective design and operation of the financial statement close and reporting controls in the areas of management review of financial statement information and independent review of journal entries in our South African-based reporting segments.\nUpon identification of the material weakness, we developed a remediation plan and implemented control design changes and/or refinements that improved and strengthened the operation of financial statement close and reporting controls. In particular, we:\n\u2022updated risk and control matrices, with a particular focus on the control descriptions of management review controls;\n\u2022re-designed processes and re-implemented controls to address the deficiencies previously identified;\n\u2022maintained adequate evidence and documentation regarding management review of journal entries and control documentation;\n\u2022aligned the roles and responsibilities of finance teams in the respective reporting segments to the individual capabilities and capacity; and\n\u2022changed the configuration of our ERP system to enforce segregation of duties with independent review and release of journal entries.\nBased on the results of our testing of the procedures and controls, management concluded that as of March 31, 2021, the material weakness reported in fiscal 2020 has been remediated.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nExcept for the changes in connection with the implementation of the remediation plan discussed above, there have been no other changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting.\nATTESTATION REPORT OF THE REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANCY FIRM\nTo the shareholders and the Board of Directors of MiX Telematics Limited\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the internal control over financial reporting of MiX Telematics Limited and its subsidiaries (the \u201cCompany\u201d) as of March 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended March 31, 2021, of the Company and our report dated June 14, 2021, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company\u2019s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Form 10-K. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions\nare recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Deloitte & Touche\nDeloitte & Touche\nRegistered Auditor\nJohannesburg, South Africa\nJune 14, 2021",

Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nGoodwill-Refer to Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nThe Company\u2019s evaluation of goodwill for impairment involves the comparison of the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. The Company uses the discounted cash flow model to estimate fair value, which requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions related to discount rates and forecasts of future revenues and operating cashflows. Changes in these assumptions could have a significant impact on either the fair value, the amount of any goodwill impairment charge, or both. The Company\u2019s goodwill balance was $43.9 million as of March 31, 2021, of which $8.9 million was allocated to the European Reporting Unit (\u201cMiX Europe\u201d). The fair value of MiX Europe exceeded its carrying value by 38.6% as of the measurement date and, therefore, no impairment was recognized.\nWe identified goodwill for MiX Europe as a critical audit matter because of the significant judgments made by management to estimate the fair value of MiX Europe. This required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our fair value specialists, when performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management\u2019s estimates and assumptions related to selection of the discount rate and forecasts of future revenue and operating cash flow of MiX Europe.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to the discount rate and forecasts of future revenue and operating cashflows used by management to estimate the fair value of MiX Europe included the following, among others:\na.We tested the effectiveness of controls over management\u2019s goodwill impairment evaluation, including those over the determination of the fair value of MiX Europe, such as controls related to management\u2019s selection of the discount rate and forecasts of future revenue.\nb.We evaluated management\u2019s ability to accurately forecast future revenues and earnings by comparing actual results to management\u2019s historical forecasts.\nc.We evaluated the reasonableness of management\u2019s revenue forecasts by comparing the forecasts to historical revenues and earnings and internal communications to management and the Board of Directors.\nd.We compared the Company\u2019s actual performance to certain of its peer companies.\ne.We evaluated the reasonableness of the valuation methodology and with the assistance of our fair value specialists, the reasonableness of the discount rate by testing the source information underlying the determination of the discount rate. We then tested the mathematical accuracy of the calculation.\nf.Developed a range of independent estimates and compared those to the discount rate selected by management.\n/s/ Deloitte & Touche\nDeloitte & Touche\nRegistered Auditor\nJohannesburg, South Africa\nJune 14, 2021\nWe have served as the Company\u2019s auditor since 2017.\nMIX TELEMATICS LIMITED\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(in thousands, except per share data)\nAs of March 31,\n2020 2021\nASSETS\nCurrent assets:\nCash and cash equivalents $ 17,953 $ 45,489\nRestricted cash 699 854\nAccounts receivables, net of allowances for doubtful accounts of $3.6 million and $5.6 million, respectively\n24,100 19,265\nInventory, net 3,271 3,109\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets 7,375 8,509\nTotal current assets 53,398 77,226\nProperty and equipment, net 30,019 23,463\nGoodwill 37,923 43,938\nIntangible assets, net 15,007 18,303\nDeferred tax assets 3,108 3,782\nOther assets 4,200 4,434\nTotal assets $ 143,655 $ 171,146\nLIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY\nCurrent liabilities:\nShort-term debt $ 2,367 $ 1,674\nAccounts payables 5,251 6,560\nAccrued expenses and other liabilities 14,839 18,675\nDeferred revenue 5,077 5,788\nTotal current liabilities 27,534 32,697\nDeferred tax liabilities 11,436 9,187\nLong-term accrued expenses and other liabilities 5,660 5,863\nTotal liabilities 44,630 47,747\nStockholders' equity:\nMiX Telematics Limited stockholders\u2019 equity\nPreference shares: 100 million shares authorized but not issued\n- -\nOrdinary shares: 600.9 million and 605.6 million no-par value shares issued and outstanding as of March 31, 2020 and 2021, respectively\n66,522 67,401\nLess treasury stock at cost: 54 million shares as of March, 31, 2020 and 2021, respectively\n(17,315) (17,315)\nRetained earnings 67,482 76,710\nAccumulated other comprehensive (loss)/income (11,070) 1,924\nAdditional paid-in capital (6,599) (5,326)\nTotal MiX Telematics Limited stockholders\u2019 equity 99,020 123,394\nNon-controlling interest 5 5\nTotal stockholders\u2019 equity\n99,025 123,399\nTotal liabilities and stockholders\u2019 equity $ 143,655 $ 171,146\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.\nMIX TELEMATICS LIMITED\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME\n(in thousands, except per share data)\nFor the year ended March 31,\n2019 2020 2021\nRevenue\nSubscription $ 123,150 $ 127,570 $ 113,351\nHardware and other 20,555 18,080 13,543\nTotal revenue 143,705 145,650 126,894\nCost of revenue\nSubscription 34,940 39,828 33,414\nHardware and other 11,945 13,187 10,451\nTotal cost of revenue 46,885 53,015 43,865\nGross profit 96,820 92,635 83,029\nOperating expenses\nSales and marketing 14,489 13,324 11,344\nAdministration and other 58,040 58,263 53,487\nTotal operating expenses 72,529 71,587 64,831\nIncome from operations 24,291 21,048 18,198\nOther income/(expense) 101 (299) (897)\nNet interest income/(expense) 233 67 (72)\nIncome before income tax expense 24,625 20,816 17,229\nIncome tax expense 9,815 9,829 2,634\nNet income for the year $ 14,810 $ 10,987 $ 14,595\nNet income attributable to MiX Telematics Limited stockholders $ 14,810 $ 10,987 $ 14,595\nNet income attributable to non-controlling interest -

Summary of significant accounting policies\nThe principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are set out below. These accounting policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.\nBasis of preparation and consolidation\nThe Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2021 are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (\u201cGAAP\u201d) and should be read in conjunction with the accompanying notes thereto. All subsidiaries have been consolidated, including variable interest entities (\u201cVIEs\u201d) of which the Company is deemed to be the primary beneficiary. Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealized gains on transactions between group companies are eliminated. Unrealized losses are also eliminated except to the extent the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the transferred asset. Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been adjusted to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Company. All subsidiaries have the same reporting dates as the Company. Non-controlling interests represent the non-controlling stockholders\u2019 proportionate share of the net assets and results of operations of the Company\u2019s subsidiaries. Non-controlling interests in the results and equity of subsidiaries are shown separately in the Consolidated Balance Sheet, Statement of Income, Statement of Comprehensive Income and Statement of Changes in Stockholders\u2019 Equity, respectively.\nUse of estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and disclosed. Significant estimates include, but are not limited to, allowances for doubtful accounts, the assessment of expected cash flows used in evaluating goodwill and long-lived assets for impairment, the amortization period for deferred commissions, the determination of useful lives of the Company\u2019s customer relationships, contingencies, the classification of devices and other hardware as in-vehicle devices (equipment) versus inventory based on the future expectation of the different types of customer contracts, income and deferred taxes, unrecognized tax benefits and valuation allowances on deferred tax assets. Actual results could differ from those estimates, and such differences may be material to the consolidated financial statements.\nAs of March 31, 2021, the global outbreak of COVID-19 has had and, we believe, will continue to have an adverse impact on global economies and financial markets. We have taken into account the impact of COVID-19 on expected credit losses to the extent possible. Our expected credit losses have increased as a result. We also considered the impact on future cash flows and weighted average cost of capital rates related to goodwill sensitivities and impairment assessments. However, future changes in economic conditions related to COVID-19 could have an impact on future estimates and judgements used.\nRevenue from contracts with customers\nSignificant judgments\nRevenue is recognized upon transfer of control of distinct promised products and/or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that the Company expects to receive in exchange for those products and/or services. The Company enters into contracts that include the supply of fleet and mobile asset management equipment. For such contracts, the Company utilizes significant judgment to determine whether control of the equipment has transferred to the customer, and in instances where it does, it recognizes revenue in accordance with Revenue from Contracts with Customers (\u201cASC 606\u201d). When control of the equipment does not transfer to the customer, which is when legal title does not transfer to the customer, our judgement is that the customer does not have the right to direct the use of the equipment when the customer does not operate the equipment or make any significant decisions about its use. In these instances the Company uses the equipment to provide fleet and mobile asset management services to the customer. Accordingly, these arrangements, which comprise virtually all of the transactions in which legal title does not pass to the customer, are not within the scope of ASC 842, Leases (\u201cASC 842\u201d). Instead, for such contracts we have concluded that they are service contracts comprising a single performance obligation, and revenue is recognized over time pursuant to ASC 606.\nRecognition and measurement\nThe Company provides fleet and mobile asset management solutions to its customers, and its principal revenue streams are (1) Subscription and (2) Hardware and other. Subscription revenue is recognized over time and hardware and other revenue is recognized at a point-in-time.\nTo provide services to customers, a device is required which collects and transmits information collected from the vehicle or other asset. Fleet customers may also obtain other items of hardware, virtually all of which are functionally-dependent on the device. Some customers obtain control of the device and other hardware (where legal title transfers to the customer); while other customers do not (where legal title remains with the Company). A contract arises on the acceptance of a customer\u2019s purchase order, which is typically executed in writing.\nIn instances where the customer obtains control of the device and other hardware, which is typically upon installation or delivery to the customer, the device, the other hardware, the installation thereof and the service are each accounted for as separate performance obligations. The total transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation using relative stand-alone selling prices. Revenue allocated to the device and other hardware is recognized upon delivery, and revenue allocated to installation is recognized once the installation is complete, since installation is completed within a day. Revenue related to the service performance obligation (subscription) is recognized on a straight-line basis over the expected contractual term, since we consistently deliver telematics services on a continuous basis over that period.\nIn instances where the customer does not obtain control of the device and other hardware, which is functionally-dependent on the device, there is only a single performance obligation, namely the service. The customer is not able to direct the use of these items, and accordingly these contracts do not contain leases. In these instances, the devices and other hardware are used by the Company to provide the services. The total revenue from these contracts is recognized as subscription revenue on a straight-line basis over the expected contractual term, since we consistently deliver telematics services on a continuous basis over that period.\nRevenue is presented net of discounts, value added tax, returns and after eliminating sales within the Company.\nThe Company distributes devices and other hardware to certain small fleet operators and consumers through distributors. Distributors act as agents and hardware revenue is only recognized when the distributor sells the hardware unit to the end customer. Once a unit is sold to a customer, the customer enters into a service agreement directly with the Company. The obligation to supply the service and the credit risk rests with the Company. The subscription revenue is recognized when the service is rendered.\nThe Company also sells hardware to motor vehicle dealerships for fitment into their vehicle trading stock. These dealerships purchase the hardware from the Company and are considered to act as a principal in the contract because they obtain title to the hardware, bear the risks and rewards of ownership and accordingly control the hardware purchased. The buyer of the vehicle then enters into a service-only contract with the Company. Revenue is recognized upon sale of the hardware to the dealership and subscription revenue is recognized as the services are provided to the customer.\nThe Company distributes devices and other hardware to enterprise fleet customers through dealers. Dealers are considered to act as a principal for the sale of hardware to the end customer, and revenue is recognized by the Company upon sale of the hardware unit to the dealer. Dealers are also considered to act as a principal for the provision of the service to end customers because, even though the dealers do not provide the service themselves, the dealers control the right to receive the service before that right is transferred to the end customer, the dealers have the primary responsibility for fulfilling the promise to\nprovide the service to the end customer, and the dealers have full discretion in establishing the prices charged to the end customer. Accordingly, subscription revenue is recognized as the service is provided to the dealers.\nContract liabilities (deferred revenue)\nTiming of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing customers or collecting payments from customers. Typically, corporate customers pay in arrears, while consumer customers pay in advance.\nWhen customers are invoiced in advance for subscription services that will be provided over periods of more than one month, or pay in advance of service periods of more than one month, deferred revenue liabilities, or contract liabilities, are recorded.\nIn all other instances, the Company has a right to consideration for subscription services from customers in an amount that corresponds directly with the value to customers of the Company\u2019s performance completed to date. Therefore, revenue is recognized for the amount to which the Company has a right to invoice. The future subscription services will be provided over varying periods from 1 to 60 months.\nContracts for which the Company receives a payment for a time period which is more than 12 months in advance are considered to comprise a significant financing component. Interest expense is accrued on the deferred revenue liability. This results in the revenue being measured at the future value of the payments received.\nDeferred commissions\nCommissions incurred to acquire contracts are capitalized and amortized, unless the amortization period is 12 months or less. The commission capitalized is attributed to the specific performance obligations in the related contract. Commission is considered commensurate with respect to a particular contract when equivalent/comparable commission is payable upon the extension or renewal of such a contract or upon the customer entering into a new contract. To the extent commission capitalized is commensurate, the commission attributable to service will be amortized over the minimum contractual period or, if shorter, the expected life of the contract. To the extent it is not commensurate, the commission capitalized that is attributable to service is amortized over the expected life of the contract. Typically, with regard to month-to-month contracts, commission payable is not considered commensurate for such contracts because no commission is payable as and when the customer extends each month by not giving notice. Accordingly, commission incurred on such contracts that is attributable to service is amortized over the expected life of the contract taking account of expected extensions/renewals. Commission capitalized that is attributable to hardware or installation is amortized in full at the time the related hardware, or installation, revenue is recognized.\nRecurring commission is commission which is payable for each month the customer remains with the Company. The amount capitalized reflects the total commission payable over the minimum contractual period or, if shorter, the expected life of the contract, together with the effect of the time value of money, where significant.\nAs of March 31, 2020 and 2021, deferred commissions amounted to $3.6 million and $3.7 million respectively, which are included within Other assets on the Balance Sheet.\nAmortization expense of external commissions capitalized is recognized in cost of sales, while that of internal commissions earned by the Company's sales personnel is recognized in sales and marketing costs. Commissions not capitalized under the 12-month practical expedient are also classified in the same manner.\nForeign currency\nFunctional and reporting currency\nEach subsidiary is consolidated by translating its assets, liabilities and results into the functional currency of its immediate parent company, and subsequently the consolidated position, determined in South African Rand, is translated into U.S. Dollars (reporting currency). Assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. Dollars using the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. Equity items are translated at historical exchange rates, while income and expense items are translated using average exchange rates for the period. Foreign currency translation adjustments are reported in stockholders\u2019 equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) until disposal.\nThe movement in the foreign currency translation adjustments is as follows (in thousands):\nAs of March 31,\n2020 2021\nCumulative foreign currency translation adjustments, beginning of year $ 2,115 $ (11,070)\nAdjustment on initial application of ASC 326 Financial Instruments - Credit Losses as of April 1, 2019\n(22) -\nForeign currency translation (losses)/gains for the year, net of tax (13,163) 12,994\nCumulative foreign currency translation adjustments, end of year $ (11,070) $ 1,924\nTransactions and balances\nTransactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded by the Company and its subsidiaries in their respective functional currencies using the exchange rates at the dates of the transactions. Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are translated at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. All resulting foreign exchange gains and losses are recognized in in Other income/(expense) in the Statement of Income, except for those gains and losses arising on long-term monetary assets held by a group entity in a foreign subsidiary for which settlement is neither planned nor anticipated within the foreseeable future, which forms part of the net investment of the foreign operation. These foreign exchange gains and losses are recognized as part of the foreign currency translation adjustments in accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) until disposal.\nFinancial Assets\nCash and cash equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and deposits held on call with banks; all of which are available for use by the Company and have an original maturity of less than three months.\nRestricted cash\nRestricted cash comprises deposits backing guarantees issued by financial institutions on behalf of the Company in respect of the Company\u2019s obligations under certain lease, supply and other agreements, and cash held by MiX Telematics Enterprise BEE Trust (a VIE which is consolidated). Cash held by the Trust is to be used solely for the benefit of its beneficiaries. As at March 31, 2020 and 2021, the cash held by the Trust comprised $0.4 million and $0.5 million, respectively.\nAccounts receivables\nAccounts receivables are amounts due from customers for goods sold or services performed in the ordinary course of business. Since the terms of payment are not more than 12 months, accounts receivables are recognized initially at their transaction price. Subsequent to initial recognition, accounts receivables are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method, less an allowance for doubtful accounts, which reflects expected credit losses .\nAllowance for doubtful accounts\nThe allowance for doubtful accounts on accounts receivables is calculated by considering all relevant information, internal and external about the collectability of cash flows, including information about past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions to appropriately reflect the risk of losses over the remaining contractual lives of the assets. Historical loss rates, calculated as actual losses over a period as a percentage of revenue, are adjusted for current conditions and management\u2019s expectations about future economic conditions.\nThe allowance is measured on a collective basis where management groups their customers appropriately based on their credit risk characteristics.\nThe allowance for doubtful accounts is a valuation account and the asset\u2019s carrying amount is reduced and the amount of the loss is recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance. Actual write-downs are recorded when the asset is deemed uncollectible after all efforts to recover have yielded no results.\nLoans to external parties\nLoans to external parties are recognized initially at fair value, and subsequently at amortized cost using the effective interest method, less expected credit losses over the lifetime of the loan.\nExpected credit losses are determined using management\u2019s estimate of the probability of default and the value of the underlying security. Loans to external parties are included within Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nConcentration of Credit Risk\nCredit risk arises from restricted cash, cash and cash equivalents as well as credit exposures to customers and loans to external parties. The Company analyses the credit risk for each of its new customers based on predefined requirements before standard payment and delivery terms and conditions are offered. An allowance for doubtful accounts is provided for individual accounts. Cash investments are only placed with reputable financial institutions. Management believes that financial institutions that hold the Company\u2019s deposits are financially credit worthy and, accordingly, minimal credit risk exists with respect to those balances.\nFair value measurements\nThe Company has no financial assets or liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis. The carrying amounts of the Company\u2019s financial instruments, except for loans to external parties, approximate their fair values due to their short-term nature, The fair value of the loans to external parties is determined using unobservable market data (Level 3 inputs), that represent management\u2019s estimate of current interest rates that a commercial lender would charge the borrowers.\nWhen certain triggering events occur, the Company is required to assess non-financial assets for impairment. When impaired, non-financial assets are written down to fair value. The Company uses valuation approaches that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs to the extent possible. The Company determines fair value based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset in the principal or most advantageous market.\nFair value is determined in accordance with ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement and is categorized as follows:\nLevel 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;\nLevel 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (that is, as prices) or indirectly (that is, derived from prices); and\nLevel 3: Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (that is, unobservable inputs).\nInventories\nInventories comprise finished goods which are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost is determined using a first-in, first-out (\u201cFIFO\u201d), actual cost or weighted average cost basis. The cost of inventories includes the cost of manufacturing as charged by third parties and excludes borrowing costs. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation, and is based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. Impairments of inventory are not subsequently reversed. During the years ended March 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021, $0.3 million, $0.3 million and $0.7 million was recognized, respectively, as a charge in cost of sales as a result of the write-down of inventory to net realizable value.\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets comprise prepaid taxes, prepaid expenses and current income tax assets.\nProperty and equipment\nProperty and equipment are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses. Historical cost includes all expenditure directly attributable to the acquisition of the items of property and equipment. Subsequent costs are included in the asset\u2019s carrying amount or recognized as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Company and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. Repairs and maintenance are charged to the Consolidated Statement of Income in the reporting period in which they are incurred.\nThe cost of in-vehicle devices installed in vehicles (including installation and shipping costs) as well as the cost of uninstalled in-vehicle devices, are capitalized as property and equipment. The Company depreciates installed in-vehicle devices on a straight-line basis over their expected useful lives, commencing upon installation, whereas uninstalled in-vehicle devices are not depreciated until installed. The related depreciation expense is recorded as part of cost of sales in the Consolidated Statement of Income. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method to reduce the cost of the asset to its residual value over its estimated useful life, as follows:\nEquipment 1 - 8 years\nMotor vehicles 3 - 7 years\nFurniture, fixtures and equipment 1 - 10 years\nComputer equipment 1 - 7 years\nIn-vehicle devices installed 1 - 6.5 years\nThe assets\u2019 residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at the end of each reporting period.\nGains or losses on disposal or retirement are recognized within Other income/(expenses) in the Consolidated Statement of Income.\nRight-of-use assets are included in Property and Equipment on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nLeases\nThe Company as a lessee\nThe Company recognizes a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date for all leases except for those that have a lease term of 12 months or less and do not contain a purchase option that is reasonably certain to be exercised. The lease payments associated with these leases are recognized as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nRight-of use assets are initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the related lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred, less any lease incentives received.\nAll of the Company\u2019s leases which are capitalized are classified as operating leases. This means that the right-of-use asset is depreciated in such a manner, that together with the interest charge on the lease liability, the Company achieves a straight-line total lease expense over the lease period.\nLease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise the following:\n\u2022fixed payments; and\n\u2022lease payments in an optional renewal period if the Company is reasonably certain to exercise an extension option.\nThe lease liability is measured at amortized cost using the relevant group entity\u2019s incremental borrowing rate at inception of the lease. The lease liability is remeasured when the Company changes its assessment of whether an extension option will be exercised, when a termination notice is served, or when there are other changes to the terms of the lease such as rent concessions or an extension to the lease term that was not initially catered for in the lease agreement.\nWhen the lease liability is remeasured, a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset. The adjustment is recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Income once the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset has been reduced to zero.\nThe Company presents right-of-use assets within property and equipment, and lease liabilities within accrued expenses and other liabilities, on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill is not amortized but is tested for possible impairment at least annually, or when circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. Goodwill is allocated to a reporting unit for the purpose of impairment testing. The carrying value of the reporting unit, to which goodwill has been allocated, is compared to its fair value, and a goodwill impairment charge is recognized for the amount (if any) by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value, limited to the amount of the goodwill. No impairments of goodwill existed as of the most recent testing date of March 31, 2021 or the previous testing date of March 31, 2020. The changes in the carrying value of goodwill during fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2021 are attributable only to foreign currency translation adjustments.\nThe allocation of goodwill to reporting units is as follows (in thousands):\nAs of March 31,\n2020 2021\nCentral Services Organization $ 5,754 $ 6,913\nEurope 8,106 8,993\nMiddle East and Australasia 4,364 4,364\nAfrica 19,699 23,668\n$ 37,923 $ 43,938\nSensitivity of goodwill to impairment as of March 31, 2021 was as follows:\nCentral Services Organization Africa Europe Middle East and Australasia\nFair value of reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount by 558.7 % 403.9 % 38.6 % 119.5 %\nPost-tax discount rate used to determine fair value 14.7 % 14.7 % 9.8 % 8.0 %\nGrowth rate used to extrapolate cash flow beyond the budget period 4.4 % 4.4 % 2.0 % 1.8 %\nThe following mutually exclusive changes will result in nil headroom\nPost-tax discount rate applied to the expected cash flow projections 40.3 % 49.6 % 12.4 % 14.8 %\nDecrease in the cash flow projections of 81.7 % 80.2 % 27.7 % 54.5 %\nAlthough there were no impairments of goodwill as of March 31, 2021, significant judgement was exercised in determining the fair value of each reporting unit, especially in light of COVID-19, which has had and, we believe, will continue to have an adverse impact on global economies and financial markets. In particular, to the extent that anticipated new contracts do not materialize and the business strategy does not come to fruition, or key personnel are not retained, the forecasts on which the impairment tests were performed could be negatively impacted.\nIntangible assets\nPatents and trademarks\nPatents and trademarks acquired in a business combination are recognized at fair value at the acquisition date. Patents and trademarks have a finite useful life and are subsequently carried at cost less accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment losses. Amortization is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate the cost of patents and trademarks over their estimated useful lives which range from 3 to 20 years.\nCustomer relationships\nCustomer relationships acquired in a business combination are recognized at fair value at the acquisition date. Customer relationships have a finite useful life and are subsequently carried at cost less accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment losses. Amortization is calculated over the expected useful life of the customer relationship ranging from 2 to 15 years and reflects the pattern in which future economic benefits of the customer relationship are expected to be generated. The useful life principally reflects management\u2019s view of the average economic life of the customer base and is assessed by reference to factors such as customer churn rates.\nInternal-use software and technology\nThe Company capitalizes as intangible assets, internal-use software acquired or developed solely to meet the Company\u2019s internal needs. Costs, excluding general and administrative costs, are capitalized from the date on which management implicitly or explicitly authorizes, or commits to fund, the project, and it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will perform the intended function (application development stage). All costs incurred during the preliminary development stage are expensed. Capitalization ceases when the project is substantially complete and the software is ready for its intended use.\nCosts, including annual licenses, associated with maintaining computer software programs, and training costs are expensed as incurred. Costs incurred for upgrades and enhancements (modifications to existing internal-use software that provides additional functionality) are capitalized during the application development stage.\nSoftware capitalized is amortized on a straight line basis over its estimated useful life ranging from 1 to 18 years, commencing on the date when the software is ready for its intended use.\nComputer software for external use\nComputer software for external use refers to the firmware that is developed by the Company for the devices and other hardware provided to its customers. The costs of developing firmware are expensed as incurred prior to the establishment of its technological feasibility, from which point the development costs are capitalized and recognized as intangible assets. For the periods presented, technological feasibility could only be demonstrated shortly before the release of the firmware, and as a result, the development costs that meet the requirements for capitalization are not material.\nImpairment of long-lived assets\nIntangible assets that are not ready for use are not subject to amortization but are assessed annually for impairment or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that they might be impaired.\nLong-lived assets that are subject to amortization or depreciation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.\nAn asset is written down immediately to its fair value if its carrying amount is greater than its future undiscounted cash flows. Recognized impairment losses are not reversed.\nFor the purposes of assessing impairment, long-lived assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities.\nImpairment losses recognized during the years ended March 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021 were less than $0.1 million for each year.\nCommon stock\nIncremental external costs directly attributable to the issuance of new shares or the exercise of stock options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds .\nIf a Group company purchases the Company\u2019s equity instruments (treasury stock), then the consideration paid, including any directly attributable incremental costs (net of income taxes) is deducted from equity attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company as treasury stock until the shares are canceled or reissued. If such ordinary shares are subsequently reissued, then any consideration received, net of any directly attributable incremental transaction costs and the related income tax effects, is included in equity attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company. MiX Telematics Investments Proprietary Ltd (\u201cMiX Investments\u201d), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, holds 53,816,750 of the Company\u2019s ordinary shares of no par value. These shares are held as treasury stock.\nShare repurchases\nOn May 23, 2017, the Company\u2019s Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program of up to R270 million (equivalent of $18.1 million as of March 31, 2021) under which the Company may repurchase its ordinary shares, including American Depositary Shares (\u201cADSs\u201d). The Company may repurchase its shares from time to time at its discretion through open market transactions and block trades, based on ongoing assessments of the capital needs of the Company, the market price of its securities and general market conditions. This share repurchase program may be discontinued at any time by the Board of Directors, and the Company has no obligation to repurchase any amount of its securities under the program. The repurchase program will be funded out of existing cash resources.\nDuring the years ended March 31, 2019 and 2020 , the Company repurchased 9,157,695 and 16,856,001 shares, respectively, for an aggregate repurchase consideration of $5.3 million and $9.8 million respectively. Subsequent to the repurchases during fiscal 2019, the shares were de-listed and now form part of the authorized unissued share capital of the Company. MiX Investments holds 13,816,750 of the shares repurchased during fiscal 2020, and the balance of the shares repurchased during fiscal 2020 of 3,039,251 were de-listed and now form part of the authorized unissued share capital of the Company. No share repurchases were made during fiscal 2021. The maximum value of shares that may still be repurchased under the program is R33.5 million (equivalent of $2.2 million as of March 31, 2021). The authority to repurchase shares will expire at the upcoming annual general meeting.\nTaxation\nIncome taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Income tax expense is recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income, except to the extent that it relates to items recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. The Company uses the portfolio approach for releasing income tax effects from accumulated other comprehensive income.\nThe current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws and tax rates enacted by the reporting date in the countries where the Company and its subsidiaries operate and generate taxable income. Interest, and penalties, incurred on the underpayment of income taxes is classified as interest expense, and administration expenses, respectively.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax is measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Valuation allowances are provided when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the extent it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.\nManagement periodically evaluates its tax positions with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation. For uncertainties in income tax positions if it is more likely than not that some tax benefit will be sustained based on the technical merits of the position, then the tax benefit recognized is the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. If it is not more likely than not that some tax benefit will be sustained, then zero tax benefit is recognized. There were no material uncertain tax positions as of March 31, 2020 and 2021.\nDeferred tax liabilities arising on investments in domestic subsidiaries are not recognized to the extent that the investment can be recovered on a tax-free basis; and on investments in foreign subsidiaries to the extent that the undistributed earnings will be invested indefinitely or will be remitted in a tax-free liquidation.\nStock-based compensation\nThe Company operates various stock-based compensation plans, under which the entity receives services from employees as consideration for equity instruments of the Company. Settlement has taken place out of a fresh issue of shares. The equity instruments that may be granted in terms of the plans include stock options, retention shares, performance shares and stock appreciation rights, all of which entitle the holder to obtain shares in the Company. The fair value, determined at grant date, of the equity instruments granted is recognized as an expense over the vesting period, taking expected forfeiture into account, with a corresponding credit to additional paid-in capital. At the end of each reporting period, the Company revises its estimate of the number of equity instruments that are expected to vest, using historical and current information, and recognizes the impact of any revisions in the Consolidated Statement of Income, with a corresponding adjustment to additional paid-in capital. Expected forfeitures relating to service conditions are estimated to be 5%.\nAdvertising\nAdvertising costs are expensed as incurred and are classified as sales and marketing expense on the Consolidated Statement of Income. For the years ended March 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021, $2.0 million, $2.0 million and $2.3 million respectively, were expensed.\nRecent accounting pronouncements\nNone of the accounting pronouncements required to be applied by the Company for the first time for the year ended 31 March 2021 had a significant financial reporting impact . In addition, new accounting pronouncements issued by 31 March 2021, but not yet effective for the Company, are not expected to have a significant financial reporting impact.\n3. Credit risk related to accounts receivables\nAs of March 31, 2020 and 2021, the aging analysis of accounts receivables is as follows (in thousands):\nGross Allowance for doubtful accounts Net\nNot past due $ 11,670 $ (366) $ 11,304\nPast due by 1 to 30 days 7,309 (321) 6,988\nPast due by 31 to 60 days 2,799 (158) 2,641\nPast due by more than 60 days 5,924 (2,757) 3,167\nTotal $ 27,702 $ (3,602) $ 24,100\nGross Allowance for doubtful accounts Net\nNot past due $ 10,156 $ (513) $ 9,643\nPast due by 1 to 30 days 4,769 (436) 4,333\nPast due by 31 to 60 days 2,457 (259) 2,198\nPast due by more than 60 days 7,458 (4,367) 3,091\nTotal $ 24,840 $ (5,575) $ 19,265\nThe movements in the allowance for doubtful accounts are as follows (in thousands):\n2020 2021\nBalance at April 1, $ 2,719 $ 3,602\nAdjustment on initial application of ASC 326 301 -\nRestated balance at April 1, 3,020 3,602\nBad debt provision 3,941 2,961\nWrite-offs, net of recoveries* (2,655) (1,656)\nForeign currency translation differences (704) 668\nBalance at March 31, $ 3,602 $ 5,575\n* Amounts written off are not subject to enforcement activity.\nThe measurement of expected credit losses is a function of the probability of default, loss given default (i.e. the magnitude of the loss if there is default) and the exposure at default. The assessment of the probability given default and loss given default is based on historical data adjusted by relevant forward-looking information. The exposure at default is represented by the asset\u2019s gross carrying amount at the reporting date.\nThe Company considers a default to have occurred when a receivable is more than 120 days past due or information determined internally or obtained from external sources indicates that the customer is unlikely to pay its creditors, including the Company, in full. Amounts provided are generally written off when there is no expectation of recovering the amount, in accordance with the Company\u2019s write-off policy.\nOverview of the Company\u2019s exposure to credit risk from customers\nThe maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the carrying value of each receivable and loan to external parties, net of impairment losses where relevant. As of March 31, 2020 and 2021, the Company has no significant concentration of credit risk, due to its spread of customers across various operations and geographical locations.\nThe Company does not hold any collateral as security.\nNet accounts receivables as of March 31, 2020 and 2021 of $2.9 million and $2.3 million, respectively, are pledged as security for the Company\u2019s overdraft facilities.\n4. Property and equipment\nProperty and equipment comprises owned and right of use assets. The Company leases many assets including property, vehicles, machinery and IT equipment.\nThe cost and accumulated depreciation of owned equipment are as follows (in thousands):\nAs of March 31,\n2020 2021\nOwned equipment\nEquipment, vehicles and other $ 6,114 $ 6,877\nIn-vehicle devices 52,824 53,448\nLess: accumulated depreciation and impairments (35,397) (42,955)\nOwned equipment, net $ 23,541 $ 17,370\nTotal depreciation expense related to owned equipment during the years ended March 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021 was $12.5 million, $16.1 million and $12.9 million, respectively. Depreciation expense related to in-vehicle devices is included in subscription cost of revenue.\nThe cost and accumulated depreciation of right-of-use property and equipment are as follows (in thousands):\nAs of March 31,\n2020 2021\nRight-of-use assets\nProperty $ 7,724 $ 8,348\nEquipment, vehicles and other 250 226\nLess: accumulated depreciation (1,496) (2,481)\nRight of use property and equipment, net $ 6,478 $ 6,093\n5. Intangible assets\nIntangible assets comprise the following (in thousands):\nAs of March 31, 2020 As of March 31, 2021\nUseful life (in years) Gross Carrying amount Accumulated amortization Net Gross Carrying amount Accumulated amortization Net\nPatents and trademarks 3 - 20\n$ 76 $ (45) $ 31 $ 115 $ (82) $ 33\nCustomer relationships 2 - 15\n2,600 (2,068) 532 2,687 (2,271) 416\nInternal-use software, technology and other 1 - 18\n26,508 (12,064) 14,444 35,618 (17,764) 17,854\nTotal $ 29,184 $ (14,177) $ 15,007 $ 38,420 $ (20,117) $ 18,303\nFor the years ended March 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021, amortization expense of $3.9 million, $3.8 million, and $3.7 million has been recognized, respectively.\nThe weighted average amortization period of intangible assets purchased during the year ended March 31, 2020 and 2021 is 3 years and 1 year, respectively.\nAs of March 31, 2020 and 2021, there was internal-use software in progress of $2.6 million, and $3.8 million, respectively.\nAs of March 31, 2021, the estimated future amortization expense is as follows (in thousands):\nYears ending March 31,\n2022 $ 5,055\n2023 4,482\n2024 3,756\n2025 2,754\n2026 1,721\nThereafter 535\nTotal $ 18,303\n6. Other assets\nThe following is a summary of other assets (in thousands):\nAs of March 31,\n2020 2021\nDeferred commissions $ 3,614 $ 3,687\nLoans to external parties and other receivables 586 747\nTotal other assets $ 4,200 $ 4,434\nDeferred commissions\nDeferred commissions arise from commissions paid to sales employees and external third parties to obtain contracts with customers, unless the amortization period is 12 months or less, in which instance it is expensed immediately. The following is a summary of the amortization expense (in thousands):\nAs of March 31,\n2020 2021\nAmortization recognized during the year: $ (3,486) $ (3,533)\n-Cost of revenue (external commissions)\n(2,428) (2,552)\n-Sales and marketing (internal commissions)\n(1,058) (981)\nLoans to external parties\nThe loans to external parties relate to Broad-based Black Economic Empowerment transactions entered to in South Africa.\nAs of March 31, 2020 and March 31, 2021, the amortized cost of the loans to Black Industrialists Group Property Management Company (Pty) Ltd (\u201cBIG\u201d) and HSW Management services CC (\u201cHSW\u201d) amounted to $0.5 million and $0.6 million, respectively. All the loans were originated during fiscal 2020, and are on off-market terms. No interest has been charged since origination. The imputed interest rate on the loans to BIG and HSW is 9.65% and 11.65% respectively. Imputed interest rate represents the interest rate that results from a process of approximation required when the present value of a loan must be estimated because an established exchange price is not determinable and the loan has no ready market, while effective interest rate is the rate of return implicit in the loan, that is, contractual interest rate adjusted for any net deferred loan fees or costs, premium, or discount existing at the origination of the loan.\n7.

The disclosures as of March 31, 2020 have been revised to conform to the current period disclosures.\nProduct warranties\nThe Company provides warranties on certain products and undertakes to repair or replace items that fail to perform satisfactorily. Management estimates the related provision for future warranty claims based on historical warranty claim information, the product lifetime, as well as recent trends that might suggest that past cost information may differ from future claims. The table below provides details of the movement in the accrual in thousands:\nAs of March 31,\n2020 2021\nProduct warranties\nOpening balance $ 777 $ 616\nWarranty expense 372 102\nUtilized (409) (211)\nForeign currency translation difference (124) 105\nBalance as of March 31 $ 616 $ 612\nNon-current portion (included in other liabilities) $ 15 $ 7\nCurrent portion $ 601 $ 605\n8.

Leases\nThe Company leases property, office equipment and vehicles under operating leases. The lease terms vary between 1 month and 138 months, with many leases providing renewal rights and certain leases with annual escalations of up to 8% per annum. To the extent the Company is reasonably certain that it will exercise renewal options, such options have been included in the lease terms used for calculating the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities.\nWhere lease terms are 12-months or less, and meet the criteria for short-term lease classification, no right-of-use asset and no lease liability are recognized.\nThe components of lease cost are as follows (in thousands):\nAs of March 31,\n2019 2020 2021\nOperating lease cost $ 1,228 $ 1,631 $ 1,657\nShort-term lease cost 721 198 407\nTotal lease cost $ 1,949 $ 1,829 $ 2,064\nSupplemental cash flow information and non-cash activity related to the Company\u2019s operating leases are as follows (in thousands):\nAs of March 31,\n2019 2020 2021\nOperating cash flow information:\nCash payments included in the measurement of lease liabilities $ 1,270 $ 1,500 $ 1,540\nNon-cash activity:\nRight-of-use assets obtained in exchange for lease obligations $ 815 $ 4,520 $ 110\nWeighted-average remaining lease term - operating leases (months)* 36 46 38\nWeighted-average discount rate - operating leases 5.4 % 7.2 % 7.3 %\n*Including expected renewals where appropriate.\nMaturities of lease liabilities as of March 31 were as follows (in thousands):\n2022 $ 1,473\n2023 1,171\n2024 998\n2025 938\n2026 912\nThereafter 2,731\nTotal lease payments 8,223\nLess: Imputed interest (1,933)\nPresent value of lease liabilities $ 6,290\n10.

MiX Telematics International Proprietary Limited (\u201cMiX International\u201d), a subsidiary of the Company, is eligible for a 150% allowance for research and development spend in terms of section 11D of the South African Income Tax Act. During fiscal years prior to 2017, the additional 50% tax deduction was disallowed on certain projects because the South African Department of Science and Innovation (\u201cDSI\u201d) was of the view that the amounts claimed did not constitute qualifying expenditure. After a lengthy legal process, the DSI approved the additional deductions during fiscal 2020, resulting in the recognition of a tax benefit of $0.5 million for fiscal 2020 that previously was not considered probable.\nThe Company\u2019s weighted average tax rate is 15.3% (2020: 47.2%, 2019: 39.9%).\nThe Company\u2019s net deferred tax liabilities consist of the following (in thousands):\nAs of March 31,\n2020 2021\nDeferred tax liabilities\nCapital allowances for tax purposes 4,141 3,494\nIntangible assets 2,778 3,559\nPrepaid expenses 164 133\nDeferred foreign currency gains 8,402 6,186\nInvestment in subsidiaries 157 427\nDeferred commissions 894 802\nLease assets 842 482\nOther 79 202\nGross deferred tax liabilities 17,457 15,285\nSet-off of deferred tax balances (6,021) (6,098)\nNet deferred tax liabilities 11,436 9,187\nDeferred tax assets\nDeferred revenue 1,059 1,224\nCapital allowances for tax purposes 1,137 823\nAccruals 2,986 5,037\nTax losses 2,578 1,456\nStock based compensation 396 540\nDeferred foreign currency losses 374 407\nRecurring commission liability 169 186\nLease liabilities 913 552\nOther 265 166\nGross deferred tax assets 9,877 10,391\nSet-off of deferred tax balances (6,021) (6,098)\nNet deferred tax assets before valuation allowance 3,856 4,293\nLess valuation allowance (748) (511)\nNet deferred tax assets 3,108 3,782\nNet deferred tax liability (8,328) (5,405)\nThe gross movement in net deferred tax assets/(liabilities) is as follows:\nOpening balance (5,977) (8,328)\nAdjustment on initial application of ASC 326 39 -\nForeign currency translation 2,240 (1,415)\nOther comprehensive income (40) 19\nStatement of Income charge (4,590) 4,319\nClosing balance (8,328) (5,405)\nRecognition of deferred tax\nDeferred tax at year-end has been recognized using the following corporate tax rates:\nRegion 2020 2021\nSouth Africa 28 % 28 %\nAustralia 30 % 30 %\nBrazil 34 % 34 %\nRomania 16 % 16 %\nThailand 20 % 20 %\nUganda 30 % 30 %\nUnited Arab Emirates - % - %\nUnited Kingdom 17 % 19 %\nUnited States of America 21 % 21 %\nRealization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income, if any, the timing and amount of which are uncertain. As of March 31, 2020 and 2021, the Company believes that it is not more likely than not that deferred tax assets of $0.7 million and $0.5 million, respectively, will be realized in respect of cumulative tax losses amounting to $2.8 million and $2.0 million, respectively. Accordingly, the Company has recorded a valuation allowance on such deferred tax assets.\nFor the years ended March 31, 2020, and 2021, the valuation allowance decreased by $0.1 million and $0.3 million primarily as a result of utilizing previously unrecognized tax losses.\nAs at March 31, 2020 and 2021, the Company had tax loss carryforwards of $17.6 million and $11.7 million. respectively. The tax loss carryforwards can be carried forward indefinitely, except for tax losses of $0.2 million in Thailand, which expire between 2023 and 2025.\n11. Earnings per share\nBasic\nBasic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the income attributable to ordinary shareholders of the parent by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year.\nThe net income and weighted average number of shares used in the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share are as follows (in thousands, except per share data):\nAs of March 31,\n2019 2020 2021\nOrdinary Shares:\nIncome attributable to ordinary shareholders $ 14,810 $ 10,987 $ 14,595\nWeighted average number of ordinary shares in issue 563,578 553,653 549,415\nBasic earnings per share $ 0.03 $ 0.02 $ 0.03\nAmerican Depository Shares*:\nIncome attributable to ordinary shareholders $ 14,810 $ 10,987 $ 14,595\nWeighted average number of American Depository Shares in issue 22,543 22,146 21,977\nBasic earnings per American Depository Share $ 0.66 $ 0.50 $ 0.66\n* One American Depository Share is the equivalent of 25 ordinary shares.\nDiluted\nDiluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing the diluted income attributable to ordinary shareholders by the diluted weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year. Stock options, retention shares and stock appreciation rights granted to employees under the TeliMatrix Group Executive Incentive Scheme and the MiX Telematics Long-Term Incentive Plan (\u201cLTIP\u201d) are considered to be potential ordinary shares. They have been included in the determination of diluted earnings per share if the required target share price or annual shareholder return hurdles (as applicable) would have been met based on the performance up to the reporting date, and to the extent to which they are dilutive.\nThe performance share awards were not considered to be dilutive as the performance conditions were not met.\nAs of March 31,\n2019 2020 2021\nDiluted income attributable to ordinary shareholders $ 14,810 $ 10,987 $ 14,595\nWeighted average number of ordinary shares in issue 563,578 553,653 549,415\nAdjusted for:\n- potentially dilutive effect of stock appreciation rights 16,245 12,560 9,872\n- potentially dilutive effect of restricted share units - - 774\n- potentially dilutive effect of stock options 3,918 1,666 562\nDiluted weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue 583,741 567,879 560,624\nDiluted earnings per share $ 0.03 $ 0.02 $ 0.03\nAmerican Depository Shares*:\nDiluted income attributable to ordinary shareholders $ 14,810 $ 10,987 $ 14,595\nDiluted weighted average number of American Depository Shares in issue 23,350 22,715 22,425\nDiluted earnings per American Depository Share $ 0.63 $ 0.48 $ 0.65\n* One American Depository Share is the equivalent of 25 ordinary shares.\n12. Dividends\nThe following dividends were declared (in thousands):\nAs of March 31,\n2019 2020 2021\nDividends declared $ 4,914 $ 6,015 $ 5,367\n13. Segment information\nThe Company has 6 reportable segments, which are based on the geographical location of the 5 Regional Sales Offices (\u201cRSOs\u201d) and also includes the Central Services Organization (\u201cCSO\u201d). CSO is the central services organization that wholesales products and services to RSOs who, in turn, interface with our end-customers, distributors and dealers. CSO is also responsible for the development of hardware and software platforms and provides common marketing, product management, technical and distribution support to each of the other reportable segments. CSO is a reportable segment because it produces discrete financial information which is reviewed by the chief operating decision maker (\u201cCODM\u201d) and has the ability to generate external revenues.\nThe CODM has been identified as the Chief Executive Officer who makes strategic decisions. The performance of the reportable segments has been measured and evaluated by the CODM using Segment Adjusted EBITDA, which is a measure that uses net income, net interest income/(expense), foreign exchange gains or losses, stock-based compensation costs, restructuring costs, gains or losses on the disposal or impairments of long-lived assets and subsidiaries. Product development costs are capitalized and amortized and this amortization is excluded from Segment Adjusted EBITDA. Interest expense and amortization related to leases are also excluded from Segment Adjusted EBITDA.\nIn determining Segment Adjusted EBITDA, the margin generated by CSO, net of any unrealized intercompany profit, is allocated to the geographic region where the external revenue is recorded by our RSOs. The costs remaining in CSO relate mainly to research and development of hardware and software platforms, common marketing, product management and technical and distribution support to each of the RSOs.\nEach RSO\u2019s results therefore reflects the external revenue earned, as well as its performance before the remaining CSO and corporate costs allocations.\nThe segment information provided to the CODM is as follows (in thousands):\nAs of March 31, 2019\nSubscription\nrevenue1\nHardware\nand other\nrevenue2\nTotal\nrevenue Segment Adjusted\nEBITDA\nRegional Sales Offices\nAfrica $ 70,503 $ 5,457 $ 75,960 $ 35,238\nEurope 10,221 5,034 15,255 4,931\nAmericas 21,279 2,646 23,925 11,097\nMiddle East and Australasia 16,439 7,089 23,528 10,610\nBrazil 4,654 322 4,976 2,007\nTotal Regional Sales Offices 123,096 20,548 143,644 63,883\nCentral Services Organization 54 7 61 (11,411)\nTotal Segment Results $ 123,150 $ 20,555 $ 143,705 $ 52,472\n1 Subscription revenue is recognized over time.\n2 Hardware and other revenue is recognized at a point in time.\nAs of March 31, 2020\nSubscription\nrevenue1\nHardware\nand other\nrevenue2\nTotal revenue Segment Adjusted EBITDA\nRegional Sales Offices\nAfrica $ 70,886 $ 5,870 $ 76,756 $ 33,103\nEurope 11,682 3,345 15,027 5,603\nAmericas 22,322 2,207 24,529 10,370\nMiddle East and Australasia 17,389 5,741 23,130 11,031\nBrazil 5,181 614 5,795 2,366\nTotal Regional Sales Offices 127,460 17,777 145,237 62,473\nCentral Services Organization 110 303 413 (9,175)\nTotal Segment Results $ 127,570 $ 18,080 $ 145,650 $ 53,298\n1 Subscription revenue is recognized over time.\n2 Hardware and other revenue is recognized at a point in time.\nAs of March 31, 2021\nSubscription\nrevenue1\nHardware\nand other\nrevenue2\nTotal revenue Segment Adjusted EBITDA\nRegional Sales Offices\nAfrica $ 62,453 $ 5,495 $ 67,948 $ 31,781\nEurope 12,138 2,441 14,579 6,260\nAmericas 18,211 770 18,981 7,077\nMiddle East and Australasia 16,558 4,679 21,237 9,751\nBrazil 3,922 142 4,064 1,495\nTotal Regional Sales Offices 113,282 13,527 126,809 56,364\nCentral Services Organization 69 16 85 (7,553)\nTotal Segment Results $ 113,351 $ 13,543 $ 126,894 $ 48,811\n1 Subscription revenue is recognized over time.\n2 Hardware and other revenue is recognized at a point in time.\nThe revenue from external parties reported to the Company\u2019s CODM is recognized and measured in a manner consistent with that in the Consolidated Statement of Income. Revenue generated by the South African-based operating segments of the Company (i.e. Central Services Organization and Africa, excluding East Africa) to its local and foreign-based customers for fiscal 2019, 2020 and 2021, amounted to $74.6 million, $76.0 million and $67.1 million, respectively. Revenue generated by the foreign-based segments (i.e. Europe, Americas, East Africa, Middle East, Brazil and Australasia) to its local and foreign-based customers for fiscal 2019, 2020 and 2021, amounted to $69.1 million, $69.7 million and $59.8 million.\nA reconciliation of the segment results to income before tax expense for the year is disclosed below (in thousands).\nAs of March 31,\n2019 2020 2021\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA $ 52,472 $ 53,298 $ 48,811\nCorporate and consolidation entries (8,631) (8,366) (8,879)\nLoss contingency 1\n15 (233) -\nExpected credit losses 2\n64 - -\nOperating lease costs 3\n(988) (1,610) (1,652)\nProduct development costs 4\n(1,449) (1,363) (1,112)\nDepreciation and amortization (16,368) (19,972) (16,559)\nImpairment of long-lived assets (62) (6) (8)\nStock-based compensation costs (511) (660) (1,273)\n(Increase)/decrease in restructuring costs 5\n(221) 1 (1,055)\nNet profit/(loss) on sale of property and equipment 43 270 (13)\nNet foreign exchange gains/(losses) 28 (610) (959)\nNet interest income/(expense) 233 67 (72)\nIncome before tax expense for the year $ 24,625 $ 20,816 $ 17,229\n1 For segment reporting purposes, a loss contingency (51% probability), had been raised prior to fiscal 2019. As of March 31, 2020, the loss contingency was no longer needed because an outflow was considered remote. In order to reconcile Segment Adjusted EBITDA to net income before taxes, the increases/decreases to the loss contingency, recognized for segment reporting purposes, needed to be added/deducted.\n2 For segment reporting purposes, in fiscal 2019 the allowance for doubtful accounts was determined using an expected credit loss model. From fiscal 2020, an expected credit loss model has been applied, as a result of the early adoption of ASC 326 Financial Instruments - Credit Losses, which is why there is no longer a reconciling item.\n3 For the purposes of calculating Segment Adjusted EBITDA, operating leases have been capitalized, except for leases with a term of no more than 12 months or leases of low value assets. Where operating leases are capitalized for segment reporting purposes, the amortization of the right-of-use asset and the interest on the operating lease liability are excluded from the Segment Adjusted EBITDA. Therefore, in order to reconcile Segment Adjusted EBITDA to net income before taxes, the total lease expense in respect of operating leases needs to be deducted.\n4 For segment reporting purposes, product development costs, which do not meet the capitalization requirements under ASC 730 Research and Development or under ASC 985 Software, are capitalized and amortized. The amortization is excluded from Segment Adjusted EBITDA. In order to reconcile Segment Adjusted EBITDA to net income before taxes, product development costs capitalized for segment reporting purposes need to be deducted.\n5 During fiscal 2019, restructuring costs of $0.1 million were recognized in each of the Middle East and Australasia segment, and the Africa segment. During fiscal 2021, the Company incurred $1.1 millon of restructuring costs which comprise of employee termination benefits, as a result of measures to minimize the adverse economic and business effect of the COVID-19 pandemic and to re-align resources with the Company's current business outlook and cost structure. $0.7 million, $0.2 million, $0.1 million and $0.1 million of the restructuring costs related to the CSO, Africa, North America and Middle East and Australasia reporting segments, respectively. As of March 31, 2021, substantially all of the restructuring costs had been paid. Restructuring costs are included in Administration and other expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Income.\nSegment assets are not disclosed because such information is not reviewed by the CODM. The following table depicts the geographical location of the Company\u2019s long-lived assets (in thousands) other than financial instruments, deferred commissions and deferred tax assets:\nAs of March 31,\n2020 2021\nSouth Africa $ 56,250 $ 63,832\nAmerica 10,027 10,366\nEurope 9,697 5,178\nMiddle East and Australia 5,559 5,474\nBrazil 1,417 854\nTotal $ 82,950 $ 85,704\nThese assets are allocated based on the physical location of the asset.\nNo single customer accounted for 10% or more of the Company\u2019s total revenue in fiscal years 2019, 2020 and 2021. No single customer accounted for 10% or more of the Company\u2019s accounts receivable as of fiscal years ended 2020 and 2021.\n14. Stock-based compensation plan\nThe Company has issued share incentives under two equity-classified incentive plans, the TeliMatrix Group Executive Incentive Scheme and the MiX Telematics Long-Term Incentive Plan (\u201cLTIP\u201d), to directors and certain key employees within the Company.\nSince the introduction of the LTIP during 2014, no further awards have been made in terms of the TeliMatrix Group Executive Incentive Scheme. The TeliMatrix Group Executive Incentive Scheme has come to an end with the last of the outstanding options being exercised during fiscal 2021. No options remain outstanding under the TeliMatrix Group Executive Incentive Scheme as of March 31, 2021.\nThe LTIP provides for three types of grants to be issued, namely performance shares, restricted share units (\u201cRSUs\u201d) and stock appreciation rights (\u201cSARs\u201d).\nAs of March 31, 2021, there were 47,090,000 shares reserved for future issuance under the LTIP.\nThe total stock-based compensation expense recognized during the years ended March 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021, was $0.5 million, $0.7 million and $1.3 million, respectively. Deferred tax benefits recognized on total stock-based compensation expense in the Statement of Income for the years ended March 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021, was $0.1 million, $0.4 million and $0.1 million, respectively. Tax benefits realized on awards exercised during the years ended March 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021, was $0.1 million, $0.2 million and $0.1 million, respectively.\nStock options granted under the TeliMatrix Group Executive Incentive Scheme\nThe options vested in tranches of 25% per annum, commencing on the second anniversary of the grant date and expired 6 years after the grant date (with the final tranche expiring on September 10, 2020). Vesting was contingent upon employment within the Company and an annual total shareholder return in excess of 10% being met, taking into account any dividends paid during the vesting period. The Company had no legal or constructive obligation to repurchase or settle the options in cash.\nManagement estimated forfeiture to be approximately 5%.\nThe following table summarizes the Company\u2019s stock options for the year ended March 31, 2021:\nNumber of\nOptions Weighted-\nAverage\nExercise Price in U.S. Cents*\nWeighted-Average Remaining Contractual Term (years) Aggregate Intrinsic Value*(in thousands)\nOutstanding as of April 1, 2020 3,500,000 28\nExercised (3,500,000) 28\nOutstanding as of March 31, 2021 - - - $ -\n* The exercise price was denominated in South African cents.

The exercise price of the SARs granted is equal to the closing market value of ordinary shares on the day preceding the date of grant. The SARs granted vest in tranches of 25% per annum, commencing on the second anniversary of the grant date and expire 6 years after the grant date. Vesting is contingent upon employment within the Company and an annual total shareholder return in excess of 10% being achieved, taking into account any dividends paid during the vesting period, being achieved. Management estimates forfeiture to be approximately 5%. Upon exercise, the Company will settle the value of the difference, between the closing market value of the ordinary shares on the day of settlement and the award price, (if positive), by delivering shares. The Company has no legal or\nconstructive obligation to settle the SARs in cash.\nThe following table summarizes the Company\u2019s SARs for the year ended March 31, 2021:\nNumber of\nSARs Weighted-\nAverage\nExercise Price in U.S. Cents* Weighted-Average Remaining Contractual Term (years) Aggregate Intrinsic Value* (in thousands)\nOutstanding as of April 1, 2020 32,943,750 35\nGranted 11,200,000 40\nExercised (2,104,428) 21\nForfeited (1,471,405) 40\nOutstanding as of March 31, 2021 40,567,917 37 3.29\nVested and expected to vest as of March 31, 2021 39,142,292 37 2.50 $ 7,107\nVested as of March 31, 2021 12,055,417 22 1.36 $ 3,804\n* The exercise price is denominated in South African cents.

This amount is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 4.18 years.\nRestricted share units granted under the LTIP\nUnder the LTIP, RSUs may be issued to certain directors and key employees. The scheme rules allow for a maximum of 2 million RSUs to be granted in any financial year and for a maximum of 12 million RSUs to be granted in aggregate over the life of the plan.\n2 million time-based RSUs were granted on June 1, 2020, and will vest in tranches of 50% per annum, commencing on the second anniversary of the grant date. Vesting is conditional upon the continued employment of the recipient with the Company. Management estimates forfeiture to be approximately 5%. Settlement will take place in the Company\u2019s shares. The Company has no legal or constructive obligation to settle the RSUs in cash. The weighted average grant date fair value per RSU granted was 34 U.S. cents. U.S. currency amounts are based on a ZAR:USD exchange rate of 14.9167 as of March 31, 2021.

The Commission contends that the Company and a number of its channel partners have engaged in market division. Should the Tribunal rule against MiX Telematics, the Company may be liable to an administrative penalty in terms of the Competition Act, No. 89 of 1998. The Company had cooperated fully with the Commission during its preliminary\ninvestigation. We cannot predict the timing of a resolution or the ultimate outcome of the matter, however, the Company and its external legal advisers continue to believe that we have consistently adhered to all applicable laws and regulations and that the referral from the Commission is without merit. As of March 31, 2021, we have not made any provisions for this matter as we do not believe that an outflow of economic resources is probable.\n17. Retirement benefits\nIt is the policy of the Company to provide retirement benefits to all its South African, United Kingdom, United States, Brazilian, Romanian and Australian employees. All these retirement benefits are defined contribution plans and are held in separate trustee-administered funds. These plans are funded by members as well as company contributions. The South African plan is subject to the Pension Funds Act of 1956, the UK plan is subject to the United Kingdom Pensions Act 2008 and the Australian plan is subject to the Superannuation Guarantee Administration Act of 1992. In Brazil, the Company contributes to a mandatory state social contribution plan known as Regime Geral de Previd\u00eancia Social. In Romania there is a mandatory social security contribution paid to the state budget, as defined by the Pension Law (Law 263/2010) and the Fiscal Code (Law 227/2015). For the United States employees, a voluntary Internal Revenue Service section 401(k) tax-deferred defined contribution scheme is offered. The full extent of the Company\u2019s liability, in respect of the retirement benefits offered, is the contributions made, which are charged to the Consolidated Statement of Income as they are incurred. The total Company contribution to such schemes for the years ended March 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021 were $2.1 million, $2.2 million and $1.9 million, respectively.\n18.

Lease expenses of $0.5 million and $0.2 million were recognized during the years ended March 31, 2019 and 2020, respectively. During fiscal 2020 the Company acquired the property from TPF and sold it immediately to Black Industrialists Group Property Management Company (Pty) Ltd (\u201cBIG\u201d), a non-related party, as part of a Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment transaction.
