    "item_1": "Item 1. Business.\nUnless otherwise stated in this Annual Report, references to \"Everbridge,\" \"we,\" \"us,\" and \"our\" refer to Everbridge, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.\nOverview\nEverbridge is a global software company that provides enterprise software applications that automate and accelerate organizations\u2019 operational response to critical events in order to keep people safe and businesses running. During public safety threats including active shooter situations, terrorist attacks or severe weather conditions, as well as critical business events such as Information Technology (\u201cIT\u201d) outages, cyber-attacks or other incidents such as product recalls or supply-chain interruptions, over 5,600 global customers rely on our Critical Event Management platform to quickly and reliably aggregate and assess threat data, locate people at risk and responders able to assist, automate the execution of pre-defined communications processes through the secure delivery to over 100 different communication devices, and track progress on executing response plans. Our customers use our platform to identify and assess hundreds of different types of threats to their organizations, people, assets or brand. Our solutions enable organizations to deliver intelligent, contextual messages to, and receive verification of delivery from, hundreds of millions of recipients, across multiple communications modalities such as voice, SMS and e-mail, in over 200 countries and territories, in several languages and dialects - all simultaneously. Our Critical Event Management platform is comprised of a comprehensive set of software applications that address the full spectrum of tasks an organization has to perform to manage a critical event, including Mass Notification, Safety Connection, Incident Management, IT Alerting, Visual Command Center, Public Warning, Community Engagement, Risk Center, Crisis Management, Secure Collaboration, and Control Center. As all of our applications leverage our Critical Event Management platform, customers can use a single contacts database, rules engine of algorithms and hierarchies and user interface to accomplish multiple objectives. We believe that our broad suite of integrated, enterprise applications delivered via a single global platform is a significant competitive advantage in the market for Critical Event Management solutions, which we refer to generally as CEM.\nIn critical situations, the speed at which threats are assessed and information is transmitted and accessed is essential. For example, United States Department of Homeland Security research indicates that the average duration of an active shooter event at a school is approximately 12.5 minutes, while the average police response time to such events is 18 minutes. Accordingly, organizations must be able to aggregate multiple types of threat and incident data and determine whether their people, assets, or suppliers could be impacted, rapidly deliver messages that are tailored to multiple, specific audiences, in precise locations and be assured of delivery. Further, the proliferation of mobile and digital communications has resulted in individuals spending less time in a fixed office location, and this trend makes it more complicated for organizations to protect their employees. These developments have made it imperative that organizations be able to locate travelling or remote workers to determine who might be impacted by a critical event, and that critical communications be delivered via voice, SMS, and email, as well as to social media, outdoor signage and personal computers. During public safety threats and critical business events, the ability to gather, organize and analyze data in real time, and to enable secure, scalable, reliable and automated communications to people can be essential to saving lives, protecting assets and maintaining businesses. Further, the ability to rapidly organize a response by locating available responders and using automation to reduce the time required to initiate action can also result in significant economic savings, as, for example, each minute of unplanned IT downtime costs organizations an average of approximately $8,900, according to the Ponemon Institute.\nThe following situations reflect examples of how our applications aggregate and assess data and enable improved management of critical events:\n\u2022\nWhen an active shooter situation or terrorist attack occurs, organizations can quickly identify employees in the affected area, including employees not at their usual business location, in order to confirm that they are safe and provide tailored instructions. For example, shelter-in-place instructions may be provided to people in an impacted building while evacuation instructions are provided to those in an adjacent building. At the same time, first responders and hospitals can use multiple modes of alerting to mobilize resources and call in staff to provide emergency care.\n\u2022\nWhen a pandemic such as COVID-19 is underway, corporate, government and healthcare organizations can navigate the complexity of operating during the shutdown phases, supplement or complement existing manual contact tracing efforts and prepare to bring back the workforce and reopen society.\n\u2022\nWhen a hurricane is imminent, local emergency management departments can alert affected communities with relevant safety and evacuation instructions while companies can put in place emergency plans to notify employees of office closures while coordinating work assignments to maintain the continuity of core operations.\n\u2022\nWhen emergency operations are required or supply chain events occur, companies can consolidate separate command centers using one common data set to aggregate and assess data on severe weather, political unrest and other types of threats to their own and suppliers\u2019 operations, thereby reducing costs while gaining efficiencies.\n\u2022\nWhen IT systems fail, IT administrators can shorten the time required to alert cross-department responders, use scheduling information to determine availability and quickly assemble appropriate personnel on a conference bridge, thereby reducing the costs incurred from downtime.\n\u2022\nWhen a patient is suspected of having a stroke, an on-call specialist can provide a patient assessment via video communications during the ambulance trip and the emergency room can be readied for an immediate stroke treatment, accelerating critical time to treatment.\n\u2022\nWhen a cyber incident shuts down an IT network, management can alert employees of the network shutdown via a secure, alternate communication path.\n\u2022\nWhen a power line is down, utility workers can utilize pre-configured incident management templates to alert affected customers and responders and provide service updates.\n\u2022\nWhen engine readings in critical equipment detect a malfunction, technicians with the appropriate skills can be automatically alerted and quickly deployed to minimize downtime and avoid revenue loss or service interruption.\n\u2022\nWhen readings from an implanted medical device are abnormal, that information can be automatically routed to the individual\u2019s healthcare provider to enable timely medical care.\n\u2022\nWhen a young child goes missing, local officials can send alerts to and receive tips from their communities to aid in locating and returning the child.\n\u2022\nWhen a financial services firm experiences disruptions in service, clients can be promptly notified and audit confirmations can be provided to document delivery.\nOur customer base has grown from 867 customers at the end of 2011 to more than 5,600 customers as of December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2020, our customers were based in 70 countries and included eight of the 10 largest U.S. cities, nine of the 10 largest U.S.-based investment banks, 47 of the 50 busiest North American airports, nine of the 10 largest global consulting firms, eight of the 10 largest global automakers, nine of the 10 largest U.S.-based health care providers, and seven of the 10 largest technology companies in the world. We provide our applications to customers of varying sizes, including enterprises, small businesses, non-profit organizations, educational institutions and governmental agencies. Our customers span a wide variety of industries including technology, energy, financial services, healthcare and life sciences, manufacturing, media and entertainment, retail, higher education and professional services.\nWe derive substantially all of our revenue from subscriptions to our critical communications applications, which represented 85%, 88% and 92% of our total revenue in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. We derived approximately 50% of our revenue in 2020 from sales of our Mass Notification application. Our pricing model is based on the number of applications subscribed to and, per application, the number of people, locations and things connected to our platform, as well as the volume of communications. We also offer premium services including data feeds for social media, threat intelligence and weather. We generate additional revenue by expanding the number of applications that our customers subscribe to and the number of contacts and devices connected to our platform.\nIndustry Background\nOver the past two decades, methods to assess critical events and to automate, accelerate and digitally transform the process of managing and responding to such events have evolved rapidly, in tandem with advances in technology, to include automated or system-generated responses, such as voice calls, text messages, emails, social media and outdoor digital signage. In critical situations, the speed at which threats are assessed and information is transmitted are essential.\nEvolution of Critical Event Management Solutions\nTraditional solutions for critical communications have not kept pace with the increasingly digital world, the evolving threat landscape and the opportunity to leverage technological innovation to more effectively gain situational awareness and to communicate with people. These solutions are often developed in-house or are not truly enterprise grade in scale and reliability, leaving many organizations to manually evaluate multiple streams of threat data and to use analog, one-way and people-based modalities to communicate with relevant stakeholders. These solutions lack the scale to reliably address the breadth of the different critical challenges that organizations increasingly face, the sophistication required to address evolving needs with aggregated data and analysis for threat assessment, automated workflows and the ability to rapidly deliver messages that are contextually tailored to multiple, specific audiences, in precise locations, using a variety of different communication modalities. Traditional solutions also typically determine a person\u2019s location for threat assessment and availability for response, and send notifications, based upon a static work or home address. Given the mobile and increasingly remote nature of today\u2019s workforce, solutions now need to be able to dynamically locate who is near a critical event and send instructions to impacted parties and responders based upon where they actually are.\nCEM solutions digitally transform the response to natural, manmade and digital crises, building upon the strengths of modern critical communications with vital data, analytics, correlation, and seamless orchestration. Organizations today typically manage critical events across the organization in silos that use disparate data sources and unintegrated tools, making it difficult to achieve a common operational view of threats and of the status of response. Utilizing a common contact base, consistent rules engines, threat databases that are integrated with information on the location of an organization\u2019s people, assets and suppliers, and a common visualization platform, CEM solutions can provide a more integrated solution which can improve management control and visibility and lower costs. The ability to cohesively and rapidly share information and collaborate across the organization underlies creating a common operational approach.\nKey Benefits of Our Solutions and Competitive Strengths\nEverbridge was founded with a vision to help organizations keep their people (employees, contractors, customers, residents, visitors) safe and operations running amid the many types of public safety and critical business events that pose threats. Our CEM solutions enable organizations to assess threats, locate impacted people and assets, and manage and respond to critical events, all on a single platform. Key benefits of our solutions and competitive strengths include the following:\n\u2022\nComprehensive, Enterprise-Scale Platform. The core of our solutions is our Critical Event Management platform, which provides multiple layers of redundancy to assure uptime and delivery of communications regardless of volume or throughput requirements. The platform is secure, scalable and reliable, enabling the delivery and verification of tens of millions of different communications virtually anywhere, in any volume, in near real-time. In 2020, we delivered over 5 billion interactions, or about 158 interactions per second, through our globally distributed data centers.\n\u2022\nDigital Transformation. Our solutions help enable our customers\u2019 digital transformation efforts by automating business continuity, risk reduction, and operational resilience. Customers can use our solutions\u2019 situational awareness capabilities to know where their people are, how to reach them and how to ensure that they are protected, while also remaining updated on the status of their facilities, customers, inventory, and goods in transit. As part of digital transformation initiatives, our solutions support operational risk reduction for better operational resiliency.\n\u2022\nOut-of-the-Box, Scalable and Mobile Applications. Our SaaS-based applications are out-of-the box, enterprise-ready and can be utilized without customer development, testing or ongoing maintenance. Regardless of a customer or prospect\u2019s size or needs, our applications are built to scale to its largest and most complex critical communications requirements.\n\u2022\nAggregated Threat Data and Analysis. Our software gathers and analyzes information from weather data feeds, public safety and threat data feeds, social media, IT ticketing systems and monitoring systems, as well as inputs and feedback from two-way and polling messages. Data can be geo-mapped and threat and incident data can be used to automatically trigger simple or complex workflows that are tied to standard operating procedures or run-books.\n\u2022\nContextual Communications. We enable intelligence and personalization in the critical communications process by delivering contextual communications. Our customers can deliver and escalate critical communications broadly to a mass population or to a targeted subset of individuals based on geographic location, skill level, role and communication modality preferences for rich, two-way collaboration.\n\u2022\nDynamic Location Awareness. Our platform can provide organizations with the ability to send and receive notifications based on the last known locations of people, not just based on a static office or home address. Our platform integrates with a variety of sources of location information, including building access control systems and corporate network access solutions. This location-specific approach enables organizations to quickly determine which individuals may be affected by a public safety threat or able to respond to a critical business event, and to provide targeted and relevant instructions and two- way communications.\n\u2022\nLarge, Dynamic and Rich Communications Data Asset. As of December 31, 2020, our data asset consists of our contacts databases that manage approximately 490 million contact profiles and connections from more than 5,600 customers based in 70 countries. Our contacts databases, which we refer to as contact stores, are initially created through an upload of contacts from the customer and are automatically updated with the most current contact information provided by the customer or by individuals who opt-in to receive notifications from our Community Engagement application. Our contact stores are repositories for all contact details, attributes and business rules and preferences, such as a person\u2019s last-known location, language spoken, special needs, technical certifications and on-call status.\n\u2022\nMulti-channel Visualization. Our platform provides the ability to create an integrated view of threats, incidents and the status of response, all within the context of the locations of an organization\u2019s people, assets and suppliers. Multiple channels of information can be displayed side-by-side so different facets of a critical event can be monitored simultaneously, and the same data can be displayed on personal computer screens and on a large command center wall to provide flexibility in deployment.\n\u2022\nRobust Security, Industry Certification and Compliance. Our platform is built on a secure and resilient infrastructure with multiple layers of redundancy. Many of our enterprise applications are designed to meet rigorous security and compliance requirements for financial services firms, healthcare institutions, the U.S. federal government and other regulated industries, including facilitating compliance with FINRA and HIPAA standards. Our solutions received designation under the Support Anti-terrorism by Fostering Effective Technology Act of 2002 (\u201cSAFETY Act\u201d), and certification by U.S. Department of Homeland Security that places us on the approved product list for homeland security. Our solutions are also accredited under the Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002 (\u201cFISMA\u201d). Our Everbridge Suite solution also achieved authorization under the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (\u201cFedRAMP\u201d) in 2018, that required satisfying a rigorous security and risk management review process and which we believe provides an advantage for selling into the U.S. federal sector. In 2019, our Critical Event Management platform received certification under International Organization for Standardization, or ISO, 27001 and also received Cloud Computing Compliance Controls Catalogue (\u201cC5\u201d) accreditation under the Federal Office for Information Security in Germany. In 2020, we received ISO 27701 compliance, the privacy extension to ISO 27001, and successfully renewed our FedRAMP Agency Authorization.\n\u2022\nAutomated Workflows. Our platform automates the workflows required to complete a critical notification, including establishing the individuals within an organization authorized to send messages, the groups of stakeholders to whom messages will be sent and the content of messages to be sent to different groups of relevant stakeholders, in each case based on incident type. We believe that this automation reduces the amount of time required to send critical notification as well as the associated cost. Our platform also enables customers to automatically establish procedures for improving the success of communication efforts.\n\u2022\nGlobally Local. Our platform is designed to be utilized globally while accounting for local cultural, linguistic, regulatory and technological differences. We have relationships with suppliers and carriers in multiple countries to ensure delivery in compliance with local, technical and regulatory requirements. We have localized our user interface in several languages and dialects.\n\u2022\nNext-Generation, Open Architecture. We developed our platform to easily integrate our applications with other systems. Our solutions provide open Application Program Initiatives (\u201cAPI\u201ds), and configurable integrations, enabling our platform to work with our customers\u2019 and partners\u2019 pre-existing processes and solutions, increasing the business value we deliver.\n\u2022\nActionable Reporting and Analytics. Our platform provides real-time dashboards, advanced map-based visualization and ad-hoc reporting across notifications, incidents and contacts. This information is easily accessed for required after-event reviews, continuous process improvements and regulatory compliance.\nOur Growth Strategy\nWe intend to drive growth in our business by building on our position as a global provider of critical event management, critical communications and enterprise safety applications. Key elements of our growth strategy include:\n\u2022\nAccelerate Our Acquisition of New Customers. We have multiple paths of entry into new customers with our portfolio of applications, which are used for a wide variety of use cases across a diverse set of verticals markets. We intend to capitalize on the breadth of our solutions and the technological advantages of our CEM platform to continue to attract new customers. In parallel, we plan to attract new customers by investing in sales and marketing and expanding our channel partner relationships.\n\u2022\nFurther Penetrate Our Existing Customers. We believe that there is a significant opportunity within our existing customer base to expand their use of our platform, both by selling new applications and features to our existing customers and selling to additional departments in their organizations. Our dollar-based net retention rate, which we define as revenue generated from existing customers including recurring revenue, expansion revenue, downgrades, and cancels, was over 110% for fiscal 2020. We also believe that we have a significant opportunity to increase the lifetime value of our customer relationships as we educate customers about the benefits of our current and future applications that they do not already utilize and of taking an integrated CEM approach. New applications added, which represent the total dollar value of new agreements entered into within the prior 12 months, exclusive of renewals, have grown from 6% of our sales in the first quarter of 2016 to 66% of our sales in the fourth quarter of 2020.\n\u2022\nExpand Our Partner Ecosystem: We continue to expand our strategic partnerships with our channel partners, technology partners, and system integrators. We intend to further expand our partner ecosystem to open up new channels to market and to enable our customers to succeed with our technology and platform in their operations and business processes.\n\u2022\nDevelop New Applications to Target New Markets and Use Cases. Our platform is highly flexible and can support the development of new applications to meet evolving safety and operational challenges. For example, throughout 2020, we announced a number of applications under the heading COVID-19 Shield, an extension to our CEM platform offering public health information, risk insights, wellness checks, logistics awareness and vaccine appointment management. We deployed our CEM Platform for a variety of COVID-19 uses, including to power countrywide communications about the pandemic, deliver health checks at higher education institutions, and coordinate vaccine distribution for a number of municipalities and organizations. We intend to continue to develop new applications for use cases in a variety of new markets and to leverage our platform and our existing customer relationships as a source of new applications, industry use cases, features and solutions.\n\u2022\nExpand Our International Footprint. We intend to continue to expand our local presence in regions such as Europe, the Middle East and Asia to leverage our relationships with local carriers and our ability to deliver messages to over 200 countries and territories in several languages and dialects as well as expand our channel partnerships and also to opportunistically consider expanding in other regions.\n\u2022\nMaintain Our Technology and Thought Leadership. We will continue to invest in our core CEM platform and our applications to maintain our technology leadership position. For example, we believe that we are the only company today that provides a full, integrated CEM solution and that we provide the first solution to offer dynamic versus static location awareness integrated with analysis and communications for the employee safety and security marketplace. Further, we believe we have a competitive advantage through our commitment to innovation and thought leadership that has enabled us to take market share from our competitors and accelerate our growth.\n\u2022\nOpportunistically Pursue Acquisitions. We plan to continue to selectively pursue acquisitions of complementary businesses, technologies and teams that allow us to penetrate new markets and add features and functionalities to our platform.\nOur Platform\nSince inception, our SaaS-based critical communications platform was architected on a single code base to deliver multi-tenant capability and the speed, scale and resilience necessary to communicate, collaborate and orchestrate the response to critical events, when they occur.\nAdditional core technical attributes of our platform include:\n\u2022\nMonitors more than 100 types of threat data and aggregates more than 25,000 of risk data elements for situation assessment and risk monitoring.\n\u2022\nMulti-tenant architecture that supports multiple layers of redundancy to maximize uptime and delivery of critical content, regardless of volume or throughput requirements.\n\u2022\nDynamic spatial/geographic information system capability to geo-target communications by zip code, street address or a specific radius from a location.\n\u2022\nSupport for two-way communications and alerting on over 100 different modalities, including wireless phones, landlines, hand-held communication and other voice-capable devices, desktop, satellite communication, cell broadcast, location-based SMS, SMS, two-way radios, TV, outdoor digital signage, sirens and internet enabled devices, social media, websites.\n\u2022\nDesigned to meet rigorous security and compliance requirements for financial services firms, healthcare institutions, the U.S. federal government and other regulated industries, including facilitating compliance with health care requirements such as HIPAA privacy and security standards including FedRAMP, the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, and ISO 27001.\n\u2022\nExtensive set of APIs and configuration capabilities to allow customers and partners to easily integrate our platform with other systems.

They are initially created through an upload of contacts from the customer and are automatically updated with the most current contact information provided by the customer or by individuals who opt-in to receive notification from our Community Engagement application. Our contact stores are simultaneously enriched by geographic, situational and other real-time data. Our contact stores are repositories for all contact details, attributes and business rules and preferences, such as a person\u2019s last-known location, language spoken, special needs, technical certifications and on-call status.\nWe leverage the data contained in our contact stores in a number of significant ways. Our data asset across multiple verticals enables us to develop best practices for reaching the intended contact, on the correct device, at the right location, at the appropriate time. We also use these data to better understand our customer base and their emerging use cases in order to improve our existing applications and develop new applications.\nEverbridge Network\nAn important component of our platform is our Everbridge Network, which allows our customers to share relevant situational awareness information with each other. Public safety agencies, for example, can publish information to the Everbridge Network about incidents that might prove disruptive to the movement of people, goods and services for businesses within a certain area. If any of those businesses are also customers of ours, they will receive this information from a source they know is vetted and reliable and will be able to take timely steps to mitigate or remediate the situation.\nOur Applications\nThrough our CEM platform, we deliver reliable enterprise-ready applications that provide organizations with the ability to assess threats, locate people, automate actions, monitor incident response, and deliver contextual communications in any volume, in near-real time. We have designed our applications\u2019 user interface to be easy to use. We understand that since some of our applications will be utilized to manage complex situations or to send large volumes of messages to key stakeholders during stressful situations, streamlining the user interface to reduce user errors and anxiety is essential. We conduct extensive usability testing and design reviews with our stakeholders, and have applied in our designs the lessons learned over more than a decade of working with critical communications users and professionals.\nOur applications enable:\n\u2022\nCommunications to key stakeholders during emergency situations.\n\u2022\nCorporate communications with customers and employees.\n\u2022\nAutomated outreach to on-call personnel.\n\u2022\nIntegrated threat assessment and visualization.\n\u2022\nIntegration of physical security data with location awareness data gathered from travel, network and access systems to rapidly find and communicate with employees during disruptive events.\n\u2022\nSecurely designed and efficiently implemented communications among healthcare providers and patients.\n\u2022\nCommunity engagement and collaboration with citizens and businesses.\n\u2022\nCritical IoT communications between machines and from machines to people.\n\u2022\nMobile response plan deployment and management of incidence response.\nOur applications include:\n\u2022\nMass Notification. Our secure, scalable and reliable Mass Notification application is our most established application and enables enterprises and governmental entities to send contextually aware notifications to individuals or groups to keep them informed before, during and after natural or man-made disasters and other emergencies. We provide robust analytics, map-based targeting, flexible group management, distributed contact data, language localization, multiple options for contact data management and a globally-optimized approach to voice and SMS routing. We also support community engagement functionality, which provides a direct link between residents and emergency management departments with the goal of fostering public safety.\n\u2022\nSafety Connection. Our Safety Connection application enables organizations to send notifications based on dynamic last known location of an individual, including the airport, street, building floor or conference room at which the individual was most recently present, while actively incorporating threat and other data to allow for targeted and relevant communications. When fully deployed, the application can also aggregate near real-time data from multiple sources, including building access control systems, wired and wireless network access points, travel management systems and mobile application check-ins. We believe that Safety Connection represents a significant advance in helping organizations use critical communications to keep their constituents safe, as many current solutions use only static office and residential locations that are not sufficiently location-aware relative to an increasingly mobile workforce.\n\u2022\nIncident Management. Our Incident Management application enables organizations to automate workflows and make their communications contextually relevant using drag and drop business rules to determine who should be contacted, how they should be contacted and what information is required. We believe that this application decreases costly human errors and reduces downtime, while simultaneously capturing required compliance information. We also support cross-account collaboration and situational intelligence sharing during crises for corporations and communities.\n\u2022\nIT Alerting. Our IT Alerting application enables IT professionals to alert and communicate with key members of their teams during an IT incident or outage, including during a cyber security breach. The application integrates with IT service management platforms, including ServiceNow, and uses automatic escalation of alerts, on-call scheduling and mobile alerting to automate manual tasks and keep IT teams collaborating during an incident. We also provide real-time shift calendars with integrated on-call notifications to help users better manage employee resources and get the right message to the right person, at the right time through automated staffing. Taken together, our IT Alerting application has the potential to provide meaningful savings to organizations by reducing mean-time-to-repair. Each minute of unplanned downtime costs organizations an average of approximately $8,900 according to Ponemon Institute, while 59% of Fortune 500 companies experience 1.6 hours of downtime per week, according to Dunn & Bradstreet. IHS, Inc. estimates information and communication technology downtime costs North American organizations $700 billion per year.\n\u2022\nVisual Command Center. Our Visual Command Center application enables customers to monitor and integrate more than 100 types of threat data, as well as information on internal incidents, to generate and visualize an alert when potential risks occur within proximity of an organization\u2019s physical locations, suppliers, assets or people. The solution improves the ability to more quickly understand and assess the impact of threats, execute the correct response, and monitor on-going resolution in order to mitigate risk to personnel safety, business continuity, assets and supply chain operations.\n\u2022\nPublic Warning. Our Public Warning application is used to reach international mobile populations on a regional or country-wide scale. It leverages existing telecom infrastructure to anonymously reach mobile phone users within a geographic area with two-way SMS communications without requiring an existing database of mobile phone numbers. Multichannel alerting can also be accomplished via mobile push notifications, cell broadcast, voice, email, or messaging to electronic display boards or radio. The application has been selected to be part of the national warning system for 11 countries in Europe, Asia, Oceania, the Middle East, Africa, and the Americas, supporting five European Union (EU) countries in conjunction with the EU mandate requiring member countries to have a population-wide alerting system in place by June 2022. These Public Warning customers include Australia, Cambodia, Greece, the Netherlands, Peru, Sweden and a number of the largest states in India. In compliance with GDPR, our Public Warning solution neither collects nor stores personally identifiable information (PII) data.\n\u2022\nCommunity Engagement. Our Community Engagement application integrates emergency management and community outreach by providing local governments with a unified solution to connect residents to their public safety department, public information resources, and neighbors via social media and mobile applications. This creates a stronger and more engaged community improving the communication reach for emergency personnel, while providing residents with real-time emergency and community information, and allows residents to anonymously opt-in and provide tips.\n\u2022\nRisk Center. Our Risk Center solution aggregates data from over 25,000 data sources to assess more than 100 types of incidents and provide 24x7 incident information and analysis. A team of analysts, leveraging automation tools, verify risk incidents.\n\u2022\nCrisis Management. Our Crisis Management application provides mobile access to crisis, recovery and brand protection plans, as well as the capability to manage a crisis or event through role-based assignments and status updates. Organizations can enhance their overall crisis management efforts by making plans readily available to responders on the most popular mobile platforms regardless of their location. The application also simplifies updating plans for changes to personnel or processes, and enhances visibility into response progress during a critical event.\n\u2022\nSecure Collaboration. Our Secure Collaboration solution allows contacts to exchange messages, voice, images, and video chat through our mobile application while providing security for their communications. The application facilitates HIPAA-compliant communications and is designed to comply with FedRAMP, Sarbanes-Oxley, and other compliance requirements from mobile devices or web browsers.\n\u2022\nControl Center. Our Control Center physical security application is used for mission-critical control in enterprises and public safety. This solution correlates events from disparate safety and security systems into a common operating picture to provide real-time situation awareness. The application provides users with actionable alerts, next step actions, and automated reporting to better manage risks, ensure compliance with operating procedures and support business continuity. Automated workflows enable rapid risk management and consistent responses, reducing the risk of human error. It also facilitates device activation to help operational control to protect people and infrastructure. Dynamic reports and dashboards provide real-time actionable insights for operational and executive teams. The Control Center application is an open platform, integrating hundreds of security and operational technologies.\n\u2022\nCOVID-19 Shield. In the first quarter of 2020, we launched COVID-19 Shield, a new set of coronavirus protection solutions designed to protect the safety of employees and customers, maintain business operations, safeguard supply chains, and reduce costs and liabilities stemming from the impact of the global coronavirus pandemic. In the second quarter of 2020, we launched several additional software solutions, including (1) COVID-19 Return to Work, a software solution designed to help businesses and governments navigate the complexity of operating during the next phase of the COVID-19 pandemic and prepare to bring back the workforce and reopen society; (2) COVID-19 Shield: Contact Tracing, a solution for corporate, government and healthcare organizations to supplement or complement existing manual contact tracing efforts; and (3) Control Center, a physical security information management software platform, which includes features designed to help organizations return to work by integrating and managing data and analytics from video cameras, thermal cameras, badge access and other building\nsystems, and by automating the response to help organizations ensure the safety and protection of employees, as well as compliance with social distancing and personal protective equipment policies. In the fourth quarter of 2020, we announced COVID-19 Shield: Vaccine Distribution, an extension to our CEM platform offering risk insights, logistics awareness and vaccine appointment management. These new products were built off of our existing platforms.\nWe also have expanded our CEM platform through a series of recent acquisitions, including Techwan SA (\u201cTechwan\u201d), CNL Software Limited (\u201cCNL Software\u201d) and SnapComms Limited (\u201cSnapComms\u201d), to further augment its physical security, public safety and internal communications capabilities.\nWith industry-leading redundancy, scalability and uptime, the Everbridge platform reaches over 650 million people in more than 200 countries and territories.\nOur Technology\nThe design and development of our applications, and our critical communication and critical event management platforms include the following key attributes:\n\u2022\nRobust, Enterprise-Grade Scalability and Reliability. Given the mission-critical nature of our solutions, our multi-tenant platform was designed to provide a robust, high level of resiliency, scalability and redundancy. We use multiple geographically distributed service providers and communications carriers to achieve a high degree of redundancy, fault tolerance and cost-effective operations. We have multiple layers of redundancy and a horizontal scaling model across our infrastructure to deliver high availability and performance. Similarly, we leverage redundant downstream communications providers to enable our services to remain uninterrupted even if a particular provider encounters technical difficulties.\n\u2022\nMulti-Modal, Globally Local Communications Delivery. We optimize international call routing across hundreds of telecommunications providers to enable higher voice quality, improved delivery rates during emergencies and the ability to configure local caller IDs to improve recognition and answer rates. We also work with multiple SMS providers to identify regulatory hurdles and deploy and actively manage an optimal mix of national and international SMS codes to ensure high delivery and response rates.\n\u2022\nSecurity and Compliance. Our solutions received designation under the SAFETY Act, and certification by U.S. Department of Homeland Security that places us on the approved product list for homeland security. Our solutions are also accredited under FISMA. Our Everbridge Suite solution also achieved authorization under FedRAMP in 2018, that required satisfying a rigorous security and risk management review process and which we believe provides an advantage for selling into the U.S. federal sector. In 2019, our Critical Event Management platform received ISO 27001 certification and also received C5 accreditation under the Federal Office for Information Security in Germany.\n\u2022\nHybrid Infrastructure. To provide highly scalable and global solutions, we employ redundant, geographically diverse production implementations of our platform infrastructure in multiple SOC 2-compliant data center facilities in North America and Europe. Within each data center, we utilize a hybrid-cloud architecture that enables us to leverage both proprietary and third-party infrastructure services to enable \u201con-demand\u201d capacity and performance without substantial upfront investment. Our architecture enables our platform to dynamically determine the best location from which to deliver critical communications on behalf of our customers and solves many international communications delivery challenges by utilizing in-country or in-region telephony, messaging and data communication providers. Our infrastructure is continuously maintained and monitored by dedicated engineers based in redundant network operations centers in the Los Angeles and Boston areas.\n\u2022\nDynamic Location Detection. Our platform can create and update dynamic data sets containing a contact\u2019s last-known location, including the airport, street, building floor or conference room at which the contact was most recently present. Multiple data sources can be aggregated including building access control and badging systems, wired and wireless network access points, and corporate travel management and office hoteling systems. These data are used to best locate a contact in an emergency or critical business situation, independent of the contact\u2019s home or office location. Contacts can also share their location via a three-in-one mobile panic button application, which sends a panic message to the applicable organization\u2019s security team, and also includes the ability to send audio and video content, to check-in to capture and report geo-location data and to establish a safe corridor through a potentially unsafe area.\nOur Comprehensive Customer Support Services\nWe are committed to the success of our customers. We demonstrate this commitment by offering a comprehensive set of support services to help our customers get started quickly, follow best practices, and realize on-going value from our critical communications solution. Our support services include:\n\u2022\nRapid Onboarding. We leverage a proven methodology and domain expertise, honed through thousands of customer on-boardings worldwide, to enable rapid use of our platform and compliance with industry best practices. The average implementation time for standard implementations for new customers purchasing our solutions is 6.5 hours.\n\u2022\nEverbridge University. We offer online education, training and professional development through Everbridge University, with role-based training modules that can be customized to meet a customer\u2019s needs and that can facilitate formalized knowledge transfer and ensure ongoing self-sufficiency.\n\u2022\nDedicated Account Management. We assign dedicated account managers to all customers. Account managers perform regular service reviews and post-incident analyses of customer communications to incorporate communication best practices and recommend additional applications to meet the customer\u2019s critical communications needs.\n\u2022\n24/7 Technical Support & Emergency Live Operator Service. We have established geographically redundant technical support centers in the Los Angeles, California; Boston, Massachusetts; and London, United Kingdom areas. From these support centers, we offer our customers 24/7 support by phone, email or through our online support center. In addition, our support centers offer a 24/7 emergency live operator service to assist customers with sending critical communications.\n\u2022\nPremium Support Services. With an understanding of the critical role that our solution plays, we have assembled an expert professional services organization to deliver premium support service packages to our customers. Our professional services team includes certified emergency management and critical communications practitioners. We believe that we help customers achieve faster time-to-value by providing on-site project management, consultation with a certified critical communications professional, creation of client-specific message and scenarios, development of ad-hoc report templates and on-site emergency and incident management reviews.\nOur Customers\nOur customer base has grown from 867 customers at the end of 2011 to more than 5,600 customers as of December 31, 2020. We define a customer as a contracting entity from which we generated $200 or more of revenue in the prior month, either directly or through a channel partner. At the end of 2011 we had 20 customers with contracts valued at $100,000 or more, whereas as of December 31, 2020 we had 573 customers with contracts valued at $100,000 or more, including 49 customers with contracts in excess of $500,000. As of December 31, 2020, our customers were based in 70 countries and included eight of the 10 largest U.S. cities, nine of the 10 largest U.S.-based investment banks, 47 of the 50 busiest North American airports, nine of the 10 largest global consulting firms, eight of the 10 largest global automakers, nine of the 10 largest U.S.-based health care providers, and seven of the 10 largest technology companies in the world. We provide our applications to customers of varying sizes, including enterprises, small businesses, non-profit organizations, educational institutions and governmental agencies. Our customers span a wide variety of industries including technology, energy, financial services, healthcare and life sciences, manufacturing, media and entertainment, retail, higher education, and professional services. For the year ended December 31, 2020, 63% of our revenue was generated from enterprise customers, 26% from government and government-related customers and 11% from healthcare-related customers.\nSales and Marketing\nOur sales and marketing organizations collaborate to create brand preference, efficiently and effectively generate leads, build a strong sales pipeline and cultivate customer relationships to help drive revenue growth. Our marketing strategy consists of a strong thought-leadership program, digital marketing engine and a diversified sales organization designed to efficiently sell across vertical markets to organizations of all sizes. We have dedicated sales teams focused on corporate customers, healthcare organizations and government customers, which covers U.S. federal, state and local governmental entities.\nSales\nWe sell our solutions through our telephone and direct inside sales teams, a direct field sales team and a growing partner channel. Our global sales teams focus on both new customer acquisition and up-selling and cross-selling additional and new offerings, respectively, to our existing customers. Our sales teams are organized by geography, consisting of the Americas; Asia Pacific, Europe, the Middle East and Africa (collectively, \u201cEMEA\u201d); as well as by target organization size. Our inside sales team focuses typically on small and middle-market transactions, while larger or more complex transactions are generally handled by our direct field sales teams. Our highly trained sales engineers help define customer use cases, manage pilots and train channel partners.\nIn addition to the vertical and geographic distribution of our salesforce, we have dedicated teams of account executives focused on net new accounts and growth of existing accounts, account managers responsible for renewal of existing accounts, and business development representatives targeting new and growth business opportunity creation. Our sales representatives use phone, email and web meetings to interact with prospects and customers. In 2020, we increased the headcount of our sales organization, and we intend to continue to invest in building our global sales and go-to-market organizations.\nWe also sell through channel partners both domestically and internationally. To help integrate our applications with other third-party services and take advantage of current and emerging technologies, we seek to enter into alliances with leading technology companies.\nMarketing\nWe focus our marketing efforts on increasing the strength of the Everbridge brand, communicating product advantages and business benefits, generating leads for our salesforce and channel partners, leveraging geographic market strengths and driving product adoption. We run campaigns that take advantage of a network effect in which success within a region encourages other organizations within that area to choose our solutions, in part to be using a system consistent with that of other entities in the area with which they may share information or best practices. We deliver targeted content to demonstrate our thought leadership in critical communications best practices and use digital advertising methods to drive conversion of potential prospects, which convert to opportunities for our sales organization.\nOur marketing team focuses on inbound marketing through our industry-leading content, resources, and sharing customer best practices. We rely on multiple marketing and sales automation tools to efficiently market to, and automatically identify qualified individuals using product and industry specific criteria. We use multiple marketing tactics to engage with prospective customers including: email marketing, event marketing, print and digital advertising, and webinar events. We engage with existing customers to provide vertically-based education and awareness and to promote expanded use of our current and new software offerings within these customers. We also host regional and national events to engage both customers and prospects, deliver product training and foster community.\nResearch and Development\nWe invest substantial resources in research and development and leverage offshore development in multiple geographies to implement a \u201cfollow the sun\u201d engineering strategy and to increase the efficiency of our overall development efforts. We enhance our core technology platform and applications, develop new end market-specific solutions and applications, and conduct application and quality assurance testing. Our technical and engineering team monitors and tests our applications on a regular basis, and we maintain a regular release process to refine, update, and enhance our existing applications.\nOur Competition\nThe market for CEM solutions is highly fragmented, intensely competitive and constantly evolving. We compete with an array of established and emerging companies, many of whom are single product or single market focused, as well as in-house solutions. We view CEM as a holistic solution that allows organizations to digitally transform their critical event management processes. These processes are siloed in a variety of ways in different organizations. Similarly, solutions from competitors in the field often are siloed by smaller functions across the holistic CEM solution. CEM includes Mass Notification, Risk Control, Public Warning, IT Alerting and Incident Management, and Control Center systems. The primary competitors for our Mass Notification applications include BlackBerry Limited, AG, OnSolve, LLC, and Rave Wireless, Inc. The primary competitors for our Risk Control application include Anvil Group and WorldAware, Inc. The primary competitors for our Public Warning application include Celltick, Intersec and Genasys, Inc. For IT Alerting and Incident Management, our primary competitors are PagerDuty, Inc. and xMatters, Inc. For Control Center, our primary competitor is Genetec. Some competitors in siloed solutions are beginning to converge and build strategies that follow our CEM platform strategy. With the introduction of new technologies and market entrants, we expect the competitive environment to remain intense going forward.\nWe believe that we compete favorably with respect to all of these factors and that we are well positioned as a leading provider of targeted and contextually relevant critical communications.\nIntellectual Property\nOur future success and competitive position depend in part on our ability to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technologies. To safeguard these rights, we rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws and contractual protections in the United States and other jurisdictions.\nWe have numerous issued patents and patent applications pending. We cannot assure you that any patents will issue from any patent applications, that patents that issue from such applications will give us the protection that we seek or that any such patents will not be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented. Any patents that may issue in the future from our pending or future patent applications may not provide sufficiently broad protection and may not be enforceable in actions against alleged infringers.\nWe have registered the \u201cEverbridge\u201d, \u201cNixle\u201d and \u201cVisual Command Center\u201d names in the United States and have registered the \u201cEverbridge\u201d name in the European Union. We have registrations and/or pending applications for additional marks in the United States; however, we cannot assure you that any future trademark registrations will be issued for pending or future applications or that any registered trademarks will be enforceable or provide adequate protection of our proprietary rights.\nWe also license software from third parties for integration into our offerings, including open source software and other software available on commercially reasonable terms. We cannot assure you that such third parties will maintain such software or continue to make it available.\nWe are the registered holder of a variety of domestic and international domain names that include everbridge.com, as well as similar variations on that name.\nIn order to protect our unpatented proprietary technologies and processes, we rely on trade secret laws and confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, vendors and others. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary technology and trade secrets, unauthorized parties may attempt to misappropriate, reverse engineer or otherwise obtain and use them. In addition, others may independently discover our trade secrets, in which case we would not be able to assert trade secret rights, or develop similar technologies and processes. Further, the contractual provisions that we enter into may not prevent unauthorized use or disclosure of our proprietary technology or intellectual property rights and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of our proprietary technology or intellectual property rights.\nIf we become more successful, we believe that competitors will be more likely to try to develop solutions that are similar to ours and that may infringe our proprietary rights. It may also be more likely that competitors or other third parties will claim that our solutions infringe their proprietary rights.\nPatent and other intellectual property disputes are common in our industry and we have been involved in such disputes from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. Some companies, including some of our competitors, own large numbers of patents, copyrights and trademarks, which they may use to assert claims against us. Third parties may in the future assert claims of infringement, misappropriation or other violations of intellectual property rights against us. They may also assert such claims against our customers whom we typically indemnify against claims that our solution infringes, misappropriates or otherwise violates the intellectual property rights of third parties. As the numbers of products and competitors in our market increase and overlaps occur, claims of infringement, misappropriation and other violations of intellectual property rights may increase. Any claim of infringement, misappropriation or other violation of intellectual property rights by a third party, even those without merit, could cause us to incur substantial costs defending against the claim and could distract our management from our business.\nGovernment Regulation\nThe legal environment of Internet-based businesses is evolving rapidly in the United States and elsewhere. The manner in which existing laws and regulations are applied in this environment, and how they will relate to our business in particular, both in the United States and internationally, is often unclear. For example, we sometimes cannot be certain which laws will be deemed applicable to us given the global nature of our business, including with respect to such topics as data privacy and security, pricing, advertising, taxation, and intellectual property ownership and infringement.\nOur customers, and those with whom they interact using our product and platform solutions, upload and store personally identifiable information and other data into our solutions and provide access to such data, generally\nwithout any restrictions imposed by us. This presents legal challenges to our business and operations, such as rights of privacy related to the data used in connection with our solutions. Both in the United States and internationally, we must monitor and comply with a host of legal concerns regarding the data stored and processed in our solutions by customers. We must also monitor and comply with these issues directly in the operation of our business in these jurisdictions.\nWe are subject to data privacy and security regulation by data protection authorities in countries throughout the world, by the U.S. federal government, and by the states in which we conduct our business. In recent years, there have been a number of well-publicized data breaches involving the improper use and disclosure of personal information of individuals. Many governing authorities have responded to these incidents by enacting laws requiring holders of personal information to maintain safeguards and to take certain actions in response to a data breach, such as providing prompt notification of the breach to affected individuals and public officials, or amending existing laws to expand compliance obligations. In the European Union, U.S. companies must meet specified privacy and security standards, such as the European General Data Protection Regulation, or the GDPR, which governs the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data, and on the free movement of such data established in the European Union to certain non-European Union countries, such as the United States. Additionally, the data protection laws of each of the European member countries require comprehensive data privacy and security protections for consumers with respect to personal data collected about them. In February 2016, the European Union and U.S. officials announced an agreement, which established the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield, or the Privacy Shield, as a means for legitimating the transfer of personal data by U.S. companies doing business in Europe from the European Economic Area to the U.S. However, on July 16, 2020, the European Court of Justice invalidated the Privacy Shield. As a result, we are no longer using the Privacy Shield as a legal mechanism for the transfer of data between the EU and the U.S. However, the European Court of Justice upheld the validity of Standard Contractual Clauses, which we will continue to use as a legal mechanism for the transfer of data between the EU and the U.S. We have and will continue to engage in efforts to ensure that data transfers from the European Economic Area comply with the GDPR and the data protection legislation of individual member states.\nIn the United States, many federal, state, and foreign government bodies and agencies have adopted, or are considering adopting, laws and regulations regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information. California recently enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, that among other things, requires covered entities to provide new disclosures to California consumers, affords such consumers new abilities to opt-out of certain sales of personal information, and gives such consumers a private right of action to enforce data breaches resulting from the covered entity's violation of its duty to implement and maintain reasonable security measures.\nFor a discussion of risks related to these various areas of government regulation, see Risk Factors set forth in Part I,",
    "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nOur operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties including those described below. You should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below, in addition to other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes, as well as our other public filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we currently believe are not material, may also become important factors that adversely affect our business. If any of the following risks or others not specified below materialize, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline.\nSummary of Risk Factors\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk because our business is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, as fully described below. The principal factors and uncertainties that make investing in our common stock risky include, among others:\nRisks Related to Our Business and Our Industry\n\u2022\nIf our business does not grow as we expect, or if we fail to manage our growth effectively, our operating results and business prospects would suffer.\n\u2022\nWe have not been profitable on a consistent basis historically and may not achieve or maintain profitability in the future.\n\u2022\nIf we are unable to renew or increase sales of our Mass Notification application, or if we are unable to increase sales of our other applications or add new applications, our business and operating results could be adversely affected.\n\u2022\nWe operate in an emerging, evolving, and competitive market, and if we cannot expand our platform and applications to meet the demands of this market or effectively compete against competitors, our revenue may decline and we may incur operating losses.\n\u2022\nOur quarterly operating results may vary from period to period, which could result in our failure to meet expectations with respect to operating results and cause the trading price of our stock to decline.\n\u2022\nOur failure to effectively complete and integrate acquired technologies, assets or businesses may harm our financial results.\n\u2022\nBecause our long-term growth strategy involves further expansion of our sales to customers outside the United States, our business will be susceptible to risks associated with international operations.\nRisks Related to Cybersecurity, and Reliability\n\u2022\nCompromise or unauthorized access to our data or the data of our customers or their employees could harm our business and our customers, cause customers to curtail or cease their use of our applications, damage our reputation, and cause us to incur significant liabilities.\n\u2022\nInterruptions or delays in service from our third-party data center providers could impair our ability to make our platform and applications available to our customers, resulting in customer dissatisfaction, damage to our reputation, loss of customers, limited growth, and reduction in revenue.\nRisks Related to Data Privacy Government Regulation\n\u2022\nWe are subject to governmental laws and regulations, particularly related to privacy, data protection and information security, and our actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations could harm our business.\n\u2022\nCompliance with governmental laws and regulations could impair our efforts to maintain and expand our customer base, and thereby decrease our revenue.\n\u2022\nIf our applications fail to function in a manner that allows our customers to operate in compliance with regulations and/or industry standards, our revenue and operating results could be harmed.\n\u2022\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property.\n\u2022\nIf we fail to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights adequately, our business could be harmed.\n\u2022\nAn assertion by a third party that we are infringing its intellectual property could subject us to costly and time-consuming litigation or expensive licenses that could harm our business and results of operations.\n\u2022\nThe use of open source software in our platform and applications may expose us to additional risks and harm our intellectual property.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\n\u2022\nOur stock price may be volatile and you may lose some or all of your investment.\n\u2022\nWe may fail to meet our publicly announced guidance or other expectations about our business and future operating results, which would cause our stock price to decline.\n\u2022\nConversion of the $450 million aggregate principal amount of 0.125% convertible senior notes due December 15, 2024 (the \u201c2024 Notes\u201d) and $115 million aggregate principal amount of 1.50% convertible senior notes due November 1, 2022 (the \u201c2022 Notes\u201d) will dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders, including holders who had previously converted their Notes, or may otherwise depress the price of our common stock.\n\u2022\nWe are obligated to maintain a system of effective internal control over financial reporting and any failure to maintain the adequacy of these internal controls may harm investor confidence in our company and, as a result, the value of our common stock.\n\u2022\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of us more difficult, limit attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management and limit the market price of our common stock.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness\n\u2022\nWe issued convertible notes that have rights senior to our common stock.\n\u2022\nServicing our debt requires a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our substantial debt.\n\u2022\nThe conditional conversion feature of the 2024 Notes and 2022 Notes, may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nGeneral Risks\n\u2022\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\u2022\nLegislative actions and new accounting pronouncements are likely to impact our future financial position or results of operations.\n\u2022\nWe may have additional tax liabilities from sales taxes, inability to use net operating losses, or changes in regulations, any or all of which could change our effective tax rate or tax liability and have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\n\u2022\nWe face exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Our Industry\nIf our business does not grow as we expect, or if we fail to manage our growth effectively, our operating results and business prospects would suffer.\nThe number of our full-time employees were 1,344, 948 and 777 as of December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. In 2020, we made a significant investment in our sales organization, growing our headcount by 40%, and our revenue increased by $70.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 2019, due in part to the increase in our customer base.\nHowever, our business may not continue to grow as quickly or at all in the future, which would adversely affect our revenue and business prospects. Our business growth depends on a number of factors including:\n\u2022\nour ability to execute upon our business plan effectively;\n\u2022\nour ability to accelerate our acquisition of new customers;\n\u2022\nour ability to further sell to our existing customers new applications and features and to additional departments in their organizations;\n\u2022\nour ability to develop new applications to target new markets and use cases;\n\u2022\nour ability to expand our international footprint;\n\u2022\nthe growth of the market in which we operate;\n\u2022\nour ability to maintain our technology leadership position; and\n\u2022\nour ability to acquire and integrate complementary business, technologies and teams we need.\nFurther, our growth has placed, and will continue to place, a strain on our managerial, operational, financial and other resources, and our future operating results depend to a large extent on our ability to successfully manage our anticipated expansion and growth. To manage our growth successfully and handle the responsibilities of being a public company, we believe we must effectively, among other things:\n\u2022\nincrease our customer base and upsell and cross-sell additional and new applications to our existing customers;\n\u2022\ninvest in sales and marketing and expand our channel partner relationships;\n\u2022\ndevelop new applications that target new markets and use cases;\n\u2022\nexpand our international operations; and\n\u2022\nimprove our platform and applications, financial and operational systems, procedures and controls.\nWe intend to continue our investment in sales and marketing, platform and applications, research and development, and general and administrative functions and other areas to grow our business. We are likely to recognize the costs associated with these investments earlier than some of the anticipated benefits and the return on these investments may be lower, or may develop more slowly, than we expect, which could adversely affect our operating results.\nIf we are unable to manage our growth effectively in a manner that preserves the key aspects of our corporate culture, we may not be able to take advantage of market opportunities or develop new applications or upgrades to our existing applications and we may fail to satisfy customer requirements, maintain the quality and security of our applications, execute on our business plan or respond to competitive pressures, which could result in our financial results suffering and a decline in our stock price.\nWe have not been profitable on a consistent basis historically and may not achieve or maintain profitability in the future.\nWe have posted a net loss in each year since inception, including net losses of $93.4 million, $52.3 million and $47.5 million in the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of $293.3 million. While we have experienced significant revenue growth in recent periods, we are not certain whether or when we will obtain a high enough volume of sales of our applications to sustain or increase our growth or achieve or maintain profitability in the future. Our ability to achieve or maintain profitability also has been and will continue to be impacted by non-cash stock-based compensation. We also expect our costs to increase in future periods, which could negatively affect our future operating results if our revenue does not increase. In particular, we expect to continue to expend substantial financial and other resources on:\n\u2022\nsales and marketing, including a significant expansion of our sales organization, both domestically and internationally;\n\u2022\nresearch and development related to our platform and applications, including investments in our research and development team;\n\u2022\ncontinued international expansion of our business; and\n\u2022\ngeneral and administration expenses, including legal and accounting expenses related to being a public company.\nThese investments may not result in increased revenue or growth in our business. If we are unable to increase our revenue at a rate sufficient to offset the expected increase in our costs, our business, financial position and results of operations will be harmed, and we may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability over the long term. Additionally, we may encounter unforeseen operating expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other unknown factors that may result in losses in future periods. If our revenue growth does not meet our expectations in future periods, our financial performance may be harmed, and we may not achieve or maintain profitability in the future.\nTo date, we have derived a substantial portion of our revenue from the sale of our Mass Notification application. If we are unable to renew or increase sales of this application, or if we are unable to increase sales of our other applications, our business and operating results could be adversely affected.\nWhile we have introduced several new event management applications over the last few years, we derived approximately 50%, 61% and 62% of our revenue from sales of our Mass Notification application in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and expect to continue to derive a substantial portion of our revenue from sales of this application in the near term. As a result, our operating results could suffer due to:\n\u2022\nany decline in demand for our Mass Notification application;\n\u2022\npricing or other competitive pressures from competing products;\n\u2022\nthe introduction of applications and technologies that serve as a replacement or substitute for, or represent an improvement over, our Mass Notification application;\n\u2022\ntechnological innovations or new standards that our Mass Notification application do not address; and\n\u2022\nsensitivity to current or future prices offered by us or competing solutions.\nBecause of our reliance on our Mass Notification application, our inability to renew or increase sales of this application or a decline in prices of this application would harm our business and operating results more seriously than if we derived significant revenue from a variety of applications. Any factor adversely affecting sales of our historical or new applications, including release cycles, market acceptance, competition, performance and reliability, reputation and economic and market conditions, could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nIf we are unable to develop upgrades to our platform, develop new applications, sell our platform and applications into new markets or further penetrate our existing market, our revenue may not grow.\nOur ability to increase sales will depend in large part on our ability to enhance and improve our platform and applications, introduce new applications in a timely manner, develop new use cases for our platform and further penetrate our existing market. The success of any enhancement to our platform or new applications depends on several factors, including the timely completion, introduction and market acceptance of enhanced or new applications, the ability to maintain and develop relationships with channel partners and communications carriers, the ability to attract, retain and effectively train sales and marketing personnel and the effectiveness of our marketing programs. Any new application that we develop or acquire may not be introduced in a timely or cost-effective manner, and may not achieve the broad market acceptance necessary to generate significant revenue. Any new markets into which we attempt to sell our applications, including new vertical markets and new countries or regions, may not be receptive. Our ability to further penetrate our existing markets depends on the quality of our platform and applications and our ability to design our platform and applications to meet consumer demand. Any failure to enhance or improve our platform and applications as well as introduce new applications may adversely affect our revenue growth and operating results.\nIf we are unable to attract new customers or sell additional applications to our existing customers, our revenue and revenue growth will be harmed.\nA part of our growth strategy is to add new customers and sell additional applications to our existing customers. Our ability to maintain existing customers, sell them new applications and to add new customers will depend in significant part on our ability to anticipate industry evolution, practices and standards and to continue to introduce and enhance the applications we offer on a timely basis to keep pace with technological developments. However, we may prove unsuccessful in developing new applications and improving existing applications. In addition, the success of any new application depends on several factors, including the timely completion, introduction and market acceptance of the application. Any new applications we develop or acquire might not be introduced in a timely or cost-effective manner and might not achieve the broad market acceptance necessary to generate significant revenue. If any of our competitors implements new technologies before we are able to implement them or better anticipates market opportunities, those competitors may be able to provide more effective or cheaper products than ours. As a result, we may be unable to renew our agreements with existing customers, attract new customers or grow or maintain our business from existing customers, which could harm our revenue and growth.\nFailure to effectively develop and expand our sales and marketing capabilities could harm our ability to increase our customer base and achieve broader market acceptance of our platform and applications.\nTo increase total customers and achieve broader market acceptance of our platform and applications, we will need to expand our sales and marketing organization, including the vertical and geographic distribution of our salesforce and our teams of account executives focused on new accounts, account managers responsible for renewal and growth of existing accounts, and business development representatives targeting new and growth business opportunity creation. We will continue to dedicate significant resources to our global sales and marketing organizations. The effectiveness of our sales and marketing teams has varied over time and may vary in the future, and depends in part on our ability to maintain and improve our platform and applications. All of these efforts will require us to invest significant financial and other resources and we are unlikely to see the benefits, if any, of these increases until future periods after incurring these expenses. Our business will be seriously harmed if our efforts do not generate a correspondingly significant increase in revenue. We may not achieve revenue growth from expanding our salesforce if we are unable to hire, develop and retain talented sales personnel, if our new sales personnel are unable to achieve desired productivity levels in a reasonable period of time or if our sales and marketing programs are not effective.\nThe nature of our business exposes us to inherent liability risks.\nOur applications, including our Mass Notification, Safety Connection, Incident Management, IT Alerting, Visual Command Center, Public Warning, Community Engagement, Risk Center, Crisis Management, Secure Collaboration, and Control Center applications, are designed to communicate life-saving or damage-mitigating information to the right people, on the right device, in the right location, at the right time during public safety threats and critical business events. Due to the nature of such applications, we are potentially exposed to greater risks of liability for employee acts or omissions or system failures than may be inherent in other businesses. Although substantially all of our customer agreements contain provisions limiting our liability to our customers, we cannot assure you that these limitations will be enforced or the costs of any litigation related to actual or alleged omissions or failures would have a material adverse effect on us even if we prevail. Further, certain of our insurance policies and the laws of some states may limit or prohibit insurance coverage for punitive or certain other types of damages or liability arising from gross negligence and we cannot assure you that we are adequately insured against the risks that we face.\nBecause we generally recognize revenue ratably over the term of our contract with a customer, downturns or upturns in sales will not be fully reflected in our operating results until future periods.\nOur revenue is primarily generated from subscriptions to our critical event management applications. Our customers generally do not have the right to take possession of our software platform and applications. Revenue from subscriptions, including additional fees for items such as incremental usage, is recognized ratably over the subscription period beginning on the date that the subscription is made available to the customer. Our agreements with our customers typically range from one to three years. As a result, much of the revenue that we report in each quarter is attributable to agreements entered into during previous quarters. Consequently, a decline in sales, customer renewals or market acceptance of our applications in any one quarter would not necessarily be fully reflected in the revenue in that quarter, and would negatively affect our revenue and profitability in future quarters. This ratable revenue recognition also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue through additional sales in any period, as revenue from new customers generally is recognized over the applicable agreement term.\nWe operate in an emerging and evolving market, which may develop more slowly or differently than we expect. If our market does not grow as we expect, or if we cannot expand our platform and applications to meet the demands of this market, our revenue may decline, fail to grow or fail to grow at an accelerated rate, and we may incur operating losses.\nThe market for CEM solutions is in an early stage of development, and it is uncertain whether this market will develop, and even if it does develop, how rapidly or how consistently it will develop or whether our platform and applications will be accepted into the markets in which we operate and plan to operate. Our success will depend, to a substantial extent, on the widespread adoption of our platform and applications as an alternative to historical mass notification systems. Some organizations may be reluctant or unwilling to use our platform and applications for a number of reasons, including concerns about additional costs, uncertainty regarding the reliability and security of cloud-based offerings or lack of awareness of the benefits of our platform and applications. Many organizations have invested substantial personnel and financial resources to integrate traditional on-premises applications into their businesses, and therefore may be reluctant or unwilling to migrate to cloud-based applications. Our ability to expand sales of our platform and applications into new markets depends on several factors, including the awareness of our platform and applications; the timely completion, introduction and market acceptance of enhancements to our platform and applications or new applications that we may introduce; our ability to attract, retain and effectively train sales and marketing personnel; our ability to develop relationships with channel partners and communication carriers; the effectiveness of our marketing programs; the costs of our platform and applications; and the success of our competitors. If we are unsuccessful in developing and marketing our platform and applications into new markets, or if organizations do not perceive or value the benefits of our platform and applications, the market for our platform and applications might not continue to develop or might develop more slowly than we expect, either of which would harm our revenue and growth prospects.\nThe markets in which we participate are competitive, and if we do not compete effectively, our operating results could be harmed.\nThe market for critical event management solutions is highly fragmented, competitive and constantly evolving. With the introduction of new technologies and market entrants, we expect that the competitive environment in which we compete will remain intense going forward. Some of our competitors have made or may make acquisitions or may enter into partnerships or other strategic relationships to provide a more comprehensive offering than they individually had offered or achieve greater economies of scale. In addition, new entrants not currently considered to be competitors may enter the market through acquisitions, partnerships or strategic relationships. We compete on the basis of a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\napplication functionality, including local and multi-modal delivery in international markets;\n\u2022\nbreadth of offerings;\n\u2022\nperformance, security, scalability and reliability;\n\u2022\ncompliance with local regulations and multi-language support;\n\u2022\nbrand recognition, reputation and customer satisfaction;\n\u2022\nease of application implementation, use and maintenance; and\n\u2022\ntotal cost of ownership.\nWe face competition from in-house solutions, large integrated systems vendors and established and emerging cloud and SaaS and other software providers. Our competitors vary in size and in the breadth and scope of the products and services offered. Many of our competitors and potential competitors have greater name recognition, longer operating histories, more established customer relationships, larger marketing budgets and greater resources than we do. While some of our competitors provide a platform with applications to support one or more use cases, many others provide point-solutions that address a single use case. Further, other potential competitors not currently offering competitive applications may expand their offerings to compete with our solutions. Our competitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards and customer requirements. An existing competitor or new entrant could introduce new technology that reduces demand for our solutions. In addition to application and technology competition, we face pricing competition. Some of our competitors offer their applications or services at a lower price, which has resulted in pricing pressures. Some of our larger competitors have the operating flexibility to bundle competing applications and services with other offerings, including offering them at a lower price as part of a larger sale. For all of these reasons, we may not be able to compete successfully and competition could result in reduced sales, reduced margins, losses or the failure of our applications to achieve or maintain market acceptance, any of which could harm our business.\nWe may not be able to scale our business quickly enough to meet our customers\u2019 growing needs and if we are not able to grow efficiently, our operating results could be harmed.\nAs usage of our platform and applications grows, we will need to continue making significant investments to develop and implement new applications, technologies, security features and cloud-based infrastructure operations. In addition, we will need to appropriately scale our internal business systems and our services organization, including customer support and professional services, to serve our growing customer base, particularly as our customer demographics change over time. Any failure of, or delay in, these efforts could impair the performance of our platform and applications and reduce customer satisfaction. Even if we are able to upgrade our systems and expand our staff, any such expansion may be expensive and complex, requiring management\u2019s time and attention. To the extent that we do not effectively scale our platform and operations to meet the growing needs of our customers, we may not be able to grow as quickly as we anticipate, our customers may reduce or cancel use of our applications and professional services, we may be unable to compete effectively and our business and operating results may be harmed.\nOur quarterly operating results may vary from period to period, which could result in our failure to meet expectations with respect to operating results and cause the trading price of our stock to decline.\nOur operating results, including the levels of our revenue, renewal rates, cash flows, deferred revenue and gross margins, have historically varied from period to period, and we expect that these items will continue to do so as a result of a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control, including:\n\u2022\nthe level of demand for our products and services;\n\u2022\ncustomer renewal rates and ability to attract new customers;\n\u2022\nthe extent to which customers purchase additional products or services;\n\u2022\nthe mix of our products and services sold during a period;\n\u2022\nnetwork outages, security breaches, technical difficulties or interruptions with our products;\n\u2022\nchanges in the growth rate of the markets in which we compete;\n\u2022\nsales of our products and services due to seasonality and customer demand;\n\u2022\nthe timing and success of new product or service introductions by us or our competitors or any other changes in the competitive landscape of its industry, including consolidation among our competitors;\n\u2022\nthe introduction or adoption of new technologies that compete with our offerings;\n\u2022\ndecisions by potential customers to purchase critical event management products or services from other vendors;\n\u2022\nthe amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures related to the operations and expansion of our business;\n\u2022\nprice competition;\n\u2022\nour ability to successfully manage and integrate our previous acquisitions and any future acquisitions of businesses, including the recent acquisitions of Connexient, Inc. (\u201cConnexient\u201d), CNL Software, One2Many Group B.V. (\u201cone2many\u201d), Techwan, SnapComms and Red Sky Technologies Inc. (\u201cRed Sky\u201d) and including without limitation the amount and timing of expenses and potential future charges for impairment of goodwill from acquired companies;\n\u2022\nour ability to establish and grow relationships with partners to market and sell our products and services;\n\u2022\nour continued international expansion and associated exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, including any fluctuations caused by uncertainties relating to the United Kingdom\u2019s exit from the European Union, commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit\u201d;\n\u2022\nthe amount and timing of operating expenses related to the maintenance and expansion of our business, operations and infrastructure;\n\u2022\nthe announcement or adoption of new regulations and policy mandates or changes to existing regulations and policy mandates;\n\u2022\nthe cost or results of existing or unforeseen litigation and intellectual property infringement;\n\u2022\nthe strength of regional, national and global economies;\n\u2022\nquarantine, private travel limitation, or business disruption in regions affecting our operations, stemming from actual, imminent or perceived outbreak of contagious disease, including the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022\nthe impact of natural disasters or manmade problems such as terrorism or war; and\n\u2022\nfuture accounting pronouncements or changes in our accounting policies.\nFluctuations in our quarterly operating results, key metrics, non-GAAP metrics and the price of our common stock may be particularly pronounced in the current economic environment due to the uncertainty caused by and the\nunprecedented nature of the current COVID-19 pandemic. Each factor above or discussed elsewhere herein or the cumulative effect of some of these factors may result in fluctuations in our operating results. This variability and unpredictability could result in our failure to meet expectations with respect to operating results, or those of securities analysts or investors, for a particular period. If we fail to meet or exceed expectations for our operating results for these or any other reasons, the market price of our stock could fall and we could face costly lawsuits, including securities class action suits.\nDue to the foregoing factors and the other risks discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, you should not rely on quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our results of operations as an indication of our future performance nor should you consider our recent revenue growth or results in any single period to be indicative of our future performance.\nChanges in the mix of sizes or types of businesses or government agencies that purchase our platform and applications purchased or used by our customers could affect our operating results.\nWe have sold and will continue to sell to enterprises of all sizes, municipal and regional governmental agencies, non-profit organizations, educational institutions and healthcare organizations. Sales to larger organizations may entail longer sales cycles and more significant selling efforts. Selling to small businesses may involve greater credit risk and uncertainty. Changes in the sizes or types of businesses that purchase our applications could cause our operating results to be adversely affected.\nIf we fail to offer high-quality customer support, our business and reputation may suffer.\nWe offer our customers implementation services and 24/7 support through our customer support centers as well as education, professional development and certification through Everbridge University as well as a range of consulting services. Consulting service offerings include onsite implementation packages, Certified Emergency Management professional operational reviews, dedicated client care representatives, custom web-based training, and development of client-specific communications materials to increase internal awareness of system value.\nProviding this education, training and support requires that our personnel who manage our training resources or provide customer support have specific experience, knowledge and expertise, making it more difficult for us to hire qualified personnel and to scale up our support operations. The importance of high-quality customer support will increase as we expand our business and pursue new customers and larger organizations. We may be unable to respond quickly enough to accommodate short-term increases in customer demand for support services or scale our services if our business grows. We also may be unable to modify the format of our support services or change our pricing to compete with changes in support services provided by our competitors. Increased customer demand for these services, without corresponding revenue, could increase our costs and harm our operating results. If we do not help our customers use applications within our platform and provide effective ongoing support, our ability to sell additional applications to, or to retain, existing customers may suffer and our reputation with existing or potential customers may be harmed.\nOur strategy includes pursuing acquisitions, and our potential inability to successfully integrate newly-acquired technologies, assets or businesses may harm our financial results. Future acquisitions of technologies, assets or businesses, which are paid for partially or entirely through the issuance of stock or stock rights, could dilute the ownership of our existing stockholders.\nWe may evaluate and consider potential strategic transactions, including acquisitions of, or investments in, businesses, technologies, services, products and other assets in the future. We also may enter into relationships with other businesses to expand our platform and applications, which could involve preferred or exclusive licenses, additional channels of distribution, discount pricing or investments in other companies.\nWe have acquired businesses and technology in the past. For example, we acquired Connexient and CNL Software Limited in February 2020, one2many in March 2020, Techwan in May 2020, SnapComms in August 2020 and Red Sky in January 2021. We believe that part of our continued growth will be driven by acquisitions of other companies or their technologies, assets, businesses and teams. Any acquisitions we complete will give rise to risks, including:\n\u2022\nincurring higher than anticipated capital expenditures and operating expenses;\n\u2022\nfailing to assimilate the operations and personnel or failing to retain the key personnel of the acquired company or business;\n\u2022\nfailing to integrate the acquired technologies, or incurring significant expense to integrate acquired technologies, into our platform and applications;\n\u2022\ndisrupting our ongoing business;\n\u2022\ndiverting our management\u2019s attention and other company resources;\n\u2022\nfailing to maintain uniform standards, controls and policies;\n\u2022\nincurring significant accounting charges;\n\u2022\nimpairing relationships with our customers and employees;\n\u2022\nfinding that the acquired technology, asset or business does not further our business strategy, that we overpaid for the technology, asset or business or that we may be required to write off acquired assets or investments partially or entirely;\n\u2022\nfailing to realize the expected synergies of the transaction;\n\u2022\nbeing exposed to unforeseen liabilities and contingencies that were not identified prior to acquiring the company; and\n\u2022\nbeing unable to generate sufficient revenue and profits from acquisitions to offset the associated acquisition costs.\nFully integrating an acquired technology, asset or business into our operations may take a significant amount of time. We may not be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered with acquisitions. To the extent that we do not successfully avoid or overcome the risks or problems related to any such acquisitions, our results of operations and financial condition could be harmed. Acquisitions also could impact our financial position and capital requirements, or could cause fluctuations in our quarterly and annual results of operations. Acquisitions could include significant goodwill and intangible assets, which may result in future impairment charges that would reduce our stated earnings. In addition, failure to maintain effective financial controls and reporting systems and procedures during and after integration of an acquired business could also impact our ability to produce timely and accurate financial statements. We may incur significant costs in our efforts to engage in strategic transactions and these expenditures may not result in successful acquisitions.\nWe expect that the consideration we might pay for any future acquisitions of technologies, assets, businesses or teams could include stock, rights to purchase stock, cash or some combination of the foregoing. If we issue stock or rights to purchase stock in connection with future acquisitions, net income per share and then-existing holders of our common stock may experience dilution.\nWe rely on the performance of our senior management and highly skilled personnel, and if we are unable to attract, retain and motivate well-qualified employees, our business and results of operations could be harmed.\nWe believe our success has depended, and continues to depend, on the efforts and talents of our senior management and key personnel. Our future success depends on our continuing ability to attract, develop, motivate and retain highly qualified and skilled employees. Qualified individuals are in high demand, and we may incur significant costs to attract them. In addition, the loss of any of our senior management or key personnel could interrupt our ability to execute our business plan, as such individuals may be difficult to replace. If we do not succeed in attracting well-qualified employees or retaining and motivating existing employees, our business and results of operations could be harmed.\nIf we are unable to increase sales of our solutions to large organizations while mitigating the risks associated with serving such customers, our business, financial position and results of operations may suffer.\nOur growth strategy is dependent, in part, upon increasing sales of our solutions to large enterprises and governments. Sales to large customers involve risks that may not be present (or that are present to a lesser extent) with sales to smaller entities. These risks include:\n\u2022\nincreased purchasing power and leverage held by large customers in negotiating contractual arrangements with us;\n\u2022\nmore stringent and complicated implementation processes, including stricter implementation deadlines and penalties for any failure to meet such deadlines;\n\u2022\nmore stringent or costly requirements imposed upon us in our support service contracts with such customers, including stricter support response times and penalties for any failure to meet support requirements;\n\u2022\nlonger sales cycles and the associated risk that substantial time and resources may be spent on a potential customer that ultimately elects not to purchase our platform or purchases less than we hoped;\n\u2022\ncloser relationships with, and dependence upon, large technology companies who offer competitive products; and\n\u2022\nmore pressure for discounts and write-offs.\nIn addition, because security breaches with respect to larger, high-profile enterprises are likely to be heavily publicized, there is increased reputational risk associated with serving such customers. If we are unable to increase sales of our offerings to large enterprise and government customers while mitigating the risks associated with serving such customers, our business, financial position and results of operations may suffer.\nOur revenue growth will depend in part on the success of our efforts to augment our direct-sales channels by developing relationships with third parties.\nWe rely largely on the direct-sales model to market our platform. In order to continue to build our business, we plan to continue to develop partnerships to support our sales efforts through referrals and co-selling arrangements. Our efforts to develop relationships with partners are still at an early stage, we have generated limited revenue through these relationships to date, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to develop and maintain successful partnerships or that these partners will be successful in marketing and selling our platform or solutions based upon our platform. Identifying partners, negotiating and supporting relationships with them and maintaining relationships requires a significant commitment of time and resources that may not yield a significant return on our investment. We expect that our partners will have only limited commitments to dedicate resources to marketing and promoting our solutions. In addition, our competitors may be more effective in providing incentives to our partners or prospective partners to favor their products or services over our solutions. If we are unsuccessful in establishing or maintaining our relationships with partners, or if these partners are unsuccessful in marketing or selling our solutions or are unable or unwilling to devote sufficient resources to these activities, our ability to compete in the marketplace or to grow our revenue could be impaired and our operating results may suffer. Further, new or emerging technologies, technological trends or changes in customer requirements may result in certain third parties de-emphasizing their dealings with us or becoming potential competitors in the future.\nBecause our long-term growth strategy involves further expansion of our sales to customers outside the United States, our business will be susceptible to risks associated with international operations.\nA component of our growth strategy involves the further expansion of our operations and customer base internationally. We opened our first international office in Beijing, China in April 2012 and subsequently opened an office in Windsor, England in September 2012 as part of our geographic expansion. In March 2014, we acquired Vocal Limited, a mass notification company based in Colchester, England. In December 2016, we acquired Svensk Krisledning AB, a SaaS mobile crisis management company based in Norsborg, Sweden. In April 2018, we acquired Unified Messaging Systems ASA, a critical communication and population alerting systems company based in Oslo, Norway. In May 2018, we acquired Respond B.V., a critical communication solutions company based in the\nNetherlands. In February 2020, we acquired CNL Software Limited, a global provider of physical security information management platform software based in Camberley, United Kingdom. In March 2020, we acquired One2Many Group B.V. based in the Netherlands. In May 2020, we acquired Techwan SA based in Switzerland. In August 2020, we acquired SnapComms Limited based in New Zealand. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, approximately 26% and 22% of our revenue, respectively, was derived from customers located outside of the United States. We intend to further expand our local presence in regions such as Europe, the Middle East and Asia. Our current international operations and future initiatives will involve a variety of risks, including:\n\u2022\ncurrency exchange rate fluctuations and the resulting effect on our revenue and expenses, and the cost and risk of entering into hedging transactions if we chose to do so in the future;\n\u2022\neconomic or political instability in foreign markets;\n\u2022\ngreater difficulty in enforcing contracts, accounts receivable collection and longer collection periods;\n\u2022\nmore stringent regulations relating to technology, including with respect to privacy, data security and the unauthorized use of, access to, or deletion of commercial and personal information, particularly in the European Union;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in maintaining our company culture with a dispersed and distant workforce;\n\u2022\nunexpected changes in regulatory requirements, taxes or trade laws;\n\u2022\ndiffering labor regulations, especially in the European Union, where labor laws are generally more advantageous to employees as compared to the United States, including deemed hourly wage and overtime regulations in these locations;\n\u2022\nchallenges inherent in efficiently managing an increased number of employees over large geographic distances, including the need to implement appropriate systems, policies, benefits and compliance programs;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in managing a business in new markets with diverse cultures, languages, customs, legal systems, alternative dispute systems and regulatory systems;\n\u2022\nlimitations on our ability to reinvest earnings from operations in one country to fund the capital needs of our operations in other countries;\n\u2022\nlimited or insufficient intellectual property protection;\n\u2022\npolitical instability or terrorist activities;\n\u2022\ndiffering exposure to, responses to and capacities for managing the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022\nlikelihood of potential or actual violations of domestic and international anticorruption laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act, or of U.S. and international export control and sanctions regulations, which likelihood may increase with an increase of sales or operations in foreign jurisdictions and operations in certain industries; and\n\u2022\nadverse tax burdens and foreign exchange controls that could make it difficult to repatriate earnings and cash.\nOur limited experience in operating our business internationally increases the risk that any potential future expansion efforts that we may undertake will not be successful. If we invest substantial time and resources to expand our international operations and are unable to do so successfully and in a timely manner, our business and operating results will suffer. We continue to implement policies and procedures to facilitate our compliance with U.S. laws and regulations applicable to or arising from our international business. Inadequacies in our past or current compliance practices may increase the risk of inadvertent violations of such laws and regulations, which could lead to financial and other penalties that could damage our reputation and impose costs on us.\nOur business, including the sales of our products and professional services by us and our channel partners, may be subject to foreign governmental regulations, which vary substantially from country to country and change from time to time. Our failure, or the failure by our channel partners, to comply with these regulations could adversely affect\nour business. Further, in many foreign countries it is common for others to engage in business practices that are prohibited by our internal policies and procedures or U.S. regulations applicable to us. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to comply with these laws and policies, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, channel partners and agents have complied, or will comply, with these laws and policies. Violations of laws or key control policies by our employees, contractors, channel partners or agents could result in delays in revenue recognition, financial reporting misstatements, fines, penalties or the prohibition of the importation or exportation of our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. If we are unable to successfully manage the challenges of international expansion and operations, our business and operating results could be adversely affected.\nWe are also monitoring developments related to the United Kingdom\u2019s departure from the European Union on January 31, 2020, commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit.\u201d Brexit could have significant implications for our business and could lead to economic and legal uncertainty, including significant volatility in global stock markets and currency exchange rates, and differing laws and regulations as the United Kingdom determines which European Union laws to replace or replicate. Any of these effects of Brexit, among others, could adversely affect our operations in the United Kingdom and our financial results.\nIf we cannot maintain our company culture as we grow, our success and our business may be harmed.\nWe believe our culture has been a key contributor to our success to-date and that the critical nature of the solutions that we provide promotes a sense of greater purpose and fulfillment in our employees. We have invested in building a strong corporate culture and believe it is one of our most important and sustainable sources of competitive advantage. Any failure to preserve our culture could negatively affect our ability to retain and recruit personnel and to effectively focus on and pursue our corporate objectives. As we grow and develop the infrastructure of a public company, we may find it difficult to maintain these important aspects of our company culture. If we fail to maintain our company culture, our business may be adversely impacted.\nOur ability to raise capital in the future may be limited, and our failure to raise capital when needed could prevent us from growing.\nOur business and operations may consume resources faster than we anticipate. In the future, we may need to raise additional funds to invest in future growth opportunities. Additional financing may not be available on favorable terms, if at all. If adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms, we may be unable to invest in future growth opportunities, which could seriously harm our business and operating results. If we incur debt, the debt holders would have rights senior to common stockholders to make claims on our assets, and the terms of any debt could restrict our operations, including our ability to pay dividends on our common stock. Furthermore, if we issue equity securities, stockholders will experience dilution, and the new equity securities could have rights senior to those of our common stock. Because our decision to issue securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of our future offerings. As a result, our stockholders bear the risk of our future securities offerings reducing the market price of our common stock and diluting their interest.\nOur sales cycle can be unpredictable, time-consuming and costly, which could harm our business and operating results.\nOur sales process involves educating prospective customers and existing customers about the use, technical capabilities and benefits of our platform and applications. Prospective customers, especially larger organizations, often undertake a prolonged evaluation process, which typically involves not only our solutions, but also those of our competitors and lasts from four to nine months or longer. We may spend substantial time, effort and money on our sales and marketing efforts without any assurance that our efforts will produce any sales.\nEvents affecting our customers\u2019 businesses may occur during the sales cycle that could affect the size or timing of a purchase, contributing to more unpredictability in our business and operating results. As a result of these factors, we may face greater costs, longer sales cycles and less predictability in the future.\nRisks Related to Cybersecurity, and Reliability\nIf our, our customers\u2019 or our third-party providers\u2019 security measures are compromised or unauthorized access to the data of our customers or their employees, customers or constituents is otherwise obtained, our platform may be perceived as not being secure, our customers may be harmed and may curtail or cease their use of our applications, our reputation may be damaged and we may incur significant liabilities.\nOur operations involve the storage and transmission of data of our customers and their employees, customers and constituents, including personally identifiable information such as contact information and physical location. Security incidents, whether as a result of third-party action, employee or customer error, technology impairment or failure, malfeasance or criminal activity, could result in unauthorized access to, or loss or unauthorized disclosure of, this information, litigation, indemnity obligations and other possible liabilities, as well as negative publicity, which could damage our reputation, impair our sales and harm our customers and our business. Cyber incidents and malicious internet-based activity continue to increase generally, and providers of cloud-based services have been targeted. If third parties with whom we work, such as vendors or developers, violate applicable laws or our security policies, such violations may also put our customers\u2019 information at risk and could in turn have an adverse effect on our business. We may be unable to anticipate or prevent techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems because they change frequently and often are not detected until after an incident has occurred. As we increase our customer base and our brand becomes more widely known and recognized, third parties may increasingly seek to compromise our security controls or gain unauthorized access to our sensitive corporate information or customers\u2019 data. Further, because of the nature of the services that we provide to our customers during public safety threats and critical business events, we may be a unique target for attacks.\nMany governments have enacted laws requiring companies to notify individuals of data security incidents or unauthorized transfers involving certain types of personal data. In addition, some of our customers contractually require notification of any data security incident. Accordingly, security incidents experienced by our competitors, by our customers or by us may lead to public disclosures, which may lead to widespread negative publicity. Any security compromise in our industry, whether actual or perceived, could harm our reputation, erode customer confidence in the effectiveness of our security measures, negatively impact our ability to attract new customers, cause existing customers to elect not to renew their subscriptions or subject us to third-party lawsuits, regulatory fines or other action or liability, which could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results. Further, the costs of compliance with notification laws and contractual obligations may be significant and any requirement that we provide such notifications as a result of an actual or alleged compromise could have a material and adverse effect on our business.\nWhile we maintain general liability insurance coverage and coverage for errors or omissions, we cannot assure you that such coverage would be adequate or would otherwise protect us from liabilities or damages with respect to claims alleging compromises of personal data or that such coverage will continue to be available on acceptable terms or at all.\nIf our computer systems are or become vulnerable to security breaches or we are unable to comply with our security obligations, we may face reputational damage and lose clients and revenue.\nThe services we provide are often critical to our clients\u2019 businesses. Certain of our client contracts may require us to comply with security obligations, which could include maintaining network security and backup data, ensuring our network is virus-free, maintaining business continuity planning procedures, and verifying the integrity of employees that work with our clients by conducting background checks. Any failure in our systems or breach of security relating to the services we provide to the client could damage our reputation or result in a claim for substantial damages against us. Our liability for breaches of data security requirements, for which we may be required to indemnify our clients, may be extensive. Any significant failure of our equipment or systems, or any major disruption to basic infrastructure like power and telecommunications in the locations in which we operate, could impede our ability to provide services to our clients, have a negative impact on our reputation, cause us to lose clients, and adversely affect our results of operations.\nIn addition, we often have access to or are required to collect and store confidential client and customer data. If any person, including any of our employees or former employees, penetrates our network security, accidentally exposes our data or code, or misappropriates data or code that belongs to us, our clients, or our clients\u2019 customers, we could be subject to significant liability from our clients or from our clients\u2019 customers for breaching contractual confidentiality provisions or privacy laws. Unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential client and customer\ndata, whether through breach of our computer systems, systems failure, loss or theft of confidential information or intellectual property belonging to our clients or our clients\u2019 customers, or otherwise, could damage our reputation, cause us to lose clients and revenues, and result in financial and other potential losses by us.\nInterruptions or delays in service from our third-party data center providers could impair our ability to make our platform and applications available to our customers, resulting in customer dissatisfaction, damage to our reputation, loss of customers, limited growth and reduction in revenue.\nWe currently serve part of our platform functions from third-party data center hosting facilities operated by Century Link and located in the Los Angeles, California and Denver, Colorado areas. We also rely on Amazon Web Services servers located in Germany, Ireland, the United Kingdom, Canada, California, and Virginia to host certain of our platform functions and applications. Our operations depend, in part, on our third-party facility providers\u2019 abilities to protect these facilities against damage or interruption from natural disasters, power or telecommunications failures, cyber incidents, criminal acts and similar events. In the event that any of our third-party facilities arrangements are terminated, or if there is a lapse of service or damage to a facility, we could experience interruptions in our platform as well as delays and additional expenses in arranging new facilities and services. Any changes in third-party service levels at our data centers or any errors, defects, disruptions, cyber incidents or other performance problems with our solutions could harm our reputation.\nAny damage to, or failure of, the systems of our third-party providers could result in interruptions to our platform. Despite precautions taken at our data centers, the occurrence of spikes in usage volume, natural disasters, cyber incidents, acts of terrorism, vandalism or sabotage, closure of a facility without adequate notice or other unanticipated problems could result in lengthy interruptions in the availability of our platform and applications. Problems faced by our third-party data center locations, with the telecommunications network providers with whom they contract, or with the systems by which our telecommunications providers allocate capacity among their customers, including us, could adversely affect the experience of our customers. Because of the nature of the services that we provide to our customers during public safety threats and critical business events, any such interruption may arise when our customers are most reliant on our applications, thereby compounding the impact of any interruption on our business. Interruptions in our services might reduce our revenue, cause us to issue refunds to customers and subject us to potential liability.\nFurther, our insurance policies may not adequately compensate us for any losses that we may incur in the event of damage or interruption. Although we benefit from liability protection under the Support Anti-Terrorism by Fostering Effective Technology Act of 2002, the occurrence of any of the foregoing could reduce our revenue, subject us to liability, cause us to issue credits to customers or cause customers not to renew their subscriptions for our applications, any of which could materially adversely affect our business.\nFailures or reduced accessibility of third-party software on which we rely could impair the availability of our platform and applications and adversely affect our business.\nWe license software from third parties for integration into our platform and applications, including open source software. These licenses might not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. While we are not substantially dependent upon any third-party software, the loss of the right to use all or a significant portion of our third-party software required for the development, maintenance and delivery of our applications could result in delays in the provision of our applications until we develop or identify, obtain and integrate equivalent technology, which could harm our business.\nAny errors or defects in the hardware or software we use could result in errors, interruptions, cyber incidents or a failure of our applications. Any significant interruption in the availability of all or a significant portion of such software could have an adverse impact on our business unless and until we can replace the functionality provided by these applications at a similar cost. Furthermore, this software may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. The loss of the right to use all or a significant portion of this software could limit access to our platform and applications. Additionally, we rely upon third parties\u2019 abilities to enhance their current applications, develop new applications on a timely and cost-effective basis and respond to emerging industry standards and other technological changes. We may be unable to effect changes to such third-party technologies, which may prevent us from rapidly responding to evolving customer requirements. We also may be unable to replace the functionality\nprovided by the third-party software currently offered in conjunction with our applications in the event that such software becomes obsolete or incompatible with future versions of our platform and applications or is otherwise not adequately maintained or updated.\nIf we do not or cannot maintain the compatibility of our platform with third-party applications that our customers use in their businesses, our revenue will decline.\nAs a significant percentage of our customers choose to integrate our solutions with certain capabilities provided by third-party providers, the functionality and popularity of our solutions depend, in part, on our ability to integrate our platform and applications with certain third-party systems. Third-party providers may change the features of their technologies, restrict our access to their applications or alter the terms governing use of their applications in an adverse manner. Such changes could functionally limit or terminate our ability to use these third-party technologies in conjunction with our platform and applications, which could negatively impact our solutions and harm our business. If we fail to integrate our solutions with new third-party applications that our customers use, we may not be able to offer the functionality that our customers need, which would negatively impact our ability to generate revenue and adversely impact our business.\nRisks Related to Data Privacy Government Regulation\nWe are subject to governmental regulation and other legal obligations, particularly related to privacy, data protection and information security, and our actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations could harm our business. Compliance with such laws could also impair our efforts to maintain and expand our customer base, and thereby decrease our revenue.\nOur handling and storage of data is subject to a variety of laws and regulations, including regulation by various government agencies, including the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (\u201cFTC\u201d), and various state, local and foreign agencies. We collect personally identifiable information and other data directly from our customers and through our channel partners. We also process or otherwise handle personally identifiable information about our customers\u2019 employees, customers and constituents in certain circumstances. We use this information to provide applications to our customers and to support, expand and improve our business. We may also share customers\u2019 personally identifiable information with third parties as described in our privacy policy and/or as otherwise authorized by our customers.\nThe U.S. federal and various state and foreign governments have adopted or proposed legislation that regulates the collection, distribution, use and storage of personal information of individuals and that mandates security requirements with respect to certain personally identifiable information. In the United States, the FTC and numerous state attorneys general are imposing standards for the online collection, distribution, use and storage of data by applying federal and state consumer protection laws. The lack of a clear and universal standard for protecting such information means, however, that these obligations may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another and may conflict with other requirements or our practices. Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with privacy or security laws, policies, legal obligations or industry standards or any security incident that results in the unauthorized release or transfer of sensitive corporate information, personally identifiable information or other customer data may result in governmental enforcement actions, litigation, fines and penalties and/or adverse publicity, and could cause our customers to lose trust in us, which could have an adverse effect on our reputation and business.\nSome proposed laws or regulations concerning privacy, data protection and information security are in their early stages, and we cannot yet determine how these laws and regulations may be interpreted nor can we determine the impact these proposed laws and regulations, may have on our business. Such proposed laws and regulations may require companies to implement privacy and security policies, permit users to access, correct and delete personal information stored or maintained by such companies, inform individuals of security breaches that affect their personal information, and, in some cases, obtain individuals\u2019 consent to use personal information for certain purposes. In addition, a foreign government could require that any personal information collected in a country not be disseminated outside of that country, and we may not be currently equipped to comply with such a requirement. Our failure to comply with federal, state and international data privacy laws and regulators could harm our ability to successfully operate our business and pursue our business goals.\nIn addition, several foreign countries and governmental bodies, including the European Union and Canada, have regulations governing the collection and use of personal information obtained from their residents, which are often more restrictive than those in the United States. Laws and regulations in these jurisdictions apply broadly to the collection, use, storage, disclosure and security of personal information that identifies or may be used to identify an individual, such as names, email addresses and in some jurisdictions, Internet Protocol, or IP, addresses. Such regulations and laws may be modified and new laws may be enacted in the future.\nWithin the European Union, legislators have adopted the General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d), which went into effect in May 2018. The GDPR includes more stringent operational requirements on entities that process personal data (as compared to existing EU law), including significant penalties for non-compliance, more robust obligations on data processors and data controllers, greater rights for data subjects (potentially requiring significant changes to both our technology and operations), and heavier documentation requirements for data protection compliance programs. Specifically, the GDPR introduces numerous privacy-related changes for companies operating in the EU, including greater control over personal data by data subjects (e.g., the \u201cright to be forgotten\u201d), increased data portability for EU consumers, data breach notification requirements and increased fines. Under the GDPR, fines of up to 20 million euros or up to 4% of the annual global revenue of the noncompliant company, whichever is greater, could be imposed for violations of certain GDPR requirements. The GDPR requirements apply not only to third-party transactions, but also to transfers of information between us and our subsidiaries, including employee information.\nFurther, Brexit could lead to additional legislative and regulatory changes. The United Kingdom Data Protection Act that substantially implements the GDPR became law in May 2018 and was subject to statutory amendments in 2019 that further align it with the GDPR. The development of United Kingdom data protection laws or regulations and regulation of data transfers to and from the United Kingdom in the medium to longer term, however, remain unclear and could impact our ability to sell our products and services to customers in the United Kingdom.\nCalifornia enacted legislation in 2018, the California Consumer Privacy Act (the \u201cCCPA\u201d), that became operative on January 1, 2020. The CCPA requires covered companies to, among other things, provide new disclosures to California consumers, and affords such consumers new abilities to opt-out of certain sales of personal information. The CCPA is the subject of proposed regulations of the California Attorney General that were released on October 10, 2019 but have yet to be finalized. Aspects of the CCPA and its interpretation remain unclear at this time. We cannot fully predict the impact of the CCPA on our business or operations, but it may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and to incur substantial costs and expenses in an effort to comply.\nWhile we have taken steps to mitigate the impact of the GDPR on us, such as implementing standard contractual clauses and self-certifying under the EU-US Privacy Shield, the efficacy and longevity of these mechanisms remains uncertain. For example, on July 16, 2020, the CJEU invalidated the U.S.-EU Privacy Shield framework that had been in place since 2016, which allowed companies like us to meet certain European legal requirements for the transfer of personal data from the EEA to the United States, and imposed additional obligations on companies when relying on the model clauses approved by the EU Commission. This CJEU decision may result in different EEA data protection regulators applying differing standards for the transfer of personal data from the EEA to the United States, and even require ad hoc verification of measures taken with respect to data flows. The invalidation of the U.S.-EU Privacy Shield framework will require us to take additional steps to legitimize any personal data transfers that are impacted by this decision. This could result in increased costs of compliance and limitations on our customers and us. More generally, we find it necessary or desirable to modify our data handling practices, and this CJEU decision or other legal challenges relating to cross-border data transfer may serve as a basis for our personal data handling practices, or those of our customers and vendors, to be challenged and may otherwise adversely impact our business, financial condition and operating results. Potential or actual legal proceedings could lead to one or both of these mechanisms being declared invalid. Further, despite our ongoing efforts to maintain compliance with the GDPR, we may not be successful either due to various factors within our control (such as limited financial or human resources) or outside our control (such as a lack of vendor cooperation). It\u2019s also possible that local data protection authorities (DPAs) may have different interpretations of the GDPR, leading to potential inconsistencies amongst various EU states.\nGlobally, governments and agencies have adopted and could in the future adopt, modify, apply or enforce laws, policies, regulations, and standards covering user privacy, data security, technologies such as cookies that are used\nto collect, store and/or process data, marketing online, the use of data to inform marketing, the taxation of products and services, unfair and deceptive practices, and the collection (including the collection of information), use, processing, transfer, storage and/or disclosure of data associated with unique individual internet users.\nNew regulation or legislative actions (or new interpretations of existing laws, regulations or standards) regarding data privacy and security, together with applicable industry standards, may increase the costs of doing business and could have a material adverse impact on our operations. If our privacy or data security measures fail to comply with current or future laws and regulations, we may be subject to litigation, regulatory investigations, fines or other liabilities, as well as negative publicity and a potential loss of business, which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and business. Moreover, if future laws and regulations limit our customers\u2019 ability to use and share personal information or our ability to store, process and share personal information, demand for our applications could decrease, our costs could increase, and our business, results of operations and financial condition could be harmed.\nIf our applications fail to function in a manner that allows our customers to operate in compliance with regulations and/or industry standards, our revenue and operating results could be harmed.\nCertain of our customers require applications that ensure secure processing, communication and storage of sensitive information given the nature of the content being distributed and associated applicable regulatory requirements. In particular, our healthcare customers rely on our applications to communicate in a manner that is designed to comply with the requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, the 2009 Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, the Final Omnibus Rule of January 25, 2013, which are collectively referred to as HIPAA, and which impose privacy and data security standards that protect individually identifiable health information by limiting the uses and disclosures of individually identifiable health information and requiring that certain data security standards be implemented to protect this information. As a \u201cbusiness associate\u201d to \u201ccovered entities\u201d that are subject to HIPAA, we also have our own compliance obligations directly under HIPAA and pursuant to the business associate agreements that we are required to enter into with our customers that are HIPAA-covered entities.\nGovernments and industry organizations may also adopt new laws, regulations or requirements, or make changes to existing laws or regulations, that could impact the demand for, or value of, our applications. If we are unable to adapt our applications to changing legal and regulatory standards or other requirements in a timely manner, or if our applications fail to allow our customers to communicate in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, our customers may lose confidence in our applications and could switch to products offered by our competitors, or threaten or bring legal actions against us.\nIn addition, governmental and other customers may require our applications to comply with certain privacy, security or other certifications and standards. For instance, with regard to transfers of personal data, on July 16, 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union (\u201cCJEU\u201d) invalidated the U.S.-EU Privacy Shield framework that had been in place since 2016, which allowed companies like us to meet certain European legal requirements for the transfer of personal data from the European Economic Area (\u201cEEA\u201d) to the United States, and imposed additional obligations on companies when relying on the model clauses approved by the EU Commission. The invalidation of the U.S.-EU Privacy Shield framework will require us to take additional steps to legitimize any personal data transfers that are impacted by this decision. While we have other legally recognized mechanisms in place that we believe allow for the lawful transfer of EU customer and employee information to the United States, this invalidation decision could result in increased costs of compliance and limitations on our customers and us. Further, it is possible that these other transfer mechanisms may also be challenged or evolve to include new legal requirements that could have an impact on how we move this data. If our applications fail to maintain compliance with these certifications and standards, or our competitors achieve compliance with these certifications and standards, we may be disqualified from selling our applications to such customers, or may otherwise be at a competitive disadvantage, either of which would harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. If our policies and practices are, or are perceived to be, insufficient or if our customers have concerns regarding the transfer of data from the European Union to the United States, we could be subject to enforcement actions or investigations by EU Data Protection Authorities or lawsuits by private parties, and our business could be negatively impacted.\nFailure to comply with governmental laws and regulations could harm our business.\nOur business is subject to regulation by various federal, state, local and foreign governments. For example, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 (\u201cTCPA\u201d), restricts telemarketing and the use of automatic text messages without proper consent. The scope and interpretation of the laws that are or may be applicable to the delivery of text messages are continuously evolving and developing. If we do not comply with these laws or regulations or if we become liable under these laws or regulations due to the failure of our customers to comply with these laws by obtaining proper consent, we could face direct liability. In certain jurisdictions, these regulatory requirements may be more stringent than those in the United States. Noncompliance with applicable regulations or requirements could subject us to investigations, sanctions, enforcement actions, disgorgement of profits, fines, damages, civil and criminal penalties, injunctions or other collateral consequences. If any governmental sanctions are imposed, or if we do not prevail in any possible civil or criminal litigation, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. In addition, responding to any action will likely result in a significant diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources and an increase in professional fees. Enforcement actions and sanctions could harm our business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\nA portion of our revenue is generated by subscriptions sold to governmental entities and heavily regulated organizations, which are subject to a number of challenges and risks.\nA portion of our revenue is generated by subscriptions sold to government entities. Additionally, many of our current and prospective customers, such as those in the financial services, and healthcare and life sciences industries, are highly regulated and may be required to comply with more stringent regulations in connection with subscribing to and implementing our applications. Selling subscriptions to these entities can be highly competitive, expensive and time consuming, often requiring significant upfront time and expense without any assurance that we will successfully complete a sale.\nFurthermore, engaging in sales activities to foreign governments introduces additional compliance risks specific to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and other similar statutory requirements prohibiting bribery and corruption in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Governmental and highly regulated entities often require contract terms that differ from our standard arrangements. For example, the federal government provides grants to certain state and local governments for our applications and if such governmental entities do not continue to receive these grants, they have the ability to terminate their contracts without penalty. Governmental and highly regulated entities impose compliance requirements that are complicated, require preferential pricing or \u201cmost favored nation\u201d terms and conditions, or are otherwise time consuming and expensive to satisfy. If we undertake to meet special standards or requirements and do not meet them, we could be subject to increased liability from our customers or regulators. Even if we do meet these special standards or requirements, the additional costs associated with providing our applications to government and highly regulated customers could harm our margins. Moreover, changes in the underlying regulatory conditions that affect these types of customers could harm our ability to efficiently provide our applications to them and to grow or maintain our customer base.\nGovernmental demand and payment for our applications may also be impacted by public sector budgetary cycles and funding authorizations, with funding reductions or delays adversely affecting public sector demand for our solutions.\nPotential regulatory requirements placed on our applications and content could impose increased costs on us, delay or prevent our introduction of new applications, and impair the function or value of our existing applications.\nCertain of our existing applications, such as Secure Collaboration, a tailored version of our Secure Messaging application that is designed to comply with HIPAA, are and are likely to continue to be subject to increasing regulatory requirements in a number of ways and as we continue to introduce new applications, we may be subject to additional regulatory requirements and other risks that could be costly and difficult to comply with or that could harm our business. In addition, we market our applications and professional services in certain countries outside of the United States and plan to expand our local presence in regions such as Europe, the Middle East and Asia. If additional legal and/or regulatory requirements are implemented in the foreign countries in which we provide our services, the cost of developing or selling our applications may increase. As these requirements proliferate and as\nexisting legal requirements become subject to new interpretations, we must change or adapt our applications and professional services to comply. Changing regulatory requirements might render certain of our applications obsolete or might block us from accomplishing our work or from developing new applications. This might in turn impose additional costs upon us to comply or to further develop our applications. It might also make introduction of new applications or service types more costly or more time-consuming than we currently anticipate. It might even prevent introduction by us of new applications or cause the continuation of our existing applications or professional services to become unprofitable or impossible.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nIf we fail to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights adequately, our business could be harmed.\nOur future success and competitive position depend in part on our ability to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technologies. To safeguard these rights, we rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws and contractual protections in the United States and other jurisdictions, some of which afford only limited protection.\nWe have numerous issued patents and patent applications pending as of December 31, 2020. We cannot assure you that any patents will issue from any patent applications, that patents that issue from such applications will give us the protection that we seek or that any such patents will not be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented. Any patents that may issue in the future from our pending or future patent applications may not provide sufficiently broad protection and may not be enforceable in actions against alleged infringers. In addition, we have registered the \u201cEverbridge\u201d, \u201cNixle\u201d and \u201cVisual Command Center\u201d names in the United States, and have registered the \u201cEverbridge\u201d name in the European Union. We have registrations and/or pending applications for additional marks in the United States and various other countries; however, we cannot assure you that any future trademark registrations will be issued for pending or future applications or that any registered trademarks will be enforceable or provide adequate protection of our proprietary rights.\nIn order to protect our unpatented proprietary technologies and processes, we rely on trade secret laws and confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, vendors and others. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary technology and trade secrets, unauthorized parties may attempt to misappropriate, reverse engineer or otherwise obtain and use them. In addition, others may independently discover our trade secrets, in which case we would not be able to assert trade secret rights, or develop similar technologies and processes. Further, the contractual provisions that we enter into may not prevent unauthorized use or disclosure of our proprietary technology or intellectual property rights and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of our proprietary technology or intellectual property rights. Effective trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which our services are available or where we have employees or independent contractors. The loss of trade secret protection could make it easier for third parties to compete with our solutions by copying functionality. In addition, any changes in, or unexpected interpretations of, the trade secret and employment laws in any country in which we operate may compromise our ability to enforce our trade secret and intellectual property rights. Costly and time-consuming litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our proprietary rights, and failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection could adversely affect our competitive business position.\nIn addition, to protect our intellectual property rights, we may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect these rights. Litigation brought to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights could be costly, time-consuming and distracting to management and could result in the impairment or loss of portions of our intellectual property. Failure to adequately enforce our intellectual property rights could also result in the impairment or loss of those rights. Furthermore, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights may be met with defenses, counterclaims and countersuits attacking the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights. Patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws offer us only limited protection and the laws of many of the countries in which we sell our services do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the United States and Europe. Accordingly, defense of our trademarks and proprietary technology may become an increasingly important issue as we continue to expand our operations and solution development into countries that provide a lower level of intellectual property protection than the United States or Europe. Policing unauthorized use of our intellectual property and technology is difficult and the steps we take may not prevent misappropriation of the\nintellectual property or technology on which we rely. For example, in the event of inadvertent or malicious disclosure of our proprietary technology, trade secret laws may no longer afford protection to our intellectual property rights in the areas not otherwise covered by patents or copyrights. Accordingly, we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property.\nWe may elect to initiate litigation in the future to enforce or protect our proprietary rights or to determine the validity and scope of the rights of others. That litigation may not be ultimately successful and could result in substantial costs to us, the reduction or loss in intellectual property protection for our technology, the diversion of our management\u2019s attention and harm to our reputation, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur failure or inability to adequately protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAn assertion by a third party that we are infringing its intellectual property could subject us to costly and time-consuming litigation or expensive licenses that could harm our business and results of operations.\nPatent and other intellectual property disputes are common in our industry and we have been involved in such disputes from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. Some companies, including some of our competitors, own large numbers of patents, copyrights and trademarks, which they may use to assert claims against us. Third parties may in the future assert claims of infringement, misappropriation or other violations of intellectual property rights against us. They may also assert such claims against our customers whom we typically indemnify against claims that our solution infringes, misappropriates or otherwise violates the intellectual property rights of third parties. As the numbers of products and competitors in our market increase and overlaps occur, claims of infringement, misappropriation and other violations of intellectual property rights may increase. Any claim of infringement, misappropriation or other violation of intellectual property rights by a third party, even those without merit, could cause us to incur substantial costs defending against the claim and could distract our management from our business.\nAs we seek to extend our platform and applications, we could be constrained by the intellectual property rights of others and it may also be more likely that competitors or other third parties will claim that our solutions infringe their proprietary rights. We might not prevail in any intellectual property infringement litigation given the complex technical issues and inherent uncertainties in such litigation. Defending such claims, regardless of their merit, could be time-consuming and distracting to management, result in costly litigation or settlement, cause development delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements. In addition, we currently have a limited portfolio of issued patents compared to our larger competitors, and therefore may not be able to effectively utilize our intellectual property portfolio to assert defenses or counterclaims in response to patent infringement claims or litigation brought against us by third parties. Further, litigation may involve patent holding companies or other adverse patent owners who have no relevant applications or revenue and against which our potential patents provide no deterrence, and many other potential litigants have the capability to dedicate substantially greater resources to enforce their intellectual property rights and to defend claims that may be brought against them. If our platform or any of our applications exceed the scope of in-bound licenses or violate any third-party proprietary rights, we could be required to withdraw those applications from the market, re-develop those applications or seek to obtain licenses from third parties, which might not be available on reasonable terms or at all. Any efforts to re-develop our platform and our applications, obtain licenses from third parties on favorable terms or license a substitute technology might not be successful and, in any case, might substantially increase our costs and harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. If we were compelled to withdraw any of our applications from the market, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed.\nWe have indemnity obligations to our customers and certain of our channel partners for certain expenses and liabilities resulting from intellectual property infringement claims regarding our platform and our applications, which could force us to incur substantial costs.\nWe have indemnity obligations to our customers and certain of our channel partners for intellectual property infringement claims regarding our platform and our applications. As a result, in the case of infringement claims against these customers and channel partners, we could be required to indemnify them for losses resulting from such claims or to refund amounts they have paid to us. We also expect that some of our channel partners with whom we do not have express contractual obligations to indemnify for intellectual property infringement claims may seek indemnification from us in connection with infringement claims brought against them. We may elect to indemnify these channel partners where we have no contractual obligation to indemnify them and we will evaluate each such request on a case-by-case basis. If a channel partner elects to invest resources in enforcing a claim for indemnification against us, we could incur significant costs disputing it. If we do not succeed in disputing it, we could face substantial liability.\nWe may be subject to damages resulting from claims that our employees or contractors have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of their former employers or other parties.\nWe have in the past and may in the future be subject to claims that employees or contractors, or we, have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information of our competitors or other parties. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. If we fail in defending against such claims, a court could order us to pay substantial damages and prohibit us from using technologies or features that are essential to our solutions, if such technologies or features are found to incorporate or be derived from the trade secrets or other proprietary information of these parties. In addition, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. A loss of key personnel or their work product could hamper or prevent our ability to develop, market and support potential solutions or enhancements, which could severely harm our business. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, such litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management.\nThe use of open source software in our platform and applications may expose us to additional risks and harm our intellectual property.\nOur platform and some of our applications use or incorporate software that is subject to one or more open source licenses and we may incorporate additional open source software in the future. Open source software is typically freely accessible, usable and modifiable; however, certain open source software licenses require a user who intends to distribute the open source software as a component of the user\u2019s software to disclose publicly part or all of the source code to the user\u2019s software. In addition, certain open source software licenses require the user of such software to make any modifications or derivative works of the open source code available to others on potentially unfavorable terms or at no cost. Use and distribution of open source software may entail greater risks than use of third-party commercial software, as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or other contractual protections regarding infringement claims or the quality of the code.\nThe terms of many open source licenses to which we are subject have not been interpreted by U.S. or foreign courts, and accordingly there is a risk that those licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our platform and applications. In that event, we could be required to seek licenses from third parties in order to continue offering our platform and applications, to re-develop our platform and applications, to discontinue sales of our platform and applications or to release our proprietary software code in source code form under the terms of an open source license, any of which could harm our business. Further, given the nature of open source software, it may be more likely that third parties might assert copyright and other intellectual property infringement claims against us based on our use of these open source software programs. Litigation could be costly for us to defend, have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition or require us to devote additional research and development resources to change our applications.\nAlthough we are not aware of any use of open source software in our platform and applications that would require us to disclose all or a portion of the source code underlying our core applications, it is possible that such use may have inadvertently occurred in deploying our platform and applications, or that persons or entities may claim such\ndisclosure to be required. Disclosing our proprietary source code could allow our competitors to create similar products with lower development effort and time and ultimately could result in a loss of sales for us. Disclosing the source code of our proprietary software could also make it easier for cyber attackers and other third parties to discover vulnerabilities in or to defeat the protections of our products, which could result in our products failing to provide our customers with the security they expect. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. Additionally, if a third-party software provider has incorporated certain types of open source software into software we license from such third party for our platform and applications without our knowledge, we could, under certain circumstances, be required to disclose the source code to our platform and applications. This could harm our intellectual property position and our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nOur stock price may be volatile and you may lose some or all of your investment.\nThe market price of our common stock may be highly volatile and may fluctuate substantially as a result of a variety of factors, some of which are related in complex ways. Our stock price ranged from an intraday low of $77.60 to an intraday high of $165.79 during the year ended December 31, 2020. Factors that may affect the market price of our common stock include:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our financial condition and operating results;\n\u2022\nvariance in our financial performance from expectations of securities analysts;\n\u2022\nchanges in the prices of our applications;\n\u2022\nchanges in our projected operating and financial results;\n\u2022\nchanges in laws or regulations applicable to our platform and applications;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant business developments, acquisitions or new applications;\n\u2022\nour involvement in any litigation;\n\u2022\nour sale of our common stock or other securities in the future;\n\u2022\nchanges in senior management or key personnel;\n\u2022\ntrading volume of our common stock;\n\u2022\nchanges in the anticipated future size and growth rate of our market; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic, regulatory and market conditions.\nRecently, the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies. These fluctuations have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. Broad market and industry fluctuations, as well as general economic, political, regulatory and market conditions, may negatively impact the market price of our common stock. In the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their securities have been subject to securities class action litigation. We may be the target of this type of litigation in the future, which could result in substantial costs and divert our management\u2019s attention.\nWe may fail to meet our publicly announced guidance or other expectations about our business and future operating results, which would cause our stock price to decline.\nWe have provided and may continue to provide guidance about our business, future operating results and other business metrics. In developing this guidance, our management must make certain assumptions and judgments about our future performance. Some of those key assumptions relate to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the anticipated contributions from the acquisitions of Connexient, CNL Software, one2many, Techwan, SnapComms and Red Sky, and the associated economic uncertainty on our business and the timing and scope of economic\nrecovery globally, which are inherently difficult to predict. This guidance, which consists of forward-looking statements, is qualified by, and subject to, such assumptions, estimates and expectations as of the date provided, and the other information contained in or referred to in the factors described above and our current and periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. While presented with numerical specificity, this guidance is necessarily speculative in nature, and is inherently subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control and are based upon specific assumptions with respect to future business decisions or economic conditions, some of which may change. It can be expected that some or all of the assumptions, estimates and expectations of the guidance furnished by us from time to time will not materialize or will vary significantly from actual results. Accordingly, our guidance is only an estimate of what management believes is realizable as of the date of release of such guidance. Furthermore, analysts and investors may develop and publish their own projections of our business, which may form a consensus about our future performance. Our business results may vary significantly from such guidance or that consensus due to a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control, including due to the global economic uncertainty and financial market conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, and which could adversely affect our operations and operating results. There are no comparable recent events that provide guidance as to the probable effect of the COVID-19 pandemic, and, as a result, the ultimate impact of the COVID-19 outbreak is highly uncertain and subject to change. We are relying on the reports and models of economic and medical experts in making assumptions relating to the duration of this crisis and predictions as to timing and pace of any future economic recovery. If these models are incorrect or incomplete, or if we fail to accurately predict the full impact that the COVID-19 pandemic will have on all aspects of our business, the guidance and other forward-looking statements we provide from time to time may also be incorrect or incomplete. Furthermore, if we make downward revisions of previously announced guidance, or if our publicly announced guidance of future operating results fails to meet expectations of securities analysts, investors or other interested parties, the price of our common stock could decline.\nConversion of the 2024 Notes and 2022 Notes will dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders, including holders who had previously converted their Notes, or may otherwise depress the price of our common stock.\nIn December 2019, we issued the 2024 Notes, which will mature on December 15, 2024, unless earlier redeemed or repurchased by us or converted by the holder pursuant to their terms. In November 2017, we issued the 2022 Notes, which will mature on November 1, 2022, unless earlier redeemed or repurchased by us or converted by the holder pursuant to their terms. The conversion of some or all of the convertible 2024 Notes and 2022 Notes will dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders to the extent we deliver shares upon conversion of any of the 2024 Notes and 2022 Notes. Based on the market price of our common stock during the 30 trading days preceding June 30, 2018, the 2022 Notes were convertible at the option of the debt holder as of September 30, 2018 and continue to be convertible at the option of the debt holder as of December 31, 2020. During 2020, we issued 362,029 shares upon the conversion of approximately $12.2 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2022 Notes. The 2024 Notes were not convertible during the year ended December 31, 2020. Any sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock. In addition, the existence of the 2024 Notes and 2022 Notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of the 2024 Notes and 2022 Notes could be used to satisfy short positions, or anticipated conversion of the 2024 Notes and 2022 Notes into shares of our common stock could depress the price of our common stock.\nThe capped call transactions entered into when we issued the convertible notes may affect the value of our common stock.\nIn connection with the issuances of the 2024 Notes and 2022 Notes, we entered into capped call transactions with the respective option counterparties. The capped call transactions are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution upon conversion of the 2024 Notes and 2022 Notes and/or offset any cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted 2024 Notes and 2022 Notes, as the case may be, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap. In connection with establishing their initial hedges of the capped call transactions, the option counterparties or their respective affiliates entered into various derivative transactions with respect to our common stock concurrently with or shortly after the pricing of the 2024 Notes and 2022 Notes. The option counterparties or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding derivatives with respect to our common stock and/or purchasing or selling our common stock or other securities of ours in secondary market transactions prior to the maturity of the 2024 Notes and 2022 Notes (and are likely to do so during any observation period related to a conversion of 2024 Notes and 2022 Notes). This activity could cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in the market price of our common stock.\nWe are obligated to maintain a system of effective internal control over financial reporting and any failure to maintain the adequacy of these internal controls may harm investor confidence in our company and, as a result, the value of our common stock.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires that we maintain effective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. We are required, pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, to furnish a report by management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. This assessment includes disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our management in our internal control over financial reporting.\nOur compliance with Section 404 necessitates that we incur substantial accounting expense and expend significant management efforts. We will continue to dedicate internal resources, engage outside consultants and adopt a detailed work plan to assess and document the adequacy of internal control over financial reporting, continue steps to improve control processes as appropriate, validate through testing that controls are functioning as documented and implement a continuous reporting and improvement process for internal control over financial reporting and to compile the system and process documentation necessary to perform the evaluation needed to comply with Section 404. However, we cannot assure you that our independent registered public accounting firm will be able to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. We may not be able to remediate any material weaknesses that may be identified, or to complete our evaluation, testing and any required remediation in a timely fashion and our independent registered public accounting firm may issue a report that is adverse in the event it is not satisfied with the level at which our controls are documented, designed or operating.\nAny failure to maintain adequate internal controls over financial reporting could severely inhibit our ability to accurately report our financial condition or results of operations. If we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our auditors are unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls when they are required to issue such opinion, investors could lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, the market price of our common stock could decline, and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the Nasdaq Global Market, the SEC or other regulatory authorities. Failure to remedy any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, or to implement or maintain other effective control systems required of public companies, could also restrict our future access to the capital markets.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or if they issue an adverse or misleading opinion regarding our stock, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. We do not have any control over these analysts. If any of the analysts who cover us issue an adverse or misleading opinion regarding us, our business model, our intellectual property or our stock performance, or if operating results fail to meet the expectations of analysts, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nWe do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future, and accordingly, stockholders must rely on stock appreciation for any return on their investment.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock and do not intend to pay any cash dividends to holders of our common stock in the foreseeable future. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be your sole source of gain for the foreseeable future.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of us more difficult, limit attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management and limit the market price of our common stock.\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control or changes in our management. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws include provisions that:\n\u2022\nauthorize our board of directors to issue preferred stock, without further stockholder action and with voting liquidation, dividend and other rights superior to our common stock;\n\u2022\nrequire that any action to be taken by our stockholders be affected at a duly called annual or special meeting and not by written consent, and limit the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings;\n\u2022\nestablish an advance notice procedure for stockholder proposals to be brought before an annual meeting, including proposed nominations of persons for director nominees;\n\u2022\nestablish that our board of directors is divided into three classes, with directors in each class serving three-year staggered terms;\n\u2022\nrequire the approval of holders of two-thirds of the shares entitled to vote at an election of directors to adopt, amend or repeal our bylaws or amend or repeal the provisions of our certificate of incorporation regarding the election and removal of directors and the ability of stockholders to take action by written consent or call a special meeting;\n\u2022\nprohibit cumulative voting in the election of directors; and\n\u2022\nprovide that vacancies on our board of directors may be filled only by the vote of a majority of directors then in office, even though less than a quorum.\nThese provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management. In addition, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, which generally prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any of a broad range of business combinations with any \u201cinterested\u201d stockholder for a period of three years following the date on which the stockholder became an \u201cinterested\u201d stockholder. Any of the foregoing provisions could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock, and they could deter potential acquirers of our company, thereby reducing the likelihood that you would receive a premium for your common stock in an acquisition.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the exclusive forum for certain litigation that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us.\nPursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the sole and exclusive forum for (1) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (2) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or other employees to us or our stockholders, (3) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws, or (4) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation further provides that any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our common stock is deemed to have notice of and\nconsented to the foregoing provision. The forum selection clause in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation may limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us.\nFuture sales of our common stock in the public market could cause our share price to decline.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales might occur, could depress the market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. We are unable to predict the effect that sales, particularly sales by our directors, executive officers and significant stockholders, may have on the prevailing market price of our common stock. Additionally, the shares of common stock subject to outstanding options under our equity incentive plans and the shares reserved for future issuance under our equity incentive plans, as well as shares issuable upon vesting of restricted stock awards, will become eligible for sale in the public market in the future, subject to certain legal and contractual limitations.\nIn addition, in the future, we may issue common stock or other securities if we need to raise additional capital. The number of new shares of our common stock issued in connection with raising additional capital could constitute a material portion of our then-outstanding shares of our common stock.\nRisks Related to our Indebtedness\nWe issued convertible notes that have rights senior to our common stock.\nIn December 2019, we issued the 2024 Notes, which will mature on December 15, 2024, unless earlier redeemed or repurchased by us or converted by the holder pursuant to their terms. In November 2017, we issued the 2022 Notes, which will mature on November 1, 2022, unless earlier redeemed or repurchased by us or converted by the holder pursuant to their terms. In connection with the issuance of the 2024 Notes, we paid $57.8 million to repurchase $23.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2022 Notes. During 2020, we issued 362,029 shares upon the conversion of approximately $12.2 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2022 Notes.\nThe 2024 Notes and 2022 Notes rank senior in right of payment to our common stock and any of our indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the 2024 Notes and 2022 Notes; equal in right of payment to any of our liabilities that are not so subordinated (including to the 2022 Notes, in the case of the 2024 Notes, and to the 2024 Notes, in the case of the 2022 Notes); effectively junior in right of payment to any of our secured indebtedness, to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and structurally junior to all indebtedness and other liabilities (including trade payables) of our subsidiaries. In the event of our bankruptcy, liquidation, reorganization or other winding up, our assets that secure debt ranking senior or equal in right of payment to the 2024 Notes and 2022 Notes will be available to pay obligations on the 2024 Notes and 2022 Notes only after the secured debt has been repaid in full from these assets, and our assets will be available to pay common stockholders only after all debt obligations have been repaid. There may not be sufficient assets remaining to pay amounts due on any or all of the 2024 Notes and 2022 Notes then outstanding or any or all shares of our common stock then outstanding.\nServicing our debt requires a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our substantial debt.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness, including the 2024 Notes and 2022 Notes, depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not continue to generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service our debt and make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had $530 million (undiscounted) principal amount of indebtedness under the 2024 Notes and 2022 Notes. Our indebtedness may:\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general business purposes;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to use our cash flow or obtain additional financing for future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general business purposes;\n\u2022\nrequire us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make debt service payments;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our business and industry;\n\u2022\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our less leveraged competitors; and\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to the impact of adverse economic and industry conditions.\nIn addition, any future indebtedness that we may incur may contain financial and other restrictive covenants that limit our ability to operate our business, raise capital or make payments under our other indebtedness. If we fail to comply with these covenants or to make payments under our indebtedness when due, then we would be in default under that indebtedness, which could, in turn, result in that and our other indebtedness becoming immediately payable in full.\nThe accounting method for convertible debt securities that may be settled in cash, such as the 2024 Notes and 2022 Notes, could have a material effect on our reported financial results.\nIn May 2008, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) issued FASB Staff Position No. APB 14-1, Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash Upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement), which has subsequently been codified as Accounting Standards Codification (\u201cASC\u201d) 470-20, Debt with Conversion and Other Options. Under ASC 470-20, an entity must separately account for the liability and equity components of the convertible debt instruments (such as the 2024 Notes and 2022 Notes) that may be settled entirely or partially in cash upon conversion in a manner that reflects the issuer\u2019s economic interest cost. The effect of ASC 470-20 on the accounting for the 2024 Notes and 2022 Notes is that the equity component is required to be included in the additional paid-in capital section of stockholders\u2019 equity on our consolidated balance sheet, and the value of the equity component was treated as original issue discount for purposes of accounting for the debt component of the 2024 Notes and 2022 Notes. As a result, we recorded a greater amount of non-cash interest expense in current periods presented as a result of the amortization of the discounted carrying value of the 2024 Notes and 2022 Notes to their face amount over the term of the 2024 Notes and 2022 Notes. We reported lower net income in our financial results because ASC 470-20 requires interest to include both the current period\u2019s amortization of the debt discount and the instrument\u2019s coupon interest, which could adversely affect our reported or future financial results, the trading price of our common stock and the trading price of the 2024 Notes and 2022 Notes.\nThe conditional conversion feature of the 2024 Notes and 2022 Notes, may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nIn the event the conditional conversion feature of the 2024 Notes or the 2022 Notes is triggered, holders of the 2024 Notes or the 2022 Notes, as the case may be, will be entitled to convert the 2024 Notes or the 2022 Notes at any time during specified periods at their option. Based on the market price of our common stock during the 30 trading days preceding June 30, 2018, the 2022 Notes were convertible at the option of the debt holder as of September 30, 2018 and continue to be convertible at the option of the debt holder as of December 31, 2020. The 2024 Notes were not convertible during the year ended December 31, 2020, but will be convertible under certain circumstances. If one or more holders elect to convert their 2022 Notes or their 2024 Notes, as the case may be, unless we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering solely shares of our common stock (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we would be required to settle a portion or all of our conversion obligation through the payment of cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity. In addition, even if holders do not elect to convert their 2022 Notes or their 2024 Notes, as the case may be, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to\nreclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the 2022 Notes or the 2024 notes, as applicable, as a current rather than long-term liability, which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital.\nGeneral Risks\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is severe, and widespread, and while the rollout of vaccines has begun, the timing of vaccinations and lifting of shelter in place requirements and movement restrictions is unknown. We are unable to accurately predict the full impact that the COVID-19 pandemic will have on our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows due to numerous uncertainties, including the duration and severity of the pandemic and containment measures. Our compliance with these measures has impacted our day-to-day operations and could disrupt our business and operations, as well as that of our customers, partners, suppliers and others with whom we work, for an indefinite period of time. To support the health and well-being of our employees, customers, partners and communities, the vast majority of our employees are working remotely and are expected to continue to work remotely until the pandemic subsides. If a natural disaster, power outage, connectivity issue, or other event occurred that impacted our employees\u2019 ability to work remotely, it may be difficult or, in certain cases, impossible, for us to continue our business for a substantial period of time. The increase in remote working for employees, vendors or contractors may also result in increased consumer privacy, IT security, and fraud concerns. Further, as certain businesses return to onsite operations, we may experience disruptions if our employees or third-party service providers\u2019 employees become ill despite the availability of vaccines, and are unable to perform their duties. This may impact our operations, internet, or mobile networks, or the operations of one or more of our third-party service providers. In addition, many of our customers and prospective customers are working remotely, which may delay the timing of their purchases of our products and services.\nThe disruptions to our operations caused by the COVID-19 pandemic may result in inefficiencies, delays and additional costs in our sales and marketing, professional services and research and development efforts, which cannot be predicted or quantified at this time. We may not be able to fully mitigate any such inefficiencies, delays and additional costs through remote or other alternative work arrangements. In addition, given the economic uncertainty created by the COVID-19 pandemic, we have and may continue to see delays in our sales cycle, failures of customers to renew at all or to renew at the anticipated scope their subscriptions with us, requests from customers for payment term deferrals as well as pricing or bundling concessions, which, if significant, could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, our third-party service providers may experience financial difficulties or business disruptions that could negatively affect their operations and their ability to supply us with services needed for our products and operations. Although such events did not have a material adverse impact on our financial results for the year ended December 31, 2020, there can be no assurance that these events will not have a material adverse impact on our financial results for the full fiscal year or future periods.\nNegative conditions in the general economy both in the United States and abroad, including conditions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, changes in gross domestic product growth, financial and credit market fluctuations, energy costs, international trade relations and other geopolitical issues, the availability and cost of credit and the global housing and mortgage markets could cause a decrease in consumer discretionary spending and business investment and diminish growth expectations in the U.S. economy and abroad. More generally, the COVID-19 pandemic raises the possibility of an extended global economic downturn and has caused volatility in financial markets, which could materially and adversely affect demand for our products and services and could materially and adversely impact our results and financial condition even after the pandemic has subsided and the containment measures are lifted. For example, we may be unable to collect receivables from those customers significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, which may be more pronounced in industry verticals more directly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Also, a decrease in subscriptions and/or renewals in a given period could negatively affect our revenues in future periods, particularly if experienced on a sustained basis, because a substantial proportion of our software subscriptions yield revenue recognized over time. The pandemic may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described herein including risks associated with our guidance, our customers, our potential customers, our market opportunity, renewals and sales cycles, among others. We will continue to evaluate the nature and extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business.\nThe full extent of the COVID-19 pandemic\u2019s impact on our operations and financial performance depends on future developments that are uncertain and unpredictable, including the duration and spread of the pandemic, the timing of vaccine rollouts and herd immunity, the pandemic\u2019s impact on capital and financial markets, the timing of economic recovery, the spread of the virus to other regions, and the actions taken to contain it, among others. Any of these impacts could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition and ability to execute and capitalize on our strategies. Due to the ongoing uncertainty regarding the severity and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, we cannot predict whether our response to date or the actions we may take in the future will be effective in mitigating the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Accordingly, we are unable at this time to predict the future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations, liquidity, and financial results, and, depending on the magnitude and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, such impact may be material.\nUncertain or weakened global economic conditions may adversely affect our industry, business and results of operations.\nOur overall performance depends on domestic and worldwide economic conditions, which may remain challenging for the foreseeable future. Financial developments seemingly unrelated to us or to our industry may adversely affect us and our planned international expansion. The U.S. economy and other key international economies have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, threatened sovereign defaults and ratings downgrades, falling demand for a variety of goods and services, restricted credit, threats to major multinational companies, poor liquidity, reduced corporate profitability, volatility in credit, equity and foreign exchange markets, bankruptcies and overall uncertainty. These conditions affect the rate of information technology spending and could adversely affect our customers\u2019 ability or willingness to purchase our applications and services, delay prospective customers\u2019 purchasing decisions, reduce the value or duration of their subscriptions or affect renewal rates, any of which could adversely affect our operating results. We cannot predict the timing, strength or duration of the economic recovery or any subsequent economic slowdown worldwide, in the United States, or in our industry.\nAny future litigation against us could be costly and time-consuming to defend.\nWe have in the past and may in the future become subject, from time to time, to legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business such as claims brought by our customers in connection with commercial disputes or employment claims made by our current or former employees. Litigation might result in substantial costs and may divert management\u2019s attention and resources, which might seriously harm our business, overall financial condition and operating results. Insurance might not cover such claims, might not provide sufficient payments to cover all the costs to resolve one or more such claims and might not continue to be available on terms acceptable to us. A claim brought against us that is uninsured or underinsured could result in unanticipated costs, thereby reducing our operating results and leading analysts or potential investors to reduce their expectations of our performance, which could reduce the trading price of our stock.\nOur business is subject to the risks of earthquakes, fires, floods and other natural catastrophic events and to interruption by man-made problems such as cyber incidents or terrorism.\nOur business and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, fires, floods, power losses, telecommunications failures, terrorist attacks, acts of war, human errors, break-ins and similar events affecting us or third-party vendors we rely on, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition. Acts of terrorism, which may be targeted at metropolitan areas that have higher population density than rural areas, could cause disruptions in our or our customers\u2019 businesses or the economy as a whole. Our servers and those of our third-party vendors may also be vulnerable to cyber incidents, break-ins and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our computer systems, which could lead to interruptions, delays, loss of critical data or the unauthorized disclosure of confidential customer data. We or our customers may not have sufficient protection or recovery plans in place, and our business interruption insurance may be insufficient to compensate us for losses that may occur. As we rely heavily on our servers, computer and communications systems, that of third parties and the Internet to conduct our business and provide high quality customer service, such disruptions could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nLegislative actions and new accounting pronouncements are likely to impact our future financial position or results of operations.\nFuture changes in financial accounting standards may cause adverse, unexpected revenue fluctuations and affect our financial position or results of operations. New pronouncements and varying interpretations of pronouncements have occurred with frequency in the past and are expected to occur again in the future and as a result we may be required to make changes in our accounting policies. Those changes could adversely affect our reported revenues and expenses, future profitability or financial position. Compliance with new regulations regarding corporate governance and public disclosure may result in additional expenses.\nFor example, in August 2020, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") 2020-06, Debt-Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging-Contracts in Entity\u2019s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity\u2019s Own Equity. ASU 2020-06 reduces the number of accounting models for convertible instruments by eliminating two of the three models that require separate accounting for embedded conversion features, amends the requirements for a contract that is potentially settled in an entity\u2019s own shares to be classified in equity, and amends certain guidance on the computation of earnings per share for convertible instruments and contracts on an entity\u2019s own equity. ASU 2020-06 is effective beginning in the first quarter of 2022. We are assessing the impact this standard will have our consolidated financial statements.\nThe application of existing or future financial accounting standards, particularly those relating to the way we account for revenues and costs, could have a significant impact on our reported results. In addition, compliance with new regulations regarding corporate governance and public disclosure may result in additional expenses. As a result, we intend to invest all reasonably necessary resources to comply with evolving standards, and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from business activities to compliance activities.\nImpairment of goodwill and other intangible assets would result in a decrease in our earnings.\nCurrent accounting rules provide that goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives may not be amortized but instead must be tested for impairment at least annually. These rules also require that intangible assets with definite useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values, and reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. We have substantial goodwill and other intangible assets, and we would be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our consolidated financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or intangible assets is determined. Any impairment charges or changes to the estimated amortization periods would result in a decrease in our earnings.\nOur ability to use our net operating losses to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards (\u201cNOL\u201ds) of $240.1 million and $222.4 million, respectively, due to prior period losses, of which $175.8 million and $76.2 million, respectively, can be carried forward indefinably with the remaining expiring in various years through 2040 if not utilized. In general, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, a corporation that undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its NOLs to offset future taxable income. Our existing NOLs may be subject to limitations arising from previous ownership changes. Future changes in our stock ownership, some of which are outside of our control, could result in an ownership change. There is also a risk that due to regulatory changes, such as suspensions on the use of NOLs, or other unforeseen reasons, our existing NOLs could expire or otherwise be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities. We completed a Section 382 study for the period through March 31, 2019 and determined that a Section 382 ownership change occurred on December 31, 2017 subjecting all pre-Tax Act losses to a utilization limitation. We also have federal and state NOLs of $9.2 million and $9.1 million, respectively, from various acquisitions which are subject to limitations under Section 382. Additionally, state NOLs generated in one state cannot be used to offset income generated in another state. For these reasons, we may not be able to realize a tax benefit from the use of our NOLs, whether or not we attain profitability.\nChanges in our effective tax rate or tax liability may have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur effective tax rate could be adversely impacted by several factors, including:\n\u2022\nChanges in the relative amounts of income before taxes in the various jurisdictions in which we operate that have differing statutory tax rates;\n\u2022\nChanges in tax laws, tax treaties and regulations or the interpretation of them;\n\u2022\nChanges to our assessment about the realizability of our deferred tax assets that are based on estimates of our future results, the prudence and feasibility of possible tax planning strategies, and the economic and political environments in which we do business;\n\u2022\nThe outcome of current and future tax audits, examinations or administrative appeals;\n\u2022\nChanges in generally accepted accounting principles that affect the accounting for taxes; and\n\u2022\nLimitations or adverse findings regarding our ability to do business in some jurisdictions.\nWe may have additional tax liabilities.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and many foreign jurisdictions and are commonly audited by various tax authorities. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. The results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our financial statements in the period or periods for which that determination is made.\nTax laws or regulations could be enacted or changed and existing tax laws or regulations could be applied to us or to our customers in a manner that could increase the costs of our software solutions and adversely impact our operating results.\nThe application of federal, state, local and foreign tax laws to services provided electronically is continuously evolving. New income, sales, use or other tax laws, statutes, rules, regulations or ordinances could be enacted or amended at any time, possibly with retroactive effect, and could be applied solely or disproportionately to services provided over the Internet. These enactments or amendments could adversely affect our sales activity due to the inherent cost increase the taxes would represent and could ultimately result in a negative impact on our operating results.\nIn addition, existing tax laws, statutes, rules, regulations or ordinances could be interpreted, modified or applied adversely to us, possibly with retroactive effect, which could require us or our customers to pay additional tax amounts, as well as require us or our customers to pay fines or penalties, as well as interest on past amounts. If we are unsuccessful in collecting such taxes due from our customers, we could be held liable for such costs, thereby adversely impacting our operating results.\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the United States passed the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (\"CARES\") Act in March 2020. The CARES Act includes various income and payroll tax measures which did not materially impact our financial statements.\nWe may be subject to additional obligations to collect and remit sales tax and other taxes, and we may be subject to tax liability for past sales, which could harm our business.\nState, local and foreign jurisdictions have differing rules and regulations governing sales, use, value added and other taxes, and these rules and regulations are subject to varying interpretations that may change over time. Further, these jurisdictions\u2019 rules regarding tax nexus are complex and vary significantly. If one or more jurisdictions were to assert that we have failed to collect taxes for sales of applications that leverage our platform, we could face the possibility of tax assessments and audits. A successful assertion that we should be collecting additional sales, use,\nvalue added or other taxes in those jurisdictions where we have not historically done so and do not accrue for such taxes could result in substantial tax liabilities and related penalties for past sales or otherwise harm our business and operating results.\nWe face exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\nAs our international operations expand, our exposure to the effects of fluctuations in currency exchange rates grows. While we have primarily transacted with customers and vendors in U.S. dollars historically, we expect to continue to expand the number of transactions with our customers that are denominated in foreign currencies in the future. Fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies may make our subscriptions more expensive for international customers, which could harm our business. Additionally, we incur expenses for employee compensation and other operating expenses at our non-U.S. locations in the local currency for such locations. Fluctuations in the exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies could result in an increase to the U.S. dollar equivalent of such expenses. These fluctuations could cause our results of operations to differ from our expectations or the expectations of our investors. Additionally, such foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations could make it more difficult to detect underlying trends in our business and results of operations.\nWe do not currently maintain a program to hedge transactional exposures in foreign currencies. However, in the future, we may use derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The use of such hedging activities may not offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place. Moreover, the use of hedging instruments may introduce additional risks if we are unable to structure effective hedges with such instruments.",

Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to historical financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those contained in or implied by any forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those under \u201cRisk Factors\u201d included in Part I, Item 1A or in other parts of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nEverbridge is a global software company that provides enterprise software applications that automate and accelerate organizations\u2019 operational response to critical events in order to keep people safe and businesses running. During public safety threats including active shooter situations, terrorist attacks or severe weather conditions, as well as critical business events such as IT outages, cyber-attacks or other incidents such as product recalls or supply-chain interruptions, global customers rely on our Critical Event Management platform to quickly and reliably aggregate and assess threat data, locate people at risk and responders able to assist, automate the execution of pre-defined communications processes and track progress on executing response plans. Our customers use our platform to identify and assess hundreds of different types of threats to their organizations, people, assets or brand. Our solutions enable organizations to deliver intelligent, contextual messages to, and receive verification of delivery from, hundreds of millions of recipients, across multiple communications modalities such as voice, SMS and e-mail, in over 200 countries and territories, in several languages and dialects - all simultaneously. Our Critical Event Management platform is comprised of a comprehensive set of software applications that address the full spectrum of tasks an organization has to perform to manage a critical event, including Mass Notification, Safety Connection, Incident Management, IT Alerting, Visual Command Center, Public Warning, Community Engagement, Risk Center, Crisis Management, Secure Collaboration, and Control Center. We believe that our broad suite of integrated, enterprise applications delivered via a single global platform is a significant competitive advantage in the market for Critical Event Management solutions, which we refer to generally as CEM.\nOur customer base has grown from 867 customers at the end of 2011 to more than 5,600 customers as of December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2020, our customers were based in 70 countries and included eight of the 10 largest U.S. cities, nine of the 10 largest U.S.-based investment banks, 47 of the 50 busiest North American airports, nine of the 10 largest global consulting firms, eight of the 10 largest global automakers, nine of the 10 largest U.S.-based health care providers, and seven of the 10 largest technology companies in the world. We provide our applications to customers of varying sizes, including enterprises, small businesses, non-profit organizations, educational institutions and governmental agencies. Our customers span a wide variety of industries including technology, energy, financial services, healthcare and life sciences, manufacturing, media and entertainment, retail, higher education and professional services.\nWe sell all of our critical event management applications on a subscription basis. We generally enter into contracts that range from one to three years in length, with an average contract duration of 1.9 years as of December 31, 2020, and generally bill and collect payment annually in advance. We derive most of our revenue from subscriptions to applications. Over 83% of the revenue that we recognized in each of the eight most recently completed quarters was generated from contracts entered into in prior quarters or renewals of those contracts; the balance of the revenue that we recognized in each such quarter was generated from contracts entered into with new customers or new contracts, other than renewals, entered into with existing customers in such quarter. We derived approximately 50% of our revenue in 2020 from sales of our Mass Notification application. Our pricing model is based on the number of applications subscribed to and, per application, the number of people, locations and things connected to our platform as well as the volume of communications. We also offer premium services including data feeds for social media, threat intelligence and weather. We generate additional revenue by expanding the number of applications that our customers subscribe to and the number of contacts and devices connected to our platform.\nWe generated revenue of $271.1 million in 2020, $200.9 million in 2019, $147.1 million in 2018 and $104.4 million in 2017, representing year-over-year increases of 35% in 2020, 37% in 2019 and 41% in 2018. We had net losses of $93.4 million, $52.3 million, $47.5 million and $19.6 million in 2020, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2020, and 2019, 24% and 23% of our customers, respectively, were located outside of the United States and these customers generated 26% and 22% of our total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nWe have focused on rapidly growing our business and believe that the future growth of our business is dependent on many factors, including our ability to increase the functionality of our platform and applications, expand our customer base, accelerate adoption of our applications beyond Mass Notification within our existing customer base and expand our international presence. Our future growth will also depend on the growth in the market for critical event management solutions and our ability to effectively compete. In order to further penetrate the market for critical event management solutions and capitalize on what we believe to be a significant opportunity, we intend to continue to invest in research and development, build-out our data center infrastructure and services capabilities and hire additional sales representatives, both domestically and internationally, to drive sales to new customers and incremental sales of new applications to existing customers. Nevertheless, we expect to continue to incur losses in the near term and, if we are unable to achieve our growth objectives, we may not be able to achieve profitability.\nRecent Developments\nBusiness Combinations\nOn February 7, 2020, we entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with Connexient pursuant to which we purchased all of the issued and outstanding shares of stock of Connexient for a base consideration of $20.2 million. We paid $11.5 million in cash at closing and paid the remaining purchase price with 96,611 newly issued shares of our common stock. On the date of this acquisition, the average price of the Company\u2019s common stock on the Nasdaq Global Market was $93.32 per share. We acquired Connexient to expand our customer base and for its strategic technology assets to enhance our CEM suite of solutions to broaden support for Internet of Things (\u201cIoT\u201d) applications.\nOn February 25, 2020, we entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with CNL Software for a base consideration of approximately $35.7 million.

We are taking a variety of measures to ensure the availability and functioning of our critical infrastructure, to promote the safety and security of our employees and to support the communities in which we operate. These measures include requiring remote working arrangements for employees where practicable, among other modifications. We are following evolving public and private sector policies and initiatives to reduce the transmission of COVID-19, such as the imposition of travel restrictions, the promotion of social distancing and the adoption of work-from-home arrangements. All of these policies and initiatives have been and may continue to impact our operations. We will continue to actively monitor the situation and may take further actions that alter our business operations as may be required or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, suppliers and stockholders. Due to the speed with which the situation is developing, we are not able at this time to estimate the future impact of COVID-19 on our financial results and operations, but the impact could be material during any future period affected either directly or indirectly by this pandemic. Due to our primarily subscription-based business model, the effect of the coronavirus may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods, if at all. See \u201cRisk Factors\u201d included in Part I, Item 1A included herein which includes information on risks associated with pandemics in general and COVID-19 specifically. The extent of the future impact of COVID-19 on our operational and financial performance will depend on certain developments, including new information which may emerge concerning the duration and severity of the outbreak, international actions taken or which may be taken in the future to contain and treat it, impact on our customers and our sales cycles, and impact on our employees, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted.\nIn the first quarter of 2020, we launched COVID-19 Shield, a new set of coronavirus protection solutions designed to protect the safety of employees and customers, maintain business operations, safeguard supply chains, and reduce costs and liabilities stemming from the impact of the global coronavirus pandemic. In the second quarter of 2020, we launched several additional software solutions, including (1) COVID-19 Return to Work, a software solution designed to help businesses and governments navigate the complexity of operating during the next phase of the COVID-19 pandemic and prepare to bring back the workforce and reopen society; (2) COVID-19 Shield: Contact Tracing, a solution for corporate, government and healthcare organizations to supplement or complement existing manual contact tracing efforts; and (3) Control Center, a physical security information management software platform, which includes features designed to help organizations return to work by integrating and managing data and analytics from video cameras, thermal cameras, badge access and other building systems, and by automating the response to help organizations ensure the safety and protection of employees, as well as compliance with social distancing and personal protective equipment policies. In the fourth quarter of 2020, we announced COVID-19 Shield: Vaccine Distribution, an extension to our CEM platform offering risk insights, logistics awareness and vaccine appointment management. These new products were built off of our existing platforms.\nPresentation of Financial Statements\nOur consolidated financial statements include the accounts of our wholly-owned subsidiaries. Business acquisitions are included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of the acquisition. Our purchase accounting resulted in all assets and liabilities of acquired businesses being recorded at their estimated fair values on the acquisition dates. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nWe report our financial results as one operating segment. Our operating results are regularly reviewed on a consolidated basis by our chief executive officer, who is our chief operating decision maker, principally to make strategic decisions regarding how we allocate our resources and to assess our consolidated operating performance.\nComponents of Results of Operations\nRevenue\nWe derive substantially all of our revenue from the sale of subscriptions to our critical event management and enterprise safety applications.\nWe generally bill and collect payment for our subscriptions annually in advance. All revenue billed in advance of services being delivered is recorded in deferred revenue. The initial subscription period typically ranges from one to three years. We offer varying levels of customer support based on customer needs and the complexity of their businesses, including the level of usage by a customer in terms of minutes or the amount of data used to transmit the notifications. Our pricing model is based on the number of applications subscribed to and, per application, the number of people, locations and things connected to our platform as well as the volume of communications. We also offer premium services including data feeds for social media, threat intelligence and weather. We generate additional revenue by expanding the number of premium features and applications that our customers subscribe to and the number of contacts connected to our platform.\nWe also sell professional services, which primarily consist of fees for deployment and optimization services as well as training. In addition, on occasion we may sell our software and related post contract support for on premises usage which is outside of our core business and is not a significant revenue stream for us.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue includes expenses related to the fulfillment of our subscription services, consisting primarily of employee-related expenses for data center operations and customer support, including salaries, bonuses, benefits and stock-based compensation expense. Cost of revenue also includes hosting costs, messaging costs and depreciation and amortization. As we add data center capacity and support personnel in advance of anticipated growth, our cost of revenue will increase and, if anticipated revenue growth does not occur, our gross profit will be adversely affected.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses consist of sales and marketing, research and development and general and administrative expenses. Salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation expense and other personnel costs are the most significant components of each of these expense categories. We include stock-based compensation expense incurred in connection with the grant of stock options, restricted stock units, performance-based restricted stock units and our employee stock purchase plan within the applicable operating expense category based on the equity award recipient\u2019s functional area.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expense primarily consists of employee-related expenses for sales, marketing and public relations employees, including salaries, bonuses, commissions, benefits and stock-based compensation expense. Sales and marketing expense also includes trade show, market research, advertising and other related external marketing expense as well as office and software related costs to support sales. We defer certain sales commissions related to acquiring new customers or services and amortize these expenses ratably over the period of benefit that we\nhave determined to be four years. Sales commissions attributable to professional services are expensed within twelve months of selling the service to the customer. We plan to continue to expand our sales and marketing functions to grow our customer base and increase sales to existing customers. This growth will include adding sales personnel and expanding our marketing activities to continue to generate additional leads and build brand awareness. In the near term, we expect our sales and marketing expense to increase on an absolute dollar basis as we hire new sales representatives in the United States and worldwide and grow our marketing staff.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expense primarily consists of employee-related expenses for research and development staff, including salaries, bonuses, benefits and stock-based compensation expense. Research and development expense also includes the cost of certain third-party services, office related costs to support research and development activities, software subscriptions and hosting costs. We capitalize certain software development costs that are attributable to developing new applications and adding incremental functionality to our platform and amortize these costs over the estimated life of the new application or incremental functionality, which is generally three years. We focus our research and development efforts on improving our applications, developing new applications and delivering new functionality. In the near term, we expect our research and development expense to increase on an absolute dollar basis as we continue to increase the functionality of our platform and applications.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expense primarily consists of employee-related expenses for administrative, legal, finance and human resource personnel, including salaries, bonuses, benefits and stock-based compensation expense. General and administrative expense also includes professional fees, insurance premiums, corporate expenses, transaction-related costs, office-related expenses, facility costs, depreciation and amortization and software license costs. In the near term, we expect our general and administrative expense to increase on an absolute dollar basis as we continue to incur the costs associated with being a publicly traded company.\nInterest and Investment Income\nInterest income consists of interest earned on our cash balances held at financial institutions. Investment income consist of interest earned on our short-term investments which consist of U.S. treasuries, U.S. government agency obligations and money market funds.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense consists of interest on our outstanding debt obligations including amortization of debt discounts and offering costs.\nLoss on Extinguishment of Convertible Notes\nLoss on Extinguishment of Convertible Notes relates to the partial extinguishment of our 2022 Notes.\nOther Expense, Net\nOther expense, net consists primarily of realized foreign currency gains and losses.\nResults of Operations\nThe following tables set forth our results of operations for the periods presented and as a percentage of our total revenue for those periods. The results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 reflects the adoption of ASU 2016-02, Leases (\u201cTopic 842\u201d). See Note 18 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information. Financial data for the year ended December 31, 2018 does not reflect the adoption of Topic 842. The period-to-period comparison of our historical results is not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected in the future (in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31,\nRevenue\n$\n271,141\n$\n200,882\n$\n147,094\nCost of revenue(1)\n83,028\n63,535\n46,810\nGross profit\n188,113\n137,347\n100,284\nOperating expenses:\nSales and marketing(1)\n123,330\n87,731\n69,608\nResearch and development(1)\n62,512\n50,024\n41,305\nGeneral and administrative(1)\n74,485\n46,820\n31,462\nTotal operating expenses\n260,327\n184,575\n142,375\nOperating loss\n(72,214\n)\n(47,228\n)\n(42,091\n)\nOther expense, net\n(23,449\n)\n(4,597\n)\n(4,628\n)\nLoss before income taxes\n(95,663\n)\n(51,825\n)\n(46,719\n)\nBenefit from (provision for) income taxes\n2,267\n(425\n)\n(796\n)\nNet loss\n$\n(93,396\n)\n$\n(52,250\n)\n$\n(47,515\n)\n(1)\nIncludes stock-based compensation expense and depreciation and amortization of acquired intangible assets as follows (in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31,\nStock-based compensation expense:\nCost of revenue\n$\n2,954\n$\n1,966\n$\n2,306\nSales and marketing\n15,946\n9,983\n9,282\nResearch and development\n8,703\n7,820\n7,106\nGeneral and administrative\n19,152\n13,720\n7,131\nTotal\n$\n46,755\n$\n33,489\n$\n25,825\nYear Ended December 31,\nDepreciation and amortization expense:\nCost of revenue\n$\n12,165\n$\n9,434\n$\n7,741\nSales and marketing\nResearch and development\nGeneral and administrative\n17,065\n8,983\n5,259\nTotal\n$\n30,759\n$\n19,671\n$\n13,693\nThe following table sets forth our consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of revenue (1):\nYear Ended December 31,\nRevenue\n%\n%\n%\nCost of revenue\n%\n%\n%\nGross profit\n%\n%\n%\nOperating expenses:\nSales and marketing\n%\n%\n%\nResearch and development\n%\n%\n%\nGeneral and administrative\n%\n%\n%\nTotal operating expenses\n%\n%\n%\nOperating loss\n(27\n)%\n(24\n)%\n(29\n)%\nOther expense, net\n(9\n)%\n(2\n)%\n(3\n)%\nLoss before income taxes\n(35\n)%\n(26\n)%\n(32\n)%\nBenefit from (provision for) income taxes\n%\n*\n(1\n)%\nNet loss\n(34\n)%\n(26\n)%\n(32\n)%\n(1)\nColumns may not add up to 100% due to rounding.\n*\nRepresents less than 0.5% of revenue.\nYear Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2019\nRevenue\nYear Ended December 31,\nChange\n(dollars in thousands)\n$\n%\nRevenue\n$\n271,141\n$\n200,882\n$\n70,259\n35.0\n%\nRevenue increased by $70.3 million in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase was due to a $70.3 million increase in sales of our solutions driven by expansion of our customer base from 5,024 customers as of December 31, 2019 to 5,613 as of December 31, 2020, including increased sales to larger organizations with greater numbers of contacts and locations.\nCost of Revenue\nYear Ended December 31,\nChange\n(dollars in thousands)\n$\n%\nCost of revenue\n$\n83,028\n$\n63,535\n$\n19,493\n30.7\n%\nGross margin %\n%\n%\nCost of revenue increased by $19.5 million in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase was primarily due to a $10.6 million increase in employee-related costs, which includes stock-based compensation, associated with our increased headcount from 238 employees as of December 31, 2019 to 332 employees as of December 31, 2020 and a $5.8 million increase in hosting, software and messaging costs. The remaining increase was principally the result of a $2.7 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense attributable to our acquired intangible assets and a $0.4 million increase attributed to office related expenses to support revenue generating activities.\nGross margin percentage increased in 2020 as compared to 2019 due to revenue growth outpacing the increase in cost.\nOperating Expenses\nSales and Marketing Expense\nYear Ended December 31,\nChange\n(dollars in thousands)\n$\n%\nSales and marketing\n$\n123,330\n$\n87,731\n$\n35,599\n40.6\n%\n% of revenue\n%\n%\nSales and marketing expense increased by $35.6 million in 2020 compared to 2019.

The remaining increase was principally the result of a $3.0 million increase in trade show and advertising costs and a $2.1 million increase attributed to office related expenses to support the sales team.\nResearch and Development Expense\nYear Ended December 31,\nChange\n(dollars in thousands)\n$\n%\nResearch and development\n$\n62,512\n$\n50,024\n$\n12,488\n25.0\n%\n% of revenue\n%\n%\nResearch and development expense increased by $12.5 million in 2020 compared to 2019.

In addition, a total of $8.5 million of internally-developed software costs during 2020 and $6.5 million of internally-developed software costs during 2019 were capitalized, resulting in a $2.0 million offset to the increase during 2020.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense\nYear Ended December 31,\nChange\n(dollars in thousands)\n$\n%\nGeneral and administrative\n$\n74,485\n$\n46,820\n$\n27,665\n59.1\n%\n% of revenue\n%\n%\nGeneral and administrative expense increased by $27.7 million in 2020 compared to 2019.

The remaining increase was due to a $4.2 million increase in the change in fair value of contingent consideration obligation, a $2.8 million increase in office related expenses to support the administrative team, a $2.0 million increase in credit loss expense, a $1.2 million increase in software subscription costs and a $0.4 million increase in other general and administrative expenses.\nOther Expense, Net\nYear Ended December 31,\nChange\n(dollars in thousands)\n$\n%\nOther expense, net\n$\n23,449\n$\n4,597\n$\n18,852\n410.1\n%\n% of revenue\n%\n%\nOther expense, net increased by $18.9 million in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to a $16.7 million increase in interest expense related to our convertible senior notes and a decrease of $2.5 million of interest income due to lower interest rates on our investment balance, partially offset by a decrease of $1.0 million in losses related to the partial extinguishment and conversions of our 2022 Notes.\nIncome Taxes\nYear Ended December 31,\nChange\n(dollars in thousands)\n$\n%\nBenefit from (provision for) income taxes\n$\n2,267\n$\n(425\n)\n$\n2,692\n633.4\n%\n% of revenue\n%\n(0\n)%\nIncome tax expense decreased by $2.7 million in 2020 compared to 2019. During 2020, deferred tax liabilities were recognized in connection with the purchase price accounting for our acquisitions. Certain of such deferred tax liabilities will be a source of future taxable income to realize a portion of our deferred tax assets, which resulted in a tax benefit of approximately $1.5 million related to U.S. acquired entities and a tax benefit of approximately $1.8 million related to non-U.S. acquisitions recognized during 2020 which is the primary reason for the decrease in our income tax provision from 2019 to 2020.\nYear Ended December 31, 2019 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2018\nFor a discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, please refer to Part II, Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, filed with the SEC on February 28, 2020.\nOther Metrics\nWe regularly monitor a number of financial and operating metrics, including the following key metrics, to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate business plans, and make strategic decisions. Our other business metrics may be calculated in a manner different than similar other business metrics used by other companies (in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31,\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n8,044\n$\n5,170\n$\n(2,947\n)\nAdjusted gross margin\n195,224\n141,427\n103,858\nFree cash flow\n2,895\n(2,771\n)\n(6,925\n)\n\u2022\nAdjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA represents our net loss before interest and investment (income) expense, net, (benefit from) provision for income taxes, depreciation and amortization expense, loss on extinguishment of convertible notes, change in fair value of contingent consideration and stock-based compensation expense. We do not consider these items to be indicative of our core operating performance. The items that are non-cash include depreciation and amortization expense, loss on extinguishment of convertible notes, change in fair value of contingent consideration and stock-based compensation expense. Adjusted EBITDA is a measure used by management to understand and evaluate our core operating performance and trends and to generate future operating plans, make strategic decisions regarding the allocation of capital and invest in initiatives that are focused on cultivating new markets for our solutions. In particular, the exclusion of certain expenses in calculating adjusted EBITDA facilitates comparisons of our operating performance on a period-to-period basis. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d). We believe that adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management and board of directors. Nevertheless, use of adjusted EBITDA has\nlimitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our financial results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are: (1) although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the capitalized software that is amortized will need to be replaced in the future, and adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements; (2) adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; (3) adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the potentially dilutive impact of equity-based compensation; (4) adjusted EBITDA does not reflect tax payments or receipts that may represent a reduction or increase in cash available to us; and (5) other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate adjusted EBITDA or similarly titled measures differently, which reduces the usefulness of the metric as a comparative measure. Because of these and other limitations, you should consider adjusted EBITDA alongside our other GAAP-based financial performance measures, net loss and our other GAAP financial results.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to net loss, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, for each of the periods indicated (in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31,\nNet loss\n$\n(93,396\n)\n$\n(52,250\n)\n$\n(47,515\n)\nInterest and investment expense, net\n22,082\n2,979\n4,504\n(Benefit from) provision for income taxes\n(2,267\n)\nDepreciation and amortization\n30,759\n19,671\n13,693\nLoss on extinguishment of convertible notes\n1,406\n-\nChange in fair value of contingent consideration\n3,665\n(550\n)\n(250\n)\nStock-based compensation\n46,755\n33,489\n25,825\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n8,044\n$\n5,170\n$\n(2,947\n)\n\u2022\nAdjusted Gross Margin. Adjusted gross margin represents gross profit plus amortization of acquired intangibles and stock-based compensation. Adjusted gross margin is a measure used by management to understand and evaluate our core operating performance and trends and to generate future operating plans. The exclusion of stock-based compensation expense and amortization of acquired intangibles facilitates comparisons of our operating performance on a period-to-period basis. In the near term, we expect these expenses to continue to negatively impact our gross profit. Adjusted gross margin is not a measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. We believe that adjusted gross margin provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management and board of directors. Nevertheless, our use of adjusted gross margin has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our financial results as reported under GAAP. You should consider adjusted gross margin alongside our other GAAP-based financial performance measures, gross profit and our other GAAP financial results. The following table presents a reconciliation of adjusted gross margin to gross profit, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, for each of the periods indicated (in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31,\nGross profit\n$\n188,113\n$\n137,347\n$\n100,284\nAmortization of acquired intangibles\n4,157\n2,114\n1,268\nStock-based compensation\n2,954\n1,966\n2,306\nAdjusted gross margin\n$\n195,224\n$\n141,427\n$\n103,858\n\u2022\nFree Cash Flow. Free cash flow represents net cash from operating activities minus capital expenditures and capitalized software development costs. Free cash flow is a measure used by management to understand and evaluate our core operating performance and trends and to generate future operating plans. The exclusion of capital expenditures and amounts capitalized for internally-developed software facilitates comparisons of our operating performance on a period-to-period basis and excludes items that we do not consider to be indicative of our core operating performance. Free cash flow is not a measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. We believe that free cash flow provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management and board of directors. Nevertheless, our use of free cash flow has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our financial results as reported under GAAP. You should consider free cash flow alongside our other GAAP-based financial performance measures, net cash provided by operating activities, and our other GAAP financial results. The following table presents a reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash for operating activities, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, for each of the periods indicated (in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31,\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$\n15,803\n$\n10,317\n$\n3,295\nCapital expenditures\n(3,257\n)\n(5,269\n)\n(1,721\n)\nCapitalized software development costs\n(9,651\n)\n(7,819\n)\n(8,499\n)\nFree cash flow\n$\n2,895\n$\n(2,771\n)\n$\n(6,925\n)\nAdditional Supplemental Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, we provide investors with certain additional supplemental non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP cost of revenue, non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP sales and marketing expense, non-GAAP research and development expense, non-GAAP general and administrative expense, non-GAAP total operating expenses, non-GAAP operating loss and non-GAAP net income (loss), which we collectively refer to as non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude all or a combination of the following (as reflected in the following reconciliation tables): stock-based compensation expense, amortization of acquired intangibles, change in fair value of contingent consideration, accretion of interest on convertible senior notes and loss on extinguishment of convertible notes. The tax impact of such adjustments is not material. The presentation of the non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. We use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision-making purposes and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information about our operating results, enhance the overall understanding of past financial performance and future prospects and allow for greater transparency with respect to metrics used by our management in its financial and operational decision making. While our non-GAAP financial measures are an important tool for financial and operational decision making and for evaluating our own operating results over different periods of time, you should consider our non-GAAP financial measures alongside our GAAP financial results.\nWe exclude stock-based compensation expense which can vary based on plan design, share price, share price volatility, and the expected lives of equity instruments granted. We believe that providing non-GAAP financial measures that exclude stock-based compensation expense allow for more meaningful comparisons between our operating results from period to period because stock-based compensation expense does not represent a cash expenditure. We believe that excluding the impact of amortization of acquired intangibles allows for more meaningful comparisons between operating results from period to period as the intangibles are valued at the time of acquisition and are amortized over a period of several years after the acquisition. We believe that excluding the change in fair value of contingent consideration allows for more meaningful comparisons between operating results from period to period, as it is non-operating in nature. We believe that excluding the impact of accretion of interest on convertible senior notes allows for more meaningful comparisons between operating results from period to period\nas accretion of interest on convertible senior notes relates to interest cost for the time value of money and are non-operating in nature. We believe that excluding loss on extinguishment of convertible notes allows for more meaningful comparisons between operating results from period to period as losses on the extinguishment of convertible notes are non-operating in nature. We do not engage in the repurchase of convertible notes on a regular basis or in the ordinary course of business. Accordingly, we believe that excluding these expenses provides investors and management with greater visibility of the underlying performance of our business operations, facilitates comparison of our results with other periods and may also facilitate comparison with the results of other companies in our industry.\nThere are limitations in using non-GAAP financial measures because the non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies and exclude expenses that may have a material impact upon our reported financial results. Further, stock-based compensation expense has been and will continue to be for the foreseeable future a significant recurring expense in our business and an important part of the compensation provided to our employees.\nThe following table reconciles our GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures:\nYear Ended December 31,\nCost of revenue\n$\n83,028\n$\n63,535\n$\n46,810\nAmortization of acquired intangibles\n(4,157\n)\n(2,114\n)\n(1,268\n)\nStock-based compensation\n(2,954\n)\n(1,966\n)\n(2,306\n)\nNon-GAAP cost of revenue\n$\n75,917\n$\n59,455\n$\n43,236\nGross profit\n$\n188,113\n$\n137,347\n$\n100,284\nAmortization of acquired intangibles\n4,157\n2,114\n1,268\nStock-based compensation\n2,954\n1,966\n2,306\nNon-GAAP gross profit\n$\n195,224\n$\n141,427\n$\n103,858\nNon-GAAP gross margin\n72.00\n%\n70.40\n%\n70.61\n%\nSales and marketing\n$\n123,330\n$\n87,731\n$\n69,608\nStock-based compensation\n(15,946\n)\n(9,983\n)\n(9,282\n)\nNon-GAAP sales and marketing\n$\n107,384\n$\n77,748\n$\n60,326\nResearch and development\n$\n62,512\n$\n50,024\n$\n41,305\nStock-based compensation\n(8,703\n)\n(7,820\n)\n(7,106\n)\nNon-GAAP research and development\n$\n53,809\n$\n42,204\n$\n34,199\nGeneral and administrative\n$\n74,485\n$\n46,820\n$\n31,462\nAmortization of acquired intangibles\n(15,979\n)\n(8,301\n)\n(4,667\n)\nChange in fair value of contingent consideration\n(3,665\n)\nStock-based compensation\n(19,152\n)\n(13,720\n)\n(7,131\n)\nNon-GAAP general and administrative\n$\n35,689\n$\n25,349\n$\n19,914\nTotal operating expenses\n$\n260,327\n$\n184,575\n$\n142,375\nAmortization of acquired intangibles\n(15,979\n)\n(8,301\n)\n(4,667\n)\nChange in fair value of contingent consideration\n(3,665\n)\nStock-based compensation\n(43,801\n)\n(31,523\n)\n(23,519\n)\nNon-GAAP operating expenses\n$\n196,882\n$\n145,301\n$\n114,439\nOperating loss\n$\n(72,214\n)\n$\n(47,228\n)\n$\n(42,091\n)\nAmortization of acquired intangibles\n20,136\n10,415\n5,935\nChange in fair value of contingent consideration\n3,665\n(550\n)\n(250\n)\nStock-based compensation\n46,755\n33,489\n25,825\nNon-GAAP operating loss\n$\n(1,658\n)\n$\n(3,874\n)\n$\n(10,581\n)\nNet loss\n$\n(93,396\n)\n$\n(52,250\n)\n$\n(47,515\n)\nAmortization of acquired intangibles\n20,136\n10,415\n5,935\nChange in fair value of contingent consideration\n3,665\n(550\n)\n(250\n)\nStock-based compensation\n46,755\n33,489\n25,825\nAccretion of interest on convertible senior notes\n22,161\n5,711\n4,616\nLoss on extinguishment of convertible notes\n1,406\n-\nNon-GAAP net loss\n$\n(233\n)\n$\n(1,779\n)\n$\n(11,389\n)\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nTo date, we have financed our operations primarily through cash from sales to our customers, along with equity issuances and debt financing arrangements. Our principal source of liquidity is cash and cash equivalents totaling $467.2 million as of December 31, 2020. We have generated significant losses since inception and expect to continue to generate losses for the foreseeable future.\nWe believe that our cash and cash equivalent balances and the cash flows generated by our operations will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months. However, our belief may prove to be incorrect, and we could utilize our available financial resources sooner than we currently expect. We believe that our financial resources will allow us to manage the anticipated impact of COVID-19 on our business operations for the foreseeable future, which could include delays in payments from our customers. The challenges posed by COVID-19 on our business could evolve rapidly. We will continue to evaluate our financial position in light of future developments, particularly those relating to COVID-19. Our future capital requirements and the adequacy of available funds will depend on many factors, including those set forth in the section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K titled \u201cRisk Factors.\u201d We cannot assure you that we will be able to raise additional capital on acceptable terms or at all. In addition, if we fail to meet our operating plan during the next 12 months, our liquidity could be adversely affected.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows (in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31,\nCash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at beginning of period\n$\n539,662\n$\n60,068\n$\n103,051\nCash provided by operating activities\n15,803\n10,317\n3,295\nCash used in investing activities\n(85,185\n)\n(24,574\n)\n(48,413\n)\nCash provided by financing activities\n5,054\n494,101\n3,099\nEffects of exchange rates on cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash\n(250\n)\n(964\n)\nCash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at end of period\n$\n475,630\n$\n539,662\n$\n60,068\nAt December 31, 2020, $10.6 million of the $475.6 million of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash was held by foreign subsidiaries. Our intention is to indefinitely reinvest foreign earnings in our foreign subsidiaries. If these earnings were used to fund domestic operations, they would be subject to additional income taxes upon repatriation.\nSources of Funds\nFollow-On Public Offering\nIn January 2019, we completed a follow-on public offering in which we sold 2,645,000 shares of our common stock, which included 345,000 shares sold pursuant to the exercise by the underwriters of an option to purchase additional shares, at a public offering price of $55.25 per share. We received net proceeds of $139.1 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions.\nConvertible Senior Notes\nIn December 2019, we issued $450.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 2024 Notes, including $75.0 million in principal amount of Notes issued upon exercise in full by the initial purchasers of their option to purchase additional 2024 Notes.\nThe 2024 Notes have an initial conversion rate of 8.8999 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of 2024 Notes. This represents an initial effective conversion price of approximately $112.36 per share of common stock and approximately 4.0 million shares issuable upon conversion. Throughout the term of the 2024 Notes, the conversion rate may be adjusted upon the occurrence of certain events. Holders of the 2024 Notes will not receive any cash payment representing accrued and unpaid interest, if any, upon conversion of a 2024 Note, except in limited circumstances. Accrued but unpaid interest will be deemed to be paid by cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock paid or delivered, as the case may be, to the holder upon conversion of a 2024 Note.\nIn connection with the issuance of the 2024 Notes, we purchased capped call options that in the aggregate relate to the total number of shares of our common stock underlying the 2024 Notes, with an initial strike price of approximately $112.36 per share, which corresponds to the initial conversion price of the 2024 Notes and is subject to anti-dilution adjustments substantially similar to those applicable to the conversion rate of the 2024 Notes, and have a cap price of approximately $166.46. The cost of the purchased capped calls was $44.9 million.\nIn November 2017, we completed a public offering of $115.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 2022 Notes, including $15.0 million in principal amount of 2022 Notes issued upon exercise in full by the underwriters of their option to purchase additional 2022 Notes.\nThe 2022 Notes have an initial conversion rate of 29.6626 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of 2022 Notes. This represents an initial effective conversion price of approximately $33.71 per share of common stock and initially approximately 3.4 million shares issuable upon conversion. Throughout the term of the 2022 Notes, the conversion rate may be adjusted upon the occurrence of certain events. Holders of the 2022 Notes will not receive any cash payment representing accrued and unpaid interest, if any, upon conversion of a 2022 Note, except in limited circumstances. Accrued but unpaid interest will be deemed to be paid by cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock paid or delivered, as the case may be, to the holder upon conversion of a 2022 Note.\nIn connection with the issuance of the 2022 Notes, we purchased capped call options that in the aggregate relate to the total number of shares of our common stock underlying the 2022 Notes, with an initial strike price of approximately $33.71 per share, which corresponds to the initial conversion price of the 2022 Notes and is subject to anti-dilution adjustments substantially similar to those applicable to the conversion rate of the 2022 Notes, and have a cap price of approximately $47.20. The cost of the purchased capped calls was $12.9 million.\nBased on the market price of our common stock during the 30 trading days preceding June 30, 2018, the 2022 Notes were convertible at the option of the debt holder as of September 30, 2018 and continue to be convertible at the option of the debt holder as of December 31, 2020.\nDuring fiscal year 2019, we paid $57.8 million to repurchase $23.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 2022 Notes. We also partially terminated capped call options entered into in connection with the 2022 Notes during fiscal year 2019 and received $5.8 million.\nDuring fiscal year 2020, we issued 362,029 shares upon the conversion of approximately $12.2 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2022 Notes.\nUses of Funds\nOur historical uses of cash have primarily consisted of cash used for operating activities, such as expansion of our sales and marketing operations, research and development activities and other working capital needs.\nOperating Activities\nOur net loss and cash flows provided by or used in operating activities are significantly influenced by our investments in headcount and infrastructure to support our growth, marketing and sponsorship expenses, and our ability to bill and collect in a timely manner. Our net loss has been significantly greater than our use of cash for operating activities due to the inclusion of non-cash expenses and charges.\nOperating activities provided $15.8 million in net cash in 2020, primarily from $116.1 million in non-cash operating expenses, which was partially offset by our net loss of $93.4 million and by a $6.9 million decrease in changes in operating assets and liabilities. Specifically, we recognized non-cash charges aggregating $46.8 million for stock-based compensation expense, $30.8 million for depreciation and amortization of intangible assets, capitalized software development costs and property and equipment, $22.2 million of accretion on the convertible notes, $12.6 million in amortization of commissions, $3.7 million related to the change in fair value of contingent consideration, $3.1 million for the increase in our provision for credit losses and sales return reserve and a $0.4 million loss on extinguishment of convertible notes, offset by $3.5 million for deferred income taxes. The change in operating assets\nand liabilities reflected a $25.0 million increase in deferred revenue, a $22.6 million increase in accounts receivable, an $18.9 million increase in deferred costs due to timing of payments made for commissions, a $7.4 million increase in other liabilities, a $4.0 million increase in prepaid expenses, a $3.5 million increase in accrued employee-related expenses due to timing of payments, a $1.5 million increase in accounts payable due to the timing of payments made and a $1.1 million increase in accrued expenses due to timing of payments made to vendors, partially offset by a $0.1 million decrease in other assets.\nOperating activities provided $10.3 million in net cash in 2019, primarily from $68.2 million in non-cash operating expenses, which was partially offset by a $5.7 million decrease in changes in operating assets and liabilities and by our net loss of $52.3 million. Specifically, we recognized non-cash charges aggregating $33.5 million for stock-based compensation expense, $19.7 million for depreciation and amortization of intangible assets, capitalized software development costs and property and equipment, $8.0 million in amortization of commissions, $5.7 million of accretion on the convertible notes, $1.4 million loss on extinguishment of convertible notes and $0.7 million for the increase in our provision for credit losses and sales return reserve, offset by $0.6 million related to the change in fair value of contingent consideration. The change in operating assets and liabilities reflected a $25.6 million increase in accounts receivable, a $15.3 million increase in deferred cost due to timing of payments made for commissions, a $3.5 million increase in prepaid expenses, a $1.4 million decrease in other liabilities, and a $1.3 million decrease in accrued expenses due to timing of payments made to vendors. These changes were partially offset by a $29.7 million increase in deferred revenue, a $5.3 million increase in accounts payable due to the timing of payments made, a $4.5 million increase in accrued employee-related expenses due to timing of payments and a $1.8 million decrease in other assets.\nInvesting Activities\nOur investing activities consist primarily of capital expenditures for capitalized software development costs, business acquisitions, property and equipment expenses and purchase and sales of short-term investments.\nInvesting activities used $85.2 million in 2020, which consisted primarily of $55.1 million of cash paid for the acquisitions of Connexient, CNL Software, one2many, Techwan and SnapComms, $17.1 million of cash paid for the purchase of intangible assets, $9.7 million of investment in software development and $3.3 million in purchases of property and equipment.\nInvesting activities used $24.6 million in 2019, which consisted primarily of our acquisitions of NC4 Inc. and NC4 Public Sector LLC (collectively, \u201cNC4\u201d) and MissionMode Solutions, Inc. for an aggregate of $58.4 million, investment in software development of $7.8 million, our purchase of property and equipment of $5.3 million, and purchase of short-term investments of $2.0 million. These were offset by cash provided of $47.8 million in maturities of our short-term investments and $1.1 million attributed to a landlord reimbursement.\nFinancing Activities\nCash generated by financing activities includes proceeds from the issuance of common stock from our follow-on public offering, borrowings under the 2024 Notes and 2022 Notes, proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and contributions to our employee stock purchase plan. Cash used in financing activities includes payments for debt and offering issuance costs, extinguishment of debt, payment of contingent consideration and employee withholding liabilities from the exercise of market based restricted stock units.\nFinancing activities provided $5.1 million of cash in 2020, which reflects $8.2 million from the exercise of stock options and $3.4 million from the issuance of stock under our employee stock purchase plan. These amounts were offset by a $6.4 million payment for restricted stock unit employee withholding taxes.\nFinancing activities provided $494.1 million of cash in 2019, which reflects proceeds of $392.4 million from our 2024 Notes offering after deducting debt issuance cost and the cost for the capped call transactions entered into in connection with the note offering, $139.1 million from our common stock offering, $17.4 million from the exercise of stock options and $2.3 million from the issuance of stock under our employee stock purchase plan. These amounts were offset by a $52.0 million payment for the 20 percent repurchase of our 2022 Notes offset by cash received for\nthe partial termination of the 2022 Notes capped call options and a $4.6 million payment for restricted stock unit employee withholding taxes.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nThe following table summarizes our commitments to settle contractual obligations as of December 31, 2020 (in thousands):\nLess than\n1 Year\n1 to 3\nYears\n3 to 5\nYears\nMore than\n5 Years\nTotal\nDebt obligations (1)\n$\n-\n$\n79,795\n$\n450,000\n$\n-\n$\n529,795\nOperating leases (2)\n5,558\n10,373\n3,564\n2,769\n22,264\n$\n5,558\n$\n90,168\n$\n453,564\n$\n2,769\n$\n552,059\n(1)\nDebt obligations include the principal amount of the 2024 Notes and 2022 Notes but exclude interest payments to be made under the 2024 Notes and 2022 Notes. Although the 2024 Notes and 2022 Notes mature in 2024 and 2022, respectively, they can be converted into cash and shares of our common stock prior to maturity if certain conditions are met. Any conversion prior to maturity can result in repayments of the principal amounts sooner than the scheduled repayments as indicated in the table. The 2024 Notes and 2022 Notes balance excludes $81.0 million and $7.3 million, respectively, of debt discount capitalized on our balance sheet and shown net of our debt obligations. Please see Note 9 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for more information on the terms of the 2024 Notes and 2022 Notes.\n(2)\nOperating leases include total future minimum rent payments under non-cancelable operating lease agreements as described in Note 18 of our consolidated financial statements.\nThe commitment amounts are associated with contracts that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum services to be used, fixed, minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the actions under the contracts. The commitment amounts do not include obligations under agreements that we can cancel without a significant penalty.\nBacklog\nWe generally sell all of our critical communications applications on a subscription basis. We generally enter into contracts that range from one to three years in length, with an average contract duration of 1.9 years as of December 31, 2020, and generally bill and collect payment annually in advance. Since we bill many of our customers at the beginning of each contract year, there can be amounts that we have not yet been contractually able to invoice. Until such time as these amounts are invoiced, they are not recorded in revenue, deferred revenue or elsewhere in our consolidated financial statements. We expect that the amount of backlog relative to the total value of our subscription agreements will change from year to year for several reasons, including the specific timing and duration of customer agreements, varying invoicing cycles of agreements, the specific timing of customer renewals and changes in customer financial circumstances. In addition, because revenue for any period is a function of revenue recognized from deferred revenue under contracts in existence at the beginning of the period, as well as contracts that are renewed and new customer contracts that are entered into during the period, backlog at the beginning of any period is not necessarily indicative of future performance. Our presentation of backlog may also differ from that of other companies in our industry. Due to these factors, as well as variances in billing arrangements with customers, we do not utilize backlog as a key management metric internally.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, including entities sometimes referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities that were established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. We do not engage in off-balance sheet financing arrangements. In addition, we do not engage in trading activities involving non-exchange traded contracts.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of revenue, assets, liabilities, costs and expenses. We base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our actual results may differ from these estimates. Our most critical accounting policies are summarized below.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe derive our revenues primarily from subscription services and professional services. We recognize revenue in accordance with FASB ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. We determine revenue recognition through the following steps:\n\u2022\nidentification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer;\n\u2022\nidentification of the performance obligations in the contract;\n\u2022\ndetermination of the transaction price;\n\u2022\nallocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and\n\u2022\nrecognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation.\nSubscription Services Revenues\nSubscription services revenues primarily consist of fees that provide customers access to one or more of our hosted applications for critical event management, with routine customer support. Revenue is generally recognized over time on a ratable basis over the contract term beginning on the date that our service is made available to the customer. All services are recognized using an output measure of progress looking at time elapsed as the contract generally provides the customer equal benefit throughout the contract period. Our subscription contracts are generally two years or longer in length, billed annually in advance, and non-cancelable.\nProfessional Services Revenues\nProfessional services revenues primarily consist of fees for deployment and optimization services, as well as training. The majority of our consulting contracts revenue is recognized over time as the services are performed. For contracts billed on a fixed price basis, revenue is recognized over time based on the proportion performed.\nSoftware License Revenues\nOn occasion we may sell software and related post contract support for on premises usage as well as professional services, hardware and hosting which is outside of our core business and is not a significant revenue stream for us. Our on premises license transactions are generally perpetual in nature and are recognized at a point in time when made available to the customer for use. Significant judgment is required to determine the standalone selling prices for each distinct performance obligation in order to allocate the transaction price for purposes of revenue recognition. Making this judgment of estimating a standalone selling price involves consideration of overall pricing objectives, market conditions and other factors, including the value of our other similar contracts, the applications sold, customer demographics, geographic locations, and the number and types of users within our contracts. The significant judgment was primarily due to using such considerations to estimate the price that each distinct performance obligation would be sold for on a standalone basis because such performance obligations are typically sold together on a bundled basis. Changes in these estimates of standalone selling prices can have a material effect on the amount of revenue recognized from each distinct performance obligation.\nContracts with Multiple Performance Obligations\nMost of our contracts with customers contain multiple performance obligations. For these contracts, we account for individual performance obligations separately if they are distinct. The transaction price is allocated to the separate performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price basis for those performance obligations with stable observable prices and then the residual method applied for any performance obligation that has pricing which is highly variable. We determine the standalone selling prices based on our overall pricing objectives, taking into consideration market conditions and other factors, including the value of our contracts, pricing when certain services are sold on a standalone basis, the applications sold, customer demographics, geographic locations, and the volume of services and users purchased.\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nAllowance for credit risk for accounts receivables and contract assets is established based on various factors including credit profiles of our customers, historical payments and current economic trends. We review the allowance for accounts receivables and contract assets by assessing individual accounts receivable or unbilled contract assets over a specific aging and amount. All other balances are pooled based on historical collection experience. The estimate of expected credit losses is based on information about past events, current economic conditions, and forecasts of future economic conditions that affect the collectability. Accounts receivable and contract assets are written-off on a case by case basis, net of any amounts that may be collected. If our estimate of uncollectible accounts is too low, credit loss expense may increase in future periods, and if it is too high, credit loss expense may decrease in future periods.\nDeferred Costs\nSales commissions earned by our sales force are considered incremental and recoverable costs of obtaining a contract with a customer. These costs are deferred and then amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of benefit that we have determined to be four years. Sales commissions attributable to professional services are expensed within twelve months of selling the service to the customer. We determined the period of benefit by taking into consideration our customer contracts, our technology and other factors. Amortization of deferred commissions is included in sales and marketing expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe recognize compensation expense for option awards and restricted stock unit awards (\u201cRSUs\u201d) based on the fair value of the award and on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the award based on the estimated portion of the award that is expected to vest.\nInherent in the valuation and recording of stock-based compensation for option awards, are several estimates that we made in regard to valuation and expense that will be incurred. We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to measure the fair value of our option awards when they are granted. For RSUs, our board of directors determines the fair value based on the closing price of our common stock as reported on the Nasdaq Global Market on the date of grant. We primarily use the daily historical volatility of companies we consider to be our peers. To determine our peer companies, we use the following criteria: software or software-as-a-service companies; similar histories and relatively comparable financial leverage; sufficient public company trading history; and in similar businesses and geographical markets. We use the peers\u2019 stock price volatility over the expected life of our granted options to calculate the expected volatility. The expected term of employee option awards is determined using the average midpoint between vesting and the contractual term for outstanding awards, because we do not yet have a sufficient history of option exercises. We consider this appropriate as we expect to see changes to our equity structure in the future and there is no other method that would be more indicative of exercise activity. The risk-free interest rate is based on the rate on U.S. Treasury securities with maturities consistent with the estimated expected term of the awards. We have not paid dividends and do not anticipate paying a cash dividend in the foreseeable future and, accordingly, use an expected dividend yield of zero.\nWe grant performance-based RSUs (\u201cPSUs\u201d), that vest upon satisfaction of certain performance-based conditions. The PSUs generally vest based on us achieving certain revenue growth thresholds. The vesting of the PSUs is\nsubject to the employee\u2019s continued employment with us through the date of achievement. The fair value is based on the value of our common stock at the date of issuance and the probability of achieving the performance metric. We have assessed the probability of achievement of the award as highly probable based on past performance of achievement of the performance metric. Compensation cost is recognized under the accelerated method and is adjusted in future periods for subsequent changes in the expected outcome of the performance related conditions.\nIn 2018, we granted market-based RSUs that vest upon satisfaction of certain market-based conditions. These RSUs were valued using the Monte-Carlo simulation model. These RSUs vested based on our common stock achieving certain stock price thresholds. The fair value was based on values calculated under the Monte Carlo simulation model on the grant date. We recognized the compensation expense associated with the market-based RSUs over the implied requisite service period subject to acceleration based on meeting the market-based condition. No market-based RSUs were granted during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nBusiness Combinations\nThe results of businesses acquired in a business combination are included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of the acquisition. Purchase accounting results in assets and liabilities of an acquired business being recorded at their estimated fair values on the acquisition date. Any excess consideration over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recognized as goodwill.\nWe perform valuations of assets acquired and liabilities assumed on each acquisition accounted for as a business combination in order to record the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on our best estimate of fair value. Determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management to use significant judgment and estimates including the selection of valuation methodologies, estimates of future revenue and cash flows, discount rates and selection of comparable companies. Significant estimation is required in determining the fair value of the customer relationship intangible assets, deferred revenue and contingent consideration liabilities. The significant estimation is primarily due to the judgmental nature of the inputs to the valuation models used to measure the fair value of these intangible assets, deferred revenue and contingent consideration liabilities, as well as the sensitivity of the respective fair values to the underlying significant assumptions. We use the income approach to measure the fair value of these intangible assets, a discounted cash flow approach for deferred revenue and a Monte Carlo simulation model to measure the fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities. The significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value of the intangible assets, deferred revenue and contingent consideration liabilities included forecasted revenues from existing customers, existing customer attrition rates, estimated costs required to fulfill the deferred revenue obligation and forecasted revenues for the contingent consideration earnout period. When estimating the significant assumptions to be used in the valuation we include a consideration of current industry information, market and economic trends, historical results of the acquired business, nature of the performance obligations associated with the deferred revenue and other relevant factors. These significant assumptions are forward-looking and could be affected by future economic and market conditions. We engage the assistance of valuation specialists in concluding on fair value measurements in connection with determining fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination.\nThe valuation of the contingent consideration is derived using estimates of the probability of achievement within specified time periods based on projections of future revenue metrics per the terms of the applicable agreements. These include estimates of our assessment of the probability of meeting such results, with the probability-weighted earn-out using a Monte Carlo Simulation Model then discounted to estimate fair value. Fair value is estimated using the probability weighted cash flow estimate closer to the measurement date. The various operating performance measures included in these contingent consideration agreements primarily relate to product revenue.\nTransaction costs associated with business combinations are expensed as incurred and are included in general and administrative expense in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\nGoodwill Impairment\nGoodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price paid over the fair value of the net assets acquired in our business combinations. Goodwill is not amortized and is tested for impairment at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. We performed our\nannual impairment assessment on November 30, 2020. We operate under one reporting unit and as a result, evaluate goodwill impairment based on our fair value as a whole.\nTo determine the number of operating segments and reporting units that are present, we analyzed whether there is any customer, product or geographic information that drives the chief operating decision maker\u2019s (our chief executive officer) decisions on how to allocate resources and whether any segment management exists. Management has concluded that operating decisions are made at the consolidated company level and there is no segment management in place that reviews results of operations with the chief operating decision maker.\nIn assessing goodwill for impairment, an entity has the option to assess qualitative factors to determine whether events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying value, then performing the two-step impairment test is unnecessary. An entity can choose not to perform a qualitative assessment for any of its reporting units and proceed directly to the use of the two-step impairment test.\nWhen assessing goodwill for impairment for the year ended December 31, 2020, we first performed a qualitative assessment to determine whether it was necessary to perform the two-step quantitative analysis. Based on the qualitative assessment we determined it was unlikely that our reporting unit fair value was less than its carrying value and the two-step impairment test was not required. Based on the results of our most recent annual qualitative assessment performed on November 30, 2020, there was no impairment of goodwill recorded.\nCapitalized Software Development Costs\nWe capitalize certain costs related to the development of our platform and other software applications for internal use. In accordance with authoritative guidance, we begin to capitalize our costs to develop software when preliminary development efforts are successfully completed, management has authorized and committed project funding, and it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used as intended. We stop capitalizing these costs when the software is substantially complete and ready for its intended use, including the completion of all significant testing. These costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the related asset, generally estimated to be three years. We also capitalize costs related to specific upgrades and enhancements when it is probable the expenditure will result in additional functionality and expense costs incurred for maintenance and minor upgrades and enhancements. Costs incurred prior to meeting these criteria together with costs incurred for training and maintenance are expensed as incurred and recorded within product development expenses in our consolidated statements of operations. We exercise judgment in determining the point at which various projects may be capitalized, in assessing the ongoing value of the capitalized costs and in determining the estimated useful lives over which the costs are amortized. To the extent that we change the manner in which we develop and test new features and functionalities related to our platform, assess the ongoing value of capitalized assets or determine the estimated useful lives over which the costs are amortized, the amount of internal-use software development costs we capitalize and amortize could change in future periods.\nConvertible Senior Notes\nSignificant judgment is required in determining the liability component of the related convertible senior notes as well as the balance sheet classification of the elements of the convertible senior notes. We accounted for the convertible senior notes, the partial repurchase of the 2022 Notes in 2019 and 2022 Note conversions in 2020 as separate liability and equity components, determining the fair value of the respective liability components based on an estimate of the fair value of a similar liability without a conversion option and assigning the residual value to the equity component.\nWe estimated the fair value of the liability component of the convertible senior notes using a discounted cash flow model with a risk adjusted yield for similar debt instruments, absent any embedded conversion feature. In estimating the risk adjusted yield, we utilized both an income and market approach. For the income approach, we used a convertible bond pricing model, which included several assumptions including volatility and the risk-free rate. For the market approach, we performed an evaluation of issuances of convertible debt securities issued by other comparable companies. Additionally, a detailed analysis of the terms of the convertible senior notes transactions was\nrequired to determine existence of any derivatives that may require separate mark-to-market accounting under applicable accounting guidance.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nFor information regarding recent accounting pronouncements, refer to Note 2 of our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.",
    "item_7A": "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\nMarket risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates. Our market risk exposure is primarily the result of fluctuations in interest rates and foreign exchange rates as well as, to a lesser extent, inflation.\nInterest Rate Risk\nOur investment portfolio is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates. The fair market value of fixed rate securities may be adversely impacted by fluctuations in interest rates while income earned on floating rate securities may decline as a result of decreases in interest rates. Under our current policies, we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes. We attempt to ensure the safety and preservation of our invested principal funds by limiting default risk, market risk and reinvestment risk. We mitigate default risk by investing in investment grade securities. We have historically maintained a relatively short average maturity for our investment portfolio, and we believe a hypothetical 100 basis point adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would not change the fair value of our interest sensitive financial instruments by a material amount. In addition, if a 100-basis point change in overall interest rates were to occur in 2020, our interest income would not change significantly in relation to amounts we would expect to earn, based on our cash, cash equivalents, and investments as of December 31, 2020.\nChanges in interest rates may also impact gains or losses from the conversion of our outstanding convertible senior notes. In December 2019, we issued $450 million in aggregate principal amount of our 2024 Notes. In November 2017, we issued $115 million in aggregate principal amount of our 2022 Notes, of which $79.8 million remain outstanding. The 2024 Notes and 2022 Notes are convertible under certain circumstances, including trading price conditions related to our common stock, and upon conversion, we will pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of our common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock in each case under certain circumstances, including trading price conditions related to our common stock. In the second quarter of 2018, the trading price of our common stock reached a price for a sustained period at 130% above the conversion price of $33.71, resulting in the 2022 Notes becoming convertible at the option of the holder during the third quarter of 2018. The 2022 Notes were still convertible at the option of the holder at December 31, 2020. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we issued 362,029 shares upon the conversion of approximately $12.2 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2022 Notes. The 2024 Notes were not convertible during the year ended December 31, 2020. Upon conversion, we are required to record a gain or loss for the difference between the fair value of the debt to be extinguished and its corresponding net carrying value. The fair value of the debt to be extinguished depends on our then-current incremental borrowing rate. If our incremental borrowing rate at the time of conversion is higher or lower than the implied interest rate of the 2024 Notes and 2022 Notes, we will record a gain or loss in our consolidated statement of operations during the period in which the 2024 Notes and 2022 Notes are converted. An incremental borrowing rate that is a hypothetical 100 basis points lower than the implicit interest rate upon conversion of the 2024 Notes and 2022 Notes would result in a loss of approximately $5.3 million.\nWe are exposed to interest rate risk in the ordinary course of our business. Our cash, cash equivalents and investments include cash in readily available checking and money market accounts and marketable securities. These securities are not dependent on interest rate fluctuations that may cause the principal amount of these assets to fluctuate.\nWe had cash and cash equivalents of $467.2 million as of December 31, 2020, which consisted of bank deposits and money market funds. To date, fluctuations in interest income have not been significant.\nWe do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes and have not used any derivative financial instruments to manage our interest rate risk exposure.\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk\nWe have foreign currency risks related to our revenue and operating expenses denominated in currencies other than our functional currency, the U.S. dollar, principally British Pounds, Euro, Norwegian Krone, Swedish Kronor and other foreign currencies. Movements in foreign currencies in which we transact business could significantly affect future net earnings. We do not currently engage in any hedging activity to reduce our potential exposure to currency fluctuations, although we may choose to do so in the future. A hypothetical 10% change in foreign exchange rates during any of the periods presented would not have had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. As our international operations grow, we will continue to reassess our approach to manage our risk relating to fluctuations in foreign currency rate.\nInflation Risk\nWe do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. If our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases. Our inability or failure to do so could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.",

Controls and Procedures.\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nWe maintain \u201cdisclosure controls and procedures,\u201d as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act,\u201d) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC\u2019s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company\u2019s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nOur management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based on such evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level as of December 31, 2020.\nManagement\u2019s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe are responsible for establishing and maintaining internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act).\nOur management, under the supervision and with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020. In making this assessment, our management used the Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) as issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO) of the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting is effective as of December 31, 2020.\nDuring 2020, we completed the acquisitions of Connexient, CNL Software, one2many, Techwan and SnapComms (the \u201cAcquisitions\u201d). As permitted by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, we excluded the Acquisitions from our assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, since it was not practical for management to conduct an assessment of internal control over financial reporting for these entities between the acquisition dates and the date of management's assessment. Excluded from our assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020 were total assets and net revenues of approximately 8% of each of our consolidated total assets and net revenues as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nThis Annual Report includes an attestation report regarding our internal control over financial reporting by our registered public accounting firm, which appears in the appendix to this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nInherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls\nOur management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our global organization have been detected. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rules 13(a)-15(d) and 15d-15(d) under the Exchange Act that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2020 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, our employees began working from home starting in March 2020. Management is continually monitoring and assessing the COVID-19 situation on our internal controls to minimize the impact to their design and operating effectiveness.",

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nPage\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nConsolidated Financial Statements:\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\nConsolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss\nConsolidated Statements of Stockholders\u2019 Equity\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Everbridge, Inc.\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Everbridge, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, stockholders\u2019 equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the \u201cconsolidated financial statements\u201d). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 26, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nAccounting for Acquisitions\nDescription of the Matter\nAs described in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company completed five acquisitions in 2020 (the 2020 Acquisitions) for total consideration of $118.5 million consisting of a combination of cash, stock and future contingent earnout payments. The acquisitions were accounted for as business combinations. The recognition, measurement and disclosure of the Company\u2019s business combinations in the 2020 consolidated financial statements was considered especially challenging and required significant auditor judgment due to the complex nature in the determination by management of the appropriate assumptions and related valuation models for the valuation of acquired assets and assumed liabilities, including, but not limited to, customer relationship intangible assets, deferred revenue and contingent consideration liabilities. The financial statement accounts primarily affected by these transactions were intangible assets, goodwill, contingent consideration liabilities and deferred revenue.\nAuditing the Company's accounting for the 2020 Acquisitions was especially challenging due to the significant estimation required by management in determining the fair value of the customer relationship intangible assets, deferred revenue and contingent consideration liabilities of $34.8 million, $12.0 million and $6.3 million, respectively. The significant estimation was primarily due to the judgmental nature of the inputs to the valuation models used to measure the fair value of these intangible assets, deferred revenue and contingent consideration liabilities, as well as the sensitivity of the respective fair values to the underlying significant assumptions. The Company used the income approach to measure the fair value of these intangible assets, a discounted cash flow approach for deferred revenue and a Monte Carlo simulation model to measure the fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities. The significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value of the intangible assets, deferred revenue and contingent consideration liabilities included forecasted revenues from existing customers, existing customer attrition rates, estimated costs required to fulfill the deferred revenue obligation and forecasted revenues for the contingent consideration earnout period. When estimating the significant assumptions to be used in the valuation the Company including a consideration of current industry information, market and economic trends, historical results of the acquired business, nature of the performance obligations associated with the deferred revenue and other relevant factors. These significant assumptions are forward-looking and could be affected by future economic and market conditions.\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of the controls over the Company\u2019s accounting for acquisitions. We tested controls over the valuation of intangible assets, deferred revenue and contingent consideration liabilities, including the valuation models and underlying assumptions used to develop such estimates.\nTo test the fair value of the acquired intangible assets, deferred revenue and contingent consideration liabilities, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the significant assumptions used, and the testing of the completeness and accuracy of underlying data. We tested the valuation models used to value the acquired intangible assets, deferred revenue and contingent consideration liabilities including consideration of the nature and classification of such contingent liabilities. Our testing procedures over the significant assumptions included, among others, comparing them to current industry, market and economic trends, historical results of the acquired business and to other relevant factors. We also performed sensitivity analyses of the significant assumptions to evaluate the change in the fair value resulting from changes in the assumptions.\nAccounting for Software Revenue Contracts\nDescription of the Matter\nDuring fiscal year 2020, the Company had a significant contract to sell software licenses, hardware, hosting, post contract support and professional services to a customer for which a portion was delivered in fiscal year 2020 and for which the revenue recognition accounting policy is discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. The financial statement accounts primarily affected by this transaction were revenue and deferred revenue.\nAuditing these accounts was especially challenging because of the significant judgment required by management to determine the standalone selling prices for each distinct performance obligation in order to allocate the transaction price for purposes of revenue recognition. Making this judgment of estimating a standalone selling price involves consideration of overall pricing objectives, market conditions and other factors, including the value of the Company\u2019s other similar contracts, the applications sold, customer demographics, geographic locations and the number and types of users within the Company\u2019s contracts. The significant judgment was primarily due to using such considerations to estimate the price that each distinct performance obligation would be sold for on a standalone basis because such performance obligations are typically sold together on a bundled basis. Changes in these estimates of standalone selling prices can have a material effect on the amount of revenue recognized from each distinct performance obligation.\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the revenue recognition process for software licenses, including controls over the determination of standalone selling prices for distinct performance obligations.\nOur audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the Company\u2019s judgments related to the estimate of standalone selling price of each performance obligation. We tested management\u2019s estimate of stand-alone selling price of each performance obligation, including an evaluation of the assumptions applied by the Company in the estimates by comparing those significant assumptions to the Company\u2019s overall pricing objectives, market conditions and other factors, including the value of the Company\u2019s other similar contracts, the applications sold, customer demographics, geographic locations and the number and types of users within the Company\u2019s contracts. We met with the project managers to discuss and evaluate those estimates. We also performed a sensitivity analysis of the significant assumptions to evaluate the impact that the change in the standalone selling price of each identified performance obligation resulting from changes in the assumptions would have on revenue recognized during the period.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nWe have served as the Company\u2019s auditor since 2018.\nBoston, Massachusetts\nFebruary 26, 2021\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Everbridge, Inc.\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Everbridge, Inc. and Subsidiaries\u2019 internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Everbridge, Inc. and Subsidiaries (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on the COSO criteria.\nAs indicated in the accompanying Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management\u2019s assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of Connexient, CNL Software, one2many, Techwan and SnapComms, which are included in the 2020 consolidated financial statements of the Company and constituted 8% and 8%, respectively, of consolidated total assets and net revenue as of December 31, 2020 and for the year then ended. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of the Company also did not include an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of Connexient, CNL Software, one2many, Techwan and SnapComms.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, stockholders\u2019 equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the \u201cconsolidated financial statements\u201d), and our report dated February 26, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company\u2019s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management\u2019s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nBoston, Massachusetts\nFebruary 26, 2021\nEVERBRIDGE, INC.

The Company\u2019s SaaS-based platform enables the Company\u2019s customers to manage and mitigate critical events. The Company\u2019s enterprise applications, such as Mass Notification, Safety Connection, Incident Management, IT Alerting, Visual Command Center, Public Warning, Community Engagement, Risk Center, Crisis Management, Secure Collaboration, and Control Center, automate numerous critical event management processes. The Company generates revenue primarily from subscription fees to the Company\u2019s enterprise applications. The Company has operations in the United States, United Kingdom, Norway, China, Netherlands, India and other countries.\n(2) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the Company\u2019s results of operations and those of its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. The Company\u2019s accounting and financial reporting policies conform to generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d).\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Business acquisitions are included in the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements from the date of the acquisition. The Company\u2019s purchase accounting resulted in all assets and liabilities of acquired businesses being recorded at their estimated fair values on the acquisition dates.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nEverbridge, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued)\nAssets and liabilities which are subject to judgment and use of estimates include the determination of the period of benefit for deferred commissions, relative stand-alone selling price for identified performance obligations in our revenue transactions, allowances for credit losses, the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations, the fair value of contingent consideration, the recoverability of goodwill and long-lived assets, valuation allowances with respect to deferred tax assets, useful lives associated with property and equipment and intangible assets, contingencies, and the valuation and assumptions underlying stock-based compensation. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates compared to historical experience and trends, which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities. In addition, the Company engages valuation specialists to assist with management\u2019s determination of the valuation of its fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations, convertible senior notes, and certain market-based performance equity awards. There have been significant changes to the global economic situation as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic. The global outbreak continues to cause instability and volatility in multiple markets where the Company conducts business which could cause changes to estimates as a result of the financial circumstances. Such changes to estimates could potentially result in impacts that would be material to the consolidated financial statements, particularly with respect to the timing of revenue recognition resulting from potential implementation delays, evaluating the recoverability of long-lived assets with finite useful lives for impairment and estimates of credit losses for accounts receivables and contract assets. No impairments were recorded as of the balance sheet date; however, due to significant uncertainty surrounding the situation, management's judgment regarding this could change in the future. As of the date of issuance of these financial statements, the Company\u2019s results of operations have not been significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic; however, the Company continues to monitor the situation.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nASU No. 2016-02\nIn February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), to require lessees to recognize most leases on the balance sheet, while recognition on the statement of operations will remain similar to current lease accounting. The ASU requires lessees to recognize a liability for lease obligations, which represents the discounted obligation to make future lease payments, and a corresponding right-of-use (\u201cROU\u201d) asset on the balance sheet. The guidance requires disclosure of key information about leasing arrangements that is intended to enable the assessment of the amount, timing and potential uncertainty of cash flows related to leases. The ASU also eliminates real estate-specific provisions and modifies certain aspects of lessor accounting.\nThe Company adopted the standard on January 1, 2019 using the modified retrospective approach. The Company elected to apply the transition method that allows companies to continue applying the guidance under the lease standard in effect at that time in the comparative periods presented in the consolidated financial statements and recognize a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings on the date of adoption. The Company also elected the \u201cpackage of practical expedients\u201d, which permits the Company not to reassess under the new standard its prior conclusions about lease identification, lease classification and initial direct costs.\nResults for reporting periods beginning after January 1, 2019 are presented under the new standard, while prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for the prior period. Upon adoption of the new lease standard, on January 1, 2019, the Company capitalized ROU assets of $14.7 million and $16.9 million of lease liabilities, within the Company\u2019s consolidated balance sheets upon adoption. Additionally, the Company reversed its deferred rent liability of $2.2 million, which upon adoption became a component of the ROU asset. The adoption of this standard did not have an impact on the Company\u2019s consolidated statement of operations or cash flows and did not result in a cumulative catch-up adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings.\nASU 2016-13\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13 (as amended through March 2020), Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. ASU 2016-13 introduced a new forward-looking approach, based on expected losses, to estimate credit losses on certain types of financial instruments, including trade receivables, contract assets and held-to-maturity debt securities, which requires the Company to incorporate considerations of historical information, current information and reasonable and supportable forecasts. ASU 2016-13 also expands disclosure requirements.\nThe Company adopted the standard on January 1, 2020 using the modified retrospective approach. Adoption of ASU 2016-13 resulted in changes to the Company\u2019s accounting policies for trade and other receivables and contract assets. Upon adoption of ASU 2016-13 the Company evaluates trade receivables and contract assets on a collective (i.e., pool) basis if they share similar risk characteristics.\nBased on the results of the Company\u2019s evaluation, the adoption of ASU 2016-13 did not have a material impact on the reserve for credit losses as of January 1, 2020. Adoption of the standard had no impact on total cash provided from or used in operating, financing, or investing activities in the Company\u2019s condensed consolidated statements of cash flows.\nASU 2018-13\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, Disclosure Framework - Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurements, which eliminates, adds and modifies certain disclosure requirements for fair value measurements as part of the FASB\u2019s disclosure framework project. The guidance includes retrospective and prospective basis application dependent on the requirements of specific amendments. The Company adopted ASU\nEverbridge, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued)\n2018-13 on January 1, 2020 on a prospective basis. The adoption of this standard did not have an impact on the Company\u2019s condensed consolidated financial statements.\nASU 2018-15\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-15, Customer's Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That Is a Service Contract, related to a customer's accounting for implementation, set-up, and other upfront costs incurred in a cloud computing arrangement (\u201cCCA\u201d). Under the new guidance, implementation costs associated with a CCA for a hosting arrangement that is a service contract are accounted for consistent with existing internal-use software implementation guidance. ASU 2018-15 also provides classification guidance on these implementation costs as well as additional quantitative and qualitative disclosures. The Company adopted ASU 2018-15 on January 1, 2020 on a prospective basis. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company\u2019s condensed consolidated financial statements.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nASU 2020-01\nIn January 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-01, Clarifying the Interactions Between Topic 321, Topic 323, and Topic 815. ASU 2020-01 addresses the accounting for the transition into and out of the equity method and measuring certain purchased options and forward contracts to acquire investments. Observable transactions that require a company to either apply or discontinue the equity method of accounting for the purposes of applying the measurement alternative in accordance with FASB Accounting Standards Codification (\u201cASC\u201d) 321, Investments - Equity Securities, should be considered immediately before applying or upon discontinuing the equity method. Certain non-derivative forward contracts or purchased call options to acquire equity securities generally will be measured using the fair value principles of ASC 321 before settlement or exercise and consideration shall not be given to how entities will account for the resulting investments on eventual settlement or exercise. ASU 2020-01 is effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of 2021 and early adoption is permitted. ASU 2020-01 should be applied prospectively. The Company is currently assessing the impact this standard will have on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements.\nASU 2020-06\nIn August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Debt-Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging-Contracts in Entity\u2019s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity\u2019s Own Equity. ASU 2020-06 reduces the number of accounting models for convertible instruments by eliminating two of the three models that require separate accounting for embedded conversion features, amends the requirements for a contract that is potentially settled in an entity\u2019s own shares to be classified in equity, and amends certain guidance on the computation of earnings per share for convertible instruments and contracts on an entity\u2019s own equity. ASU 2020-06 is effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of 2022 and early adoption is permitted beginning in the first quarter of 2021. ASU 2020-06 may be applied using a modified or full retrospective transition method. The Company is currently assessing the impact this standard will have on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements.\nOther accounting standard updates effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 31, 2020 are not expected to have a material impact on the Company\u2019s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nFair Value Measurements\nFair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date.\nEverbridge, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued)\nValuation techniques used to measure fair value must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. Accounting standards describe a fair value hierarchy based on three levels of inputs, of which the first two are considered observable and the last unobservable, that may be used to measure fair value which are the following:\nLevel 1-Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities or funds.\nLevel 2-Inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.\nLevel 3-Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.\nA financial instrument\u2019s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement.\nConcentrations of Credit and Business Risk\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to a concentration of credit risk consist of cash, cash equivalents and accounts receivable.\nThe Company maintains cash and cash equivalent balances at several banks. Accounts located in the United States are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (\u201cFDIC\u201d), up to $250,000. From time to time, balances may exceed amounts insured by the FDIC. The Company has not experienced any losses in such amounts.\nThe Company\u2019s accounts receivable are generally unsecured and are derived from revenue earned from customers primarily located in the United States, Norway, Netherlands, Sweden and the United Kingdom and are generally denominated in U.S. Dollars, Norwegian Krone, Euro, Swedish Kronor or British Pounds. Each reporting period, the Company reevaluates each customer\u2019s ability to satisfy credit obligations and maintains an allowance for credit risk based on the evaluations. No single customer comprised more than 10% of the Company\u2019s total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. No single customer comprised more than 10% of the Company\u2019s total accounts receivable balance at December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe Company considers all highly liquid instruments with original maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents consist of funds deposited into money market funds. Cash and cash equivalents are recorded at cost, which approximates fair value.\nRestricted Cash\nThe Company\u2019s restricted cash balance primarily consists of cash held at a financial institution for collateral against performance on the Company\u2019s customer contracts and certain other cash deposits for specific purposes.\nShort-Term Investments\nShort-term investments consist of highly liquid investments, primarily commercial paper, U.S. Treasury and U.S. agency securities, with maturities over three months from the date of purchase and less than 12 months from the date of the balance sheet. Debt securities, money market funds and U.S. agency bonds that the Company has the ability and positive intent to hold to maturity are carried at amortized cost, which approximates fair value. There were no short-term investments at December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nEverbridge, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued)\nAccounts Receivable\nAccounts receivable includes trade accounts receivables from the Company\u2019s customers, net of an allowance for credit risk. Accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. The Company\u2019s contract assets relate to services performed which were not billed, net of an allowance for credit risk. Allowance for credit risk for accounts receivables and contract assets is established based on various factors including credit profiles of the Company\u2019s customers, historical payments and current economic trends. The Company reviews its allowance for accounts receivables and contract assets by assessing individual accounts receivable or unbilled contract assets over a specific aging and amount. All other balances are pooled based on historical collection experience. The estimate of expected credit losses is based on information about past events, current economic conditions, and forecasts of future economic conditions that affect the collectability. Accounts receivable and contract assets are written-off on a case by case basis, net of any amounts that may be collected.\nDeferred Offering Costs\nDeferred offering costs consist primarily of direct incremental costs related to the Company\u2019s follow on offering of its common stock, which was completed in January 2019.\nProperty and Equipment, Net\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which is generally three years for computer software, office computers and system software, five years for system hardware and furniture and equipment, and over the shorter of lease term or useful life of the assets for leasehold improvements. Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nCapitalized Software Development Costs\nThe Company capitalizes the costs of software developed or obtained for internal use in accordance with FASB ASC 350-40, Internal Use Software. Capitalized software development costs consist of costs incurred during the application development stage and include purchased software licenses, implementation costs, consulting costs, and payroll-related costs for projects that qualify for capitalization. These costs relate to major new functionality. All other costs, primarily related to maintenance and minor software fixes, are expensed as incurred.\nThe Company amortizes the capitalized software development costs on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the software, which is generally three years, beginning when the asset is substantially ready for use. The amortization of capitalized software development costs is reflected in cost of revenue.\nFor software licenses for on premises usage, software development costs are capitalized in accordance with ASC 985-20, Costs of Software to be Sold, Leased or Marketed. The Company capitalizes software development costs incurred after technological feasibility of the software is established or for development costs that have alternative future uses. Under the Company\u2019s current practice, the technological feasibility of the underlying software is not established until substantially all product development and testing is complete, which generally includes the development of a working model. Software development costs that have been capitalized to date have not been material.\nBusiness Combinations\nThe results of businesses acquired in a business combination are included in the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. Purchase accounting results in assets and liabilities of an acquired business being recorded at their estimated fair values on the acquisition date. Any excess consideration over the value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recognized as goodwill.\nEverbridge, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued)\nThe Company performs valuations of assets acquired and liabilities assumed on each acquisition accounted for as a business combination, and allocates the purchase price to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on its best estimate of fair value. Acquired intangible assets include: tradenames, customer relationships, and developed technology. The Company determines the appropriate useful life of intangible assets by performing an analysis of cash flows based on historical experience of the acquired businesses. Intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives based on the pattern in which the economic benefits associated with the asset are expected to be consumed, which to date has approximated the straight-line method of amortization. The estimated useful lives for tradenames, customer relationships, and technology are generally one to seven years, five to nine years, and three to four years, respectively.\nThe valuation of the contingent consideration is derived using estimates of the probability of achievement within specified time periods based on projections of future revenue metrics per the terms of the applicable agreements. These include estimates of the Company\u2019s assessment of the probability of meeting such results, with the probability-weighted earn-out using a Monte Carlo Simulation Model then discounted to estimate fair value. Fair value is estimated using the probability weighted cash flow estimate closer to the measurement date. The various operating performance measures included in these contingent consideration agreements primarily relate to product revenue.\nSegment Information\nThe Company's Chief Executive Officer is the chief operating decision maker, who reviews the Company's financial information presented on a consolidated basis for purposes of allocating resources and evaluating the Company's financial performance. Accordingly, the Company has determined that it operates in a single reporting segment.\nLong-Lived Assets\nThe Company evaluates the recoverability of its long-lived assets with finite useful lives for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable or that the useful lives of those assets are no longer appropriate. Management considers the following potential indicators of impairment of its long-lived assets (asset group): a substantial decrease in the Company\u2019s stock price, a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long-lived asset (asset group) is being used, a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of the long-lived asset (asset group), an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of a long-lived asset (asset group), and a current expectation that, more likely than not, a long lived asset (asset group) will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life. When such events occur, the Company compares the carrying amounts of the assets group to their undiscounted expected future cash flows. If this comparison indicates that there may be an impairment, the amount of the impairment is calculated as the difference between the carrying value and fair value. For the years presented, the Company did not recognize an impairment charge.\nIntangible Assets\nIntangible assets consist of patents, tradename, customer relationships and acquired technology. The Company records acquired intangible assets at fair value on the date of acquisition. and amortize such assets using the straight-line method over the expected useful life of the asset. The estimated useful life of acquired intangible assets is one to nine years. The Company evaluates the useful lives of these assets on an annual basis and tests for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets in accordance with the long-lived assets policy states above. If the estimate of an intangible asset\u2019s remaining useful life is changed, the Company amortizes the remaining carrying value of the intangible asset prospectively over the revised remaining useful life.\nEverbridge, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued)\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price paid over the fair value of the net assets acquired in business combinations. Goodwill is not amortized and is tested for impairment at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Events or changes in circumstances that could trigger an impairment review include a significant adverse change in business climate, an adverse action or assessment by a regulator, unanticipated competition, a loss of key personnel, significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the Company\u2019s overall business, significant negative industry or economic trends, or significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future results of operations. The Company has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, including goodwill. If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, the Company determines that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, additional impairment testing is not required. The Company tests for goodwill impairment annually on November 30.\nThe Company performed a qualitative goodwill assessment at November 30, 2020 and concluded there was no impairment based on consideration of a number of factors, including the improvement in the Company\u2019s key operating metrics over the prior year, improvement in the strength of the general economy and the Company\u2019s continued execution against its overall strategic objectives.\nDebt Issuance Costs\nDebt issuance costs related to convertible senior notes recorded as a reduction of the carrying amount of the debt are amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company derives its revenues primarily from subscription services and professional services. The Company adopted the requirements of the ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, as of January 1, 2018. See Note 15.\nRevenues are recognized when control of services is transferred to the Company\u2019s customers in an amount that reflects the consideration it expects to be entitled to in exchange for those services.\nThe Company determines revenue recognition through the following steps:\n\u2022\nIdentification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer;\n\u2022\nIdentification of the performance obligations in the contract;\n\u2022\nDetermination of the transaction price;\n\u2022\nAllocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and\n\u2022\nRecognition of revenue when, or as, the Company satisfies a performance obligation.\nIdentify the customer contract\nA customer contract is generally identified when the Company and a customer have executed an arrangement that calls for the Company to grant access to its online software products and provide professional services in exchange for consideration from the customer.\nEverbridge, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued)\nIdentify performance obligations that are distinct\nA performance obligation is a promise to provide a distinct good or service or a series of distinct goods or services. A good or service that is promised to a customer is distinct if the customer can benefit from the good or service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available to the customer, and a company\u2019s promise to transfer the good or service to the customer is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. The Company has determined that subscriptions for its online software products are distinct because, once a customer has access to the online software product that it purchased, the online software product is fully functional and does not require any additional development, modification, or customization. Professional services sold are distinct because the customer benefits from the on-boarding and training to make better use of the online software products it purchased.\nDetermine the transaction price\nThe transaction price is the amount of consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to a customer, excluding sales taxes that are collected on behalf of government agencies. The Company estimates any variable consideration to which it will be entitled at contract inception, and reassesses at each reporting date, when determining the transaction price. The Company does not include variable consideration to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will occur when any uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved. Variable consideration revenue was not material for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.\nAllocate the transaction price to the distinct performance obligations\nThe transaction price is allocated to the separate performance obligation on a relative standalone selling prices (\u201cSSP\u201d) basis for those performance obligations with stable observable prices and then the residual method is applied for any performance obligation that has pricing which is highly variable. The Company determines the SSP of its goods and services based upon their average sales price or using other observable inputs, such as similar products or services.\nRecognize revenue as the performance obligations are satisfied\nRevenues are recognized when or as control of the promised goods or services is transferred to customers. Revenue from subscriptions to the Company\u2019s critical event management and enterprise safety applications is recognized ratably over the subscription period beginning on the date the Company\u2019s online software products are made available to customers. Most subscription contracts are two years or more. The Company recognizes revenue from professional services as the services are provided. Software on premises license transactions are generally perpetual in nature and are recognized at a point in time when made available to the customer for use.\nDisaggregation of Revenue\nThe Company provides disaggregation of revenue based on geographic region (see Note 15) and based on the subscription versus professional services and other classification on the consolidated statements of operations as it believes this best depict how the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors.\nSubscription Services Revenues\nSubscription services revenues primarily consist of fees that provide customers access to one or more of the Company\u2019s hosted applications for critical event management, with routine customer support. Revenue is generally recognized over time on a ratable basis over the contract term beginning on the date that the Company\u2019s service is made available to the customer. All services are recognized using an output measure of progress looking at time elapsed as the contract generally provides the customer equal benefit throughout the contract period. The Company\u2019s subscription contracts are generally two years or longer in length, billed annually in advance, and non-cancelable.\nEverbridge, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued)\nProfessional Services Revenues\nProfessional services revenues primarily consist of fees for deployment and optimization services, as well as training. The majority of the Company\u2019s consulting contracts revenue is recognized over time as the services are performed. For contracts billed on a fixed price basis, revenue is recognized over time based on the proportion performed.\nSoftware License Revenues\nOn occasion the Company may sell software and related post contract support for on premises usage as well as professional services, hardware and hosting which is outside of the Company\u2019s core business and is not a significant revenue stream for the Company. The Company\u2019s on premises license transactions are generally perpetual in nature and are recognized at a point in time when made available to the customer for use. Significant judgment is required to determine the standalone selling prices for each distinct performance obligation in order to allocate the transaction price for purposes of revenue recognition. Making this judgment of estimating a standalone selling price involves consideration of overall pricing objectives, market conditions and other factors, including the value of our other similar contracts, the applications sold, customer demographics, geographic locations, and the number and types of users within the Company\u2019s contracts. The significant judgment was primarily due to using such considerations to estimate the price that each distinct performance obligation would be sold for on a standalone basis because such performance obligations are typically sold together on a bundled basis. Changes in these estimates of standalone selling prices can have a material effect on the amount of revenue recognized from each distinct performance obligation.\nContracts with Multiple Performance Obligations\nMost of the Company\u2019s contracts with customers contain multiple performance obligations. For these contracts, the Company accounts for individual performance obligations separately if they are distinct. The transaction price is allocated to the separate performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price basis for those performance obligations with stable observable prices and then the residual method applied for any performance obligation that has pricing which is highly variable. The Company determines the standalone selling prices based on the Company\u2019s overall pricing objectives, taking into consideration market conditions and other factors, including the value of the Company\u2019s contracts, pricing when certain services are sold on a standalone basis, the applications sold, customer demographics, geographic locations, and the volume of services and users.\nReturns\nThe Company does not offer rights of return for its products and services in the normal course of business.\nCustomer Acceptance\nThe Company\u2019s contracts with customers generally do not include customer acceptance clauses.\nTrade and Other Receivables\nTrade and other receivables are primarily comprised of trade receivables that are recorded at the invoice amount, net of an allowance for credit risk, which is not material. Other receivables represent unbilled receivables related to subscription and professional services contracts, net of an allowance for credit losses, which is not material. On January 1, 2020, the Company adopted ASU 2016-13 (as amended through March 2020), Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. See Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements above.\nEverbridge, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued)\nDeferred Costs\nSales commissions earned by the Company\u2019s sales force are considered incremental and recoverable costs of obtaining a contract with a customer. Subscription-related commissions costs are deferred and then amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of benefit that the Company has determined to be four years. Sales commissions attributable to professional services are expensed within twelve months of selling the service to the customer. The Company has determined the period of benefit by taking into consideration its customer contracts, its technology and other factors. Sales commissions attributed to renewals are not material and are not commensurate with initial and growth sales. Amortization of deferred commissions is included in sales and marketing expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.\nDeferred Revenue\nDeferred revenue consists of amounts that have been invoiced and for which the Company has the right to bill, but that have not been recognized as revenue because the related goods or services have not been transferred. Deferred revenue that will be realized during the succeeding 12-month period is recorded as current, and the remaining deferred revenue is recorded as non-current.\nIn instances where the timing of revenue recognition differs from the timing of invoicing, the Company has determined its contracts generally do not include a significant financing component. The primary purpose of the Company\u2019s invoicing terms is to provide customers with simplified and predictable ways of purchasing the Company\u2019s products and services, not to receive financing from its customers or to provide customers with financing. Examples include invoicing at the beginning of a subscription term with revenue recognized ratably over the contract period.\nAdvertising Expenses\nAdvertising expenses to promote the Company\u2019s services are expensed as incurred. Advertising expenses included in sales and marketing expense were $4.8 million, $1.9 million and $1.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses primarily consist of employee-related costs for research and development staff, including salaries, bonuses, benefits and stock-based compensation and the cost of certain third-party service providers related to the development of the Company\u2019s solutions that do not meet the criteria to be capitalized under ASC 350-40, Internal Use Software or ASC 985-20, Costs of Software to be Sold, Leased or Marketed.\nStock-Based Compensation\nStock-based compensation expense is comprised of stock options, restricted stock units (\u201cRSUs\u201d), performance-based RSUs (\u201cPSUs\u201d) and employee stock purchase plan awards.\nStock-based compensation related to stock options and RSUs is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized straight-line as expense, net of estimated forfeitures, over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective award. The Company utilizes the Black-Scholes pricing model for determining the estimated fair value of the stock options and employee stock purchase plan awards. The Black-Scholes pricing model requires the use of subjective assumptions including the option\u2019s expected term, the volatility of the underlying stock, the fair value of the stock and the expected forfeiture rate.\nThe Company grants PSUs that vest upon satisfaction of certain performance-based conditions. The vesting of PSUs is subject to the employee\u2019s continued employment with the Company through the date of achievement. The fair value is based on value of the Company\u2019s common stock at the date of issuance and the probability of achieving the performance metric. The Company has assessed the probability of achievement as highly probable based on past performance of achievement of the performance metric. Compensation cost is recognized under the accelerated\nEverbridge, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued)\nmethod and is adjusted in future periods for subsequent changes in the expected outcome of the performance related conditions.\nIn 2018, the Company granted market-based RSUs that vested upon satisfaction of certain market-based conditions. These market-based RSUs were valued using the Monte-Carlo simulation model. No market-based RSUs were granted during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. The Company recognized compensation expense associated with the market-based RSUs over the implied requisite service period subject to acceleration based on meeting the market-based condition.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes in which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized as income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is established if it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.\nThe calculation of the Company\u2019s tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties of the application of complex tax regulations. The Company recognizes liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two-step approach. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not, that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount, which is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The Company considers many factors when evaluating and estimating its tax positions and tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments.\nForeign Currency Translation\nThe functional currency for the Company\u2019s foreign subsidiaries is the local currency. For those subsidiaries, the assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate method at the balance sheet date. Income and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates for the period. Foreign currency exchange gain and losses are recorded in other expenses.\nOther Comprehensive Income (Loss)\nFor all periods presented, the Company\u2019s other comprehensive income (loss) is comprised of foreign currency translation adjustments related to the Company\u2019s foreign subsidiaries.\nNet Loss Per Share Attributable to Common Stockholders\nBasic net loss per share attributable to common stockholders is computed by dividing the Company\u2019s net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares used in the loss per share calculation during the period. Diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders is computed by giving effect to all potentially dilutive securities, including stock-based compensation awards. Basic and diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders was the same for all periods presented as the inclusion of all potentially dilutive securities outstanding was anti-dilutive.\n(3) Accounts Receivable, Net\nOn January 1, 2020, the Company adopted ASU 2016-13 using the modified retrospective approach. See Note 2. The cumulative effect of initially applying ASU 2016-13 had an immaterial impact on the Company\u2019s opening balance of accumulated deficit.\nEverbridge, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued)\nAccounts receivable, net, is as follows (in thousands):\nAs of December 31,\nAccounts receivable amortized cost\n$\n98,164\n$\n69,767\nAllowance for credit losses\n(3,788\n)\n(1,125\n)\nNet accounts receivable\n$\n94,376\n$\n68,642\nThe following table summarizes the changes in the allowance for credit losses for accounts receivable (in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31,\nBalance, beginning of period\n$\n(1,125\n)\n$\n(711\n)\n$\n(863\n)\nProvision for expected credit losses\n(2,877\n)\n(971\n)\n(58\n)\nWrite-offs\nBalance, end of period\n$\n(3,788\n)\n$\n(1,125\n)\n$\n(711\n)\nContract assets, net is as follows (in thousands):\nAs of December 31,\nContract asset amortized cost\n$\n2,560\n$\n1,959\nAllowance for credit losses\n(398\n)\n-\nNet contract asset\n$\n2,162\n$\n1,959\nThe following table summarizes the changes in the allowance for credit losses for contract assets (in thousands):\nYear Ended\nDecember 31, 2020\nBalance, beginning of period\n$\n-\nProvision for expected credit losses\n(398\n)\nBalance, end of period\n$\n(398\n)\nCredit loss expense for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $2.7 million, $0.7 million and $0.1 million, respectively.\nThe following table summarizes the changes in the sales reserve (in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31,\nBalance, beginning of period\n$\n(175\n)\n$\n(200\n)\n$\n(100\n)\n(Additions) reductions\n(85\n)\n(193\n)\nWrite-offs\nBalance, end of period\n$\n(175\n)\n$\n(175\n)\n$\n(200\n)\nEverbridge, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued)\n(4) Property and Equipment\nProperty and equipment consist of the following (in thousands):\nUseful life\nAs of December 31,\nin years\nFurniture and equipment\n$\n2,041\n$\n1,785\nLeasehold improvements (1)\n4,944\n4,074\nSystem hardware\n1,596\nOffice computers\n6,547\n5,309\nComputer and system software\n1,451\n15,166\n14,215\nLess accumulated depreciation and amortization\n(7,392\n)\n(7,931\n)\nProperty and equipment, net\n$\n7,774\n$\n6,284\n(1)\nLesser of the lease term or the estimated useful lives of the improvements, which may be up to 9 years.\nDepreciation and amortization expense for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $2.7 million, $2.2 million and $1.8 million, respectively.\n(5) Capitalized Software Development Costs\nCapitalized software development costs consisted of the following (in thousands):\nGross\ncarrying\namount\nAmortization\nperiod\nAccumulated\namortization\nNet\ncarrying\namount\nAs of December 31, 2020\n$\n59,761\n3 years\n$\n(43,432\n)\n$\n16,329\nAs of December 31, 2019\n49,909\n3 years\n(35,622\n)\n14,287\nThe Company capitalized software development costs of $9.9 million, $8.8 million and $8.8 million during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nAmortized expense for capitalized software development costs was $7.9 million, $7.0 million and $5.9 million during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Amortization of capitalized software development costs is classified within cost of revenue in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\nThe expected amortization, as of December 31, 2020, for each of the next three years is as follows (in thousands):\n$\n7,610\n5,682\n3,037\n$\n16,329\n(6) Fair Value Measurements\nThe carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate fair value because of the short maturity of these items.\nCertain assets, including long-lived assets, goodwill and intangible assets are also subject to measurement at fair value on a non-recurring basis if they are deemed to be impaired as a result of an impairment review. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, no impairments were identified of those assets requiring measurement at fair value on a non-recurring basis.\nEverbridge, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued)\nThe Company classifies and discloses fair value measurements in one of the following three categories of fair value hierarchy:\nLevel 1Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets and liabilities.\nLevel 2Quoted prices in markets that are not active or financial instruments for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly.\nLevel 3Prices or valuations that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable.\nA financial instrument\u2019s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement.\nThe following table summarizes the Company's financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis by level within the fair value hierarchy.

Investments are reviewed periodically to identify possible other-than-temporary impairments. As the Company has the ability and intent to hold these investments with unrealized losses for a reasonable period of time sufficient for the recovery of fair value, which may be maturity, the Company does not consider these investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired for any of the periods presented.\nOn May 27, 2020, the Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with Techwan SA (\u201cTechwan\u201d) pursuant to which the Company purchased all of the issued and outstanding shares of stock of Techwan (see Note 8). In accordance with the Stock Purchase Agreement, 6,779 shares of the Company\u2019s common stock were reserved and are expected to be issued to the sellers in November 2021 subject to the provisions in the Stock Purchase Agreement. Management analyzed the liability for derivative accounting consideration under ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging, and determined that the liability qualifies for derivative accounting. The derivative liability is not designated as a hedging instrument. In accordance with ASC 815, the Company recorded the acquisition-related deferred common stock consideration derivative liability, which is carried at fair value, in other long-term liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheet. The derivative liability will be marked-to-market each measurement period and changes in fair value during the year ended December 31, 2020 of $0.1 million was recorded as a component of other expense, net on the consolidated statement of operations. The fair value is derived from the Company\u2019s stock price. The acquisition-related deferred common stock consideration derivative liability will remain in effect until such time as the associated shares are issued and the resulting derivative liability will be transitioned from a liability to equity as of such date.\nThe following table summarizes the changes in Level 3 financial instruments (in thousands):\nFair value at December 31, 2018\n$\n-\nContingent consideration from MissionMode\nacquisition\nChange in fair value of contingent consideration\nobligation from MissionMode acquisition\n(550\n)\nFair value at December 31, 2019\n-\nContingent consideration from one2many\nacquisition\n2,190\nContingent consideration from Techwan\nacquisition\n2,030\nContingent consideration from SnapComms\nacquisition\n2,047\nChange in fair value of contingent consideration\nobligation from one2many acquisition\n8,114\nChange in fair value of contingent consideration\nobligation from Techwan acquisition\n(2,030\n)\nChange in fair value of contingent consideration\nobligation from SnapComms acquisition\n(2,047\n)\nForeign currency translation\nFair value at December 31, 2020\n$\n10,619\nThe valuation of the contingent consideration was derived using estimates of the probability of achievement within specified time periods based on projections of future revenue metrics per the terms of the applicable agreements. These include estimates of the Company\u2019s assessment of the probability of meeting such results, with the probability-weighted earn-out using a Monte Carlo Simulation Model then discounted to estimate fair value. Fair value is estimated using the probability weighted cash flow estimate closer to the measurement date. The various operating performance measures included in these contingent consideration agreements primarily relate to product revenue. As these are unobservable inputs, the contingent consideration liabilities are included in Level 3 inputs. During the year ended December 31, 2020, as a result of assessing the probabilities of One2Many Group B.V. (\u201cone2many\u201d) meeting revenue metrics during the period of March 1, 2020 through February 28, 2021, the Company recognized an increase in the fair value of one2many\u2019s contingent consideration obligation in the amount\nEverbridge, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued)\nof $8.1 million. During the year ended December 31, 2020, as a result of assessing the probabilities of Techwan meeting revenue metrics during the period of April 1, 2020 through March 31, 2021, the Company recognized a decrease in the fair value of Techwan\u2019s contingent consideration obligation in the amount of $2.0 million. During the year ended December 31, 2020, as a result of assessing the probabilities of SnapComms Limited (\u201cSnapComms\u201d) meeting revenue metrics during the period of April 1, 2020 through March 31, 2021, the Company recognized a decrease in the fair value of SnapComms\u2019 contingent consideration obligation in the amount of $2.0 million.\nThe Company estimates the fair value of the convertible senior notes based on their last actively traded prices (Level 1) or market-observable inputs (Level 2). As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the fair value of the 0.125% convertible senior notes due 2024 (the \u201c2024 Notes\u201d) was determined to be $663.6 million and $450.4 million, respectively, and the carrying value of the 2024 Notes was $369.0 million and $351.1 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the fair value of the 1.50% convertible senior notes due 2022 (the \u201c2022 Notes\u201d) was determined to be $265.5 million and $215.8 million, respectively, and the carrying value of the 2022 Notes was $72.5 million and $79.2 million, respectively.

Amortization expense of tradenames and customer relationships is\nEverbridge, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued)\nincluded within general and administrative expenses, while amortization of developed technology is included in cost of revenue. The Company recorded amortization expense attributed to developed technology of $4.2 million, $2.1 million and $1.3 million for the period ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. In December 2020, the Company completed an asset acquisition and recorded $17.1 million to developed technology. The average useful life for the December 2020 asset acquisition of acquired technology is 4.0 years. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company retired $4.4 million of fully amortized intangible assets.\nThe expected amortization of the intangible assets, as of December 31, 2020, for each of the next five years and thereafter is as follows (in thousands):\n$\n27,387\n24,219\n19,165\n17,443\n11,040\nThereafter\n14,508\n$\n113,762\n(8) Business Combinations\nThe Company accounted for the following acquisitions using the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations under ASC 805, Business Combinations, which required that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recognized on the balance sheet at their fair values as of the acquisition date. The excess of the purchase price over the net fair value of the assets and liabilities was recorded as goodwill. This goodwill includes the know-how of the assembled workforce, the ability of the workforce to further improve technology and product offerings, customer relationships and the expected cash flows resulting from these efforts. Goodwill may also include expected synergies resulting from the complementary strategic fit these businesses bring to existing operations.\nFair value estimates are based on a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and rely heavily on estimates and assumptions. The judgments used to determine the estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as asset lives and the expected future cash flows and related discount rates, can materially impact the Company\u2019s results of operations. Significant inputs used for the model included the amount of cash flows, the expected period of the cash flows and the discount rates. Significant estimation was required by management in determining the fair value of the customer relationship intangible assets, deferred revenue and contingent consideration liabilities. The significant estimation is primarily due to the judgmental nature of the inputs to the valuation models used to measure the fair value of these intangible assets, deferred revenue and contingent consideration liabilities, as well as the sensitivity of the respective fair values to the underlying significant assumptions. The Company used the income approach to measure the fair value of these intangible assets, a discounted cash flow approach for deferred revenue and a Monte Carlo simulation model to measure the fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities. The significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value of the intangible assets, deferred revenue and contingent consideration liabilities included forecasted revenues from existing customers, existing customer attrition rates, estimated costs required to fulfill the deferred revenue obligation and forecasted revenues for the contingent consideration earnout period. When estimating the significant assumptions to be used in the valuation the Company includes a consideration of current industry information, market and economic trends, historical results of the acquired business, nature of the performance obligations associated with the deferred revenue and other relevant factors. These significant assumptions are forward-looking and could be affected by future economic and market conditions. The valuation of the contingent consideration was derived using estimates of the probability of achievement within specified time periods based on projections of future revenue metrics per the terms of the applicable agreements. These include estimates of the Company\u2019s assessment of the probability of meeting such results, with the probability-weighted earn-out using a Monte Carlo Simulation Model then discounted to estimate fair value. Fair value is estimated using the probability weighted cash flow estimate closer to the measurement date. The various operating performance measures included in these contingent consideration agreements primarily relate to product revenue.\nEverbridge, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued)\nThe business acquisitions discussed below are included in the Company\u2019s results of operations from their respective dates of acquisition.\n2020 Acquisitions\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company acquired Connexient, Inc., CNL Software Limited, One2Many Group B.V., Techwan SA and SnapComms Limited. These acquisitions were not material individually or on a consolidated basis. Additionally, neither the investment in the assets nor the results of operations of these acquisitions were significant to the Company\u2019s consolidated financial position or results of operations, and thus pro forma information is not required to be presented.\nConnexient, Inc.\nOn February 7, 2020, the Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with Connexient, Inc. (\u201cConnexient\u201d) pursuant to which the Company purchased all of the issued and outstanding shares of stock of Connexient for a base consideration of $20.2 million. The Company paid $11.5 million in cash at closing and paid the remaining purchase price with 96,611 newly issued shares of the Company\u2019s common stock. On the date of this acquisition, the average price of the Company\u2019s common stock on the Nasdaq Global Market was $93.32 per share. In addition to the base purchase price, there is also a potential contingent payment of up to $6.0 million that can be earned by the sellers based on fiscal year 2020 revenue metrics. As of the date of the acquisition, the fair value of the contingent consideration was zero as a result of the Company\u2019s initial assessment of the probability of Connexient meeting the revenue metrics. At December 31, 2020, it was determined that Connexient would not meet the fiscal year 2020 revenue metric threshold. The Company acquired Connexient to expand the Company\u2019s customer base and for its strategic technology assets to enhance the Company\u2019s Critical Event Management (\u201cCEM\u201d) suite of solutions to broaden support for Internet of Things (\u201cIoT\u201d) applications.\nThe following table summarizes the estimated fair value of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed, which were recorded as of the acquisition date, as well as the aggregate consideration for the acquisition of Connexient made by the Company (in thousands):\nConnexient\nAssets acquired\nAccounts receivable\n$\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets\nProperty and equipment\nAcquired technology\n1,220\nTrade names\nCustomer relationships\n7,800\nGoodwill\n14,343\nOther assets\nTotal assets acquired\n25,607\nLiabilities assumed\nAccounts payable\nAccrued expenses\nDeferred revenue\n2,420\nDeferred tax liabilities\n2,011\nOther liabilities\nNet assets acquired\n$\n20,006\nConsideration paid\nCash consideration, net of cash acquired\n$\n10,991\nFair value of common stock issued\n9,015\nTotal\n$\n20,006\nEverbridge, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued)\nThe weighted average useful life of all identified acquired intangible assets is 7.92 years. The average useful lives for acquired technologies, customer relationships and trade names are 3.0 years, 9.0 years and 4.0 years, respectively. Identifiable intangible assets with definite lives are amortized over the period of estimated benefit using the straight-line method. The straight-line method of amortization represents the Company\u2019s best estimate of the period of expected cash flows of the identifiable intangible assets.\nThe goodwill balance is primarily attributed to the anticipated synergies from the acquisition and expanded market opportunities with respect to the integration of Connexient\u2019s products with the Company's other solutions. The Company believes that the factors listed above in relation to the purchase of Connexient support the amount of goodwill recorded as a result of the purchase price paid for the acquisition, in relation to other acquired tangible and intangible assets. The resulting goodwill from the Connexient acquisition is not deductible for income tax purposes.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company incurred transaction costs of $0.1 million in connection with the Connexient acquisition, which were expensed as incurred and included in general and administrative expenses.\nCNL Software Limited\nOn February 25, 2020, the Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with CNL Software Limited (\u201cCNL Software\u201d) for a base consideration of approximately $35.7 million.

On the first anniversary of the acquisition date, the Company expects to pay deferred consideration of approximately $3.3 million in cash and shares of the Company\u2019s common stock subject to the provisions in the Stock Purchase Agreement. In addition to the base purchase price, there is also a potential contingent payment of up to approximately $5.0 million that can be earned by the sellers based on revenue metrics during the period of April 1, 2020 through March 31, 2021. At the date of\nEverbridge, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued)\nthe acquisition, the Company preliminarily assessed the probability of SnapComms meeting the revenue metrics during the period of April 1, 2020 through March 31, 2021 and recorded a $2.0 million initial fair value of contingent consideration as part of the purchase price allocation. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recognized a decrease in the fair value of SnapComms\u2019 contingent consideration obligation in the amount of $2.0 million recognized in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. The Company acquired SnapComms to expand the Company\u2019s customer base and for its internal communications software to enhance the Company\u2019s CEM suite of solutions.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recognized a $0.9 million decrease in SnapComms\u2019 deferred revenue balance with a corresponding decrease in goodwill from the initial assessment as of the acquisition date. As the Company finalizes its estimation of the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, additional adjustments may be recorded during the measurement period (a period not to exceed 12 months). The initial accounting is incomplete as of December 31, 2020 for the acquired assets and liabilities as the Company is in the process of completing the assessment of the tax attributes of the business combination. The finalization of the acquisition accounting valuation assessment may result in a change in the valuation of the deferred tax assets and liabilities which could have a material impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial position.\nThe following table summarizes the preliminary estimated fair value of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed, which were recorded as of the acquisition date, as well as the aggregate consideration for the acquisition of SnapComms made by the Company (in thousands):\nSnapComms\nAssets acquired\nAccounts receivable\n$\n1,808\nOther current assets\nProperty and equipment\nAcquired technology\n2,300\nTrade names\nCustomer relationships\n13,300\nGoodwill\n22,629\nOther assets\nTotal assets acquired\n42,341\nLiabilities assumed\nAccrued expenses\nDeferred revenue\n3,165\nDeferred tax liabilities\n4,960\nOther liabilities\nNet assets acquired\n$\n32,971\nConsideration paid\nCash consideration, net of cash acquired\n$\n10,090\nFair value of common stock issued\n17,685\nAcquisition-related deferred consideration\n3,149\nContingent consideration\n2,047\nTotal\n$\n32,971\nThe weighted average useful life of all identified acquired intangible assets is 7.82 years.

Identifiable intangible assets with definite lives are amortized over the period of estimated benefit using the straight-line method. The straight-line method of amortization represents the Company\u2019s best estimate of the period of expected cash flows of the identifiable intangible assets.\nThe goodwill balance is primarily attributed to the anticipated synergies from the acquisition and expanded market opportunities with respect to the integration of SnapComms\u2019 products with the Company's other solutions. The Company believes that the factors listed above in relation to the purchase of SnapComms support the amount of\nEverbridge, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued)\ngoodwill recorded as a result of the purchase price paid for the acquisition, in relation to other acquired tangible and intangible assets. The resulting goodwill from the SnapComms acquisition is not deductible for income tax purposes.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company incurred transaction costs of $0.1 million in connection with the SnapComms acquisition, which were expensed as incurred and included in general and administrative expenses.\n2019 Acquisitions\nMissionMode Solutions, Inc.\nOn April 1, 2019, the Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with MissionMode Solutions, Inc. (\u201cMissionMode\u201d) pursuant to which the Company purchased all of the issued and outstanding shares of stock of MissionMode for base consideration of $6.8 million. There was also a potential contingent payment of up to $1.0 million that could have been earned in addition to the base consideration by the sellers based on successfully converting MissionMode\u2019s customers to the Company\u2019s products. At the date of the acquisition, the Company assessed the probabilities of MissionMode meeting the threshold to convert MissionMode\u2019s customers to the Company\u2019s products required for the seller to earn the contingent payment. Therefore, contingent consideration was recorded as part of the purchase price allocation and the fair value of the contingent consideration was determined to be $0.6 million. At December 31, 2019, it was determined to not be probable that MissionMode would meet the threshold to convert MissionMode\u2019s customers to the Company\u2019s products which resulted in a decrease of the contingent consideration obligation in the amount of $0.6 million recognized in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. The Company\u2019s acquisition of MissionMode was made primarily to expand the Company\u2019s customer base and to a lesser extent to complement some of the existing facets of MissionMode\u2019s business with the Company\u2019s existing products.\nThe following table summarizes the estimated fair value of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed as well as the aggregate consideration during the year ended December 31, 2019 for the acquisition of MissionMode made by the Company (in thousands):\nMissionMode\nAssets acquired\nAccounts receivable\n$\nOther assets\nProperty and equipment\nTrade names\nAcquired technology\nCustomer relationships\n4,600\nGoodwill\n2,918\nTotal assets acquired\n8,356\nLiabilities assumed\nAccounts payable and accrued expenses\nDeferred revenue\nOther liabilities\nNet assets acquired\n$\n7,314\nConsideration paid\nCash paid, net of cash acquired\n$\n6,764\nContingent consideration\nTotal\n$\n7,314\nEverbridge, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued)\nThe weighted average useful life of all identified acquired intangible assets is 6.50 years.

The Company paid approximately $51.7 million in cash at closing from the Company\u2019s cash and cash equivalents. The remaining purchase price was paid with 320,998 newly issued shares of the Company\u2019s common stock. On the date of this acquisition the average price of the Company\u2019s common stock on the Nasdaq Global Market was $102.18 per share. On August 1, 2019, the Acquisition was consummated pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, except for the transfer of the NC4 Public Sector business which was consummated on September 30, 2019. The Company determined that the two transactions should be accounted for as a single transaction in accordance with ASC 810-10-40-6, Consolidation, as the transactions were entered in contemplation of one another and were essentially a single transaction designed to achieve an overall commercial effect. The Company\u2019s acquisition of NC4 was made primarily to expand the Company\u2019s customer base and to a lesser extent to complement some of the existing facets of NC4\u2019s business with the Company\u2019s existing products.\nEverbridge, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued)\nThe following table summarizes the estimated fair value of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed as well as the aggregate consideration during the year ended December 31, 2019 for the acquisition of NC4 made by the Company (in thousands):\nNC4\nAssets acquired\nAccounts receivable\n$\n2,611\nOther current assets\nProperty and equipment\nAcquired technology\n5,210\nTrade names\n8,610\nCustomer relationships\n35,490\nGoodwill\n40,384\nTotal assets acquired\n92,910\nLiabilities assumed\nDeferred revenue\n7,540\nOther current liabilities\nNet assets acquired\n$\n84,453\nConsideration paid\nCash paid\n$\n51,655\nFair value of common stock issued\n32,798\nTotal\n$\n84,453\nThe weighted average useful life of all identified acquired intangible assets is 5.88 years.

The 2024 Notes will mature on December 15, 2024, unless earlier redeemed or repurchased by the Company or converted by the holder pursuant to their terms. Interest is payable semiannually in arrears on June 15 and December 15 of each year, commencing on June 15, 2020.\nThe 2024 Notes are governed by an Indenture between the Company, as issuer, and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the \u201c2024 Notes Indenture\u201d). The 2024 Notes are unsecured and rank: senior in right of payment to the Company\u2019s indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the 2024 Notes; equal in right of payment to the Company\u2019s existing and future indebtedness that is not so subordinated, including its 1.50% convertible senior notes due 2022 (see 1.50% Convertible Senior Notes Due 2022 below); effectively junior in right of payment to any of the Company\u2019s secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and structurally junior to all existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities incurred by the Company\u2019s subsidiaries.\nUpon conversion, the Company will pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of the Company\u2019s common stock or a combination of cash and shares of common stock, at the Company\u2019s election.\nThe 2024 Notes have an initial conversion rate of 8.8999 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of 2024 Notes. This represents an initial effective conversion price of approximately $112.36 per share of common stock and approximately 4.0 million shares issuable upon conversion. Throughout the term of the 2024 Notes, the conversion rate may be adjusted upon the occurrence of certain events. Holders of the 2024 Notes will not receive any cash payment representing accrued and unpaid interest, if any, upon conversion of a 2024 Note, except in limited circumstances. Accrued but unpaid interest will be deemed to be paid by cash, shares of the Company\u2019s common stock or a combination of cash and shares of the Company\u2019s common stock paid or delivered, as the case may be, to the holder upon conversion of a 2024 Note.\nHolders may convert all or a portion of their 2024 Notes prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding June 15, 2024, in multiples of $1,000 principal amount, only under the following circumstances:\n\u2022\nduring any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending on March 31, 2020 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price of the Company\u2019s common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price on each applicable trading day;\n\u2022\nduring the five business day period after any ten consecutive trading day period (the \u201c2024 Notes Measurement Period\u201d), in which the \u201ctrading price\u201d (as the term is defined in the 2024 Notes Indenture) per $1,000 principal amount of notes for each trading day of such 2024 Notes Measurement Period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of the Company\u2019s common stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day;\nEverbridge, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued)\n\u2022\nif the Company calls such notes for redemption, at any time prior to the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately preceding the redemption date; or\n\u2022\nupon the occurrence of specified corporate events.\nOn or after June 15, 2024 until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders may convert all or any portion of their 2024 Notes at the conversion rate at any time regardless of whether the conditions set forth below have been met.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the 2024 Notes are not yet convertible. The 2024 Notes are classified as long-term on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020 as it is the Company\u2019s intent to settle all of the debt at maturity or to settle in shares if exercised by the debt holder prior to maturity.\nThe 2024 Notes are not redeemable by the Company prior to December 20, 2022. The Company may redeem for cash all or any portion of the 2024 Notes, at its option, on or after December 20, 2022 if the last reported sale price of the Company's common stock has been at least 130% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive), including the trading day immediately preceding the date on which the Company provides notice of redemption, during any 30 consecutive trading day period ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which the Company provides notice of redemption at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2024 Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date.\nBased on market data available for publicly traded, senior, unsecured corporate bonds issued by companies in the same industry and with similar maturity, the Company estimated the implied interest rate of its 2024 Notes to be approximately 5.16%, assuming no conversion option. Assumptions used in the estimate represent what market participants would use in pricing the equity component, including market interest rates, credit standing, and yield curves, all of which are defined as Level 2 observable inputs. The estimated implied interest rate was applied to the 2024 Notes, which resulted in a fair value of the liability component of $360.4 million upon issuance, calculated as the present value of implied future payments based on the $450.0 million aggregate principal amount. The excess of the principal amount of the liability component over its carrying amount, or the debt discount, is amortized to interest expense over the term of the 2024 Notes. The $89.6 million difference between the aggregate principal amount of $450.0 million and the estimated fair value of the liability component was recorded in additional paid-in capital as the 2024 Notes were not considered redeemable.\nSignificant judgment is required in determining the liability component of the related convertible senior notes as well as the balance sheet classification of the elements of the convertible senior notes. The Company accounted for the convertible senior notes and the partial extinguishment of the 2022 Notes, discussed below, as separate liability and equity components, determining the fair value of the respective liability components based on an estimate of the fair value of a similar liability without a conversion option and assigning the residual value to the equity component.\nThe Company estimated the fair value of the liability component of the convertible senior notes using a discounted cash flow model with a risk adjusted yield for similar debt instruments, absent any embedded conversion feature. In estimating the risk adjusted yield, the Company utilized both an income and market approach. For the income approach, the Company used a convertible bond pricing model, which included several assumptions including volatility and the risk-free rate. For the market approach, the Company performed an evaluation of issuances of convertible debt securities issued by other comparable companies. Additionally, a detailed analysis of the terms of the convertible senior notes transactions was required to determine existence of any derivatives that may require separate mark-to-market accounting under applicable accounting guidance.\nIn accounting for the transaction costs related to the issuance of the 2024 Notes, the Company allocated the total amount incurred to the liability and equity components based on their estimated relative fair values. Transaction costs attributable to the liability component, totaling $10.2 million, are being amortized to expense over the term of the 2024 Notes, and transaction costs attributable to the equity component, totaling $2.6 million, and were netted with the equity component in shareholders\u2019 equity.\nEverbridge, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued)\nThe 2024 Notes consist of the following (in thousands):\nAs of December 31,\nLiability component:\nPrincipal\n$\n450,000\n$\n450,000\nLess: debt discount, net of amortization\n(80,968\n)\n(98,942\n)\nNet carrying amount\n$\n369,032\n$\n351,058\nEquity component (1)\n86,133\n86,133\n(1)\nRecorded in the consolidated balance sheet within additional paid-in capital, net of $2.6 million transaction costs in equity and net of $0.9 million for taxes.\nThe following table sets forth total interest expense recognized related to the 2024 Notes (in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31,\n0.125% coupon\n$\n$\nAmortization of debt discount and transaction costs\n17,974\n$\n18,538\n$\nThe fair value of the 2024 Notes, which was determined based on inputs that are observable in the market or that could be derived from, or corroborated with, observable market data, quoted price of the 2024 Notes in an over-the-counter market (Level 2), and carrying value of debt instruments (carrying value excludes the equity component of the Company\u2019s 2024 Notes classified in equity) were as follows (in thousands):\nAs of December 31,\nFair Value\nCarrying Value\nFair Value\nCarrying Value\n2024 Notes\n$\n663,615\n$\n369,032\n$\n450,414\n$\n351,058\nIn connection with the issuance of the 2024 Notes, the Company entered into capped call transactions with certain counterparties affiliated with the initial purchasers and other financial institutions. The capped call transactions are expected to reduce potential dilution of earnings per share upon conversion of the 2024 Notes. Under the capped call transactions, the Company purchased capped call options that in the aggregate relate to the total number of shares of the Company\u2019s common stock underlying the 2024 Notes, with an initial strike price of approximately $112.36 per share, which corresponds to the initial conversion price of the 2024 Notes and is subject to anti-dilution adjustments substantially similar to those applicable to the conversion rate of the 2024 Notes, and with a cap price of approximately $166.46. The cost of the purchased capped calls of $44.9 million was recorded to shareholders\u2019 equity and will not be re-measured.\nBased on the closing price of the Company\u2019s common stock of $149.07 on December 31, 2020, the if-converted value of the 2024 Notes was more than their respective principal amounts.\n1.50% Convertible Senior Notes Due 2022\nIn November 2017, the Company issued $115.0 million aggregate principal amount of\nEverbridge, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued)\n1.50% convertible senior notes due 2022, including $15.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2022 Notes issued upon the initial purchasers\u2019 exercise in full of their option to purchase additional 2022 Notes. The 2022 Notes will mature on November 1, 2022, unless earlier redeemed or repurchased by the Company or converted by the holder pursuant to their terms. Interest is payable semiannually in arrears on May 1 and November 1 of each year, commencing on May 1, 2018.\nThe 2022 Notes are governed by an Indenture between the Company, as issuer, and U.S. Bank, National Association, as trustee (the \u201c2022 Notes Indenture\u201d). The 2022 Notes are unsecured and rank: senior in right of payment to the Company\u2019s future indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the 2022 Notes; equal in right of payment to the Company\u2019s existing and future indebtedness that is not so subordinated, including the Company\u2019s 2024 Notes; effectively subordinated in right of payment to any of the Company\u2019s secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities incurred by the Company\u2019s subsidiaries.\nUpon conversion, the Company will pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of the Company\u2019s common stock or a combination of cash and shares of common stock, at the Company\u2019s election. The Company\u2019s current intention is to settle the conversion in shares of common stock if a conversion were to occur.\nThe 2022 Notes have an initial conversion rate of 29.6626 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of 2022 Notes. This represents an initial effective conversion price of approximately $33.71 per share of common stock and initially approximately 3.4 million shares issuable upon conversion. Throughout the term of the 2022 Notes, the conversion rate may be adjusted upon the occurrence of certain events. Holders of the 2022 Notes will not receive any cash payment representing accrued and unpaid interest, if any, upon conversion of a 2022 Note, except in limited circumstances. Accrued but unpaid interest will be deemed to be paid by cash, shares of the Company\u2019s common stock or a combination of cash and shares of the Company\u2019s common stock paid or delivered, as the case may be, to the holder upon conversion of a 2022 Note.\nHolders may convert all or a portion of their 2022 Notes prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding May 1, 2022, in multiples of $1,000 principal amount, only under the following circumstances:\n\u2022\nduring any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending on March 31, 2018 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price of the Company\u2019s common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price on each applicable trading day;\n\u2022\nduring the five business day period after any five consecutive trading day period (the \u201c2022 Notes Measurement Period\u201d), in which the \u201ctrading price\u201d (as the term is defined in the 2022 Notes Indenture) per $1,000 principal amount of notes for each trading day of such 2022 Notes Measurement Period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of the Company\u2019s common stock on such trading day and the conversion rate on each such trading day;\n\u2022\nif the Company calls any or all of the notes for redemption, at any time prior to the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date; or\n\u2022\nupon the occurrence of specified corporate events.\nOn or after May 1, 2022, until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders may convert all or any portion of their 2022 Notes at the conversion rate at any time regardless of whether the conditions set forth below have been met.\nThe 2022 Notes were not redeemable by the Company prior to November 6, 2020. The Company may redeem for cash all or any portion of the 2022 Notes, at its option, on or after November 6, 2020 if the last reported sale price of the Company's common stock has been at least 130% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive), including the trading day immediately preceding the date on which the Company provides notice of redemption, during any 30 consecutive trading day period ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which the Company provides notice of redemption at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2022 Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date. The Company has not provided notice to exercise its option to redeem the 2022 Notes.\nEverbridge, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued)\nBased on the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock during the 30 trading days preceding June 30, 2018, the 2022 Notes were convertible at the option of the debt holder as of September 30, 2018 and continue to be convertible at the option of the debt holder as of December 31, 2020.\nIn connection with the issuance of the 2024 Notes in December 2019, the Company paid $57.8 million to repurchase $23.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 2022 Notes. The Company determined the fair value of the liability portion being extinguished immediately prior to extinguishment. Based on market data available for publicly traded, senior, unsecured corporate bonds issued by companies in the same industry and with similar maturity, the Company estimated the implied interest rate of its 2022 Notes to be approximately 4.64%. The fair value of such liability portion was then deducted from the amount of consideration transferred and allocated to the liability component. The difference between the fair value of the liability and its carrying value, inclusive of any unamortized debt issue costs, were recognized as an extinguishment loss in the amount of $1.4 million in Loss on extinguishment of convertible notes on the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss during the year ended December 31, 2019. The remaining consideration was allocated to the reacquisition of the equity component and recognized as a reduction of Additional paid-in capital on the consolidated balance sheet in the amount of $36.7 million. The Company also partially terminated capped call options entered into in connection with the 2022 Notes during fiscal year 2019 and received $5.8 million recorded to additional paid-in capital on the consolidated balance sheet.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company issued 362,029 shares upon the conversion of approximately $12.2 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2022 Notes and recognized $11.4 million in additional paid-in capital on the consolidated balance sheet related to shares issued. The Company determined the fair value of the liability portion being extinguished immediately prior to extinguishment. Based on market data available for publicly traded, senior, unsecured corporate bonds issued by companies in the same industry and with similar maturity, the Company estimated the implied interest rate of its 2022 Notes ranged from approximately 4.64% to 5.13%. The fair value of such liability portion was then deducted from the amount of consideration transferred and allocated to the liability component. The difference between the fair value of the liability and its carrying value, inclusive of any unamortized debt issue costs, were recognized as an extinguishment loss in the amount of $0.4 million in Loss on extinguishment of convertible notes on the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss during the year ended December 31, 2020. Of the $0.4 million Loss on extinguishment of convertible notes, $0.1 million Loss on extinguishment of convertible notes was recognized during the year ended December 31, 2020 related to a conversion notice which was received on December 31, 2020 and settled in January 2021.\nThe 2022 Notes are classified as long-term on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020. The Company may repurchase the 2022 Notes prior to maturity and intends to settle in shares if exercised by the debt holder prior to maturity.\nBased on market data available for publicly traded, senior, unsecured corporate bonds issued by companies in the same industry and with similar maturity, the Company estimated the implied interest rate of its 2022 Notes at the time of issuance to be approximately 6.93%, assuming no conversion option. Assumptions used in the estimate represent what market participants would use in pricing the equity component, including market interest rates, credit standing, and yield curves, all of which are defined as Level 2 observable inputs. The estimated implied interest rate was applied to the 2022 Notes, which resulted in a fair value of the liability component of $92.1 million upon issuance, calculated as the present value of implied future payments based on the $115.0 million aggregate principal amount. The excess of the principal amount of the liability component over its carrying amount, or the debt discount, is amortized to interest expense over the term of the 2022 Notes. The $22.9 million difference between the aggregate principal amount of $115.0 million and the estimated fair value of the liability component was recorded in additional paid-in capital as the 2022 Notes were not considered redeemable.\nIn accounting for the transaction costs related to the issuance of the 2022 Notes, the Company allocated the total amount incurred to the liability and equity components based on their estimated relative fair values. Transaction costs attributable to the liability component on the remaining outstanding notes as of the issuance date, totaling $2.2 million, are being amortized to expense over the term of the 2022 Notes, and transaction costs attributable to the\nEverbridge, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued)\nequity component as of the issuance date, totaling $0.8 million, and were netted with the equity component in shareholders\u2019 equity.\nThe 2022 Notes consist of the following (in thousands):\nAs of December 31,\nLiability component:\nPrincipal\n$\n79,795\n$\n92,000\nLess: debt discount, net of amortization\n(7,313\n)\n(12,776\n)\nNet carrying amount\n$\n72,482\n$\n79,224\nEquity component (1)\n(21,318\n)\n(14,555\n)\n(1)\nRecorded in the consolidated balance sheet within additional paid-in capital, net of $0.8 million transaction costs in equity.

The capped call transactions are expected to reduce potential dilution of earnings per share upon conversion of the 2022 Notes. Under the capped call transactions, the Company purchased capped call options that in the aggregate relate to the total number of shares of the Company\u2019s common stock underlying the 2022 Notes, with an initial strike price of approximately $33.71 per share, which corresponds to the initial conversion price of the 2022 Notes and is subject to anti-dilution adjustments substantially similar to those applicable to the conversion rate of the 2022 Notes, and have a cap price of approximately $47.20. The cost of the purchased capped calls of $12.9 million was recorded to shareholders\u2019 equity and will not be re-measured.\nBased on the closing price of the Company\u2019s common stock of $149.07 on December 31, 2020, the if-converted value of the 2022 Notes was more than their respective principal amounts.\nThe following table summarizes the Company\u2019s debt obligations at December 31, 2020 (in thousands):\nLess than\n1 Year\n1 to 3\nYears\n3 to 5\nYears\nMore than\n5 Years\nTotal\nDebt obligations\n$\n-\n$\n79,795\n$\n450,000\n$\n-\n$\n529,795\nEverbridge, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued)\nDebt obligations include the principal amount of the 2024 Notes and 2022 Notes but exclude interest payments to be made under the 2024 Notes and 2022 Notes. Although the 2024 Notes and 2022 Notes mature in 2024 and 2022, respectively, they can be converted into cash and shares of our common stock prior to maturity if certain conditions are met. Any conversion prior to maturity can result in repayments of the principal amounts sooner than the scheduled repayments as indicated in the table.

The 2016 Plan provides for the grant of incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, restricted stock awards, restricted stock unit awards, stock appreciation rights and performance share awards to employees, directors and consultants of the Company. The number of shares of common stock reserved for issuance under the 2016 Plan will automatically increase on January 1 of each year by 3% of the number of shares of the Company\u2019s capital stock outstanding on the immediately preceding December 31, or such lesser number of shares as determined by the Company\u2019s board of directors.\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan\nThe Company\u2019s Employee Stock Purchase Plan (\u201c2016 ESPP\u201d) became effective on September 15, 2016. The number of shares reserved for issuance under the 2016 ESPP will automatically increase on January 1 of each year by the lesser of 200,000 shares of the Company\u2019s common stock, 1% of the number of shares of the Company\u2019s common stock outstanding on the immediately preceding December 31, or such lesser number of shares as determined by the Company\u2019s board of directors.\nThe 2016 ESPP allows eligible employees to purchase shares of the Company\u2019s common stock at a discount of up to 15% through payroll deductions of their eligible compensation, subject to any plan limitations. The 2016 ESPP provides for separate six-month offering periods beginning each March and September of each fiscal year.\nOn each purchase date, eligible employees will purchase the Company\u2019s stock at a price per share equal to 85% of the lesser of (i) the fair market value of the Company\u2019s common stock on the offering date or (ii) the fair market value of the Company\u2019s common stock on the purchase date.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, 49,319, 42,481, and 74,517 shares of common stock, respectively, were purchased under the 2016 ESPP. As of December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, total recognized compensation cost was $1.4 million, $0.9 million, and $0.7 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, unrecognized compensation cost related to the 2016 ESPP was $0.4 million which will be amortized over a weighted-average period of 0.20 years.\nEverbridge, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued)\nStock Options\nStock option awards are granted with an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the Company\u2019s common stock at the date of grant based on the closing market price of its common stock as reported on The Nasdaq Global Market. The option awards generally vest over four years and are exercisable any time after vesting. The stock options expire ten years after the date of grant.\nThe weighted-average grant-date fair value per share of stock options granted for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $35.00. There were no stock options granted during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. The Company recorded stock-based compensation expense of $3.5 million, $5.7 million and $7.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, attributed to stock options.\nThe total intrinsic value of options exercised in 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $30.6 million, $48.2 million and $25.7 million, respectively. This intrinsic value represents the difference between the fair market value of the Company\u2019s common stock on the date of exercise and the exercise price of each option. Based on the fair market value of the Company\u2019s common stock at December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 the total intrinsic value of all outstanding options was $34.5 million, $37.3 million and $59.9 million, respectively.\nThere were no excess tax benefits realized for the tax deductions from stock options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.\nThe fair value of stock option grants and shares issuable under the ESPP is determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions:\nYear Ended December 31,\nEmployee Stock Options:\nFair value of common stock\n-\n-\n$33.06 - $58.75\nExpected term (in years) (1)\n-\n-\n6.00\nExpected volatility (2)\n-\n-\n45% - 50%\nRisk-free interest rate (3)\n-\n-\n2.72% - 2.98%\nDividend rate (4)\n-\n-\n0%\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan:\nExpected term (in years) (1)\n0.50\n0.50\n0.50\nExpected volatility (2)\n55% - 65%\n45%\n40% - 60%\nRisk-free interest rate (3)\n0.12% - 0.29%\n1.93% - 2.52%\n1.18% - 2.33%\nDividend rate (4)\n0%\n0%\n0%\n(1)\nThe expected term represents the period that the stock-based compensation awards are expected to be outstanding. Since the Company did not have sufficient historical information to develop reasonable expectations about future exercise behavior, the Company used the simplified method to compute expected term, which reflects the average of the time-to-vesting and the contractual life for stock options. The expected term represents the contractual term of the ESPP;\n(2)\nThe expected volatility of the Company\u2019s common stock on the date of grant is based on the weighted-average of the Company\u2019s historical volatility as a public company, the implied volatility of publicly-traded options on the Company\u2019s common stock and the volatilities of publicly traded peer companies that are reasonably comparable to the Company\u2019s own operations;\n(3)\nThe risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for zero coupon U.S. Treasury notes with maturities approximately equal to the expected term of the grant; and\n(4)\nThe expected dividend yield is assumed to be zero as the Company has never paid dividends and has no current plans to pay any dividends on the Company\u2019s common stock.\nTotal unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested stock options was approximately $1.4 million as of December 31, 2020 and is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 0.9 years. The amount of cash received from the exercise of stock options in 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $8.2 million, $17.4 million, and $10.2 million, respectively.\nEverbridge, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued)\nThe following table summarizes the Company\u2019s stock option activity:\nStock options\noutstanding\nWeighted\naverage\nexercise price\nOutstanding at December 31, 2019\n723,383\n$\n26.56\nExercised\n(323,838\n)\n25.20\nForfeited\n(120,524\n)\n32.57\nOutstanding at December 31, 2020\n279,021\n25.55\nStock options outstanding, vested and expected to vest and exercisable are as follows:\nAs of December 31, 2020\nNumber\nof shares\nRemaining\ncontractual\nlife (years)\nWeighted-\naverage\nexercise\nprice\nOutstanding\n279,021\n6.30\n$\n25.55\nVested and expected to vest\n277,328\n6.30\n25.50\nExercisable\n166,634\n5.90\n21.69\nVested and nonvested stock option activity was as follows:\nVested\nNonvested\nOptions\noutstanding\nWeighted\naverage\nexercise\nprice\nOptions\noutstanding\nWeighted\naverage\nexercise\nprice\nOutstanding at December 31, 2020\n166,634\n$\n21.69\n112,387\n$\n31.28\nRestricted Stock Units\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company granted 346,912 RSUs to members of its senior management and certain other employees pursuant to the 2016 Plan. The Company accounts for RSUs issued to employees at fair value, based on the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock on the date of grant. The weighted-average grant date fair values of RSUs granted during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 were $122.82, $80.16 and $52.11 respectively. The fair values of RSUs that vested during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, were $18.2 million, $11.9 million and $3.1 million, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the Company recorded $20.1 million, $16.3 million, and $5.4 million respectively, of stock-based compensation related to the RSUs. There were 315,111 RSUs that vested during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nAs of December 31, 2020, there was $50.7 million of unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested RSUs which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 2.4 years. For RSUs subject to graded vesting, the Company recognizes compensation cost on a straight-line basis over the service period for the entire award.\nEverbridge, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued)\nPerformance-Based Restricted Stock Units\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company granted 302,050 PSUs to members of its management pursuant to the 2016 Plan. The PSUs generally vest based on the Company achieving certain revenue growth thresholds which range from 20% to 40% compounded annual growth over a measurement period of two years for the first 50% of PSUs and three years for the remaining PSUs. The vesting of the PSUs is subject to the employee\u2019s continued employment with the Company through the date of achievement. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the share price of the Company\u2019s common stock on the date of issuance of the PSUs ranged from $82.23 to $158.95 per share. The fair value is based on the value of the Company\u2019s common stock at the date of issuance and the probability of achieving the performance metric. The Company has assessed the probability of achievement of the award at 100% based on past performance of achievement of the performance metric. Compensation cost is adjusted in future periods for subsequent changes in the expected outcome of the performance related conditions. The weighted-average grant date fair value of PSUs granted during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $119.78, $80.87 and $55.99, respectively. 136,768 PSUs vested during the year ended December 31, 2020. No PSUs vested during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the Company recognized $21.8 million, $10.6 million and $1.5 million, respectively, of stock compensation expense in connection with the PSU awards.\nAs of December 31, 2020, there was $37.5 million of unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested PSUs which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 1.8 years. Compensation cost is recognized under the accelerated method and is adjusted in future periods for subsequent changes in the expected outcome of the performance related conditions.\nMarket-Based Restricted Stock Units\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company granted no market-based RSUs pursuant to the 2016 Plan. The market-based RSUs granted prior to the year ended December 31, 2019 vested based on the Company achieving certain stock price thresholds, which ranged from $35 per share to $65 per share for 30 consecutive trading days as reported by The Nasdaq Stock Market, LLC, subject to the employee\u2019s continued employment with the Company through the date of achievement. The share price of the Company\u2019s common stock on the date of issuance of the market-based RSUs was between $33.06 and $45.17 per share. The fair value was based on values calculated under the Monte Carlo simulation model on the grant date. The key estimates used in the Monte-Carlo simulation were a risk-free rate of 2.26% to 2.90%, dividend yield of zero, expected term of 10 years and volatility of 50% to 60%. Compensation cost was not adjusted in future periods for subsequent changes in the expected outcome of market related conditions. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company recognized no stock compensation expense in connection with these awards. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company recognized $10.5 million of stock compensation expense in connection with these awards.\nAs of December 31, 2020, there was no unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested market-based awards.\nThe following table summarizes the Company\u2019s RSU and PSU activity:\nNumber of Shares\nOutstanding at December 31, 2019\n1,314,791\nGranted\n648,962\nVested\n(451,879\n)\nForfeited\n(91,333\n)\nOutstanding at December 31, 2020\n1,420,541\nEverbridge, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued)\nStock-Based Compensation Expense\nThe Company recorded the total stock-based compensation expense as follows (in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31,\nCost of revenue\n$\n2,954\n$\n1,966\n$\n2,306\nSales and marketing\n15,946\n9,983\n9,282\nResearch and development\n8,703\n7,820\n7,106\nGeneral and administrative\n19,152\n13,720\n7,131\nTotal\n$\n46,755\n$\n33,489\n$\n25,825\nStock-based compensation expense is recognized over the award\u2019s expected vesting schedule, which is reduced for forfeitures.\n(12) Basic and Diluted Net Loss per Share\nBasic net loss per common share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted net loss per share is computed by giving effect to all potential dilutive shares of common stock. Basic and diluted net loss per share of common stock were the same for all periods presented as the impact of all potentially dilutive securities outstanding was anti-dilutive. The Company uses the if converted method for convertible senior notes for calculating any potential dilutive effect on diluted loss per share.\nThe following common equivalent shares were excluded from the diluted net loss per share calculation because their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive:\nYear Ended December 31,\nConvertible senior notes\n6,371,882\n6,733,914\n3,411,199\nStock-based compensation grants\n1,699,562\n2,038,174\n2,562,274\nTotal\n8,071,444\n8,772,088\n5,973,473\nIn connection with the issuance of the 2024 Notes in December 2019, the Company paid $44.9 million to enter into capped call option agreements to reduce the potential dilution to holders of the Company\u2019s common stock upon conversion of the 2024 Notes. In connection with the issuance of the 2022 Notes in November 2017, the Company paid $12.9 million to enter into capped call option agreements to reduce the potential dilution to holders of the Company\u2019s common stock upon conversion of the 2022 Notes. In December 2019, the Company partially terminated capped call options related to the 2022 Notes and received $5.8 million. The capped call option agreements are excluded from the calculation of diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders as their effect is antidilutive.\nReserve for Unissued Shares of Common Stock\nThe Company is required to reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares of common stock such number of shares sufficient for the exercise of all shares granted and available for grant under the Company\u2019s 2008 Equity Incentive Plan, 2016 Plan and 2016 ESPP. The amount of such shares of the Company\u2019s common stock reserved for these purposes at December 31, 2020 was 4.8 million shares. Additionally, the Company is required to reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares of common stock shares that become issuable pursuant to the terms of the 2024 Notes and 2022 Notes.\nEverbridge, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued)\n(13) Income Taxes\nThe components of loss before income taxes are as follows (in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31,\nDomestic\n$\n(72,164\n)\n$\n(47,218\n)\n$\n(41,985\n)\nForeign\n(23,499\n)\n(4,607\n)\n(4,734\n)\nTotal\n$\n(95,663\n)\n$\n(51,825\n)\n$\n(46,719\n)\nFor purposes of reconciling the Company\u2019s provision for income taxes at the statutory rate and the Company\u2019s provision (benefit) for income taxes at the effective tax rate, a notional 21% tax rate was applied as follows (in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31,\nIncome tax at federal statutory rate\n$\n(20,089\n)\n$\n(10,883\n)\n$\n(9,811\n)\nIncrease (decrease) in tax resulting from:\nState income tax expense, net of federal tax effect\n(3,763\n)\n(3,657\n)\n(2,749\n)\nNondeductible permanent items\n1,659\n3,522\n(1,522\n)\nExecutive Compensation\n6,020\n-\n-\nForeign rate differential\n(156\n)\n(367\n)\nTax rate change\n-\n-\nAdjustment to deferred taxes\n(3,190\n)\n(1,904\n)\nChange in valuation allowance\n25,339\n22,481\n15,805\nUncertain tax positions\nNonqualified stock option and performance award windfall\nupon exercise\n(8,608\n)\n(9,128\n)\n(1,983\n)\nOther\n(80\n)\nTotal\n$\n(2,267\n)\n$\n$\nThe difference between the statutory federal income tax rate and the Company\u2019s effective tax rate in 2020, 2019 and 2018 is primarily attributable to the effect of state income taxes, difference between the U.S. and foreign tax rates, deferred tax state rate adjustments, share-based compensation, true up of deferred taxes, other non-deductible permanent items, and change in valuation allowance.

A significant piece of objective negative evidence evaluated was the cumulative loss incurred over the three-year period ended December 31, 2020. Such objective evidence limits the ability to consider other subjective evidence such as its projections for future growth. On the basis of this evaluation, at December 31, 2020 and 2019, a valuation allowance of $52.3 million and $24.6 million, respectively, has been recorded.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company has accumulated federal and state net operating loss (\u201cNOL\u201d) carryforwards of $240.1 million and $222.4 million, respectively. Of the $240.1 million of federal NOL carryforwards, $64.3 million was generated before January 1, 2018 and is subject to the 20-year carryforward period (\u201cpre-Tax Act losses\u201d). The remaining $175.8 million (\u201cpost-Tax Act losses\u201d) can be carried forward indefinitely but is subject to the 80% taxable income limitation. Of the $222.4 million of state NOL carryforwards, $76.2 million can be carried forward indefinitely. The pre-Tax Act U.S. federal and state net operating loss carryforwards will expire in varying amounts through 2040. The Company completed a Section 382 study for the period through March 31, 2019 and determined that a Section 382 ownership change occurred on December 31, 2017 subjecting all pre-Tax Act losses to a utilization limitation; however, such limitation is not expected to result in NOLs expiring unused. Any future annual limitation may result in the expiration of NOLs before utilization. Included in the Company\u2019s NOLs are federal and state NOLs of $9.2 million and $9.1 million, respectively, from various acquisitions which are subject to limitations under Section 382.\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company had combined foreign net operating loss carry-forwards available to reduce future taxable income of approximately $48.4 million and $25.6 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, valuation allowances of $29.9 million and $24.6 million, respectively, had been recorded against the related deferred tax assets for those loss carry-forwards that are not more likely than not to be fully utilized in reducing future taxable income.\nEverbridge, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued)\nThe following changes occurred in the amount of unrecognized tax benefits (in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31,\nBeginning balance of unrecognized tax benefits\n$\n$\n$\nAdditions for current year tax positions\nReductions for prior year tax positions\n-\n-\n(14\n)\nEnding balance (excluding interest and penalties)\nInterest and penalties\nTotal\n$\n$\n$\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the Company has recorded income tax expense of $151,000, $128,000 and $143,000, respectively, related to uncertain tax positions. The Company\u2019s policy is to recognize potential interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits associated with uncertain tax positions, if any, in the income tax provision. At December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the Company had accrued $20,000, $22,000 and $15,000, respectively, in interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions.\nThe Company is subject to taxation in the United States and various states along with other foreign countries. The Company has not been notified that it is under audit by the IRS or any state or foreign taxing authorities, however, due to the presence of NOL carryforwards, all of the income tax years remain open for examination in each of these jurisdictions. The Company does not believe that it is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease in the next 12 months.\nDeferred income taxes have not been provided for undistributed earnings of the Company\u2019s consolidated foreign subsidiaries because of the Company\u2019s intent to reinvest such earnings indefinitely in active foreign operations. At December 31, 2020, the Company had $7.5 million in unremitted earnings that were permanently reinvested related to its consolidated foreign subsidiaries.\n(14) Segment information\nThe Company operates as one operating segment. Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker (\u201cCODM\u201d), who is the Company\u2019s chief executive officer, in deciding how to allocate resources and assess the Company\u2019s financial and operational performance. While the Company has applications that address multiple use cases, the Company\u2019s applications generally operate on and leverage a single technology platform and are deployed and sold in an identical way. In addition, the Company\u2019s CODM evaluates the Company\u2019s financial information and resources and assesses the performance of these resources on a consolidated basis. As a result, the Company has determined that the Company\u2019s business operates in a single operating segment. Since the Company operates as one operating segment, all required financial segment information can be found in the consolidated financial statements.\n(15) Revenue Recognition\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (\"Topic 606\"). Topic 606 superseded the revenue recognition requirements in ASC Topic 605, Revenue Recognition (\"Topic 605\"), and requires the recognition of revenue when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the considerations to which the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. Topic 606 also includes Subtopic 340-40, Other Assets and Deferred Costs - Contracts with Customers, which requires the deferral of incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer. Collectively, the Company refers to Topic 606 and Subtopic 340-40 as the \"new revenue standard\" or \u201cASC 606.\u201d\nThe Company adopted the requirements of the new revenue standard as of January 1, 2018, utilizing the modified retrospective method of transition. The Company recognized the cumulative effect of initially applying the new revenue standard as an adjustment to the opening balance of accumulated deficit. Adoption of the new revenue standard resulted in changes to the Company\u2019s accounting policies for revenue recognition and deferred commissions as detailed below. The Company applied the new revenue standard using a practical expedient where\nEverbridge, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued)\nthe consideration allocated to the remaining performance obligations or an explanation of when the Company expects to recognize that amount as revenue for all reporting periods presented before the date of the initial application is not disclosed.\nBased on the results of the Company\u2019s evaluation, the adoption of the new revenue standard did not have a material impact on its revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018. The primary impact of adopting the new revenue standard relates to the deferral of incremental commission costs of obtaining subscription contracts. Under Topic 605, the Company deferred only direct and incremental commission costs to obtain a contract and amortized those costs over one year. Under the new revenue standard, the Company defers all incremental commission costs to obtain the contract. The Company amortizes costs for subscription-related commissions over a period of benefit that the Company has determined to be four years. Sales commissions attributable to professional services are expensed within twelve months of selling the service to the customer. Adoption of the new revenue standard had no impact on total cash provided from or used in operating, financing, or investing activities in the Company\u2019s consolidated statements of cash flows.\nThe cumulative effect of the changes made to the Company\u2019s consolidated January 1, 2018 balance sheet for the adoption of the new revenue standard was as follows (in thousands):\nBalance at\nDecember 31,\nAdjustments Due\nto ASC 606\nBalance at\nJanuary 1, 2018\nBALANCE SHEET\nAssets\nAccounts receivable, net\n$\n31,699\n$\n$\n31,799\nDeferred costs\n2,429\n2,132\n4,561\nDeferred costs (non-current)\n-\n6,965\n6,965\nLiabilities and Stockholders\u2019 Equity\nOther current liabilities\nDeferred revenue (current and non-current)\n73,072\n-\n73,072\nAccumulated deficit\n(109,252\n)\n9,097\n(100,155\n)\nThe following table disaggregates the Company\u2019s revenue by geography which provides information as to the major source of revenue (in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31,\nPrimary Geographic Markets\nUnited States\n$\n201,458\n$\n157,039\n$\n119,589\nInternational\n69,683\n43,843\n27,505\nTotal\n$\n271,141\n$\n200,882\n$\n147,094\nThe following table presents the Company\u2019s revenues disaggregated by revenue source (in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31,\nSubscription services\n$\n242,651\n$\n179,934\n$\n137,260\nProfessional services\n20,410\n17,187\n9,538\nSoftware licenses and other\n8,080\n3,761\nTotal\n$\n271,141\n$\n200,882\n$\n147,094\nContract Assets\nThe Company does not have material amounts of contract assets since revenue is recognized as control of goods is transferred or as services are performed. There are a small number of professional services that may occur over a\nEverbridge, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued)\nperiod of time, but that period of time is generally very short in duration. Any contract assets that may arise are recorded in other assets in the Company\u2019s consolidated balance sheet net of an allowance for credit losses.\nContract Liabilities\nThe Company\u2019s contract liabilities consist of advance payments and deferred revenue. The Company\u2019s contract liabilities are reported in a net position on a contract-by-contract basis at the end of each reporting period. The Company classifies advance payments and deferred revenue as current or noncurrent based on the timing of when it expects to recognize revenue. Generally, all contract liabilities are expected to be recognized within one year and are included in deferred revenue in the Company\u2019s consolidated balance sheet. The noncurrent portion of deferred revenue is included and separately disclosed in the Company\u2019s consolidated balance sheet.\nDeferred Costs\nCurrent deferred costs, which primarily consist of deferred sales commissions, were $14.5 million and $9.9 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Noncurrent deferred costs, which primarily consist of deferred sales commissions, were $15.9 million and $14.2 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, amortization expense for the deferred costs was $12.6 million, $8.0 million and $5.5 million, respectively. There was no impairment loss in relation to the costs capitalized.\nDeferred Revenue\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, $123.3 million, $86.2 million and $62.5 million, respectively, of subscription services, license and other revenue was recognized and was included in the deferred revenue balances at the beginning of the respective period. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, $6.6 million and $6.0 million, respectively, of professional services revenue was recognized and was included in the deferred revenue balance at the beginning of the period.\nAs of December 31, 2020, approximately $358.4 million of revenue is expected to be recognized from remaining performance obligations for subscription and other contracts. The Company expects to recognize revenue on approximately $212.8 million of these remaining performance obligations over the next 12 months, with the balance recognized thereafter.\nAs of December 31, 2020, approximately $16.5 million of revenue is expected to be recognized from remaining performance obligations for professional services contracts. The Company expects to recognize revenue on approximately $13.5 million of these remaining performance obligations over the next 12 months, with the balance recognized thereafter.\n(16) Geographic Concentrations\nRevenue by location is determined by the billing address of the customer. Approximately 74%, 78% and 81% of the Company\u2019s revenue was from the United States for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. No other individual country comprised more than 6% of total revenue for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. Property and equipment by geographic location is based on the location of the legal entity that owns the asset. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, more than 83% of the Company\u2019s property and equipment was located in the United States.\n(17) Employee Benefit Plan\nThe Company maintains a 401(k) plan for the benefit of the Company\u2019s eligible employees. The plan covers all employees who have attained minimum service requirements. The 401(k) plan allows each participant to contribute up to an amount not to exceed an annual statutory maximum. The Company may, at its discretion, make matching contributions to the 401(k) plan. There was $1.7 million, $1.2 million and $0.6 million cash contributions made to the plan by the Company for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Contribution\nEverbridge, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued)\nexpense recognized for the 401(k) plan was $1.7 million, $1.2 million and $0.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.\n(18) Leases\nThe Company\u2019s leases relate primarily to office facilities that expire on various dates from 2021 through 2029. The terms of the Company's non-cancelable operating lease arrangements typically contain fixed lease payment which increases over the term of the lease at fixed rates, rent holidays and provide for additional renewal periods. Lease expense is recognized over the term of the lease on a straight-line basis. All of the Company\u2019s leases are classified as operating leases. The Company has determined that periods covered by options to extend the Company\u2019s leases are excluded from the lease term as the Company is not reasonably certain the Company will exercise such options. Operating lease expense, including expenses related to short-term leases, were $6.0 million, $4.8 million and $3.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nThe Company records its ROU Assets within other assets (long term) and its operating lease liabilities within other current and long-term liabilities.\nAdditional information related to the Company\u2019s leases is as follows (in thousands, except lease term and discount rate):\nAs of December 31,\nBalance sheet information\nROU assets\n$\n15,045\n$\n13,071\nLease liabilities, current\n$\n4,259\n$\n3,567\nLease liabilities, non-current\n14,403\n11,823\nTotal lease liabilities\n$\n18,662\n$\n15,390\nSupplemental data\nWeighted average remaining lease term\n4.57 years\n4.11 years\nWeighted average discount rate\n7.00\n%\n7.00\n%\nYear Ended December 31,\nCash paid for amounts included in lease liabilities\n$\n4,891\n$\n3,986\nROU assets obtained in exchange for new lease obligations\n5,870\n17,724\nMaturities of lease liabilities as of December 31, 2020 were as follows (in thousands):\nYear ending December 31,\n$\n5,558\n5,268\n5,105\n2,635\nThereafter\n2,769\nTotal undiscounted lease payments\n22,264\nLess: imputed interest\n(3,602\n)\nTotal lease liabilities\n$\n18,662\nEverbridge, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued)\nThe following table presents components of lease expense (in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31,\nOperating lease expense\n$\n5,024\n$\n3,879\nShort-term lease expense(1)\n6,006\n4,837\nLess: Sublease income\n(236\n)\n(91\n)\nTotal lease expense\n$\n5,770\n$\n4,746\n(1)\nShort-term lease expense includes all leases with lease terms ranging from less than one month to one year.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company does not have any leases that have not yet commenced that create significant rights and obligations.\n(19) Commitments and Contingencies\nFor a summary of the Company\u2019s debt and lease obligations, see Notes 9 and 18, respectively.\n(a) Litigation\nFrom time to time the Company may become involved in legal proceedings or be subject to claims arising in the ordinary course of business. Although the results of litigation and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company currently believes that the final outcome of these ordinary course matters will not have a material adverse effect on its business, operating results, financial condition or cash flows. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources and other factors.\n(b) Employee Contracts\nThe Company has entered into employment contracts with certain of the Company\u2019s executive officers which provide for at-will employment. However, under the provisions of the contracts, the Company would incur severance obligations of up to twelve months of the executive\u2019s annual base salary for certain events, such as involuntary terminations.\n(20) Subsequent Events\nRed Sky Technologies Inc. Acquisition\nOn January 15, 2021, the Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with Red Sky Technologies Inc. (\u201cRed Sky\u201d) pursuant to which the Company purchased all of the issued and outstanding shares of stock of Red Sky for a base consideration of $55.4 million, net of cash acquired. The Company paid $32.4 million in cash, net of cash acquired, and issued 162,820 newly issued shares of the Company\u2019s common stock at closing. In addition to the base purchase price, there is also a potential contingent payment of up to approximately $30 million that can be earned by the sellers based on certain revenue targets through June 30, 2021. The Company acquired Red Sky to expand the Company\u2019s customer base and for its E911 incident response solutions platform to enhance the Company\u2019s CEM suite of solutions.\n2022 Notes Conversions\nFrom January 1, 2021 through February 26, 2021, the Company issued 581,829 shares of common stock to holders of the 2022 Notes for settlement of conversion of an aggregate principal amount of approximately $19.6 million of such notes."
