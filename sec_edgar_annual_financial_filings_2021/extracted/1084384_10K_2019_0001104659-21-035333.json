    "item_1": "Item 1. Business\nOverview\nPareteum Corporation (OTC: TEUM) is a rapidly growing cloud software communications platform company with a mission - to Connect Every Person and Every(Thing) \u2122.\nMillions of people and devices are connected around the world using Pareteum\u2019s global cloud software communications platform, enhancing their mobile experience. Pareteum\u2019s goal is to unleash the power of applications and mobile services, which we believe will bring secure, ubiquitous, scalable, and seamlessly available voice, video, SMS/text messaging, and data services to our customers, making worldwide communications services easily and economically accessible to everyone. By harnessing the value of our cloud communications platform, Pareteum serves enterprises, communications service providers, early-stage innovators, developers, Internet-of-Things (\u201cIoT\u201d), and telecommunications infrastructure providers.\nWith estimates of up to 30 billion devices to be managed and connected according to ABI Research, a market research firm that specializes in global connectivity and emerging technology, the total available market is vast. Service providers, brand marketing companies, and enterprise and IoT providers use Pareteum\u2019s cloud communication services and turnkey solutions featuring relevant content, applications, and connectivity worldwide. Pareteum integrates a variety of disparate communications methods and services and offers them to customers and application developers, allowing communications to become a value-added service. We believe that this is a major strategic goal for many industries, from legacy telecommunications providers to the disruptive technology and data enterprises of today and the future.\nThe vast majority of our platform is comprised of our internally-developed software and intellectual property, which provides our customers with flexibility in how they use our products and allows us to be market driven going forward. We have been granted more than 70 patents related to techniques and processes that support our cloud software and communications platform solutions. Our platform services partners (whose technologies are integrated into our cloud) include: Hewlett Packard Enterprise, IBM, AT&T, Amazon Web Services, Sonus, Veniam, Oracle, Microsoft, NetNumber, Affirmed Networks and other world-class technology providers.\nPareteum is a mission-focused company that seeks to empower \u201cEvery Person and Every(Thing)\u201d to be globally connected, hence our slogan - ANY DEVICE, ANY NETWORK, ANYWHERE\u2122. The Pareteum cloud communications platform targets large and growing sectors from IoT, Mobile Virtual Network Operators, Enablers and Aggretators (\u201cMVNO\u201d, \u201cMVNE\u201d and \u201cMVNA\u201d), Smart Cities, and Application developer markets - each in need of mobile platforms, management and connectivity. These sectors need Communications-Platform-as-a-Service (\u201cCPaaS\u201d), which Pareteum delivers.\nCoronavirus Pandemic\nIn March 2020, the novel coronavirus (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) began spreading across the globe and was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization; the President of the United States (\u201cU.S.\u201d) declared this a national emergency. The economic effects of the pandemic and resulting social changes are not predictable. There are a number of uncertainties arising from COVID-19 that have impacted and could continue to impact our operating results: the effectiveness of COVID-19 mitigation measures, the duration of the pandemic, the pace and effectiveness of vaccination efforts, and the effect on global economic conditions. Likewise, business operational changes, work from home, school from home and shop from home all impact consumer confidence and the availability of supply chains to support these activities. We expect operating and financial results to continue to be adversely impacted by COVID-19 for the duration of the pandemic.\nWe have seen an increase in usage consumption, particularly for messaging and consumer mobile services during the pandemic. However, our products and services for customers in the travel and hospitality industries have been and continue to be negatively impacted. We expect volatility in customer demand and consumption habits as the pandemic continues, and we may experience constrained supply or curtailed customer demand that could adversely impact our operations. Specifically, we have seen slowing sales cycles, including customers and prospective customers delaying contracts or renewals. Customers in the pipeline are uncertain and may minimize commitments related to the products and services we offer.\nInnovative Use Cases\nMany sectors, from traditional network operators to disruptive technology and data-driven companies, have found many innovative use cases for our platforms. Beyond simply enabling communications between people and devices, the Company\u2019s platforms are designed to enable any of the following, among others:\n\u2022 Smart homes, including smart appliances, smart energy meters, wearables etc.\n\u2022 Connected cars\n\u2022 Smart cities\n\u2022 Smart logistics and supply chains\n\u2022 Smart healthcare applications\nIn addition to the foregoing, as a result of acquisitions completed in October 2018 and February 2019, the Company has acquired certain intellectual property portfolios (the \u201cAcquired IP Rights\u201d), which it now manages through various wholly owned direct and indirect subsidiaries. The Company utilizes patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws in the U.S., Europe, and elsewhere to protect the Acquired IP Rights.\nBusiness Model\nAt Pareteum, our mission is to \u201cEmpower Consumer Service Providers (\u201cCSPs\u201d), Enterprises and Developers to simply create and control their own wireless communications products and experience through our powerful combination of software, services and global connectivity.\u201d We believe that open software and interfaces for communications services will create more innovation, economic freedom, and opportunity equality worldwide, just like the internet did for information. Our value proposition intersects with numerous applications and industries. It is our strong belief that no other company in the CPaaS market offers similarly broad value in such a comprehensive way.\nHowever, an easily accessible open mobility system for the world is challenging to scale because it requires a \u201cnetwork effect.\u201d The network effect is the principle that a service yields increased value as it grows. The essence of this point is that our business and our services will grow in value as we grow and scale. We aim to achieve that growth by providing the marketplace exchange on which these communications and transactions take place, and in doing so we attract new users and more customers.\nTo achieve our desired growth, we use our managed services solutions as a launching pad from which to grow our Pareteum Experience Cloud Platform by offering Mobility, Engagement, Intelligence and Control products and services to our existing and prospective customers. This process is already well underway, including with our anchor customer Vodafone.\nGo-to-Market and Growth Strategy\nPareteum is in growth mode, which we expect to achieve through a combination of organic growth as well as targeted mergers and acquisitions, such as the recent Artilium, iPass and Devicescape acquisitions.\nPareteum seeks to continue winning new long-term contractual business. We expect this pace to increase throughout 2021 and beyond. Our focus is on selling and implementing new communications services and IoT opportunities as fast as reasonably possible, as the world of connected devices and people continues to rise on a daily basis.\nOur go-to-market strategy uses a four-phase approach:\nPhase 1: Continue to attract new subscribers across all verticals to all our platforms through direct sales, existing channel partnerships and new initiatives such as referral programs.\nPhase 2: Continue to on-board new communications services providers, multiplying our own growth, largely through business development and direct sales in each of our six defined sales regions (North America, Latin America, Europe, Middle East, Africa, and Asia Pacific).\nPhase 3: Drive adoption through a twin approach. First, we will be on-boarding more \u201cthings\u201d (whether Subscriber Identification Module (\u201cSIM\u201d) cards, handsets, devices, vehicles etc.) to our Pareteum Experience Cloud Platform, as our initial user base. Second, we will be drawing in new and existing customers and end-users to add and consume more services into our existing Pareteum Experience Cloud Platform. These will be people with the greatest pain point, who are underserved by the current mobility networks and applications out in the market (including in developing markets).\nPhase 4: At this stage, our strategic Pareteum Experience Cloud Platform customers will have their own go-to-market strategy, creating shared value, ranging from traditional consumer strategies to sophisticated B2B and B2B2C strategies, driving and expanding our ecosystem to new heights.\nThe phases described above are already being implemented, in parallel as far as possible, for the fastest, most sustainable growth, highlighting our strategy for accelerating the world\u2019s shift to an open mobility and application network. When we\u2019re successful, we believe it may accelerate the pace of innovation in the world, create more economic freedom, and provide better mobility services to billions of underserved people.\nWe also follow an organic growth plan focused on three core areas:\n\u2022 Exploring cross and up-sale opportunities among Pareteum\u2019s recent customer acquisitions - focused on offering new products and services that complement or supplement their existing or future needs so to accelerate their strategy;\n\u2022 Platform evolution - enhance and expand existing products and services; and\n\u2022 Geographic expansion-focusing on entering new markets such as South East Asia and Latin America.\nEmployees\nAs of December 31, 2019, the Company had 218 full and part-time employees worldwide.\nResearch & Development\nPareteum\u2019s research and development function attempts to ensure that its communications platforms grow in line with customer needs and technological advancement, and remain resilient, reliable and secure. Product development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 were $12.8 million and $3.1 million, respectively.\nIntellectual Property\nPareteum relies on a combination of patents, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere. The Company protects its brand and reputation through the exploitation of a number of registered and unregistered trademarks and service marks. Pareteum has two granted patents for inventions embedded in its communications platforms, and with the addition of Artilium and iPass has a patent portfolio of over 70 granted patents. The current patent portfolio includes, but is not limited to, a set of developments embracing areas such as advanced network characterization and migration, automated configuration for network appliances, method and system for changing security information in a computer network, method and system for verifying and updating the configuration of an access device during authentication, service quality monitoring process, system and method for enabling wireless social networking and systems and methods for network curation, all expiring throughout 2034, and subject to renewals.\nPareteum further protects its intellectual property rights by requiring all its employees and independent contractors involved in the development of intellectual property to assign those rights to the Company, to the greatest extent permitted by applicable law.\nSales & Marketing\nPareteum\u2019s sales and marketing teams work together to identify and establish relationships with prospective customers, acquire new ones and expand relationships with existing customers by encouraging their consumption of additional services and products existing in our Pareteum Experience Cloud Platform. Our marketing team generates leads through our website, online marketing campaigns, webinars, white papers, public relations and other outbound lead development efforts.\nWe engage with prospective and existing customers through an enterprise sales approach. Our sales executives directly engage C-Level executives and other senior business, product and technical decision makers responsible for the end-user experience and financial results at their companies. Our sales executives work to educate these decision makers and their teams about the benefits of using Pareteum Experience Cloud Platform to launch and scale robust communications experiences.\nCustomers\nOur customers are tier 1 communications service providers that provide telecommunications services to end-users, Fortune 1,000 companies, mobile virtual network enablers of all sizes, software developers, banks, financial and online payment services companies, global consulting companies, mobile marketing platforms, telecommunications applications, and many others.\nA customer advocate is assigned to each new contract, and a multi-step process of handoff from sales to service is handled by this distinct team that is made up of experienced staff around the globe and supported by back office professionals throughout the U.S., United Kingdom, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Asia Pacific and Latin America.\nPareteum provides multiple levels of customer support, including 24x7 support, to ensure service levels and network reliability to meet the expectations and requirements of Pareteum\u2019s customers. We believe that customers that use the Pareteum Experience Cloud Platform value our network reliability and availability, responsive customer support, competitive pricing, and collaborative approach.\nThe Company has a significant customer and the loss of this customer could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial conditions. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, this significant customer accounted for approximately 20% and 64% of our revenues.\nCompetition\nWe compete with telecommunications solution providers, cloud software and service providers, communications\u2019 platforms, and the in-house IT and network departments of communications companies as well as firms that provide IT services (including consulting, systems integration and managed services), software vendors that sell products for particular aspects of a total information system, software vendors that specialize in systems for particular communications services (such as Internet, land-line and mobile services, cable, satellite and service bureaus) and companies that offer software systems in combination with the sale of network equipment.\nWe believe that our ability to compete depends on several factors, including:\n\u2022 the development of software products by others that are competitive with our products and services;\n\u2022 the price at which others offer competitive software and services;\n\u2022 the ability to make use of the networks of mobile network operators;\n\u2022 the technological changes of telecommunication operators affecting our ability to run services over their networks;\n\u2022 the ability of competitors to deliver projects at a level of quality that rivals our own;\n\u2022 the responsiveness of our competitors to customer needs; and\n\u2022 the ability of our competitors to hire, retain and motivate key personnel.\nA number of our competitors have long operating histories, large customer bases, substantial financial, technical, sales, marketing and other resources, and strong name recognition. Current and potential competitors have established, and may establish in the future, cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties.\nThe CPaaS market is moving quickly. We believe that the key competitive differentiators for Pareteum in the near-term will be:\n\u2022 Scale and international reach of connectivity\n\u2022 Comprehensiveness of platform offerings\n\u2022 Ease of deployment and implementation\n\u2022 Scalability and reliability of service\nPareteum considers itself well-placed to be judged on those criteria. The Company is confident that its network of global and international connectivity partners will enable it to access markets that currently are under-served and compete equally with larger competitors in mature markets. In addition, Pareteum is confident that few other players have the breadth of value-added services to complement the core connectivity platforms, resulting in competitive positioning for each of the areas where it competes:\n\u2022 Mobile Virtual Network Enabler (\u201cMVNE\u201d) services for CSPs: In a fragmented market without large competitors, Pareteum is well-known in the industry for a wide range of platform functionalities and high-flexibility to adapt to customer needs and accommodate complex requirements at a competitive price. As a result, Pareteum is serving leading CSPs in Europe, Asia Pacific, North America, Latin American and Africa, untapping solid growth potential in each of these markets.\n\u2022 Wi-Fi Connectivity aggregation for Enterprise customers: Pareteum has built an extensive Wi-Fi footprint with exclusive deals, covering more hotels, airports, business, leisure and outdoor areas. Pareteum offers a unified user experience with seamless access across Wi-Fi hotspots to blue chip customers, with a variety of successful business models.\n\u2022 Short Message Service Application-To-Person (\u201cSMS A2P\u201d) messaging for Enterprise customers: Leveraging global connectivity agreements enabling competitive price points and a strong competitive position in Europe, Pareteum offers fully programmable B2C messaging across a wide range of mobile and social channels with simple Application Programming Interface (\u201cAPI\u201d) integration.\n\u2022 IoT connectivity platform for IoT solution providers: Leveraging on the above capabilities, Pareteum is in an advantageous position to build a unique proposition for IoT solution providers that would benefit from the large growth potential in IoT. The foundations are in place and Pareteum has already received very positive commercial traction.\nNevertheless, some of our competitors have greater financial, technical and sales and marketing resources, as well as greater brand and market awareness, and consequently may be able to react more quickly to competitive pressures. As we execute on our growth strategies, and enter new markets, or disrupt markets and replace incumbents, we expect competition to become more intense.\nOne key tenet in our competitive strategy, however, is to actually lower the competitive barriers to market for new customers to create new mobility and communications applications and businesses. We intend to disrupt existing markets and have the advantage of quick time-to-market for those newly enabled business models and opportunities. These include, for example:\n\u2022 Uniquely tailored data services such as unlimited social media, messaging apps or streaming music services.\n\u2022 Global roaming connectivity without local infrastructure: e.g., business executives using a multi-SIM worldwide phone.\n\u2022 Creation of personal, branded, mobile services.\n\u2022 One-stop shop for bundles of IoT and machine-to-machine (\u201cM2M\u201d) services: through plug-ins to multiple vertical applications and specialized platforms. One-stop shop for current and next-gen Global System for Mobile (\u201cGSM\u201d) communications and Wi-Fi connectivity, deployed seamlessly through our CPaaS solutions.\nRegulatory\nPareteum is subject to several U.S. federal, state and foreign laws and regulations that involve matters central to our business. These laws and regulations involve privacy, data protection, intellectual property, telecommunications, trade and export sanctions or other subjects. Many of the laws and regulations to which we are subject are still evolving and may be tested or varied in courts and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business. In addition, the application and interpretation of these laws and regulations are often uncertain, particularly in the new and rapidly evolving markets in which we operate. Because applicable international laws and regulations have continued to develop and evolve rapidly, it is possible that we, our products or our platform may not be, or may not have been, compliant with each such applicable law or regulation.\nPrivacy and Data Protection\nThe regulatory framework for privacy, data protection and security issues worldwide is complex and rapidly evolving and as a result, implementation standards and enforcement practices are likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. These data privacy laws and regulations are especially relevant and applicable to us as a technology company because we process vast amounts of personal and non-personal data on behalf of our customers and we also host significant and increasing amounts of data in our cloud solutions. The application of existing laws to cloud-based solutions is particularly uncertain and cloud-based solutions may be subject to further regulation, the impact of which cannot be fully understood at this time. Moreover, it is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data processing and privacy practices. Complying with these various laws and regulations may cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business.\nBecause the interpretation and application of many privacy and data protection laws along with contractually imposed industry standards are uncertain, it is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our existing data management practices or the features of our services and platform capabilities. If so, in addition to the possibility of fines, lawsuits, regulatory investigations, imprisonment of company officials and public censure, other claims and penalties, significant costs for remediation and damage to our reputation, we could be required to fundamentally change our business activities and practices or modify our services and platform capabilities and/or implement additional organizational and technical measures, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business.\nAny failure by us, our suppliers or other parties with whom we do business to comply with our contractual commitments, policies or with federal, state, local or international regulations could result in proceedings against us by governmental, regulatory and supervisory authorities or others. In many jurisdictions (especially the European Union), enforcement actions and consequences for noncompliance are rising. In the U.S., these include enforcement actions in response to rules and regulations promulgated under the authority of federal agencies, state attorneys general and legislatures and consumer protection agencies. In addition, security advocates and industry groups have regularly proposed, and may propose in the future, self-regulatory standards with which we must legally comply or that contractually apply to us. If we fail to follow these security standards even if no personal information is compromised, we may incur significant fines or experience a significant increase in costs.\nInternationally, most jurisdictions in which we operate, have established or strengthened their own data security and privacy legal framework with which we or our customers must comply, including but not limited to the European Union (\u201cEU\u201d), the United Kingdom (\u201cUK\u201d) and Switzerland. The EU\u2019s and UK\u2019s data protection landscape changed significantly in 2018, resulting in significant operational costs for internal compliance and risk to our business. The EU adopted the General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d), which went into effect back in May 2018, and together with national legislation, regulations and guidelines of the EU, UK and Switzerland, ushered in a new and complex data protection regime including principles, rights and obligations with extraterritorial reach of EU, UK and Swiss data protection authorities. The European data protection and security laws, including GDPR, provide for extensive data subject rights, robust obligations on data controllers and processors and additional requirements on businesses to put in place data protection and security compliance programs, systems and processes. Continued evolvement of, and varied implementation and interpretation of such European data protection and security laws has increased, and continues to extend, our obligations and potential liability for failing to meet these requirements and our obligations under such laws. Among other requirements, the GDPR (and its UK equivalent commonly referred to as \u201cUK GDPR\u201d) regulates transfers of personal data (subject to such laws) from the European Economic Area (\u201cEEA\u201d) and the UK to the U.S. as well as other third countries outside EEA and the UK which are deemed not to provide adequate standards of data protection to the levels required by GDPR. The recent European Court of Justice judgement in July 2020 which nullified the EU-US Privacy Shield, its critical remarks about lack of data protection safeguards for non-US nationals, and subsequent and consequent measures taken by European data protection regulators in response to this judgement, has increased uncertainty in respect of data transfers from the EEA, UK and Switzerland to the US, creating serious challenges, uncertainties and increased costs for businesses such as ours. The GDPR and UK GDPR also impose numerous privacy-related obligations and requirements for companies operating in the EU and the UK including requiring data controllers not to transfer personal data to US-based processors unless they agree to certain legally binding processing obligations, greater control for data subjects (for example, the \u201cright to be forgotten\u201d), increased data portability for EU and UK consumers, data breach notification requirements and exposure to substantial fines for non-compliance. Under the GDPR and UK GDPR, fines of up to 20 million euros or 4% of the annual global revenue of the non-compliant company, whichever is greater, could be imposed for violations of certain of the GDPR\u2019s and UK GDPR\u2019s requirements. Such penalties are in addition to any civil litigation claims by customers and data subjects. The frequency and quantum of fines imposed by EU and UK data protection regulators under GDPR and UK GDPR has been increasing since 2019. The GDPR and UK GDPR requirements apply not only to third-party transactions, but also to transfers of information between us and our subsidiaries and affiliates, including employee personal data.\nOn January 31, 2020, the UK ceased to be a member of the EU, an event generally referred to as \u201cBrexit\u201d. Following the end of the transition period on 31 December 2020, the UK left the EU Single Market and Customs Union, and is no longer subject to EU law or a party to the EU\u2019s trade agreements. Effective from 1 January 2021, the free movement of persons, goods, services and capital between the UK and the EU, as it existed before 31 December 2020, ended and the EU and the UK now form two separate markets; two distinct regulatory and legal spaces. This will create barriers to trade in goods, services and to cross-border mobility and exchanges (including data) that did not exist prior to 31 December 2020.\nEven though the UK reached an agreement with the EU on the terms of their future cooperation, as reflected in the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA) and related documents, and the UK government has sought to reproduce the effects of the EU trading agreements and EU laws (including the implementation of GDPR into UK law (now commonly referred to as UK GDPR) that previously applied to it, material changes took effect from 1 January 2021. It is unclear how the TCA will actually be implemented, how it will affect the nature of the UK\u2019s relationship with the EU and how it will impact our business. It is also unclear how the UK\u2019s new arrangements with other countries will actually be implemented and the coverage of those agreements. The effects of this uncertainty will continue to impact the political and economic environment in the UK and across other EU member states, and may impair our ability to transact business. This uncertainty could also continue to affect the UK, the EU and worldwide economic or market conditions and contribute to instability in global financial markets, and the value of the pound sterling or other currencies, including the Euro.\nAdditionally, now that the UK and EU regulatory and legal spaces are distinct and separate, the regulatory frameworks of the UK and the EU may subsequently change and potentially divergent laws and regulations may develop, including those relating to data protection and security. This may have adverse practical and/or operational implications for our business which involves data processing and cross-border data transfers, including the potential disruption to data transfers, additional compliance and operational costs and necessary operational changes.\nAlthough the current arrangements between the EU and UK permit flow of data between these two regions for a period of up to 6 months from 1 January 2021, the European Commission has not yet made any determination as to whether UK is a safe country for personal data transfer. Even if such finding is made, with the UK not required to follow EU laws, there is an increased risk of divergence in data protection and security laws (and related guidance) between the UK and the EU, with the possibility of EU restricting data flows to the UK and vice versa. This has the potential to cause disruption to data transfers and our operations and result in additional compliance and operational costs.\nNon-compliance with relevant data privacy laws, directives and regulations, such as the GDPR and UK GDPR, could result in proceedings against us by governmental regulatory and supervisory authorities, customers, suppliers, data subjects and others. We may also experience difficulty retaining or obtaining new European or multi-national customers due to the legal requirements, concerns about US data protection safeguards for non-US nationals, compliance cost, potential risk exposure and uncertainty for these entities and businesses, and we may experience significantly increased liability with respect to these customers pursuant to the terms set forth in our engagements with them.\nU.S. federal and state laws in this area are also complex and developing rapidly. Many state legislatures have adopted legislation that regulates how businesses operate online, including measures relating to privacy, data security and data breaches, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Federal Trade Commission, have adopted, or are considering adopting, laws and regulations concerning personal information and data security. In addition, laws in all 50 states require businesses to provide notice to customers whose personally identifiable information has been disclosed as a result of a data breach. The laws are not consistent, and compliance in the event of a widespread data breach is costly. States are also constantly amending existing laws, requiring attention to frequently changing regulatory requirements. Further, California recently enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, which took effect on January 1, 2020 and imposes obligations on companies that process personal information of California residents. The CCPA was amended prior to going into effect, and it is possible that further amendments will be enacted, but even in its current form it remains unclear how various provisions of the CCPA will be interpreted and enforced. Among other things, the CCPA gives California residents expanded rights to access and delete their personal information, opt out of certain personal information sharing and receive detailed information about how their personal information is used. The CCPA also provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches that is expected to increase data breach litigation. The CCPA may increase our compliance costs and potential liability. Some observers have noted that the CCPA could mark the beginning of a trend toward more stringent privacy legislation in the U.S., which could increase our potential liability and adversely affect our business.\nBecause the interpretation and application of many privacy and data protection laws along with contractually imposed industry standards are uncertain, it is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our existing data management practices or the features of our services and platform capabilities. If so, in addition to the possibility of fines, lawsuits, regulatory investigations, imprisonment of company officials and public censure, other claims and penalties, significant costs for remediation and damage to our reputation, we could be required to fundamentally change our business activities and practices or modify our services and platform capabilities and/or implement additional organizational and technical measures, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business.\nAny inability to adequately address privacy and security concerns, even if unfounded, or comply with applicable privacy and data security laws, regulations, contractual obligations and policies, could result in additional cost and liability to us, damage our reputation, inhibit sales and have a material and adverse effect on our business. Furthermore, the costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, the laws, regulations, contractual obligations and policies that are applicable to the businesses of our customers may limit the use and adoption of, and reduce the overall demand for, our services. Privacy and data security concerns, whether valid or not valid, may inhibit market adoption of our services, particularly in certain industries and foreign countries. If we are not able to adjust to changing laws, regulations and standards related to the Internet, our business may be harmed.\nTelecommunications Regulations\nCurrently, few existing laws or regulations specifically apply to the Internet, other than laws generally applicable to businesses. Many Internet-related laws and regulations, however, are pending and may be adopted in the U.S., in individual states and local jurisdictions and in other countries. These laws may relate to many areas that impact our business, including encryption, network and information security, and the convergence of traditional communication services, such as telephone services, with Internet communications, taxes and wireless networks. These types of regulations could differ between countries and other political and geographic divisions both inside and outside the U.S. Non-U.S. countries and political organizations may impose, or favor, more and different regulation than that which has been proposed in the U.S., thus furthering the complexity of regulation. Certain countries have implemented, or may implement, legislative and technological actions that either do or can effectively regulate access to the Internet, including the ability of Internet Service Providers to limit access to specific websites or content. In addition, state and local governments within the U.S. may impose regulations in addition to, inconsistent with, or stricter than federal regulations. The adoption of such laws or regulations, and uncertainties associated with their validity, interpretation, applicability and enforcement, may affect the available distribution channels for, and the costs associated with, our products and services. The adoption of such laws and regulations may harm our business.\nCorporate Information\nPareteum Corporation, a Delaware corporation, was originally formed in 2001 as Elephant Talk Communications Corp. as a result of a merger between Staruni Corporation (USA, 1962) and Elephant Talk Limited (Hong Kong, 1994).\nIn December 2011, the Company moved its listing from the OTCBB to the NYSE MKT (now known as the NYSE American) and its stock began trading at that time under the ticker symbol \u201cETAK.\u201d\nFollowing approval at the Company\u2019s 2016 annual stockholders\u2019 meeting, the Company was rebranded and formally renamed to \u201cPareteum Corporation\u201d and on November 3, 2016, the Company\u2019s ticker symbol on the NYSE American was changed to \u201cTEUM.\u201d On October 23, 2018, the Company moved its listing to The Nasdaq Capital Market under its current ticker symbol \u201cTEUM.\u201d On November 10, 2020, Nasdaq notified the Company by letter that the Company\u2019s common stock would be delisted and, accordingly, trading of the Company\u2019s common stock on Nasdaq\u2019s Capital Market was suspended effective at the open of business on November 12, 2020 and prices for the Company\u2019s common stock have since been quoted on the OTC Markets Group Inc.\u2019s Pink Open Market.

In connection with the Artilium Acquisition, the Company issued an aggregate of 37,511,447 shares of the Company\u2019s common stock to Artilium stockholders and cancelled 3,200,332 shares of common stock that were held by Artilium pre-acquisition. Artilium is a software development company active in the enterprise communications and core telecommunications markets delivering software solutions which layer over disparate fixed, mobile and IP networks to enable the deployment of converged communications services and applications. See Note 2, Acquisitions to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report for additional information.\nFinancial Information About Segments\nThe Company has three operating segments, Legacy Pareteum, Artilium and iPass, which have been aggregated into one reportable segment. Segment information is prepared on the same basis that our chief operating decision-maker (\u201cCODM\u201d) manages segments, evaluates financial results, and makes key operating decisions, and for which discrete financial information is available. The CODM assesses performance of the Company\u2019s major lines of business, MVNO, MVNE, Messaging, and Enterprise (\u201cBusiness Lines\u201d), based on revenues, however the lowest level of discrete financial information, including revenues, cost of sales, gross margin and earnings, is at the primary business units, which represent the Company\u2019s operating segments. The CODM makes resource allocation decisions, primarily regarding the number of employees allocated, based on revenues, gross margin, earnings and cash flows on a consolidated basis. The CODM is not provided and does not use asset information when making operating decisions, assessing performance, or allocating resources. For additional information regarding our reportable segment, see \u201cNote 1, Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Revenue Recognition and Reporting Segment\u201d in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report.",
    "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nAn investment in our common stock is subject to risks inherent in our business. Before making an investment decision, you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information included in this report. In addition to the risks and uncertainties described below, other risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. The value or market price of our common stock could decline due to any of these identified or other risks, and you could lose all of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nThe restatement of our previously issued financial statements contained in Amendment No. 1 to our Annual Report for the year ended December 31, 2018 on Form 10-K/A and in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, may lead to additional risks and uncertainties, including regulatory, stockholder or other actions, loss of investor confidence and negative impacts on our stock price.\nOn October 21, 2019, our board of directors determined that the Company\u2019s financial statements that were included in its annual report for the year ended December 31, 2018 and quarterly reports for the quarters ended March 31, 2019 and June 30, 2019 (collectively, the \u201cNon-Reliance Periods\u201d) should no longer be relied upon. Similarly, related press releases, earnings releases, and investor communications describing the Company\u2019s financial statements for the Non-Reliance Periods should no longer be relied upon. The Company restated its financial statements for a portion of the Non-Reliance Periods in the previously filed amendments to our Annual Report for the year ended December 31, 2018 on Form 10-K/A. This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains restated financial statements for the Non-Reliance Periods in 2019.\nAs a result of these restatements and associated non-reliance on previously issued financial information, we have become subject to a number of additional costs and risks, including unanticipated costs for accounting and legal fees in connection with or related to the restatement and the remediation of our ineffective disclosure controls and procedures and material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting. Likewise, the attention of our management team has been diverted by these efforts. In addition, we have become subject to, and could also be subject to additional, stockholder, governmental, regulatory or other actions or demands in connection with the restatement or other matters. Any such proceedings will, regardless of the outcome, consume a significant amount of management\u2019s time and attention and may result in additional legal, accounting, insurance and other costs. If we do not prevail in any such proceedings, we could be required to pay damages or settlement costs. In addition, the restatement and related matters could impair our reputation or could cause our customers, stockholders, or other counterparties to lose confidence in us. Any of these occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price. In connection with the restatement of our financial statements for the Non-Reliance Periods, our management identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, as described in Item 9A, \u201cControls and Procedures\u201d of this report. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies in internal controls over financial reporting that results in a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Further, management determined that control deficiencies existed with respect to certain aspects of our historical financial reporting and, accordingly, management has concluded that management\u2019s reports related to the effectiveness of internal and disclosure controls may not have been correct. As a result, loss of investor confidence and negative impacts on our stock price are possible.\nOur business may be adversely impacted by risks, or the public perception of the risks, related to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe outbreak of COVID-19 has resulted in a widespread health crisis that has adversely affected the economies and financial markets of many countries, resulting in a global economic downturn. As a response to the spread of COVID-19 many countries, including the U.S., Great Britain and other jurisdictions in Europe, South America and the Middle East where we have employees, have been taking measures designated to limit the continued spread of COVID-19, including the closure of workplaces, restricting travel, prohibiting assembling, closing international borders and quarantining populated areas. Governments around the world have passed temporary emergency orders requiring all residents to remain in their homes along with limitations on which businesses are allowed to remain open and the number of workers allowed at each site. Although many of these orders have been partially lifted in certain jurisdictions, the effects of these indefinite travel restrictions and alternative working arrangements are unknown, may negatively impact the productivity of our employee base, and may have a negative effect on our sales and operations functions, which could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nWhile the full impact of the COVID-19 outbreak is unknown at this time, we are closely monitoring the developments and continually assessing the potential impact on our business. Our business may be adversely affected by the COVID-19 outbreak due to the following risks, any of which may lead to an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations:\n\u2022 a number of our employees may be infected and/or subject to quarantine periods and may be unable to perform their duties and our offices may be forced to operate with a reduced workforce and/or be forced to close under the temporary emergency regulations. This may lead to ineffective control over our business and a lower work efficiency, productivity and financial performance;\n\u2022 a reduced workforce, lack of international travel, and few face-to-face meetings with customers and potential customers may adversely affect our operations;\n\u2022 we may experience difficulties in collecting amounts due from customers, including major customers, due to a downturn in their financial condition; and\n\u2022 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, a significant number of our employees have moved to work from their homes and remotely access our IT networks. Such remote working mode creates the risk of attacking the end-point user stations, connection channels and gateways. These potential breaches of our security measures may harm our business.\nHistorically, a significant portion of our sales were conducted in person. Currently, as a result of the work and travel restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic, substantially all of our sales and professional services activities are being conducted remotely. As of the date of this Annual Report, we do not yet know the extent of the negative impact on our ability to attract, serve or retain customers. Furthermore, as a result of uncertainty due to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as general economic uncertainty and associated macroeconomic conditions, existing and potential customers may choose to reduce or delay technology spending in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, or attempt to renegotiate contracts and obtain concessions, which may materially and negatively impact our operating results, financial condition and prospects. This could result in reductions in sales of our platform and services, longer sales cycles, reductions in subscription duration and value, slower adoption of new technologies and increased price competition. Any of these events could harm our business and operating results. In addition, there can be no assurance that cloud-based collaborative work management and productivity spending levels will increase following any recovery, which could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nThe number of companies whose employees are working remotely as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting government-ordered shutdowns has caused use of our platform to increase. If our data centers are unable to keep up with this increased usage, customers may experience delays or interruptions in service, which could result in the loss of customers who use our communications platform because of its reliability and performance, which could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nOur independent auditor\u2019s report contains an explanatory paragraph that expresses a substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm\u2019s report on our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2019 contains a paragraph expressing substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Based on our current projection of revenue, expenses, capital expenditures and cash flows, we will not have sufficient resources to fund our operations and meet the obligations specified in the documents governing our convertible financing for the next twelve months following the filing of this Annual Report. Our software platforms require ongoing funding to continue the current development and operational plans and we have a history of net losses. We believe that we will continue to expend substantial resources for the foreseeable future in connection with the continued development of our software platforms. These expenditures will include costs associated with research and development activity, corporate administration, business development, and marketing and selling of our services. In addition, other unanticipated costs may arise. As a result, we believe that additional capital will be required to fund our operations. To access capital to fund operations and provide growth capital to meet the obligations under our outstanding convertible note, we may need to restructure our convertible indebtedness and raise capital in one or more debt and/or equity offerings. However, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in raising the necessary capital or that any such offering will be available to us on terms acceptable to us, or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital that may be needed on terms acceptable to us, it could have a material adverse effect on the Company. Furthermore, the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly disrupted world financial markets, negatively impacted U.S. market conditions and may reduce opportunities for us to seek out additional funding. In particular, a decline in the market price of our common stock, coupled with the suspension of trading of our common stock on the Nasdaq Stock Market, could make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem appropriate. For these reasons, the audit report of our independent registered public accountants on our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2019 contains an explanatory paragraph stating that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nThe current economic climate, especially in Europe, may have an adverse effect in the markets in which we operate.\nMuch of our customers\u2019 business is consumer driven, and to the extent there is a decline in consumer spending, our customers could experience a reduction in the demand for their services and consequently affect the demand for our services and a decrease in our revenues, net income and an increase in bad debts arising from non-payment of our trade receivables. The potential adverse effects of an economic downturn include:\n\u2022 reduced demand for services, resulting in increased price competition or deferrals of purchases, with lower revenues not fully compensated through reduced costs;\n\u2022 risk of financial difficulties or failures among our suppliers;\n\u2022 increased demand for customer finance, difficulties in collection of accounts receivable and increased risk of counterparty default;\n\u2022 risk of impairment losses related to our intangible assets as a result of lower forecasted sales of certain products;\n\u2022 increased difficulties in forecasting sales and financial results as well as increased volatility in our reported results; and\n\u2022 end-user demand could also be adversely affected by reduced consumer spending on technology, changed operator pricing, security breaches and trust issues.\nUncertainties and risks associated with international markets could adversely impact our international operations.\nWe have significant international operations in Europe, and to a lesser extent in the U.S., Middle East and elsewhere. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain the permits and operating licenses required for us to operate, obtain access to local transmission facilities on economically acceptable terms, or market services in international markets. In addition, operating in international markets generally involves additional risks, including unexpected changes in regulatory requirements, taxes, tariffs, customs, duties and other trade barriers, difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations, problems in collecting accounts receivable, political risks, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, restrictions associated with the repatriation of funds, technology export and import restrictions, and seasonal reductions in business activity. Our ability to operate and grow our international operations successfully could be adversely impacted by these risks.\nWe operate in a complex regulatory environment, and failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could adversely affect our business.\nOur operations are subject to a broad range of complex and evolving laws and regulations. Because of our coverage in many countries, we must perform our services in compliance with the legal and regulatory requirements of multiple jurisdictions. Some of these laws and regulations may be difficult to ascertain or interpret and may change from time to time. Violation of such laws and regulations could subject us to fines and penalties, damage our reputation, constitute a breach of our client agreements, impair our ability to obtain and renew required licenses, and decrease our profitability or competitiveness. If any of these effects were to occur, our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected. Additionally, to serve our international markets, we maintain business entities in various jurisdictions around the world. Accordingly, we must maintain and operate these business entities in compliance with the applicable corporate, tax, employment and other laws of these various jurisdictions, which adds complexity to our operations. Our failure to maintain compliance with such laws and regulations could give rise to liabilities that could materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may not be able to integrate new technologies and provide new services in a cost-efficient manner.\nThe telecommunications industry is subject to rapid and significant changes in technology, frequent new service introductions and evolving industry standards. We cannot predict the effect of these changes on our competitive position, our profitability or the industry in general. Technological developments may reduce the competitiveness of our networks and our software solutions and require additional capital expenditures or the procurement of additional products that could be expensive and time consuming. In addition, new products and services arising out of technological developments may reduce the attractiveness of our services. If we fail to adapt successfully to technological advances or fail to obtain access to new technologies, we could lose customers and be limited in our ability to attract new customers and/or sell new services to our existing customers. In addition, delivery of new services in a cost-efficient manner depends upon many factors, and we may not generate anticipated revenue from such services.\nWe may not be able to develop and successfully market our mobile telecommunications platform and services as planned.\nPareteum operates in an exceptionally competitive environment where there is continuous innovation and new development. We are required to be a top performer in over a dozen highly specialized domains to effectively compete with our competitors. Ongoing investments are required to stay ahead of the competition. The sales process for our platform and the deployment process may be complicated and very slow. We are highly dependent on convincing mobile network operators and mobile virtual network operators to believe that outsourcing their requirements to us is the best way to go. We are exposed to business risks associated with turnkey projects and the scalability of our service and support organization. Although our policy is to avoid or minimize risks, it cannot be ruled out that in certain cases events occur that may seriously impact us and our performance.\nImplementation and development of our software platform business depends on our ability to obtain adequate funding.\nOur software platforms require ongoing funding to continue the current development and operational plans and we have a history of net losses. We believe that we will continue to expend substantial resources for the foreseeable future in connection with the continued development of our software platforms. These expenditures will include costs associated with research and development activity, corporate administration, business development, and marketing and selling of our services. In addition, other unanticipated costs may arise. When our available cash and cash equivalents become insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements, or if and when we identify additional opportunities to do so, we will likely seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain additional credit facilities.\nFailure to obtain such adequate financing will substantially delay our development, slow down current operations, result in loss of customers and adversely impact our results of operations. Additionally, the funds we need may not be available when we need them, on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. Furthermore, the recent outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly disrupted world financial markets, negatively impacted U.S. market conditions and may reduce opportunities for us to obtain additional funding. In particular, a decline in the market price of our common stock could make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem appropriate.\nDisruptions in our networks and infrastructure may result in customer dissatisfaction, customer loss or both, which could materially and adversely affect our reputation and business.\nOur systems are an integral part of our customers\u2019 business operations. It is critical for our customers that our systems provide a continued and uninterrupted performance. Customers may be dissatisfied by any system failure that interrupts our ability to provide services to them. Sustained or repeated system failures would reduce the attractiveness of our services significantly and could result in decreased demand for our services.\nWe face the following risks to our networks, infrastructure and software applications:\n\u2022 significant weather events can physically damage access lines;\n\u2022 power surges and outages, computer viruses or hacking, earthquakes, terrorism attacks, vandalism and software or hardware defects which are beyond our control; and\n\u2022 unusual spikes in demand or capacity limitations in our or our suppliers\u2019 networks.\nDisruptions may cause interruptions in service or reduced capacity for customers, either of which could cause us to lose customers and/or incur expenses, and thereby adversely affect our business, revenue and cash flow.\nCybersecurity breaches and other disruptions could adversely affect our business, and could compromise our information and expose us to liability and reputational harm.\nThe size and complexity of our information systems make such systems potentially vulnerable to service interruptions or to security breaches from inadvertent or intentional actions by our employees or vendors, or from attacks by malicious third parties. Such attacks are of ever-increasing levels of sophistication and are made by groups and individuals with a wide range of motives and expertise. While we have invested in the protection of data and information technology, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent or quickly identify service interruptions or security breaches. Any such interruption or breach of our systems could adversely affect our business operations and/or result in the loss of critical or sensitive confidential information or intellectual property, and could result in financial, legal, business and reputational harm to us. Similarly, we could be subject to liability or our reputation could be harmed if technologies integrated into our products fail to prevent cyberattacks, or if our customers fail to safeguard the systems with security policies that conform to industry best practices. In addition, any cyberattack or security breach that affects a competitor\u2019s product could lead to the negative perception that our products are similarly vulnerable to attacks or breaches.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property and proprietary and/or personally identifiable information of customers, partners, employees, and other third parties. The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations. Despite our security measures and precautions, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. Any hack or breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any unauthorized access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, disrupt our operations, lead to reputational harm or loss of confidence in our products and services, all of which could adversely affect our business.\nIntegration of acquisitions ultimately may not provide the benefits originally anticipated by management and may distract the attention of our personnel from the operation of our business.\nWe strive to broaden our solutions offerings as well as to increase the number of subscribers hosted on our platforms, volume of voice and data that we carry over our existing global network in order to reduce transmission costs and other operating costs as a percentage of net revenue, improve margins, improve service quality and enhance our ability to introduce new products and services. Strategic acquisitions in desired markets play a part of our growth strategy, and we may pursue additional acquisitions in the future to further strengthen our strategic objectives. Acquisitions of businesses and customer lists involve operational risks, including the possibility that an acquisition may not ultimately provide the benefits originally anticipated by management. Moreover, we may not be successful in identifying attractive acquisition candidates, completing and financing additional acquisitions on favorable terms, or integrating the acquired business or assets into our own. There may be difficulty in integrating technologies and solutions, in migrating customer bases and in integrating the service offerings, distribution channels and networks gained through acquisitions with our own. For example, our recent acquisitions have led to the unexpected addition of a significant amount of aged accounts payable to our balance sheet. Successful integration of operations and technologies requires the dedication of management and other personnel, which may distract their attention from the day-to-day business, the development or acquisition of new technologies, and the pursuit of other business acquisition opportunities. Therefore, successful integration may not occur in light of these factors.\nOur revenue, earnings and profitability are affected by the length of our sales cycle, and a longer sales cycle could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business is directly affected by the length of our sales cycle and strategic mobile partnership cycles with mobile network operators and other large enterprises. Our software platforms, outsourced solutions and value-added communication services, are relatively complex and their purchase may involve a significant commitment of mostly human capital, with attendant delays frequently associated with the allocation of substantial human resources and procurement procedures within an organization. The purchase of these types of products typically also requires coordination and agreement across many departments within a potential customer. Delays associated with such timing factors could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In periods of economic slowdown in the communications industry, which may recur in the current economic climate, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the government shutdown orders that have been implemented in many jurisdictions around the world in an effort to slow the spread of the pandemic, our typical sales cycle may lengthen, which means that the average time between our initial contact with a prospective customer and the signing of a sales contract increases. The lengthening of our sales and strategic mobile partnership cycle could reduce growth in our revenue in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nBecause most of our business is conducted outside the U.S., fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates versus the U.S. Dollar could adversely affect our results of operations.\nCurrently most of our net revenue, expenses and capital expenditures are derived and incurred from sales and operations outside the U.S., whereas the reporting currency for our consolidated financial statements is the U.S. Dollar (\u201cUSD\u201d). The local currency of each country is the functional currency for each of our respective entities operating in that country, making the Euro the predominant currency in which our business is conducted. Considering the fact that most income and expenses are not subject to relevant exchange rate differences, it is only at a reporting level that the translation needs to be made to the reporting unit of USD. In the future, we expect to continue to derive a significant portion of our net revenue and incur a significant portion of our operating costs outside the U.S., and changes in exchange rates have had and may continue to have a significant, and potentially distorting effect (either negative or positive) on the reported results of operations, not necessarily being the result of operations in real terms. Our primary risk of loss regarding foreign currency exchange rate risk is caused by fluctuations in the USD/Euro exchange rates.\nWe historically have not engaged in hedging transactions since we primarily operate in same currency countries, currently being the Euro (\u201cEUR\u201d). However, the operations of affiliates and subsidiaries in non-US countries have been funded with investments and other advances denominated in foreign currencies and more recently in USD. Historically, such investments and advances have been long-term in nature, and we have accounted for any adjustments resulting from currency translation as a charge or credit to Accumulated other comprehensive loss within the Stockholders\u2019 Equity section of our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Although we have not engaged in hedging in the past, we continue to assess on a regular basis the possible need for hedging.\nWe are substantially smaller than our major competitors, whose marketing and pricing decisions, and relative size advantage, could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain customers and are likely to continue to cause significant pricing pressures that could adversely affect our net revenues, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur services related to cloud-based communications software and information systems, outsourced solutions and value-added communication services are subject to competitive pressure, and we expect competition to continue to increase. We compete with telecom solution providers, independent software and service providers and the in-house IT and network departments of communications companies as well as firms that provide IT services (including consulting, systems integration and managed services), software vendors that sell products for particular aspects of a total information system, software vendors that specialize in systems for particular communications services (such as Internet, land-line and mobile services, cable, satellite and service bureaus) and companies that offer software systems in combination with the sale of network equipment. Also, in this more fragmented market, larger players exist with associated advantages described earlier with which we need to compete against.\nWe believe that our ability to compete depends on several factors, including:\n\u2022 the development by others of software products that are competitive with our products and services;\n\u2022 the price at which others offer competitive software and services;\n\u2022 the ability to make use of the networks of mobile network operators;\n\u2022 the technological changes of telecommunication operators affecting our ability to run services over their networks;\n\u2022 the ability of competitors to deliver projects at a level of quality that rivals our own;\n\u2022 the responsiveness of our competitors to customer needs; and\n\u2022 the ability of our competitors to hire, retain and motivate key personnel.\nA number of our competitors have long operating histories, large customer bases, substantial financial, technical, sales, marketing and other resources, and strong name recognition. Current and potential competitors have established, and may establish in the future, cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties. Many of our competitors are also able to offer service at lower prices than we are, forcing us to match their prices in response. This negatively affects our gross margins and financial results of operations. If we fail to effectively compete, we may experience lower revenues and/or net income, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur positioning in the marketplace as a smaller provider places a significant strain on our resources, and if not managed effectively, could result in operational inefficiencies and other difficulties.\nOur positioning in the marketplace may place a significant strain on our management, operational and financial resources, and increase demand on our systems and controls. To manage this position effectively, we must continue to implement and improve our operational and financial systems and controls, invest in development and engineering, critical systems and network infrastructure to maintain or improve our service quality levels, purchase and utilize other systems and solutions, and train and manage our employee base. As we proceed with our development, operational difficulties could arise from additional demand placed on customer provisioning and support, billing and management information systems, product delivery and fulfillment, sales and marketing and administrative resources.\nFor instance, we may encounter delays or cost overruns or suffer other adverse consequences in implementing new systems when required. In addition, our operating and financial control systems and infrastructure could be inadequate to ensure timely and accurate financial reporting, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWe need to grow our business and revenue in order to achieve profitability.\nWe need to expand our network to maintain and grow our business and revenue. If we fail to expand and maintain an effective sales force or successfully develop our relationships with new customers, our business, prospects and brand may be materially and adversely affected. We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully grow our client base or expand the number of services provided to them. If we fail to do so, our sales could fail to grow or could decline, and our ability to grow our business could be adversely affected, which could prevent our revenues from covering our fixed costs and deny the Company operating leverage, delaying the date at which we achieve profitability. Accordingly, if we do not grow our revenue and business, we will not achieve profitability in the near term, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and the trading price of our common stock.\nWe could suffer adverse tax and other financial consequences if U.S. or foreign taxing authorities do not agree with our interpretation of applicable tax laws.\nOur corporate structure is based, in part, on assumptions about the various tax laws, including withholding tax, and other relevant laws of applicable non-U.S. jurisdictions. Foreign taxing authorities may not agree with our interpretations or reach different conclusions. Our interpretations are not binding on any taxing authority and, if these foreign jurisdictions were to change or to modify the relevant laws, we could suffer adverse tax and other financial consequences or have the anticipated benefits of our corporate structure materially impaired. This could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur management has identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, that, if not remediated, or if we identify additional material weaknesses or other adverse findings in the future, may not allow us to be able to report our financial condition or results of operations accurately or timely, which may result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports, significant expenses to remediate any internal control deficiencies, and ultimately have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\nPursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, our management is required to report on, and our independent registered public accounting firm is required to attest to, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. As disclosed in Part II, Item 9A, Controls and Procedures, of this Annual Report, our management identified material weaknesses in internal controls related to:\n\u2022 Inadequate and ineffective management assessment of internal control over financial reporting, including insufficient experienced resources to complete the documentation of internal control assessment;\n\u2022 Ineffective design, implementation and monitoring of information technology general controls pertaining to the Company\u2019s change management process;\n\u2022 entity-level controls were not effective due to certain executive management \u201ctone at the top\u201d issues which contributed to an ineffective control environment and to deficiencies aggregating to material weaknesses; and\n\u2022 the Company not having sufficient accounting and finance department resources to effectively assess risk and design, operate and oversee effective internal controls over financial reporting, which contributed to the failure in the effectiveness and adequate identification of certain controls including:\no application of appropriate revenue recognition standards;\no proper accounting of share-based compensation;\no appropriate settlement of payables via issuance of shares;\no complete and appropriate application of foreign currency translations;\no identification and accounting of operating leases in accordance with ASC 842; and\no method of accounting for acquisitions and business combinations.\nAs a result, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2019. As described in Part II, Item 9A, Controls and Procedures, of this Annual Report, we are implementing remedial measures that we believe will effectively remedy the material weakness. If we are unable to remediate the material weakness timely and sufficiently, or are otherwise unable to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting, we could suffer future material misstatements in our financial statements and fail to meet our reporting obligations, which would likely cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information. This could harm our operating results and lead to a decline in our stock price. Additionally, ineffective internal control over financial reporting could expose us to increased risk of fraud or misuse of corporate assets and subject regulatory investigations, civil or criminal sanctions and class action litigation.\nWe must attract and retain skilled personnel. If we are unable to hire and retain technical, technical sales and operational employees, our business could be harmed.\nOur ability to manage our growth will be particularly dependent on our ability to develop and retain an effective sales force and qualified technical and managerial personnel. We need software development specialists with in-depth knowledge of a blend of IT and telecommunications or with a blend of security and telecommunications. We intend to hire additional necessary employees, including software engineers, communication engineers, project managers, sales consultants, employees and operational employees, on a permanent basis. The competition for qualified technical sales, technical, and managerial personnel in the communications and software industry is intense in the markets where we operate, and we may not be able to hire and retain sufficient qualified personnel. In addition, we may not be able to maintain the quality of our operations, control our costs, maintain compliance with all applicable regulations, and expand our internal management, technical, information and accounting systems in order to support our desired growth, which could have an adverse impact on our operations. Volatility in the stock market and other factors could diminish our use, and the value, of our equity awards as incentives to employees, putting us at a competitive disadvantage or forcing us to use more cash compensation. Accordingly, our failure to attract and retain skilled personnel may materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf we are not able to use and protect our intellectual property domestically and internationally, it could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur ability to compete depends, in part, on our ability to use intellectual property internationally. We rely on a combination of patents, copyright, trade secrets and confidentiality, trademarks and licenses to protect our intellectual property. There is limited protection under patent law to protect the source codes we developed or acquired on our platform. The copyright and know-how protection on which we rely may not be sufficient. Our granted patents and pending patent applications may be challenged. We are also subject to the risks of claims and litigation alleging infringement of the intellectual property rights of others. The telecommunications industry is subject to frequent litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. We rely upon certain technology, including hardware and software, licensed from third parties. The technology licensed by us may not continue to provide competitive features and functionality. Licenses for technology currently used by us or other technology that we may seek to license in the future may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all, which could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are dependent on one significant customer for a substantial portion of our business and the loss of this customer could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had one significant customer that accounted for 20% and 64% of our revenue, respectively. Although no other customer accounted for greater than 10% of our net sales during this period, other customers may account for more than 10% of our net sales in future periods. Additionally, because many of our other customers produce net losses for us, the loss, or reduction in services to this significant customer or other discontinuation of their relationship with us for any reason, or if this significant customer reduces or postpones purchases that we expect to receive, it could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur success depends on our continued investment in research and development, the level and effectiveness of which could reduce our profitability.\nWe intend to continue to make investments in research and development and product development in seeking to sustain and improve our competitive position and meet our customers\u2019 needs. These investments currently include streamlining our suite of software functionalities, including modularization and improving scalability of our integrated solutions. To maintain our competitive position, we may need to increase our research and development investment, which could reduce our profitability and cash flows, thereby causing a material and adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we cannot assure you that we will achieve a return on these investments, nor can we assure you that these investments will improve our competitive position or meet our customers\u2019 needs.\nProduct defects or software errors could adversely affect our business.\nDesign defects or software errors may cause delays in product introductions and project implementations, damage customer satisfaction and may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our software systems are highly complex and may, from time to time, contain design defects or software errors that may be difficult to detect and correct. Because our products are generally used by our customers to perform critical business functions, design defects, software errors, misuse of our products, incorrect data from external sources or other potential problems within or outside of our control may arise during implementation or from the use of our products and may result in financial or other damages to our customers, for which we may be held responsible. Although we have license agreements with our customers that contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential claims and liabilities arising from customer problems, these provisions may not effectively protect us against such claims in all cases and in all jurisdictions. Our insurance coverage is not sufficient to protect against all possible liability for defects or software errors. In addition, as a result of business and other considerations, we may undertake to compensate our customers for damages caused to them arising from the use of our products, even if our liability is limited by a license or other agreement. Claims and liabilities arising from customer problems could also damage our reputation, adversely affecting our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nPolitical risks, including changes to U.S. tariff and import/export regulations may have a negative effect on our business.\nThere have been recent changes to U.S. trade policies, treaties and tariffs, including determinations made by the U.S. to reinstate or impose new sanctions levied by the U.S. Department of the Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control against certain nation states. The Company or its subsidiaries may engage in business with entities located in certain regions which may be impacted, directly or indirectly by such changes. If the Company is precluded as a result of changes to sanctions laws from doing business in certain jurisdictions or with certain entities, the loss of any related revenues could impact our business, results of operations and/or financial condition.\nWe, and certain of our directors and current and former officers, have been named as parties to various lawsuits and those lawsuits could adversely affect us, require significant management time and attention, result in significant legal expenses or damages, and cause our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows to suffer.\nA number of lawsuits have been filed against us, including securities class action complaints. If these matters cannot be resolved expeditiously, management\u2019s attention may be diverted to this matter and there can be no assurance that the litigation would be settled. If the current litigation proceeds or if additional claims are filed, the legal and other costs associated with the defense of these actions and their ultimate outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. While we expect insurance to cover many of the costs associated with defending such litigation, insurance coverage may be insufficient and could require a diversion of our resources. There also may be adverse publicity associated with litigation that could negatively affect customer perception of our business, regardless of whether the allegations are valid or whether we are ultimately found liable.\nAlthough we have directors and officers liability insurance, such insurance may be insufficient to cover the liabilities incurred under all claims and any claims against us may result in our incurring substantial costs and a diversion of resources.\nAlthough we have directors and officers liability insurance, the coverage under such policies may be insufficient to cover any claim, including the claims pending against us and certain of our directors and officers resulting from the restatement of our financial statements (see \u201cItem 3. Legal Proceedings\u201d). Because we also have obligations to indemnify our current and former officers and directors under our governing documents, liabilities in excess of the limits of our insurance policies that may be imposed in connection with actions against certain of the Company\u2019s past and present directors and officers and certain current and former employees who are entitled to indemnification will be funded by the Company with its existing cash resources. Such expenses could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRisks Related to Our Industry\nChanges in the regulation of the telecommunications industry could adversely affect our business, revenue or cash flow.\nWe operate in a heavily regulated industry. As a provider of communications technology, we are directly and indirectly subject to varying degrees of regulation in each of the jurisdictions in which we provide our services. Local laws and regulations, and the interpretation of such laws and regulations, differ significantly among the jurisdictions in which we operate. Enforcement and interpretations of these laws and regulations can be unpredictable and are often subject to the informal views of government officials. Certain European, foreign, U.S. federal, and state regulations and local franchise requirements have been, are currently, and may in the future be, the subject of judicial proceedings, legislative hearings and administrative proposals. Such proceedings may relate to, among other things, the rates we may charge for our local, network access and other services, the manner in which we offer and bundle our services, the terms and conditions of interconnection, unbundled network elements and resale rates, and could change the manner in which telecommunications companies operate. We cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings or the impact they will have on our business, revenue and cash flow.\nThere can be no assurance that future regulatory changes will not have a material adverse effect on us, or that regulators or third parties will not raise material issues regarding our compliance or noncompliance with applicable regulations, any of which could have a material adverse effect upon us. Potential future regulatory, judicial, legislative, and government policy changes in jurisdictions where we operate could have a material adverse effect on us. Domestic or international regulators or third parties may raise material issues regarding our compliance or noncompliance with applicable regulations, and therefore may have a material adverse impact on our competitive position, growth and financial performance.\nThe telecommunications industry is rapidly changing, and if we are not able to adjust our strategy and resources effectively in the future to meet changing market conditions, we may not be able to compete effectively.\nThe telecommunications industry is changing rapidly due to deregulation, privatization, consolidation, technological improvements, availability of alternative services such as mobile, broadband, DSL, Internet, VOIP, and wireless DSL through use of the fixed wireless spectrum, and the globalization of the world\u2019s economies. In addition, alternative services to traditional land-line services, such as mobile, broadband, Internet and VOIP services, have shown a competitive threat to our legacy land-line traffic business. If we do not continue to invest and exploit the contemplated plan of development of our communications information systems, outsourced solutions and value-added communication services to meet changing market conditions, or if we do not have adequate resources, we may not be able to compete effectively in providing technology solutions to our customers. The telecommunications industry is marked by the introduction of new product and service offerings and technological improvements. Achieving successful financial results will depend on our ability to anticipate, assess and adapt to rapid technological changes, and offer, on a timely and cost-effective basis, services including the bundling of multiple services into our technology platforms that meet evolving industry standards. If we do not anticipate, assess or adapt to such technological changes at a competitive price, maintain competitive services or obtain new technologies on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms, our financial results may be materially and adversely affected.\nIf we are not able to operate a cost-effective network, we may not be able to grow our business successfully.\nOur long-term success depends on our ability to design, implement, operate, manage and maintain a reliable and cost-effective network. In addition, we rely on third parties to enable us to expand and manage our global network and to provide local, broadband Internet and mobile services. If we are unable to grow and operate a cost-effective network for our customers, our business may fail to grow or decline, which would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Capital Stock\nCovenant restrictions in our debt instruments may limit our flexibility to operate and grow our business, and if we are not able to comply with such covenants, our lenders could accelerate our indebtedness, proceed against certain collateral or exercise other remedies, which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nOn June 8, 2020, we closed the issuance of $17.5 million aggregate principal amount of our Senior Secured Convertible Notes due 2025 (the \u201c2020 Note\u201d) under the terms of a securities purchase agreement, also dated as of June 8, 2020 (together with the 2020 Note, the \u201cNote Facility\u201d). The covenants in the Note Facility documents contain a number of provisions that impose operating and financial restrictions which, subject to certain exceptions, limit our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to, among other things: incur additional indebtedness, pay dividends or make distributions or redeem or repurchase our securities, make certain investments, grant liens on assets, sell or dispose of any material assets; and acquire the assets of, or merge or consolidate with, other companies. Additionally, the Note Facility documents contain affirmative covenants that require to us take, and have taken by certain dates, specific actions, some of which have not been satisfied by the dates required, including (i) us filing our restated Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 with the SEC on or prior to October 31, 2020, (ii) after October 31, 2020, our timely filing subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q with the SEC and (iii) us maintaining the listing of our common stock on the Nasdaq Stock Market. As a result, on December 1, 2020, we entered into a forbearance agreement with the holder of the 2020 Note under which we admitted that we were in default of several obligations and such holder acknowledged such defaults and agreed not to exercise any right or remedy under the Note Facility documents, including its right to accelerate the aggregate amount outstanding under the 2020 Note, until the earlier of December 31, 2020 (since extended to March 31, 2021), the date of any new event of default or the initiation of any action by the Company to invalidate any of the representations and warranties made in such forbearance agreement.\nComplying with these covenants, as well as those that may be contained in any future debt agreements, may limit our ability to finance our future operations or working capital needs or to take advantage of future business opportunities. Our ability to comply with these covenants will depend on our future performance, which may be affected by events beyond our control. If we do not maintain and regain compliance with our continuing obligations or any covenants, terms and conditions of the Note Facility, after the expiration of the forbearance agreement, we could be in default and required to repay outstanding borrowings on an accelerated basis, which could subject us to decreased liquidity and other negative impacts on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In the case of an event of default, we may not have sufficient funds available to make the required payments under the Note Facility. If we are unable to repay amounts owed under the terms of our Note Facility, the lenders thereunder may choose to exercise their remedies in respect to the collateral, including a foreclosure of their lien which may result in a sale of certain of our assets to satisfy our obligations under the Note Facility.\nWe could issue additional common stock, which might dilute the book value of our capital stock.\nOur Board of Directors has authority, without action or vote of our stockholders, to issue all or a part of our authorized but unissued shares of common stock. Any such stock issuance could be made at a price that reflects a discount or a premium to the then-current trading price of our common stock. In addition, in order to raise future capital, we may need to issue securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for a significant amount of our common stock. These issuances, if any, would dilute your percentage ownership interest in the Company, thereby having the effect of reducing your influence on matters on which stockholders vote. You may incur additional dilution if holders of stock options, whether currently outstanding or subsequently granted, exercise their options, or if warrant holders exercise their warrants to purchase shares of our common stock. As a result, any such issuances or exercises would dilute your interest in the Company and the per share book value of the common stock that you owned, either of which could negatively affect the trading price of our common stock and the value of your investment.\nShares eligible for future sale may adversely affect the market for our common stock.\nAs of December 31, 2020, there are (i) 6,704,803 shares of common stock that may be issued upon the exercise of outstanding options, 37,298,850 shares of common stock that may be issued upon the exercise of outstanding warrants and 29,166,667 shares of common stock that may be issued upon the conversion of outstanding convertible indebtedness. Options are exercisable at exercise prices between $0.36 and $62.50 and the warrants are exercisable at exercise prices between $0.37 and $5.38. Accrued interest owed on the 2020 Note may also be paid in the form of shares of our common stock from time to time. If and when these securities are exercised or converted into shares of our common stock, the number of our shares of common stock outstanding will increase. Such increase in our outstanding shares, and any subsequent sales of such shares, could have a material adverse effect on the market for our common stock and the market price of our common stock.\nIn addition, from time to time, certain of our stockholders may be eligible to sell all or some of their shares of common stock by means of ordinary brokerage transactions in the open market pursuant to Rule 144, promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d), subject to certain limitations. In general, pursuant to Rule 144, after satisfying a six month holding period: (i) affiliated stockholders (or stockholders whose shares are aggregated) may, under certain circumstances, sell within any three-month period a number of securities that does not exceed the greater of 1% of the then outstanding shares of common stock or the average weekly trading volume of the class during the four calendar weeks prior to such sale and (ii) non-affiliated stockholders may sell without such limitations, provided that we are current in our public reporting obligations. Rule 144 also permits the sale of securities by non-affiliates that have satisfied a one year holding period without any limitation or restriction. Any substantial sale of our common stock pursuant to Rule 144 or pursuant to any resale prospectus may have a material adverse effect on the market price of our securities.\nOur common stock is quoted on the OTC Markets Group Inc.\u2019s Pink Open Market which may have an unfavorable impact on our stock price and liquidity.\nOn November 10, 2020, The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (\u201cNasdaq\u201d) notified the Company that, because of the Company\u2019s failure to satisfy the conditions to the exception to Nasdaq\u2019s listing standards granted by the Nasdaq Hearings Panel, our common stock would be delisted, and trading of our common stock on Nasdaq\u2019s Capital Market was suspended effective at the open of business on November 12, 2020. After trading of the Company\u2019s common stock was suspended by Nasdaq, prices for our common stock began being quoted on the OTC Markets Group Inc.\u2019s Pink Open Market (the \u201cPink Sheets\u201d). The delisting became effective on February 12, 2021. The Pink Sheets is a significantly more limited market than Nasdaq or the New York Stock Exchange. The quotation of our shares on the Pink Sheets may result in a less liquid market available for existing and potential stockholders to trade shares of our common stock, could depress the trading price of our common stock and could have a long-term adverse impact on our ability to raise capital in the future on favorable terms, or at all.\nBecause our common stock is no longer listed on a registered national securities exchange, we are subject to certain \u201cblue sky\u201d laws of the various states that impose restrictions on our ability to offer and sell our securities. These \u201cblue sky\u201d laws may make it more difficult for us to raise capital or to issue our common stock for equity compensation or other strategic purposes, which could adversely affect our ability to fund our operations or to attract and retain employees.\nIn addition, our common stock may be classified as a \u201cpenny stock\u201d under Rule 3a51-1 under the Exchange Act. \u201cPenny stocks\u201d are subject to Rule 15g-9, which imposes additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers that sell low-priced securities to persons other than established customers and institutional accredited investors. For transactions covered by this rule, a broker-dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchaser and have received the purchaser\u2019s written consent to the transaction prior to sale. Consequently, the rule may affect the ability of broker-dealers to sell our common stock and affect the ability of holders to sell their shares of our common stock in the secondary market. To the extent our common stock is subject to the penny stock regulations, the market liquidity for the shares will be adversely affected and could have a long-term adverse impact on our ability to raise capital in the future on favorable terms, or at all.\nWe have no dividend history and have no intention to pay dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe have never paid dividends on or in connection with our common stock and do not intend to pay any dividends to common stockholders for the foreseeable future.",

    "item_2": "Item 2. Properties\nOur headquarters are located in New York City, NY. In addition, we lease office/building space around the world, primarily in Europe, the U.S., and Asia. We do not own any properties but lease data center colocations for housing our equipment, applications, and network interconnections to our customers and telecommunication network providers in Europe, the U.S., South America, and Asia.\nWe intend to procure additional space in the future as we continue to add employees and expand geographically. We believe our facilities are adequate and suitable for our current needs and that, should it be needed, suitable additional or alternative space will be available to accommodate our operations and headquarters.",
    "item_3": "Item 3. Legal Proceedings\nThe Company is currently a defendant in various legal actions and asserted claims arising in the normal course of business. We anticipate that we will become involved in new litigation matters from time to time in the future. We will incur legal and related costs concerning litigation and may, from time to time, determine to settle some or all of the cases, regardless of the assessment of our legal position. The amount of legal defense costs and settlements in any period will depend on many factors, including the status of cases, the number of cases that are in trial or about to be brought to trial, and the opposing parties\u2019 aggressiveness in pursuing their cases and their perception of their legal position.\nSEC Investigation. In August 2019 and February 2020, the SEC issued the Company subpoenas requiring the production of documents related to, among other things, the Company\u2019s recognition of revenue, practices with certain customers, and internal accounting controls. The SEC staff has also interviewed and taken testimony from individuals previously employed by the Company in connection with the investigation. The Company is cooperating with the SEC staff in the SEC investigation and discussions with the SEC staff regarding a potential resolution of the investigation are ongoing.\nIn re Pareteum Securities Litigation is the consolidation of various putative class actions that were filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (the \u201cSouthern District Court\u201d). The Southern District Court consolidated the actions on January 10, 2020 and named the Pareteum Shareholder Investor Group as the Lead Plaintiff. The Lead Plaintiff is asserting claims on behalf of purported purchasers and/or acquirers of Company securities between December 14, 2017 and October 21, 2019. The defendants are the Company, Robert H. Turner, Edward O\u2019Donnell, Victor Bozzo, Denis McCarthy, Dawson James Securities Inc., and Squar Milner LLP (\u201cDefendants\u201d). The Lead Plaintiff alleges that Defendants caused the Company to issue certain materially false or misleading statements in SEC filings and other public pronouncements in violation of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act, and Sections 11, 12 and 15 of the Securities Act. Lead Plaintiff seeks to recover compensatory damages with interest for itself and the other class members for all damages sustained as a result of Defendants\u2019 alleged wrongdoing and reasonable costs and attorney\u2019s fees incurred in the case.\nDouglas Loskot v. Pareteum Corporation, et al., is a putative class action pending in the Superior Court of California, County of San Mateo. It was filed on May 29, 2020 on behalf of all former shareholders of iPass Inc. who received shares of the Company\u2019s common stock pursuant to a February 12, 2019 exchange tender offer. The defendants are the Company, Robert H. Turner, Edward O\u2019Donnell, Victor Bozzo, Yves van Sante, Robert Lippert and Luis Jimenez-Tunon. The Complaint alleges that the defendants caused the Company to issue materially false or misleading statements in SEC filings submitted in connection with the tender offer in violation of Sections 11 and 15 of the Securities Act.\nMiller ex rel. Pareteum Corporation v. Victor Bozzo, et al. was filed on February 28, 2020 in the Supreme Court for the State of New York, New York County. It is a stockholder derivative suit brought by Plaintiff William Miller (\u201cPlaintiff\u201d), derivatively on behalf of Pareteum, the Nominal Defendant, against certain officers and directors of Pareteum, including Victor Bozzo, Laura Thomas, Yves van Sante, Luis Jimenez-Tunon, Robert Lippert, Robert H.

Pareteum Corporation v. Luis Jimenez-Tunon, et al. was filed on July 10, 2020 in the Supreme Court for the State of New York, New York County. It is a stockholder derivative suit brought by Plaintiff Michael Shaw (\u201cPlaintiff\u201d), derivatively on behalf of Pareteum, the Nominal Defendant, against certain officers and directors of Pareteum, including Luis Jimenez-Tunon, Robert Lippert, Yves van Sante, Robert H.

On April 3, 2020, the District Court consolidated related suits brought by stockholders Edward Hayes, Juanita Silvera, and Brad Linton (\u201cPlaintiffs\u201d), derivatively on behalf of Pareteum, the Nominal Defendant, against certain officers and directors of Pareteum, including Robert H. Turner, Edward O\u2019Donnell, Denis McCarthy, Laura Thomas, Victor Bozzo, Luis Jimenez-Tunon, Robert Lippert, Rob Mumby and Yves van Sante (the \u201cIndividual Defendants\u201d). Plaintiffs in the related actions have alleged that the Individual Defendants caused Pareteum to issue false or misleading statements in Securities Exchange Commission filings and other public pronouncements in violation of certain federal securities regulations. Plaintiffs allege that as a result of the Individual Defendants\u2019 misconduct, they are liable for violations of Section 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act, breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, and gross mismanagement. Plaintiffs seek a judgment (1) declaring that the Individual Defendants breached their fiduciary duties and/or aided and abetted the breach of their fiduciary duties; (2) awarding Pareteum damages sustained as a result of the Individual Defendants\u2019 breaches of fiduciary duty and violations of federal securities laws; (3) ordering that the Individual Defendants disgorge any performance-based compensation that was received during, or as a result of, the Individual Defendants\u2019 breaches of fiduciary duty; (4) directing the Individual Defendants to take certain measures to reform and improve Pareteum\u2019s corporate governance and internal procedures; (5) granting appropriate equitable or injunctive relief to remedy the Individual Defendants\u2019 breaches of fiduciary duties and other violations of laws; (6) awarding Pareteum restitution from the Individual Defendants; and (7) awarding Plaintiff all costs and expenses incurred in pursuing various actions against the Company and the Individual Defendants.

In addition to historical consolidated financial statements, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. See \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report and \u201cCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d in the forepart of this Annual Report.\nBusiness Overview\nPareteum Corporation (OTC: TEUM) is a growth-oriented cloud software communications platform company with a mission - to Connect Every Person and Every(Thing) \u2122. Pareteum\u2019s goal is to unleash the power of applications and mobile services, bringing secure, ubiquitous, scalable, and seamlessly available voice, video, SMS/text messaging, and data services to its customers, making worldwide communications services easily and economically accessible to everyone. By harnessing the value of our cloud communications platform, Pareteum serves enterprises, communications service providers, early-stage innovators, developers, IoT and telecommunications infrastructure providers.\nPareteum integrates a variety of disparate communications methods and services and offers them to customers and application developers, allowing communications to become a value-added service. The vast majority of our platform is comprised of our internally-developed software and intellectual property, which provides our customers with flexibility in how they use our products and allows us to be market driven going forward. We have been granted over 70 patents related to techniques and processes which support our cloud software and communications platform solutions. Our platform services partners (whose technologies are integrated into our cloud) include Hewlett Packard, IBM, Sonus, Oracle, Microsoft, NetNumber, Affirmed and other world-class technology providers.\nThe Pareteum cloud communications platform targets large and growing sectors from IoT, MVNO, Smart Cities, and Application developer markets - each in need of mobile platforms, management and connectivity. These sectors need Communications-Platform-as-a-Service (CPaaS), which Pareteum delivers. Our vision is to empower Communication Service Providers, Enterprises and Developers to simply create and control their own wireless communications products and experiences through our powerful combination of software, services and global connectivity.\nPareteum Corporation, a Delaware corporation, was originally formed in 2001 as Elephant Talk Communications Corp. as a result of a merger between Staruni Corporation (USA, 1962) and Elephant Talk Limited (Hong Kong, 1994). Since 2016, our name has been Pareteum Corporation, and from November 12, 2019 until November 12, 2020, our common stock was traded on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the ticker symbol \u201cTEUM.\u201d Prices for our common stock are now quoted on the Pink Sheets under the same symbol.\nRestatement and Revision of Previously Issued Interim Financial Statements\nWe restated the unaudited quarterly financial statements as of and for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and as of and for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019. The impact of the restatement is reflected in this Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (\u201cMD&A\u201d), see the discussion below in \u201cConsolidated Quarterly Results\u201d. The Company has not yet filed its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2019 with the SEC.\nDelisting of the Company\u2019s Common Stock\nOn November 5, 2020, the Company notified the Nasdaq Hearings Panel that it would not be able to file its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2019, its amended Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2018, its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 or its Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the periods ended March 31, 2020 and June 30, 2020 by November 9, 2020, the date by which the Nasdaq Hearings Panel had required the Company to make such filings in order for the Company\u2019s common stock to remain listed on Nasdaq Capital Market.\nIn response to the Company\u2019s notice to the Nasdaq Stock Market that it would not satisfy the conditions to the exception to the listing requirements granted by the Hearing Panel, the Nasdaq Stock Market notified the Company by letter dated November 10, 2020 that the Company\u2019s common stock would be delisted, and trading of the Company\u2019s common stock on Nasdaq\u2019s Capital Market was suspended effective at the open of business on November 12, 2020. Since the trading of the Company\u2019s common stock was suspended, prices for our common stock have been quoted on Pink Sheets.\nResults of Operations\nConsolidated Annual Results\nOur results of operations for the periods presented were as follows:\nYears Ended December 31, Change\n($ in thousands) Increase/(Decrease)\nREVENUES $ 62,049 $ 20,258 $ 41,791\nCOST AND OPERATING EXPENSES\nCost of revenues (excluding depreciation and amortization) 47,134 10,054 37,080\nProduct development 12,956 3,083 9,873\nSales and marketing 10,345 3,197 7,148\nGeneral and administrative 34,583 17,330 17,253\nRestructuring and acquisition costs 3,457 7,260 (3,803 )\nImpairment of goodwill and intangible assets 160,989 - 160,989\nDepreciation and amortization 12,938 5,427 7,511\nTotal cost and operating expenses 282,402 46,351 236,051\nLOSS FROM OPERATIONS (220,353 ) (26,093 ) (194,260 )\nOTHER INCOME (EXPENSE)\nInterest income\nInterest expense (2,120 ) (309 ) (1,811 )\nInterest expense related to debt discount and conversion feature (619 ) (184 ) (435 )\nChanges in derivative liabilities - 1,284 (1,284 )\nLoss on extinguishment of debt (8,873 ) - (8,873 )\nGain on equity investment - 6,371 (6,371 )\nAmortization of deferred financing costs (237 ) (29 ) (208 )\nOther income (expense), net (3,221 ) (3,799 )\nTotal other income (expense) (14,712 ) 7,895 (22,607 )\nLOSS BEFORE BENEFIT FOR INCOME TAXES (235,065 ) (18,198 ) (216,867 )\nIncome tax benefit (8,295 ) (174 ) (8,121 )\nNET LOSS (226,770 ) (18,024 ) (208,746 )\nOTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS\nForeign currency translation loss (219 ) (200 ) (19 )\nCOMPREHENSIVE LOSS $ (226,989 ) $ (18,224 ) $ (208,765 )\nAlthough the majority of our business activity is carried out in Euros, we report our financial statements in U.S. dollars (\u201cUSD\u201d). The conversion of Euros and USD leads to period-to-period fluctuations in our reported USD results arising from changes in the exchange rate between the USD and the Euro. Generally, when the USD strengthens relative to the Euro, it has an unfavorable impact on our reported revenue and income and a favorable impact on our reported expenses. Conversely, when the USD weakens relative to the Euro, it produces a favorable impact on our reported revenue and income, and an unfavorable impact on our reported expenses. These fluctuations in the USD/Euro exchange rate therefore result in currency translation effects (not to be confused with real currency exchange effects), which impact our reported USD results and may make it difficult to determine actual increases and decreases in our revenue and expenses that are attributable to our actual operating activities. We carry out our business activities primarily in Euros, and we do not currently engage in hedging activities.\nThe following table shows the average USD equivalent of the major currencies used to translate our financial results for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018:\nUSD\nEquivalent\nEuro $ 1.14460 $ 1.18102\nBritish Pound $ 1.27369 $ 1.33501\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2019 and 2018\nRevenue\nWe generate revenues primarily through providing CPaaS solutions to enterprises, communications service providers, early-stage innovators, developers, IoT, and telecommunications infrastructure providers. Our solutions are hosted software solutions that generate hosting and subscription revenue. We also offer customer support and professional services related to implementing and supporting our suite of applications. We offer managed services and bundled services for our mobile solutions services. Managed service revenues are recognized monthly based on an average number of end-users managed and is calculated based on a pre-determined service fee per user. For bundled services, we provide both network administration as well as mobile airtime management services. Bundled service revenue is recognized monthly based on an average number of end-users of managed and mobile airtime usage, calculated based on a pre-determined service fee. We also earn revenue from telecommunications services we offer, which revenue is based on a pre-determined rate and number of user minutes and calls that we manage in a given month. We also earn revenue from professional services, including consulting services to support business process mapping, configuration, data migration, integration and training.\nOur total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019 were $62.0 million, an increase of $41.8 million, or 206%, compared to $20.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was mainly due to the Company\u2019s inclusion of a full year of revenues of Artilium following the acquisition of Artilium in the fourth quarter of 2018, and the addition of iPass revenues following the iPass acquisition in the first quarter of 2019.\nCost of Revenues\nCost of revenues includes origination, termination, network and billing charges from telecommunications operators, costs of telecommunications service providers, network costs, data center costs, facility cost of hosting network and equipment and cost in providing resale arrangements with long distance service providers, cost of leasing transmission facilities, international gateway switches for voice, data transmission services, and the cost of professional services of staff directly related to the generation of revenues, consisting primarily of employee-related costs associated with these services, including share-based compensation and the cost of subcontractors. Cost of revenues excludes depreciation and amortization.\nCost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $47.1 million, an increase of $37.1 million, or 369%, compared to $10.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Similar to the increase in revenues, the increase in cost of revenues in 2019 was primarily due to Company\u2019s acquisitions of Artilium and iPass.\nProduct Development\nProduct development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, including share-based compensation expenses, of employees involved in the development of the Company\u2019s services, which are expensed as incurred. Costs such as database architecture, and Pareteum BOSS & IN platform development and testing are included in this function.\nCosts incurred during the application development stage of internal-use software projects, such as those used in the Company\u2019s operations, are capitalized in accordance with the accounting guidance for costs of computer software developed for internal use. Capitalized costs are amortized on a straight-line basis. When assigning useful lives to internal-use software, the Company considers the effects of obsolescence, competition, technology, and other economic factors. During the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company capitalized $6.4 million and $1.3 million, respectively, of internal-use software.\nProduct development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 were $13.0 million and $3.1 million, respectively, an increase of $9.9 million, or 320%, primarily due to the incremental product developments costs of the iPass business acquired in 2019.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, including share-based compensation expenses, for our sales and marketing staff, including commissions, payments to partners and marketing programs. Marketing programs consist of advertising, events, corporate communications and brand building.\nSales and marketing expenses for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 were $10.3 million and $3.2 million, respectively, an increase of $7.1 million, or 224%. The increase was due to additions to the sales force as well as the inclusion of the Artilium and iPass sales and marketing expenses in 2019.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses are our largest cost, other than our impairment charge, and consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, including share-based compensation, for non-employee directors, finance and accounting, legal and human resources personnel, legal costs, professional fees and other corporate expenses.\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 were $34.6 million and $17.3 million, respectively, an increase of $17.3 million, or 100%. An increase in non-cash compensation, staff-related costs and the addition of Artilium and iPass resulted in higher general administrative expenses of $5.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2019 when compared to the same period in 2018. In 2019, the Company worked to decrease the compensatory costs from Artilium through identified synergies as a result of the acquisition.\nRestructuring and Acquisition Costs\nRestructuring and acquisition costs for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 were $3.5 million and $7.3 million, respectively, a decrease of $3.8 million or 52%. The acquisition costs for the year ended December 31, 2019 were $3.5 million related to our acquisition of iPass compared to $7.1 million related to our acquisition of Artilium in 2018.\nImpairment of goodwill and intangible assets\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company performed its annual goodwill impairment test. Based on results of the goodwill impairment test, the Company determined that the estimated fair values of two of the Company\u2019s three operating segments, Artilium and iPass, were less than their carrying values. As a result, the Company recognized a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $129.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2019 to write down the carrying value of its goodwill from $139.2 million to $10.1 million. In determining the estimated fair value of its reporting unit, the Company used the income approach. Under the income approach, the fair value is based on the present value of discounted cash flows projected which includes assumptions about revenue growth rates, operating margins and terminal growth rates discounted by an estimated weighted-average cost of capital derived from other publicly traded companies that are similar but not identical from an operational and economic standpoint. The primary factor contributing to the reduction in the fair value of the Company\u2019s reporting unit was a significant decline in projected long-term cash flow projections following the below expectations performance of Artilium and iPass during 2019, which the Company primarily attributes to disruptions caused by an uncertain economic environment.\nBased on the Company\u2019s review for impairment of intangible assets, the Company determined that the carrying values exceeded the fair values by $31.9 million. As a result, the Company recognized a non-cash impairment charge of $31.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2019 to write down the carrying value of certain intangible assets to $15.5 million. The primary factor contributing to the impairment charge was the significant decline in projected long-term cash flow projections which the Company primarily attributes to disruptions caused by an uncertain economic environment.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 was $12.9 million and $5.4 million, an increase of $7.5 million, or 138%. The increase is primarily due to the amortization of the intangible assets acquired through the acquisitions of Artilium and iPass.\nInterest Income\nInterest income increased slightly for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 was $2.1 million and $0.3 million, respectively, an increase of $1.8 million. The increase results primarily from borrowings under that certain credit agreement (the \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d) with Post Road Administrative Finance, LLC and its affiliate Post Road Special Opportunity Fund I LLP (the \u201cPost Road Loan\u201d) entered into February 2019, which was subsequently paid off in conjunction with a securities purchase agreement entered into in September 2019. (see Note 15, Stockholders\u2019 Equity - Securities Purchase Agreement).\nInterest Expense Related to Debt Discount and Conversion Feature\nFor the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, interest expenses related to debt discount and conversion features of certain of our exercisable and convertible securities was $0.6 million and $0.2 million, respectively, an increase of $0.4 million. The increase was primarily attributable to the issuance of the Post Road Loan Facility in February 2019 that was subsequently paid off in conjunction with a securities purchase agreement entered into in September 2019. (see Note 15, Stockholders\u2019 Equity - Securities Purchase Agreement).\nChanges in Fair Value of Derivative Liabilities\nIn 2018, we recognized a revaluation gain of $1.3 million on derivative liabilities associated with a promissory note that was settled in the third quarter of 2018. We did not have a similar transaction in 2019.\nLoss on Extinguishment of Debt\nIn 2019, we recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of $8.9 million related to the extinguishment of Post Road Loan and Fortress Credit Agreement in September 2019 (see Note 12, Long-term Debt).\nGain on Equity Investment\nIn 2018, we recognized a gain on equity investment that represents the gain in our equity investment in Artilium at its carrying value of $3.2 million at the time of our acquisition of Artilium compared to its acquisition-date fair value of $9.6 million. There is no comparable transaction in 2019.\nAmortization of Deferred Financing Costs\nAmortization of deferred financing costs for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $0.2 million, compared to a de minimis amount in the same period in 2018. The increase was primarily attributable to the issuance of the Post Road Loan in February 2019 that was subsequently paid off in September 2019.\nOther Income (expense), net\nOther income (expense) net, is generated from non-operating activities and includes foreign currency gains and losses. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recorded other expense, net of $3.2 million compared to other income, net of $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease of $3.8 million was primarily due to the recognition of a reserve on a note receivable and the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates on our results in 2018 when compared to 2019.\nIncome Taxes Benefit\nIncome tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 was $8.3 million and $0.2 million, respectively. This change was primarily due to the full valuation of the deferred tax liability resulting from the Artilium acquisition. On October 1, 2018, the Company completed the acquisition of Artilium and as a result of the purchase price allocation, the Company recorded a net deferred tax liability of $8.6 million for the basis difference on acquired intangible assets and tax attributes from the business combination. The total tax-effected intangible impairment for Artilium in 2019 totaled $17.2 million.\nOther Comprehensive Loss\nWe record foreign currency translation gains and losses as part of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Foreign currency translation loss for the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 was $0.2 million and $0.2 million, respectively.\nConsolidated Quarterly Results Our unaudited quarterly financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019, as restated, and the impact of the restatement adjustments are summarized in the following tables.

Our deployments with existing customers continue to grow, new implementations generated new revenues and new cloud-based revenues were all factors in our revenue growth. Additionally, revenues include $8.9 million in revenues from Artilium and iPass which were acquired in October 2018 and February 2019, respectively. Comparable revenues were not reflected in the three months ended March 31, 2018, because these subsidiaries were acquired in subsequent periods.\nComparison of three months and six months ended June 30, 2019 and June 30, 2018.\nRevenues for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 were $16.9 million and $29.9 million; a $13.0 million and $22.4 million, respectively, or 335% and 298%, respectively, increase compared to $3.9 million and $7.5 million, respectively, for the comparable three and six months in 2018. The increase was primarily due to acquisition of Artilium and iPass that occurred subsequent to the same period in 2018.\nCost of Revenues\nCost of revenues includes origination, termination, network and billing charges from telecommunications operators, costs of telecommunications service providers, network costs, data center costs, facility cost of hosting network and equipment and cost in providing resale arrangements with long distance service providers, cost of leasing transmission facilities, international gateway switches for voice, data transmission services, and the cost of professional services of staff directly related to the generation of revenues, consisting primarily of employee-related costs associated with these services, including share-based compensation and the cost of subcontractors. Cost of service excludes depreciation and amortization.\nComparison of three months ended March 31, 2019 and March 31, 2018.\nCost of revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2019 was $8.0 million, an increase of $6.8 million or 571%, compared to $1.2 million for the comparable three-month period in 2018. For the three months ended March 31, 2019, this includes $5.0 million of cost of revenues for Artilium and iPass. Comparable costs were not reflected in the three months ended March 31, 2018, because these subsidiaries were acquired in subsequent periods.\nComparison of three months and six months ended June 30, 2019 and June 30, 2018.\nCost of revenues for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 was $12.6 million and $20.7 million, respectively, an increase of $10.8 million and $17.7 million, respectively, or 589% and 581%, respectively, compared to $1.8 million and $3.0 million, respectively, for the comparable three- and six-month periods in 2018. The increase in cost of revenues was primarily due to acquisition of Artilium and iPass that occurred subsequent to the same period in 2018 and volume in revenue growth.\nProduct Development\nProduct development costs consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, including share-based expenses, of employees involved in the development of the Company\u2019s services, which are expensed as incurred. Costs such as database architecture, and Pareteum BOSS & IN platform development and testing are included in this function.\nComparison of three months ended March 31, 2019 and March 31, 2018.\nProduct development costs for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, were $2.6 million and $0.7 million, respectively, an increase of $1.8 million or 251%. The increase is primarily due to the overall expansion of our lines of business year over year and the inclusion of product development costs of $0.8 million for Artilium and iPass for the three months ended March 31, 2019. Comparable costs were not reflected in the three months ended March 31, 2018, because these subsidiaries were acquired in subsequent periods.\nComparison of three months and six months ended June 30, 2019 and June 30, 2018.\nProduct development costs for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 were $3.6 million and $6.2 million, respectively, an increase of $2.8 million and $4.6 million, respectively, or 351% and 303%, respectively, compared to $0.8 million and $1.5 million, respectively, for the comparable three- and six-month periods in 2018. The increase was due to the overall expansion of our lines of business year over year. The increase in product development costs is primarily due to acquisition of Artilium and iPass that occurred subsequent to the same period in 2018 and overall expansion of our lines of business year over year.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, including share-based expenses, for our sales and marketing staff, including commissions, payments to partners and marketing programs. Marketing programs consist of advertising, events, corporate communications and brand building.\nComparison of three months ended March 31, 2019 and March 31, 2018.\nSales and marketing expenses for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, were $2.9 million and $0.7 million, respectively, an increase of $2.2 million or 317%. This increase is primarily a direct result of hiring new employees, the inclusion of the Artilium and iPass sales and marketing expenses of $0.9 million, and other incremental costs incurred as the Company expanded.\nComparison of three months and six months ended June 30, 2019 and June 30, 2018.\nSales and marketing expenses for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 were $3.1 million and $6.0 million, respectively, an increase of $2.3 million and $4.5 million, respectively, or 283% and 299%, respectively, compared to $0.8 million and $1.5 million, respectively, for the comparable three- and six-month periods in 2018. The increase in sales and marketing expenses is primarily due to acquisition of Artilium and iPass that occurred subsequent to the same period in 2018 and hiring new employees and allocating resources to growing our business.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses are typically our largest cost and consist primarily of overhead related salaries and expenses, including share-based compensation, for non-employee directors, finance and accounting, legal, internal audit and human resources personnel, legal costs, professional fees and other corporate expenses.\nComparison of three months ended March 31, 2019 and March 31, 2018.\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the three-month period ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, were $7.9 million and $1.8 million, respectively, an increase of $6.1 million or 334%. These increases were primarily due to the inclusion of general and administrative expenses for Artilium and iPass of $3.6 million and increase in personnel costs including share-based compensation expense.\nComparison of three months and six months ended June 30, 2019 and June 30, 2018.\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 were $8.4 million and $16.3 million, respectively, an increase of $6.1 million and $12.2 million, respectively, or 271% and 299%, respectively, compared to $2.3 million and $4.1 million, respectively, for the comparable three- and six-month periods in 2018. The increase in general and administrative expenses is primarily due to acquisition of Artilium and iPass that occurred subsequent to the same period in 2018 and increase in personnel costs including share-based compensation expense.\nRestructuring and Acquisition Charges\nComparison of three months ended March 31, 2019 and March 31, 2018.\nRestructuring and acquisition charges for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, were $3.3 million and $0.1 million, an increase of $3.2 million. The costs incurred in 2019 were primarily the result of the iPass acquisition which was completed on February 12, 2019.\nComparison of three months and six months ended June 30, 2019 and June 30, 2018.\nRestructuring and acquisition charges for the three months ended June 30, 2019 were $0.1 million. Restructuring and acquisition costs of $3.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019 were comprised predominantly of acquisition costs related to the acquisition of iPass that was completed on February 12, 2019 and to a lesser extent, restructuring charges following the acquisitions of Artilium and iPass.\nRestructuring and acquisition charges for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2018 were not significant.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, the Company reported net losses of $226.8 million and $18.0 million for the years ended 2019 and 2018, respectively, and had an accumulated deficit of $543.9 million as of December 31, 2019 and $317.1 million as of December 31, 2018. During the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company recognized a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $129.1 million and intangible assets impairment of $31.9 million.\nThe cash balance, including restricted cash and cash, of the Company at December 31, 2019 was $5.9 million. As of December 31, 2018, our cash balance, including restricted cash, was $6.5 million.\nOn June 8, 2020, we issued a $17.5 million 8% Senior Secured Convertible Note (the \u201cHigh Trail Note\u201d) to High Trail Investments SA LLC (\u201cHigh Trail\u201d) due April 1, 2025 for an aggregate purchase price of $14 million, of which $7 million is currently maintained in one or more blocked accounts. The terms of the High Trail Note and related documents require the Company to meet certain specified conditions and covenants, some of which have not been satisfied by the dates required, including (i) the Company filing its restated financial statements with the SEC for (a) the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, (b) the quarter ended March 31, 2019 and (c) the quarter ended June 30, 2019, in each case on or prior to October 31, 2020, (ii) after October 31, 2020, the Company timely filing its subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q or its subsequent annual reports on Form 10-K with the SEC in the manner and within the time periods required under the Exchange Act and (iii) the Company maintaining the listing of its common stock on the Nasdaq Stock Market. As a result, on December 1, 2020, we entered into a forbearance agreement (the \u201cForbearance Agreement\u201d) with High Trail under which: (i) we admitted that we were in default of several obligations under the High Trail Note and related agreements, (ii) High Trail acknowledged such defaults and agreed not to exercise any right or remedy under the High Trail Note or the related securities purchase agreement, warrant or security documents, including its right to accelerate the aggregate amount outstanding under the High Trail Note, until the earlier of December 31, 2020 (since extended to March 31, 2021), the date of any new event of default or initiation of any action by the Company to invalidate any of the representations and warranties made in the Forbearance Agreement. As a result of the defaults, the interest rate paid on the principal outstanding under the High Trail Note increased to 18% per annum. As partial consideration for its agreement to not to exercise any right or remedy under the High Trail financing documents, we agreed with High Trail to make certain changes to the High Trail Note and related agreements. In this regard, we agreed to delete the \u201cFloor Price\u201d of $0.10 that had previously limited the number of shares of Company common stock into which (i) the outstanding indebtedness could be converted upon default and (ii) payments of interest could be made. We also agreed to increase the number of shares it was required to reserve for issuance upon conversion of the High Trail Note and to decrease the exercise price of the related warrant from $0.58 to $0.37.\nOn February 22, 2021, the Company closed the issuance of $2.4 million aggregate principal amount of its Senior Second Lien Secured Convertible Notes due 2025 (the \u201cSecond Lien Notes\u201d). The Second Lien Notes were sold under the Securities Purchase Agreement, dated as of February 22, 2021, entered into by and between the Company and an institutional investor. The aggregate purchase price for the Second Lien Notes and related warrant to purchase common stock was $2.0 million. The Second Lien Notes are senior, secured obligations of the Company, but rank junior to the High Trail Note. Interest is payable monthly beginning April 1, 2021 at a rate of 8% per annum. The Second Lien Notes are secured by a second lien on substantially all assets of the Company and substantially all assets of its material U.S.-organized subsidiaries. Interest may be paid, at the election of the Company, in cash or in shares of common stock of the Company; provided, that, so long as the High Trail Note remains outstanding, such payments may only be made in shares. The number of shares issuable to pay interest in shares is determined by the application of a formula in which the amount of the interest due is divided by 85% of the lowest volume-weighted average price of the Company\u2019s common stock on the principal market for the Company\u2019s common stock over the 10 days preceding the date of such payment.\nSubject to an intercreditor agreement with the holder of the High Trail Note, upon notice by the Company, the Company may elect to redeem all or a portion of the then-outstanding principal amount outstanding under the Second Lien Note. The holder of the Second Lien Note or the Company may also elect for the Company to redeem the Second Lien Notes at a 20% premium if the Company undergoes a fundamental change. The Second Lien Notes will be convertible into shares of common stock, in part or in whole, from time to time, at the election of the holder of the Second Lien Notes. The initial conversion rate is 1666.6667 shares of Company common stock for each $1,000 of principal amount of Second Lien Notes. The conversion rate is subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments in the event the Company issues stock dividends or effects a split or reverse split of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nBecause of the limited nature of the relief provided under the Forbearance Agreement, which does not lower the amounts payable in principal or interest, and the limited amount of additional capital we raised by selling the Second Lien Notes, we believe that we will not have sufficient resources to fund our operations and meet the obligations specified in the note for the next twelve months following the filing of this Annual Report. Our software platforms require ongoing funding to continue the current development and operational plans and we have a history of net losses. We will continue to expend substantial resources for the foreseeable future in connection with the continued development of our software platforms. These expenditures will include costs associated with research and development activity, corporate administration, business development, and marketing and selling of our services. In addition, other unanticipated costs may arise.\nAs a result, we believe that additional capital will be required to fund our operations and provide growth capital to meet the obligations under the High Trail Note. Accordingly, we will have to raise additional capital in one or more debt and/or equity offerings. However, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in raising the necessary capital or that any such offering will be available to us on terms acceptable to us, or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital that may be needed, this would have a material adverse effect on the Company. Furthermore, the recent outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly disrupted world financial markets, has negatively impacted U.S. market conditions and may reduce opportunities for us to seek out additional funding. In particular, a decline in the market price of our common stock, coupled with the stock\u2019s delisting from the Nasdaq Capital Market, could make it more difficult to sell equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem appropriate. The factors discussed above raise substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued.\nOperating Activities\nWe reported net cash used in operating activities of $17.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to net cash used in operating activities of $7.8 million in 2018, an increase in cash used of $9.9 million. Operating activities decreased primarily as a result of a decrease in net operating results after the add back of the $161.0 million impairment of goodwill and intangible assets and $8.9 million loss on extinguishment of debt as well as the amortization of deferred financing costs, share-based compensation, depreciation and amortization and change in fair value of warrant liability.\n($ in thousands)\nNet loss $ (226,770 ) $ (18,024 )\nAdjustments to reconcile net loss to net cash used in operating activities: 192,617 5,511\n(34,153 ) (12,513 )\nChanges in operating assets and liabilities: 16,392 4,693\nNet cash used in operating activities $ (17,761 ) $ (7,820 )\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities for year ended December 31, 2019, was $11.1 million, a decrease of $0.4 million or 3%, compared to $11.5 million net cash used in investing activities in 2018. This decrease is a result of an all common stock acquisition of iPass in the year ended December 31, 2019 partially offset by an increase in capitalized software, notes receivable issued to a third party, and assets purchased from Devicescape Holdings, Inc.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019, was $28.3 million, compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $12.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Financing activities increased as a result of the Company\u2019s issuance of common equity and redeemable preferred stock offset by repayment of loans issued during the current year and the repayment of debt held by iPass as of the date of the acquisition.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company entered into certain off-balance sheet commitments that require the future purchase of goods or services (\u201cunconditional purchase obligations\u201d). We entered into the Strategic Connectivity Agreement (the \u201cConnectivity Agreement\u201d) with Hutchison 3G UK Limited (\u201c3UK\u201d) on July 23, 2019. Under the Connectivity Agreement, we are obligated to pay 3UK $0.6 million for the implementation of a MVNO (the \u201c3UK MVNO\u201d), and for monthly services provided, based on usage, after the 3UK MVNO is launched, which we anticipate to be in the third quarter of 2021. As of December 31, 2019, $0.1 million was invoiced by 3UK and is recorded in Accrued expenses and other payables in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2019. Of the remaining unconditional purchase obligation to 3UK outstanding as of December 31, 2019, we expect to incur $0.1 million in 2020 and the remainder in 2021.\nConcurrent with the execution of the Connectivity Agreement, we entered into the Agreement for the Sale and Purchase of Credit Voucher (the \u201cCredit Voucher Agreement\u201d) with PCCW Global Limited (\u201cPCCW\u201d) under which we are obligated to purchase a credit voucher for $28.0 million. The credit voucher will be used to offset certain monthly service charges incurred under the Connectivity Agreement. As of December 31, 2019, $0.6 million of the purchase price has been recorded in Accrued expenses and other payables in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The remaining $27.5 million unconditional purchase obligation is due and payable following the launch date of the 3UK MVNO, with minimum aggregate payments due as of June 30th, 2022, 2023, 2024 and 2025.\nSee Note 19, Commitments and Contingencies for additional details about these off-balance sheet arrangements.\nApplication of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nRevenue Recognition and Net billings in Excess of Revenues\nRevenue represents amounts earned for (non-software) arrangements consisting of hosting subscriptions for our CPaaS solutions. We also offer customer support and professional services related to implementing and supporting our suite of applications. Revenues generally are recognized net of any taxes collected from customers and subsequently remitted to governmental authorities.\nMonthly Service Revenues:\nThe Company\u2019s performance obligations in monthly Software as a Service (SaaS) and service offerings are simultaneously received and consumed by the customer and therefore, are recognized over time. For recognition purposes, we do not unbundle such services into separate performance obligations. The Company typically bills its customer at the end of each month, with payment to be received shortly thereafter. The fees charged may include a combination of fixed and variable charges with the variable charges tied to the number of subscribers or some other measure of volume. Although the consideration may be variable, the volumes are estimable at the time of billing, with \u201ctrue-up\u201d adjustments occurring in the subsequent month. Such amounts have not been historically significant.\nInstallation and Software Development Revenues:\nThe Company\u2019s other revenues consist generally of installation and software development projects.\nInstallation represents the activities necessary for a customer to obtain access and connectivity to the Company\u2019s monthly SaaS and service offerings. While installation may require separate phases, it represents one promise within the context of the contract.\nSoftware development consists of programming and other services which adds new functionality to a customer\u2019s existing or new service offerings. Each development project defines its milestones and will have its own performance obligation.\nRevenue is recognized over time if the installation and software development activities create an asset that has no alternative use for which the Company is entitled to receive payment for performance completed to date. If not, then revenue is not recognized until the applicable performance obligation is satisfied.\nArrangements with Multiple Performance Obligations:\nThe Company\u2019s contracts with customers may include multiple performance obligations. For such arrangements, the Company allocates revenue to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. The Company generally determines standalone selling prices based on the prices charged to customers.\nContract assets and liabilities:\nGiven the nature of the Company\u2019s services and contracts, it has no contract assets. The Company records net billings in excess of revenues when payments are made in advance of our performance, including amounts which are refundable.\nPayment terms vary by the type and location of our customer and the products or services offered. The term between invoicing and when payment is due is not significant. For certain products or services and customer types, payment is required before control is transferred or services are delivered to the customer.\nCost of Revenues\nCost of revenues includes origination, termination, network and billing charges from telecommunications operators, costs of telecommunications service providers, materials and supplies, network costs, data center costs, facility cost of hosting network and equipment and cost in providing resale arrangements with long distance service providers, cost of leasing transmission facilities, international gateway switches for voice, data transmission services, and the cost of professional services of staff directly related to the generation of revenues, consisting primarily of employee-related costs associated with these services, including share-based expenses and the cost of subcontractors. Cost of revenues excludes depreciation and amortization.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nWe record an allowance for estimated uncollectible accounts in an amount approximating anticipated losses. Accounts receivable are periodically evaluated for collectability based on past credit history with customers. An allowance is recorded on the basis of loss experience, known and inherent risk in the account balance and current economic conditions. Individual uncollectible accounts are written off against the allowance when collection of the individual accounts appears doubtful.\nIncome Taxes\nWe estimate our income taxes separately for each tax jurisdiction in which we conduct operations. The provision for federal, state, foreign and local income taxes is calculated on income before income taxes based on current tax law and includes the cumulative effect of any changes in tax rates from those used previously in determining deferred tax assets and liabilities. Such provision differs from the amounts currently payable because certain items of income and expense are recognized in different reporting periods for financial reporting purposes than for income tax purposes.\nWe record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized. In determining the net deferred tax assets and valuation allowances, we are required to make judgments and estimates in assessing the realizability of the deferred tax assets. In making such determination, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent results of operations. If we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount or would no longer be able to realize our deferred income tax assets in the future as currently recorded, we would make an adjustment to the valuation allowance which would decrease or increase the provision for income taxes.\nShare-based Compensation\nThe Company follows the provisions of ASC 718 Compensation-Stock Compensation (\u201cASC 718\u201d). Under ASC 718, share-based awards are recorded at fair value as of the grant date and recognized as expense with an adjustment for forfeiture over the employee\u2019s requisite service period (the vesting period, generally three years), which the Company amortizes on a straight-line basis.\nFor both contractors and advisory board members, we recognize the guidance for share-based compensation awards to non-employees in accordance with ASC 505-50 Equity-Based Payments to Non-Employees (\u201cASC 505-50\u201d). Under ASC 505-50, we determine the fair value of the options or share-based compensation awards granted as either the fair value of the consideration received, or the fair value of the equity instruments issued, whichever is more reliably measurable.\nShare-based compensation (cash and non-cash) related to equity plans for employees and non-employee directors are included within our cost of revenues and operating expenses.\nWarrant and Conversion feature derivative liabilities\nWarrants and convertible notes that are accounted for as derivative liabilities are remeasured at fair value each reporting period in accordance with the provisions of ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement (\u201cASC 820\u201d). The Company utilizes the Monte Carlo valuation model to determine the value of the outstanding warrants and the conversion feature in the convertible notes. Since the Monte Carlo valuation model requires special software and expertise to model the assumptions to be used, the Company uses a third-party valuation expert to fair value the derivative liabilities.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe generally recognize the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any non-controlling interests in an acquiree at their fair values as of the date of acquisition, under the purchase method of accounting. We measure goodwill as the excess of consideration transferred, which we also measure at fair value, over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The acquisition method of accounting requires us to exercise judgment and make significant estimates and assumptions regarding the fair values of the elements of a business combination as of the date of acquisition, including the fair values of identifiable intangible assets, deferred tax asset valuation allowances, liabilities related to uncertain tax positions, and contingencies. This method also requires us to refine these estimates over a one-year measurement period to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the measurement of the amounts recognized as of that date. If we are required to retroactively adjust provisional amounts that we have recorded for the fair value of assets and liabilities in connection with acquisitions, these adjustments could materially decrease our operating income and net income and result in lower asset values on our balance sheet.\nSignificant estimates and assumptions that we must make in estimating the fair value of acquired technology, customer lists, and other identifiable intangible assets include future cash flows that we expect to generate from the acquired assets. If the subsequent actual results and updated projections of the underlying business activity change compared with the assumptions and projections used to develop these values, we could record impairment charges. In addition, we have estimated the economic lives of certain acquired assets and these lives are used to calculate depreciation and amortization expense. If our estimates of the economic lives change, depreciation or amortization expenses could be accelerated or slowed.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets Impairment\nGoodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level, which is defined as an operating segment, or one level below the operating segment. We operate in one reportable segment.\nWe test for an indication of goodwill impairment in the fourth quarter of each year, or sooner, when indicators of impairment exist, by comparing the fair value of our reporting unit to its carrying value. If there is an indication of impairment, we perform a \u201cstep two\u201d test to measure the impairment. Impairments, if any, are recorded to the statement of operations in the period the impairment is recognized.\nA significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred. Such indicators include a sustained and significant decline in our stock price and market capitalization, a decline in our expected future cash flows, a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate and unanticipated competition.\nIn accordance with ASC 350 Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (\u201cASC 350\u201d), intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortization and impairment charges. Intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the expected useful lives of the assets, between three and ten years. Other intangible assets are reviewed for impairment in accordance with ASC 350, on an annual basis, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Measurement of any impairment loss for long-lived assets and identifiable intangible assets that management expects to hold and use, is based on the amount of the carrying value that exceeds the fair value of the asset.\nContingent Losses\nFrom time to time, during the normal course of operations, we are party to litigation and regulatory matters, claims and other contingent matters. Litigation and regulatory reviews can be expensive and disruptive to normal business operations. Moreover, the results of complex proceedings and reviews are difficult to predict and our view of these matters may change in the future as events related thereto unfold. We expense legal fees as incurred. We record a provision for contingent losses when it is both probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount or range of the loss can be reasonably estimated. An unfavorable outcome to any legal or regulatory matter, if material, could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s operations or its financial position, liquidity or results of operations.\nImpact of Recent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 1, Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report for a discussion of the impact of recent accounting pronouncements.",

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nPareteum Corporation\nAND SUBSIDIARIES\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nPAGE\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2019 AND 2018\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS AND COMPREHENSIVE LOSS FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019 AND 2018\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CHANGES IN STOCKHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY (DEFICIT) FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019 AND 2018\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019 AND 2018\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Pareteum Corporation\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Pareteum Corporation and its subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, changes in stockholders\u2019 equity (deficit) and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes to the consolidated financial statements (collectively, the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (Untied States) (PCAOB), the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013. Our report dated March 12, 2021 expressed an opinion that the Company had not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019 based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013.\nGoing Concern Uncertainty\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company has suffered recurring losses from operations, negative cash flows from operations, and had a negative working capital of $31.3 million and an accumulated deficit of $543.9 million as of December 31, 2019. This raises substantial doubt about the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern. In addition, with respect to the ongoing and evolving coronavirus (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) outbreak, which was designated as a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020, the outbreak has cause substantial disruption in international and U.S. economies and markets and if repercussions of the outbreak are prolonged, could have a significant adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business. Management\u2019s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 1. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nChange in Accounting Principle\nAs discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company has changed its method of accounting for leases during the ended December 31, 2019 due to the adoption of Accounting Standards Codification 842, Leases.\nImpairment of Goodwill and Intangible Assets\nAs discussed in Note 8 to the financial statements, in the fourth quarter of 2019 the Company recorded an impairment charge of approximately $161.0 million related to goodwill and intangible assets.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company\u2019s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n/s/ Baker Tilly US, LLP\nWe have served as the Company\u2019s auditor since 2014.\nLos Angeles, California\nMarch 12, 2021\nPareteum Corporation and Subsidiaries\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(in thousands, except share and per share amounts)\nAs of December 31,\nASSETS\nCURRENT ASSETS\nCash and cash equivalents\n$ 4,447\n$ 6,052\nRestricted cash\n1,455\nAccounts receivable, net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of $1,546 at December 31, 2019 and $514 at December 31, 2018\n8,307\n3,338\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets\n4,453\n2,084\nTotal current assets\n18,662\n11,905\nNON- CURRENT ASSETS\nOTHER ASSETS\nRIGHT OF USE LEASE ASSETS\n2,241\n-\nNOTE RECEIVABLE, NON-CURRENT\n1,082\nPROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT, NET\n6,262\n5,444\nINTANGIBLE ASSETS, NET\n15,500\n39,658\nGOODWILL\n10,099\n101,375\nTOTAL ASSETS\n$ 54,028\n$ 159,509\nLIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY\nCURRENT LIABILITIES\nAccounts payable and customer deposits\n$ 30,374\n$ 10,338\nNet billings in excess of revenues\n2,529\nAccrued expenses and other payables\n13,616\n7,741\nPromissory note\nLease liabilities, current\n2,422\n-\n9% Unsecured subordinate convertible promissory note (current portion net of debt discount and debt issuance)\n-\nTotal current liabilities\n49,934\n19,094\nLONG TERM LIABILITIES\n8% Series C Redeemable Preferred Stock, net\n4,798\n-\nLease liabilities, non-current\n-\nOther long-term liabilities\nDeferred tax liabilities\n-\n8,386\nRelated party loan\nTotal long-term liabilities\n5,656\n8,941\nTotal liabilities\n55,590\n28,035\nCommitments and Contingencies (See Notes)\nSTOCKHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY (DEFICIT)\nPreferred Stock $0.00001 par value, 50,000,000 shares authorized; designated 150 shares and 13,000 shares as Series A and B, respectively, of which 0 issued and outstanding as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively\n-\n-\nCommon Stock $0.00001 par value, 500,000,000 shares authorized, 139,060,180 and 98,292,530 issued and outstanding as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively\n547,948\n453,995\nAccumulated other comprehensive loss\n(5,608 )\n(5,389 )\nAccumulated deficit\n(543,902 )\n(317,132 )\nTotal stockholders\u2019 equity (deficit)\n(1,562 )\n131,474\nTOTAL LIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY (DEFICIT)\n$ 54,028\n$ 159,509\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.\nPareteum Corporation and Subsidiaries\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS AND COMPREHENSIVE LOSS\n(in thousands, except per share data)\nFor the years ended December 31,\nREVENUES\n$ 62,049\n$ 20,258\nCOST AND OPERATING EXPENSES\nCost of revenues (excluding depreciation and amortization)\n47,134\n10,054\nProduct development\n12,956\n3,083\nSales and marketing\n10,345\n3,197\nGeneral and administrative\n34,583\n17,330\nRestructuring and acquisition costs\n3,457\n7,260\nImpairment of goodwill and intangible assets\n160,989\n-\nDepreciation and amortization\n12,938\n5,427\nTotal cost and operating expenses\n282,402\n46,351\nLOSS FROM OPERATIONS\n(220,353 )\n(26,093 )\nOTHER INCOME (EXPENSE)\nInterest income\nInterest expense\n(2,120 )\n(309 )\nInterest expense related to debt discount and conversion feature\n(619 )\n(184 )\nChanges in derivative liabilities\n-\n1,284\nLoss on extinguishment of debt\n(8,873 )\n-\nGain on equity investment\n-\n6,371\nAmortization of deferred financing costs\n(237 )\n(29 )\nOther income (expense), net\n(3,221 )\nTotal other income (expense)\n(14,712 )\n7,895\nLOSS BEFORE (BENEFIT) PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES\n(235,065 )\n(18,198 )\nIncome tax benefit\n(8,295 )\n(174 )\nNET LOSS\n(226,770 )\n(18,024 )\nOTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS\nForeign currency translation loss\n(219 )\n(200 )\nCOMPREHENSIVE LOSS\n$ (226,989 )\n$ (18,224 )\nNet loss per common share and equivalents -

Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nDescription of Business\nPareteum is an experienced provider of Communications Platform as a Service (\u201cCPaaS\u201d) solutions.

These features facilitate and improve the ability of our channel partners to provide support and to drive sales.\nAs of October 1, 2018, the Company acquired Artilium plc (\u201cArtilium\u201d), which operates as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. Artilium is a software development company active in the enterprise communications and core telecommunications markets delivering software solutions which layer over disparate fixed, mobile and IP networks to enable the deployment of converged communication services and applications.\nAs of February 12, 2019, the Company acquired iPass Inc. (\u201ciPass\u201d), which operates as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. iPass is a cloud-based service provider of global mobile connectivity, offering Wi-Fi access on any mobile device through its SaaS platform.\nLiquidity\nAs reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, the Company reported net loss of $226,770 and $18,024 for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and had negative working capital of $31,272 and an accumulated deficit of $543,902 as of December 31, 2019. The cash balance, including restricted cash, as of December 31, 2019, was $5,902.\nOn June 8, 2020, the Company issued a $17.5 million 8% Senior Secured Convertible Note (the \u201cHigh Trail Note\u201d) to High Trail Investments SA LLC (\u201cHigh Trail\u201d) due April 1, 2025 for an aggregate purchase price of $14 million, of which $7 million is currently maintained in one or more blocked accounts. The terms of the High Trail Note and related documents require the Company to meet certain specified conditions and covenants, some of which have not been satisfied by the dates required, including (i) the Company filing its restated financial statements with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) for (a) the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, (b) the quarter ended March 31, 2019 and (c) the quarter ended June 30, 2019, in each case on or prior to October 31, 2020, (ii) after October 31, 2020, the Company timely filing its subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q or its subsequent annual reports on Form 10-K with the SEC in the manner and within the time periods required under the Exchange Act and (iii) the Company maintaining the listing of its common stock on the Nasdaq Stock Market (see Note 22, Subsequent Events). As a result, on December 1, 2020, we entered into a forbearance agreement (the \u201cForbearance Agreement\u201d) with High Trail under which: (i) we admitted that we were in default of several obligations under the High Trail Note and related agreements, (ii) High Trail acknowledged such defaults and agreed not to exercise any right or remedy under the High Trail Note or the related securities purchase agreement, warrant or security documents, including its right to accelerate the aggregate amount outstanding under the High Trail Note, until the earlier of December 31, 2020 (since extended to February 28, 2021), the date of any new event of default or initiation of any action by the Company to invalidate any of the representations and warranties made in the Forbearance Agreement. As a result of the defaults, the interest rate paid on the principal outstanding under the High Trail Note increased to 18% per annum. As partial consideration for its agreement to not exercise any right or remedy under the High Trail financing documents, we agreed with High Trail to make certain changes to the High Trail Note and related agreements. In this regard, we agreed to delete the \u201cFloor Price\u201d of $0.10 that had previously limited the number of shares of Company common stock into which (i) the outstanding indebtedness could be converted upon default and (ii) payments of interest could be made. We also agreed to increase the number of shares it was required to reserve for issuance upon conversion of the High Trail Note and to decrease the exercise price of the related warrant from $0.58 to $0.37.\nPareteum Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Amounts in thousands except share and per share data and unless otherwise indicated)\nBecause of the limited nature of the relief provided under the Forbearance Agreement, which does not lower the amounts payable in principal or interest, the Company believes that it will not have sufficient resources to fund its operations and meet the obligations specified in the note for the next twelve months following the filing of this Annual Report. The Company\u2019s software platforms require ongoing funding to continue the current development and operational plans and the Company has a history of net losses. The Company will continue to expend substantial resources for the foreseeable future in connection with the continued development of its software platforms. These expenditures will include costs associated with research and development activity, corporate administration, business development, and marketing and selling of the Company\u2019s services. In addition, other unanticipated costs may arise.\nAs a result, the Company believes that additional capital will be required to fund its operations and provide growth capital to meet the obligations under the High Trail Note. Accordingly, the Company will have to raise additional capital in one or more debt and/or equity offerings and continue to work with High Trail to cure the defaults. However, there can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in raising the necessary capital or that any such offering will be available to the Company on terms acceptable to the Company, or at all. If the Company is unable to raise additional capital that may be needed and with acceptable terms, this would have a material adverse effect on the Company. Furthermore, the recent outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly disrupted world financial markets, has negatively impacted U.S. market conditions and may reduce opportunities for the Company to seek out additional funding. In particular, a decline in the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock, coupled with the stock\u2019s delisting from the Nasdaq Capital Market, could make it more difficult to sell equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price that the Company deems appropriate. The factors discussed above raise substantial doubt as to the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Pareteum and its subsidiaries and have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d). All intercompany transactions and account balances have been eliminated in consolidation.\nForeign Currency Translation\nThe Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements were translated into U.S. dollars in accordance with ASC 830, Foreign Currency Matters (\u201cASC 830\u201d). The majority of the Company\u2019s operations are carried out in Euros. For all operations outside of the U.S., assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars using the period end exchange rates and the average exchange rates as to revenues and expenses, and capital accounts were translated at their historical exchange rates when the capital transaction occurred. In accordance with ASC 830, net gains and losses resulting from translation of foreign currency financial statements are included in the Statement of Changes in Stockholders\u2019 Equity as Other comprehensive income (loss). Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Loss, under the line item \u201cOther income (expense), net\u201d.\nContingent Losses\nThe Company records a provision for contingent losses when it is both probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount or range of the loss can be reasonably estimated. An unfavorable outcome to any legal or regulatory matter, if material, could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s operations or its financial position, liquidity or results of operations. The Company expenses legal fees as incurred.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements conforms with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. and requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and intangible assets acquired through acquisitions. Significant estimates include the bad debt allowance; revenue recognition; impairment of goodwill, intangible assets and long-lived assets; valuation of financial instruments; realization of deferred tax assets; useful lives of long-lived assets; share-based compensation and contingent losses. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nPareteum Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Amounts in thousands except share and per share data and unless otherwise indicated)\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents.\nRestricted Cash\nRestricted cash as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 was $1,455 and $431, respectively, and consists primarily of cash deposited in blocked accounts as bank guarantees for corporate credit cards and letters of credit issued to vendors related to contract performance.\nAccounts Receivables, net\nThe Company has a geographically dispersed customer base. The Company maintains an allowance for potential credit losses on accounts receivable. The Company makes ongoing assumptions relating to the collectability of our accounts receivable. The accounts receivable amounts presented on our Consolidated Balance Sheets include an allowance for accounts that might not be collected. In determining the amount of the allowance, the Company considers its historical level of credit losses. The Company also makes judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations, and the Company assesses current economic trends that might impact the level of credit losses in the future. The Company\u2019s allowances have generally been adequate to cover its actual credit losses. However, since the Company cannot reliably predict future changes in the financial stability of its customers, it cannot guarantee that its allowances will continue to be adequate. If actual credit losses are significantly greater than the allowance, the Company would increase its general and administrative expenses and increase its reported net losses. Conversely, if actual credit losses are significantly less than our reserve, this would eventually decrease the Company\u2019s general and administrative expenses and decrease its reported net losses. Allowances are recorded primarily on a specific identification basis. See Note 3, Allowance for Doubtful Accounts to the Financial Statements for more information.\nLeasing Arrangements\nThe Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating leases are included in operating lease right-of-use (\u201cROU\u201d) assets and lease liabilities in the Company\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of adoption of ASU No. 2016-02, \u201cLeases (Topic 842)\u201d the Company was not party to finance lease arrangements.\nROU assets represent the Company\u2019s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Company\u2019s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As the Company\u2019s leases do not generally provide an implicit rate, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. The implicit rate is used when it is readily determinable. The Company\u2019s lease agreements may have lease and non-lease components, which the Company accounts for as a single lease component. The Company\u2019s lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. Lease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and variable payments are recognized in the period they are incurred. The Company\u2019s lease agreements do not contain any residual value guarantees. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet.\nUnder the available practical expedient, the Company accounts for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component.\nRevenue Recognition\nOur revenues represent amounts earned for our mobile and CPaaS solutions. Our solutions take many forms but our revenue generally consists of fixed and/or variable charges for services delivered monthly under a combined services and SaaS model. We also offer discrete (one-time) services for implementation and for development of specific functionality to properly service our customers.\nThe following table presents our revenues disaggregated by revenue source:\nYears Ended\nDecember 31,\nMonthly Service $ 61,206 $ 19,170\nInstallation and Software Development 1,088\nTotal revenues $ 62,049 $ 20,258\nPareteum Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Amounts in thousands except share and per share data and unless otherwise indicated)\nBoth monthly services revenues are recognized over time and installation and software development revenues are recognized over time.\nThe following table presents our revenues disaggregated by geography, based on the billing addresses of our customers:\nYears Ended\nDecember 31,\nEurope $ 39,957 $ 18,753\nUnited States 20,124\nOther geographic areas 1,968\nTotal revenues $ 62,049 $ 20,258\nMonthly Service Revenues\nThe Company\u2019s performance obligations in a monthly Software as a Service (SaaS) and service offerings are simultaneously received and consumed by the customer and therefore, are recognized over time. For recognition purposes, we do not unbundle such services into separate performance obligations. The Company typically bills its customer at the end of each month, with payment to be received shortly thereafter. The fees charged may include a combination of fixed and variable charges with the variable charges tied to the number of subscribers or some other measure of volume. Although the consideration may be variable, the volumes are estimable at the time of billing, with \u201ctrue-up\u201d adjustments occurring in the subsequent month.\nInstallation and Software Development Revenues\nThe Company\u2019s other revenues consist generally of installation and software development projects.\nInstallation represents the activities necessary for a customer to obtain access and connectivity to the Company\u2019s monthly SaaS and service offerings. While installation may require separate phases, it represents one promise within the context of the contract.\nDevelopment consists of programming and other services which adds new functionality to a customer\u2019s existing or new service offerings. Each development project defines its milestones and will have its own performance obligation.\nRevenue is recognized over time if the installation and development activities create an asset that has no alternative use for which the Company is entitled to receive payment for performance completed to date. If not, then revenue is not recognized until the applicable performance obligation is satisfied.\nArrangements with Multiple Performance Obligations\nThe Company\u2019s contracts with customers may include multiple performance obligations. For such arrangements, the Company allocates revenue to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. The Company generally determines standalone selling prices based on the prices charged to customers.\nContract Assets and Liabilities\nGiven the nature of the Company\u2019s services and contracts, it has no contract assets.\nThe Company records net billings in excess of revenues when payments are made in advance of our performance, including amounts which are refundable. Net billings in excess of revenues were $2,529 and $227 as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nPayment terms vary by the type and location of our customer and the products or services offered. The term between invoicing and when payment is due is not significant. For certain products or services and customer types, payment is required before control is transferred or services are delivered to the customer.\nPareteum Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Amounts in thousands except share and per share data and unless otherwise indicated)\nCost of Revenues\nCost of Revenues\nCost of revenues includes origination, termination, network and billing charges from telecommunications operators, costs of telecommunications service providers, supplies and materials, network costs, data center costs, facility cost of hosting network and equipment and cost in providing resale arrangements with long distance service providers, cost of leasing transmission facilities, international gateway switches for voice, data transmission services, and the cost of professional services of staff directly related to the generation of revenues, consisting primarily of employee-related costs associated with these services, including share-based expenses and the cost of subcontractors. Cost of revenues excludes depreciation and amortization.\nReporting Segments\nThe segment reporting guidance in ASC 280, Segments Reporting (\u201cASC 280\u201d), defines operating segments as components of an enterprise for which discrete financial information is available and that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker (\u201cCODM\u201d) for purposes of allocating resources and in assessing performance. The Company has determined its Chief Executive Officer, together with its Chief Financial Officer, to be the CODM. During the assessment of segment reporting for the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company identified three operating segments. The three operating segments, Legacy Pareteum, Artilium and iPass, have been aggregated into one reportable segment as they have similar economic characteristics in that they provide communications connectivity through a communication-as-a-service platform to similar customers wishing to be connected to everything mobile. The results of this assessment also consider the impacts of recent acquisitions of Artilium and iPass and the way in which internally reported financial information is used by the CODM to make decisions and allocate resources.\nFair Value Measurements\nIn accordance with ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement (\u201cASC 820\u201d), the Company defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability (i.e., the exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available.\nObservable inputs are those that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Company. Unobservable inputs reflect the Company\u2019s assumptions about the inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances.\nThe fair value hierarchy is categorized into three levels based on the inputs as follows:\nLevel 1 - Quoted prices are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reported date.\nLevel 2 - Pricing inputs are other than quoted prices in active markets, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reported date. The nature of these financial instruments includes cash instruments for which quoted prices are available but are traded less frequently, derivative instruments whose fair values have been derived using a model where inputs to the model are directly observable in the market and instruments that are fair valued using other financial instruments, the parameters of which can be directly observed.\nLevel 3 - Instruments that have little to no pricing observability as of the reported date. These financial instruments are measured using management\u2019s best estimate of fair value, where the inputs into the determination of fair value require significant management judgment or estimation.\nThe degree of judgment exercised by the Company in determining fair value is greatest for assets categorized in Level 3. In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, for disclosure purposes, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement falls in its entirety is determined by the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.\nNonrecurring fair value measurements\nThe Company\u2019s nonfinancial assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis include goodwill and intangible assets acquired in business combinations as well as fair value measurements used when performing its annual impairment test. The valuation methods used to determine fair value require a significant degree of management judgment to determine the key assumptions which include projected revenues and appropriate discount rates. As such, the Company classifies nonfinancial assets subjected to nonrecurring fair value adjustments at level 3 measurements. The Company hired a third-party valuation expert to value the trade names, customer relationships and the technology acquired as part of the acquisition of Artilium and iPass due to the expertise required to model the assumptions used. At December 31, 2019, goodwill and certain intangible assets were impaired and written down to their fair value; see Note 8, Goodwill and Net Intangibles.\nPareteum Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Amounts in thousands except share and per share data and unless otherwise indicated)\nRecurring fair value measurements - Warrant Derivative Liabilities and Conversion Feature Derivative\nIn cases where the Company needs to account for derivative liabilities, the Company uses the Monte Carlo valuation model and the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the value of the outstanding warrants and conversion feature, in these situations, the Company hires a third-party valuation expert to prepare such calculations due to the expertise required to model the assumptions. There were no derivative liabilities at December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nNumber of Outstanding Warrants and/or Convertible Notes\nThe number of outstanding warrants and/or convertible notes is adjusted every re-measurement date after deducting for the exercise or conversion of any outstanding warrants convertible notes during the previous reporting period.\nStock Price at Valuation Date\nThe closing stock price at re-measurement date being the last available closing price of the reporting period taken from www.nasdaq.com.\nExercise Price\nThe exercise price is fixed and determined under the terms of the financing facility it was issued.\nRemaining Term\nThe remaining term is calculated by using the estimated term of the outstanding principal liability at the re-measurement date.\nExpected Volatility\nManagement estimates expected cumulative volatility giving consideration to the expected term of the note and/or warrants and calculated the annual volatility by using the continuously compounded return calculated by using the share closing prices of an equal number of days prior to the maturity date of the note (reference period). The annual volatility is used to determine the (cumulative) volatility of the Company\u00b4s common stock.\nLiquidity Event\nWe estimate the expected liquidity event considering the average expectation of the timing of fundraises and the need for those funds offset against scheduled repayment dates and the costs and/or savings of the future steps in re-modelling the organization.\nRisk-Free Interest Rate\nManagement estimates the risk-free interest rate using the \u201cDaily Treasury Yield Curve Rates\u201d from the US Treasury Department with a term equal to the reported rate or derived by using both spread in intermediate term and rates, up to the expected maturity date of the derivative involved.\nExpected Dividend Yield\nManagement estimates the expected dividend yield by giving consideration to the Company\u00b4s current dividend policies as well as those anticipated in the future considering the Company\u00b4s current plans and projections. Management currently does not believe that it is in the best interest of the Company to pay dividends at this time.\nPareteum Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Amounts in thousands except share and per share data and unless otherwise indicated)\nFinancial Instruments\nThe carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable, notes receivable, promissory notes (payable) and customer deposits approximate their fair values based on their short-term nature. The recorded values of long-term debt, including the 8% Series C Redeemable Preferred Stock, approximate their fair values, as interest approximates market rates (Level 2). The Company\u2019s unsecured convertible promissory note conversion feature, a derivative instrument in 2018, is recognized in the balance sheet at its fair values with changes in fair market value reported in earnings (Level 3).\nShare-based Compensation\nThe Company follows the provisions of ASC 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation, (\u201cASC 718\u201d). Under ASC 718, share-based awards are recorded at fair value as of the grant date and recognized as expense with an adjustment for forfeiture over the employee\u2019s requisite service period (the vesting period, generally up to three years). The share-based compensation cost based on the grant date fair value is amortized over the period in which the related services are received.\nIn periods prior to January 1, 2019, the Company accounted for the issuance of share-based compensation awards to contractors and advisory board members in accordance with ASC 505-50 Equity-Based Payments to Non-Employees (\u201cASC 505-50\u201d). Under ASC 505-50, we determined the fair value of the options or share-based compensation awards granted as either the fair value of the consideration received, or the fair value of the equity instruments issued, whichever is more reliably measurable. On January 1, 2019, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update 2018-07, Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting requiring the measurement of the share-based compensation awards granted to non-employees at the grant-date fair value, in a manner consistently with equity-classified awards issued to employees.\nTo determine the value of our stock options at grant date under our employee stock option plan, the Company uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The use of this model requires the Company to make many subjective assumptions. The following addresses each of these assumptions and describes our methodology for determining each assumption:\nExpected Term\nThe expected term represents the period that the stock option awards are expected to be outstanding. The Company uses the simplified method for estimating the expected term of the option, by taking the average between time to vesting and the contract term of the award.\nExpected Volatility\nThe Company estimates expected cumulative volatility giving consideration to the expected term of the option of the respective award, and the calculated annual volatility by using the continuously compounded return calculated by using the share closing prices of an equal number of days prior to the grant-date (reference period). The annual volatility is used to determine the (cumulative) volatility of its common stock.\nForfeiture rate\nThe Company is using the aggregate forfeiture rate. The aggregate forfeiture rate is the ratio of pre-vesting forfeitures over the awards granted (pre-vesting forfeitures/grants).\nRisk-Free Interest Rate\nThe Company estimates the risk-free interest rate using the \u201cDaily Treasury Yield Curve Rates\u201d from the U.S. Treasury Department with a term equal to the reported rate or derived by using both spread in intermediate term and rates, to the expected term of the award.\nExpected Dividend Yield\nThe Company estimates the expected dividend yield by giving consideration to our current dividend policies as well as those anticipated in the future considering our current plans and projections.\nPareteum Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Amounts in thousands except share and per share data and unless otherwise indicated)\nIncome Taxes\nCurrent tax is based on the income or loss from ordinary activities adjusted for items that are non-assessable or disallowable for income tax purpose and is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted at the balance sheet date. Deferred tax assets are recognized for the expected future tax benefit to be derived from various sources such as tax losses and tax credit carry-forwards. Establishment of a valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that deferred taxes will not be fully realized.\nIn the ordinary course of a global business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of revenue sharing and reimbursement arrangements among related entities, the identification of revenue and expenses that qualify for preferential tax treatment and assessment of the sustainability of tax positions based on several factors including changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, settled audit issues and new audit activity.\nThe Company files federal income tax returns in the U.S., various U.S. state jurisdictions and various foreign jurisdictions. The Company\u2019s income tax returns are open to examination by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, generally for 3 years but can be extended to 6 years under certain circumstances. In other jurisdictions the period for examinations depends on local legislation, typically ranging from three to eight years. The Company\u2019s policy is to record estimated interest and penalties on unrecognized tax benefits as part of its income tax provision.\nComprehensive Income (Loss)\nFor the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company\u2019s comprehensive loss consisted of net losses and foreign currency translation adjustments.\nBusiness Combinations\nThe acquisition method of accounting for business combinations as per ASC 805, Business Combinations (\u201cASC 805\u201d), requires the Company to use significant estimates and assumptions, including fair value estimates, as of the business combination date and to refine those estimates as necessary during the measurement period (defined as the period, not to exceed one year, in which the Company may adjust the provisional amounts recognized for a business combination).\nUnder the acquisition method of accounting, the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any non-controlling interests acquired in the acquisition are recognized as of the closing date for purposes of determining fair value. The Company measures goodwill as of the acquisition date as the excess of consideration transferred, over the net of the acquisition date fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Costs that the Company incurs to complete the business combination such as investment banking, legal and other professional fees are not considered part of consideration and the Company charges them to general and administrative expense as they are incurred.\nDuring the measurement period, the Company adjusts the provisional amounts recognized at the acquisition date to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the measurement of the amounts recognized as of that date. Measurement period adjustments are recognized in the reporting period in which they are determined.\nGoodwill\nThe Company records goodwill when the fair value of consideration transferred in a business combination exceeds the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill and other intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives are not amortized, but the Company tests them for impairment annually during its fourth fiscal quarter and whenever an event or change in circumstances indicates that the carrying value of the asset is impaired.\nThe authoritative guidance for the goodwill impairment model includes a two-step process. First, it requires a comparison of the carrying value of the reporting unit to its fair value. If the fair value is determined to be less than the carrying value, a second step is performed. In the second step, the Company compares the implied fair value of goodwill to its carrying value in the reporting unit. The shortfall of the fair value below carrying value, if any, would represent the amount of goodwill impairment charge. The Company uses the criteria in ASU No. 2011-08 Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Testing Goodwill for Impairment, which permits the Company to make a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not than not that a reporting unit\u2019s fair value is less than the carrying amount before applying the two-step goodwill impairment test. If the Company concludes that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less that its carrying amount, it would not need to perform the two-step impairment test for that reporting unit.\nPareteum Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Amounts in thousands except share and per share data and unless otherwise indicated)\nThe Company tests goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter of each year, or sooner should there be an indicator of impairment as per ASC 350. The Company periodically analyzes whether any such indicators of impairment exist. Such indicators include a sustained, significant decline in the Company\u2019s stock price and market capitalization, a decline in the Company\u2019s expected future cash flows, a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate, unanticipated competition, and/or slower growth rate, among others. In the Company\u2019s case, the primary indicators are the continuing losses and decline in the Company\u2019s expected future cash flows. At December31, 2019 goodwill was impaired and written down to fair value; see Note 8, Goodwill and Net Intangibles.\nLong-Lived Assets and Intangible Assets\nIn accordance with ASC 30, long-lived assets, including intangible assets subject to amortization, are carried at cost less accumulated amortization and impairment charges. Intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the expected useful lives of the assets, between three and ten years. Long-lived assets, including intangible assets subject to amortization, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. Impairment is measured based on the amount of the carrying a that exceeds the fair value of the asset. At December31, 2019, certain intangible assets were impaired and written down to their fair value; see Note 8, Goodwill and Net Intangibles.\nProperty and Equipment, Internal Use Software and Third- Party Software\nProperty and equipment are initially recorded at cost. Additions and improvements are capitalized, while expenditures that do not enhance the assets or extend the useful life are charged to operating expenses as incurred. Included in property and equipment are certain costs related to the development of the Company\u2019s internally developed software technology platform.\nThe Company has adopted the provisions of ASC 350-40, Internal-Use Software, and therefore the costs incurred in the preliminary stages of development are expensed as incurred. The Company capitalizes all costs related to software developed or obtained for internal use when management commits to funding the project; the preliminary project stage is completed and when technological feasibility is established. Software developed for internal use has generally been used to deliver hosted services to the Company\u2019s customers. Technological feasibility is considered to have occurred upon completion of a detailed program design that has been confirmed by documenting the product specifications, or to the extent that a detailed program design is not pursued, upon completion of a working model that has been confirmed by testing to be consistent with the product design. Once a new functionality or improvement is released for operational use, the asset is moved from the property and equipment category \u201cconstruction in progress\u201d (\u201cCIP\u201d) to a property and equipment asset subject to depreciation. In addition, account management also records equipment acquired from third parties, until it is ready for use. Capitalization of costs ceases when the project is substantially complete and ready for its intended use. Depreciation is applied using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets once the assets are placed in service.\nManagement evaluates the useful lives of these assets on an annual basis and tests for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets. There were no material impairment losses recognized in 2019 and 2018 related to property and equipment, internal use software and third-party software.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nIn June 2018, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update (\u201cASU\u201d) 2018-07, Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting. ASU 2018-07 expands the scope of Topic 718 to include share-based payment transactions for acquiring goods and services from non-employees. ASU2018-07became effective for the Company on January 1, 2019. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements.\nIn July 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-11, Earnings per Share (Topic 260), Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity (Topic 480), Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815)(\u201cASU 2017-11\u201d). ASU 2017-11 consists of two parts. The amendments in Part I of this update change the classification analysis of certain equity-linked financial instruments (or embedded features) with down round features. When determining whether certain financial instruments should be classified as liabilities or equity instruments, a down round feature no longer precludes equity classification when assessing whether the instrument is indexed to an entity\u2019s own stock. The amendments also clarify existing disclosure requirements for equity-classified instruments. As a result, a freestanding equity-linked financial instrument (or embedded conversion option) no longer would be accounted for as a derivative liability at fair value as a result of the existence of a down round feature. For freestanding equity classified financial instruments, the amendments require entities that present earnings per share (\u201cEPS\u201d) in accordance with Topic 260 to recognize the effect of the down round feature when it is triggered. That effect is treated as a dividend and as a reduction of income available to common stockholders in basic EPS. Convertible instruments with embedded conversion options that have down round features are now subject to the specialized guidance for contingent beneficial conversion features (in Subtopic 470-20, Debt-Debt with Conversion and Other Options), including related EPS guidance (in Topic 260). The amendments in Part II of this update re-characterize the indefinite deferral of certain provisions of Topic 480 that now are presented as pending content in the Codification, to a scope exception. Those amendments do not have an accounting effect. For public business entities, the amendments in Part I of this update are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted for all entities, including adoption in an interim period. If an entity early adopts the amendments in an interim period, any adjustments should be reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes that interim period. The amendments in Part II of this update do not require any transition guidance because those amendments do not have an accounting effect. ASU2017-11became effective for the Company on January 1, 2019. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements.\nPareteum Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Amounts in thousands except share and per share data and unless otherwise indicated)\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (\u201cASU 2016-02\u201d). This new standard establishes a right-of-use (ROU) model that requires a lessee to record a ROU asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. Leases will be classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. In July 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-11 which provides an alternative transition method that allows entities to apply the new leases standard at the adoption date and recognize a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the period of adoption. The Company has adopted the requirements of ASU 2016-02 on January 1, 2019, using the modified retrospective method. The Company took advantage of the practical expedient options, which allows an entity not to reassess whether any existing or expired contracts contain leases. Upon adoption of this standard on January 1, 2019, the Company recorded right of use assets and corresponding lease liabilities of $1.8 million. The standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated income statements. We elected to apply the practical expedient related to land easements, as well as the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance in the new standard, which allowed us to carryforward our historical lease classification.\nIn February 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-02, Income Statement-Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (\u201cASU 2018-02\u201d). The ASU allows entities to reclassify certain \u201cstranded tax effects\u201d resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \u201cTax Act\u201d) from accumulated other comprehensive income (\u201cAOCI\u201d) to retained earnings. Under existing guidance in ASC 740, Income Taxes, adjustments to deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from a change in tax laws or rates occur within the period that the enactment of these changes occur and any adjustments are included in income from continuing operations. Deferred income taxes originally recognized through other comprehensive income were initially measured at the previous income tax rate resulting in a disproportionate tax balance remaining in AOCI from recognizing the tax rate adjustments from the Tax Act in income from continuing operations (i.e., \u201cstranded tax effects\u201d). The amendments in the ASU have been applied under adoption of this standard for the 2019 tax year, and the effects of the change resulted in an immaterial adjustment to accumulated deficit.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments,\u201d (\u201cASU 2016-13\u201d) which requires measurement and recognition of expected versus incurred credit losses for financial assets held. ASU 2016-13 is effective for the Company\u2019s annual and interim reporting periods beginning January 1, 2023, with early adoption permitted on January 1, 2019. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this ASU on its consolidated financial statements.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment, which simplifies the accounting for goodwill impairments by eliminating Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to that excess, versus determining an implied fair value in Step 2 to measure the impairment loss. ASU 2017-04 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019. The Company does not expect the provisions of ASU 2017-04 to have a material impact on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-15, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer\u2019s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement that is a Service Contract (\u201cASU 2018-15\u201d), which aligns the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software (and hosting arrangements that include an internal use software license). ASU 2018-15 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019 and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption of the amendments is permitted including adoption in any interim period. The guidance can be applied either prospectively to all implementation costs incurred after the date of adoption or retrospectively. The Company adopted this standard on January 1, 2020 on a prospective basis. The adoption of ASU 2018-15 did not have a material impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and financial statement disclosures.\nPareteum Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Amounts in thousands except share and per share data and unless otherwise indicated)\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820)-Disclosure Framework-Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement, to modify the disclosure requirements for fair value measurements. The standard adds, modifies, and removes previous disclosure requirements. Eliminated disclosures include items such as removing disclosures for the valuation process for Level 3 measurements, policy for timing of transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy and changes in unrealized gains and losses included in earnings for recurring Level 3 measurements held at the reporting period. The guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted. The Company does not anticipate the adoption of ASU 2018-13 to have a material impact on the disclosures accompanying its consolidated financial statement statements.\nIn November 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-08, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718) and Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Codification Improvements - Share-Based Consideration Payable to a Customer. Under this new guidance, share-based payment awards issued to a customer should be recorded as a reduction of the transaction price in revenue with an amount measured under the grant-date fair value of the award. Changes in the measurement of the share-based payments after the grant date that are due to the form of the consideration are not included in the transaction price and are recorded elsewhere in the income statement. The award is measured and classified under ASC 718 for its entire term, unless the award is modified after it vests and the grantee is no longer a customer. The new guidance is effective in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adoption of ASU 2019-08 on its financial statements.\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes (\u201cASU 2019-12\u201d), which is intended to simplify various aspects related to accounting for income taxes. ASU 2019-12 removes certain exceptions to the general principles in Topic 740 and also clarifies and amends existing guidance to improve consistent application. ASU 2019-12 is effective for the Company beginning in fiscal 2021. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adoption of ASU 2019-12 on its consolidated financial statements, financial condition or results of operations.\nIn August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Debt-Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging-Contracts in Entity\u2019s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity\u2019s Own Equity (\u201cASU 2020-06\u201d), which simplifies the accounting for convertible instruments by removing the separation models for (1) convertible debt with a cash conversion feature and (2) convertible instruments with a beneficial conversion feature. Upon adoption, a convertible debt instrument will be accounted for as a single liability at amortized cost unless (1) a convertible instrument contains features that require bifurcation as a derivative under ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, or (2) a convertible debt instrument was issued at a substantial premium. These changes will reduce reported interest expense and increase reported net income for entities that have issued a convertible instrument that was bifurcated according to previously existing rules. ASU 2020-06 also requires the application of the if-converted method for calculating diluted earnings per share and the treasury stock method will be no longer available. The new guidance is effective for public entities excluding smaller reporting companies in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, with early adoption permitted no earlier than fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020. For public business entities that meet the definition of a smaller reporting company, the amendments in ASU 2020-06 are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2023. ASU 2020-06 is effective for us in our first quarter of fiscal 2024. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adoption of ASU 2020-06 on its consolidated financial statements, financial condition or results of operations.\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848), Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting. This ASU provides optional guidance for a limited period of time to ease the burden in accounting for (or recognizing the effects of) reference rate reform on financial reporting. This would apply to companies meeting certain criteria that have contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions that reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued because of reference rate reform. This standard is effective as of March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022 and may be applied to contract modifications made and hedging relationships entered into from the beginning of an interim period that includes or is subsequent to March 12, 2020. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adoption of ASU 2020-04 on its consolidated financial statements, financial condition or results of operations.\nPareteum Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Amounts in thousands except share and per share data and unless otherwise indicated)\nReclassifications\nCertain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.\nNote 2. Acquisitions\nDevicescape Asset Purchase\nOn April 22, 2019, the Company, together with Devicescape Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (the \u201cHoldco\u201d and together with the Company, the \u201cBuyer\u201d) entered into an asset purchase agreement (the \u201cPurchase Agreement\u201d) with Devicescape Software, Inc., a California corporation (\u201cDevicescape\u201d), whereby the Buyer acquired certain assets of Devicescape and assumed certain liabilities of Devicescape, such that Holdco shall continue as a surviving subsidiary of the Company holding the acquired assets and assuming those certain liabilities of Devicescape (the \u201cDevicescape Purchase\u201d). In connection with the Devicescape Purchase, and pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Purchase Agreement, the Company paid cash consideration of $2,000 and issued to the stockholders of Devicescape an aggregate of 400,000 shares of the Company\u2019s common stock at a value of $1,692 based on our closing price on April 22, 2019, of $4.23 per share.\nThe Devicescape Purchase has been treated as an asset purchase under U.S. GAAP. Under an asset purchase, assets are recognized based on their cost to the acquiring entity, which generally includes the transaction costs of the asset acquired and is allocated to the individual assets acquired or liabilities assumed based on their relative fair values and does not give rise to goodwill.\nThe allocation of the purchase price was as follows:\nPurchase consideration:\nCash consideration and transaction costs $ 2,137\nShares issued to stockholders 1,692\nTotal purchase consideration $ 3,829\nPurchase price allocation:\nAssets:\nAccounts receivable $ 71\nEscrow receivable\nIntangible assets 3,646\nTotal assets 3,917\nLiabilities:\nAccounts payable & other liabilities\nTotal liabilities\nEstimated fair value of net assets acquired $ 3,829\nThe allocation of the purchase price for Devicescape\u2019s intangible assets were as follows:\nEstimated Useful\nFair Life\nValue (Years)\nDeveloped technology $ 3,525\nCustomer relationships\nIntangible assets $ 3,646\nThe value of the developed technology intangible asset was calculated using the relief-from-royalty method, an income approach. The relief-from-royalty method measures the fair value of an asset by identifying the avoided royalty costs of licensing an asset of similar utility from a third party. The value of the customer relationships intangible asset was calculated using the excess earnings method of the income approach. The excess earnings method calculates the present value of the residual after-tax cash flows, or excess earnings, attributable to the subject intangible asset after certain deductions are applied for the use of the other assets that contribute to the generation of the cash flows. The value of the tradename intangible asset was calculated using the relief-from-royalty method.\nPareteum Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Amounts in thousands except share and per share data and unless otherwise indicated)\niPass, Inc.

The Company accounted for the Exchange Agreement as a cost method equity investment in the amount of $3,230.\nOn June 7, 2018, the Artilium Board and the Pareteum Board announced that they had reached agreement regarding the terms of a recommended share and cash offer by Pareteum to acquire the issued and to-be-issued ordinary share capital of Artilium not already owned by Pareteum. Under the terms of the acquisition, each Artilium shareholder was entitled to receive 0.1016 Pareteum shares and $2.55 (or 1.9 pence) in cash per Artilium share upon completion of the transaction. The acquisition valued each Artilium share at $26.22 (or 19.55 pence) and the entire issued and to be issued ordinary share capital of Artilium at approximately $104.7 million (or \u00a378.0 million), based on Pareteum\u2019s closing share price of $2.33 on June 6, 2018 and the exchange rate of US$1.3413: \u00a31.\nOn September 13, 2018, stockholders of Pareteum approved the proposed acquisition of the entire issued and to be issued ordinary shares of Artilium.\nOn October 1, 2018, The Pareteum completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding shares of Artilium.

Goodwill and Net Intangibles, Net\nDuring the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2019, the Company performed its annual impairment test for goodwill and intangible assets. As a result of the deteriorating business conditions, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $160,989 during the year ended December 31, 2019 related to goodwill and intangible assets associated with the Company\u2019s acquisitions of iPass and Artilium.\nThe Company operates in a single reportable segment. The impairment test indicated that the net book value of goodwill associated with the Company\u2019s acquisitions of iPass and Artilium exceeded their implied fair value. The Company estimated the fair value of its reportable segment utilizing a discounted cash flow model. The intangible assets acquired in the iPass and Artilium acquisitions also indicated an impairment as the carrying values exceeded the fair value determined in the impairment test. The impairment charge for goodwill and finite-lived intangible assets represented the amount by which the carrying values exceed their estimated fair values.\nChanges in goodwill were as follows (As restated):\nGoodwill\nBalance at December 31, 2017\n$ -\nBusiness acquisition\n101,375\nBalance at December 31, 2018\n$ 101,375\nBusiness acquisition\n37,821\nImpairment\n(129,097 )\nBalance at December 31, 2019\n$ 10,099\nThe Company utilized the income approach to determine the enterprise value of the Company in its goodwill impairment test. The fair value was based on forecasted future cash flows discounted back to the present value; significant judgments related to the risk adjusted discount rates, terminal growth rates and weighted-average cost of capital (\u201cWACC\u201d).\nNet intangibles consisted of the following amortizing intangibles:\nAs of December 31, 2019\nAs of December 31, 2018\nGross\nGross\nCarrying\nAccumulated\nCarrying\nAccumulated\nAmount\nAmortization\nImpairment\nTotal\nAmount\nAmortization\nImpairment\nTotal\nTechnology\n$ 25,971\n$ (4,102 )\n$ (15,369 )\n$ 6,500\n$ 20,720\n$ (859 )\n$ -\n$ 19,861\nCustomer relationships\n25,066\n(2,192 )\n(14,803 )\n8,071\n16,800\n(233 )\n-\n16,567\nTrade names\n3,374\n(725 )\n(1,720 )\n3,400\n(170 )\n-\n3,230\nNet intangibles\n$ 54,411\n$ (7,019 )\n$ (31,892 )\n$ 15,500\n$ 40,920\n$ (1,262 )\n$ -\n$ 39,658\nPareteum Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Amounts in thousands except share and per share data and unless otherwise indicated)\nImpairment charges related to finite lived intangible assets during the year ended December 31, 2019 were $31,892. There were no impairment charges for the year ended December 31, 2018. The 2019 impairment charge by type of intangible asset was as follows:\nImpairment\ncharge Original useful\nlife (years)\nTechnology $ 15.369 6-8\nCustomer relationships 14,803 11-18\nTrade names 1,720 3-5\nTotal impairment charge $ 31,892\nThe Company utilized various methods to determine the fair value of the intangible assets for use in the impairment test. The fair value of the trademarks intangible assets was calculated using the income approach relief-from-royalty method. The relief-from-royalty method measures the fair value of an asset by identifying the avoided royalty costs of licensing an asset of similar utility from a third party. The fair value of the technology intangible assets was calculated utilizing the relief-from-royalty method for the iPass intangible asset and the excess earnings method of the income approach for Artilium\u2019s intangible asset. The excess earnings method calculates the present value of the residual after-tax cash flows, or excess earnings, attributable to the subject intangible asset after certain deductions are applied for the use of the other assets that contribute to the generation of the cash flows. Customer relationships were valued based on the distributor method, an income-based approach, and the cost approach for Artilium and iPass, respectively. The distributor method uses a discounted cash flow model to calculate the present value of a distributor\u2019s expected profit margins to reflect the value of the distributor\u2019s ability to provide products to its customers. The cost approach measures the benefits related to an asset by the cost to reconstruct it or replace it with another asset of similar utility.\nAt December 31, 2019, the Company\u2019s estimated useful lives of its intangible assets by category was 8 years, 5 to 6 years and 2 to 6 years for technology, customer relationships and trade names, respectively. The change in the estimated useful lives from the estimates at the acquisition dates was due to diminished expectations of the future periods that would benefit from our original estimates. At December 31, 2019, the weighted-average amortization period for intangible assets was 6.2 years. At December 31, 2019, the weighted-average amortization periods for technology, customer relationships, and trade names was 7.7 years, 5.1 years and 5.6 years, respectively.\nAmortization expense related to intangible assets for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 was $7,019 and $1,262, respectively.\nThe estimated annual amortization expense related to finite-lived intangible assets as of December 31, 2019, is as follows:\nYear Ended December 31,\nAmortization\n$ 2,606\n2,606\n2,556\n2,556\n2,556\nand thereafter\n2,620\n$ 15,500\nNote 9. Net Billings in Excess of Revenues\nBecause the Company recognizes revenue upon performance of services, net billings in excess of revenues represents amounts received from customers for which either delivery has not occurred or against future sales of services. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the balance of net billings in excess of revenues was $2,529 and $227, respectively.\nNote 10. Accrued Expenses and Other Payables\nAs of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, accrued expenses and other payables were comprised of the following:\nDecember 31,\nDecember 31,\nAccrued expenses and other payables\nAccrued selling, general and administrative expenses\n$ 2.720\n$ 1,189\nAccrued salaries and bonuses\n2,005\n1,596\nAccrued employee benefits\n-\nAccrued restructuring & acquisition related costs\n-\n1,885\nAccrued cost of service\nAccrued taxes (including VAT)\n2,637\n1,834\nAccrued interest payable\nAccrued customer credit\n3,393\n-\nOther accrued expenses\n1,617\nAccrued expenses and other payables\n$ 13,616\n$ 7,741\nPareteum Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Amounts in thousands except share and per share data and unless otherwise indicated)\nAccrued taxes include income taxes payable as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, amounting to $316 and $81 respectively. See Note 18 to the Financial Statements for more information.\nAccrued selling, general and administrative expenses include social security premiums, personnel related costs such as payroll taxes, provision for holiday allowance, accruals for marketing and sales expenses, and office related expenses.\nNote 11. Promissory Notes and Unsecured Convertible Promissory Notes\nPromissory Notes\nThe Promissory Notes of $993 at December 31, 2019 are comprised of six bank notes secured through by Artilium with varying original maturity dates ranging between 6 and 24 months with an average interest rate of 2%. The notes are not convertible and are not included in any of the tables in the remainder of this note. The promissory notes were $681 at December 31, 2018.\n9% Unsecured Convertible Promissory Note\nOn December 18, 2015, the Company consummated a closing and on March 14, 2016, the Company consummated the last of twelve closings of its private placement offering of units (\u201cUnits\u201d) to \u201caccredited investors\u201d (as defined in Rule 501(a) of the Securities Act as part of a \u201cbest efforts\u201d private placement offering of up to $4,200 consisting of up to 140 Units, each Unit consisting of: (i) one 9% unsecured subordinated Note in the principal amount of $30, which is convertible into the Note Shares of common stock of the Company at the option of the holder at a conversion price of $7.50 per share, subject to certain exceptions; and (ii) a five-year Warrant to purchase one hundred thousand (4,000) shares of common stock (the \u201cWarrant Shares\u201d) at an exercise price of $11.25 per share, subject to certain exceptions. During 2016 and 2015, the Company sold an aggregate of $3,548 principal amount of Notes and delivered Warrants to purchase an aggregate of 473,067 shares of common stock. In December 2016, the Company and the holders agreed upon modification of the Warrants to remove certain anti-dilution protections in the note and offered an exercise price adjustment to $3.75 and 10% bonus warrants (47,306 warrants) in return.\nIn connection with the offering, the Company retained a registered FINRA broker dealer (the \u201cPlacement Agent\u201d) to act as the placement agent. For acting as the placement agent, 33,115 warrants were issued with an exercise price of $11.25 and 33,115 warrants were issued with an exercise price of $7.50 along with a cash fee.\nThe value of the Warrants and the conversion feature to the investors and the Placement Agent cash fees and warrants were capitalized and off set against the liability for the Notes at the time of issuance and were amortized over the term of the Notes using the effective interest method.\nDuring 2019, the conversion feature was exercised at a price of $1.75 per share and 60,000 shares were issued for the outstanding principal amount, 6,000 shares issued for the 10% early repayment and 18,220 shares issued for accrued interest on the promissory notes (see table below).\nBreakdown of the 9% Unsecured Subordinated Convertible\nPromissory Note (Matured December 2018 through June 2019)\nDecember 31,\nRegular\nAmortizations\n(during\n2019)\nConversions\n(during 2019)\nincluding\naccelerated\namortization\nOutstanding\nDecember 31,\nConvertible Note Principal Amount\nPrincipal Amount\n$ -\n$ -\n$\n$ (105 )\n10% Early Repayment\n-\n-\n(11 )\nDebt Discounts & Financing Costs\nInvestor Warrants\n-\n(2 )\n-\nConversion Feature value\n-\n(1 )\n-\n7% Agent Warrants\n-\n(1 )\n-\nFinancing Costs\n-\n(5 )\n-\n$ -\n$ (9 )\n$\n$ (107 )\nPareteum Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Amounts in thousands except share and per share data and unless otherwise indicated)\nAt December 31, 2019 there were 38,111,211 warrants outstanding from the accredited investors 4,818,269 warrants were exercised in 2019 and 1,488,973 outstanding from the Placement Agent.\nBreakdown of the conversion rights for outstanding convertible notes:\nNumber of underlying shares for Conversion of\noutstanding unsecured convertible notes\nOutstanding\nDecember 31,\nAgreement\nAmendments\n/ Interest\neffects\nExercises /\nConversions\n/ Expirations\nOutstanding\nDecember 31,\n9% Convertible Note - Investors\n-\n44,720\n(84,220 )\n39,500\nOutstanding Conversion Features\n-\n44,720\n(84,220)\n39,500\nIn the above table the exercise price at December 31, 2018 for the conversion of the promissory notes, including accrued interest, into common shares was at $3.75 (39 shares) and converted in 2019 at an exercise price of $1.75 (84 shares) resulting in a difference of 45 shares.\nNote 12. Long-term Debt\nFormer Post Road Group Debt Facility\nOn February 26, 2019, Pareteum Corporation and certain of its subsidiaries entered into a credit agreement (the \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d) with Post Road Administrative Finance, LLC and its affiliate Post Road Special Opportunity Fund I LLP (collectively, \u201cPost Road\u201d). Pursuant to the Credit Agreement, Post Road provided the Company with a secured loan of up to $50,000 (the \u201cLoan\u201d), with an initial loan of $25,000 funded on February 26, 2019, and additional amounts in $5,000 increments as requested by the Company before the 18-month anniversary of the initial funding date. No additional loan was to be funded until the later of delivery of certain third-party consents (the \u201cConsents\u201d), the filing of Pareteum\u2019s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the first quarter of 2019, or June 1, 2019. All amounts owed under the Credit Agreement were due on February 26, 2022.\nBorrowings under the Credit Agreement bore interest at a rate per year of Libor plus 8.5% provided, however, that upon an event of default or if certain of the Consents were not delivered prior to May 1, 2019 or June 1, 2019, as applicable, borrowings under the credit agreement were to bear interest at a rate per year of Libor plus 11.5% until the Consents were delivered. The interest was due and payable monthly in cash in arrears, provided, however, that the Company could elect to pay any or all of the interest in the form of Payment-in-Kind (\u201cPIK\u201d) interest due and payable at maturity at a maximum percentage per year equal to (a) through and including the first anniversary of the initial funding date, 3%, (b) after the first anniversary of the initial funding date through and including the second anniversary of the initial funding date, 2%, and (c) after the second anniversary of the initial funding date, 1%.\nThe Loan was subject to prepayment upon the receipt of proceeds outside the ordinary course of business in excess of $1,000 and payment of a commitment fee of 1% per year on the unused portion of the Credit Agreement.\nPermitted use of proceeds for the initial $25,000 of the Loan included approximately $11,000 for payment in full of the outstanding secured debt owed to Fortress incurred in connection with the Company\u2019s previously disclosed acquisition of iPass on February 12, 2019, as well as the remaining amounts for permitted acquisitions and investments and for general working capital purposes. The initial $25,000 loan was reduced by an original issue discount of (i) 0.75% of $25,000 and (ii) 1.25% of $50,000 and any additional amounts borrowed were reduced by an original issue discount of 0.75% of the funded amounts. The aggregate original issue discount was $813 and was amortized and reflected as interest expense initially over the term of the Credit agreement using the effective interest method. The Company paid $867 of debt issuance costs which were recorded as a reduction of the loan balance and was amortized and reflected as amortization expense initially over the term of the Credit Agreement using the effective interest method. The debt discount and issuance costs resulted in a higher effective interest rate on the Credit Agreement.\nOn February 26, 2019, concurrent with entering into the Credit Agreement, the existing loan and security agreement by and among iPass, iPass IP LLC and Fortress (the \u201cExisting iPass Loan\u201d) was paid in full. Additionally, pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement, the Company issued to Post Road 425,000 shares of its common stock valued at $1,607, based on the Company\u2019s closing stock price of $3.78 on February 26, 2019. The $1,607 was recorded as a debt issuance cost reducing the loan balance and was amortized in the same manner as the original issue discount discussed above.\nPareteum Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Amounts in thousands except share and per share data and unless otherwise indicated)\nOn August 22, 2019, the Company and Post Road entered into an agreement (the \u201cAmendment\u201d) to amend and waive certain provisions of the Credit Agreement. Pursuant to the Amendment, Post Road agreed to waive terms of certain obligations and covenants in the Credit Agreement and fund the Company an additional loan of $2,500. The Company agreed to issue to Post Road 750,000 shares of its common stock valued at $2,167, based on the Company\u2019s closing stock price of $2.89 on August 22, 2019. The $2,167 was recorded as a debt issuance cost reducing the loan balance. The Company also incurred additional debt issuance costs of $140, which was recorded as a reduction of the loan balance.\nIn September 2019, the Company paid off the Credit Agreement from the proceeds received from the Securities Purchase Agreement (as defined in Note 15, Stockholder\u2019s Equity). As a result, the Company recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of $ 7,873 for the difference between the net carrying value of the loan, which includes the unamortized debt discount and issuance costs of $4,926 and the reacquisition price of the loan, which includes the exit fee paid to the lender of $2,947.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, costs of $494 and $174 were amortized and reflected on the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Loss as \u201cInterest expense related to debt discount and conversion feature\u201d and \u201cAmortization of deferred financing costs\u201d, respectively, as well as $1,659 of interest expense incurred on the loan, excluding loan fees. The weighted-average interest rate was 11.08%.\nRedeemable Preferred Stock\nOn December 24, 2019, the Company issued 105.33 shares of 8% Series C Redeemable Preferred Stock (the \u201cSeries C Redeemable Preferred Stock\u201d) with a stated value of $100.00 per share in a private placement transaction exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, for an aggregate purchase price of $5,033. The Company received net proceeds of $4,479 after deducting legal fees of $361 and $193 of proceeds was remitted to an escrow account, recorded as \u201cPrepaid and other current assets\u201d on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2019, and subsequently remitted to the Company in January 2020. The Series C Redeemable Preferred Stock requires mandatory redemption on December 24, 2020, together with the 8% dividend and a 12.5% premium.\nThe Series C Redeemable Preferred Stock was accounted for as a liability in accordance with ASC 480, \u201cDistinguishing Liabilities from Equity\u201d. Accordingly, the Company recorded a liability of $10,533 equal to the stated value of the issued shares and a debt discount of $5,500 representing the difference between the stated value and the gross proceeds of $5,033. The debt discount is being amortized through the redemption date of December 24, 2020 using the effective interest rate method. The Company incurred placement and legal fees totaling $361 which were also recorded as a debt discount and are being amortized over the same period on a straight-line basis. Additionally, the 8% dividend is being accrued over the same period and the 12.5% redemption premium is being accreted through the redemption date and recorded to \u201cInterest expense related to debt discount and conversion feature\u201d on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss.\nAs of December 31, 2019, the components of the Series C Redeemable Preferred Stock liability consisted of the following:\nDecember 31,\nSeries C Redeemable Preferred Stock, stated value\n$ 10,533\nUnamortized debt discount\n(5,776 )\nAccretion of redemption premium\nAccrued dividend\nSeries C Redeemable Preferred Stock, net\n$ 4,798\nThe following table details the amounts in the Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Loss in connection with Series C Redeemable Preferred Stock liability as of December 31, 2019:\nDecember 31,\nLocation\nAmortization of debt discount\n$\nInterest expense-debt discount / Amortization of deferred financing costs\nAccretion of redemption premium\nInterest expense-debt discount\nAccrued dividend\nInterest expense\nTotal interest and amortization expense\n$\nPareteum Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Amounts in thousands except share and per share data and unless otherwise indicated)\nBy their terms, those shares of Series C Redeemable Preferred Stock are not convertible into other securities of the Company. However, on various dates from July 17, 2020 through October 1, 2020, the Company entered into Exchange Agreements with the holders of those 105.33 shares of Series C Redeemable Preferred Stockholders (collectively, the \u201cSeries C Exchange Agreements\u201d) containing certain exchange provisions as described below.\nUnder the Series C Exchange Agreements, the Company and the holders of the outstanding shares of the Series C Redeemable Preferred Stock agreed that (i) the Company may exchange outstanding shares of Series C Redeemable Preferred Stock for shares of the Company\u2019s common stock on the one-year anniversary of the issuance date of those shares; and (ii) the holders may exchange outstanding shares of Series C Redeemable Preferred Stock for shares of the Company\u2019s common stock at any time prior to the one-year anniversary of the issuance date of those shares. Such exchanges are subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including approval of the Company\u2019s stockholders of the issuance of such common stock and the Company\u2019s ability to issue shares of common stock not subject to restrictions on resale. The number of shares of common stock issuable upon exchange of the Series C Redeemable Preferred Stock under the Series C Exchange Agreements will determined by the application of a formula in which (i) the stated value of the shares of Series C Redeemable Preferred Stock being converted plus the value of any accrued and unpaid dividends plus, with respect to certain agreed upon shares of the Series C Redeemable Preferred Stock, a premium of 12.5% on the stated value is divided by (ii) the conversion price. The conversion price for holders of 97 shares of Series C Redeemable Preferred Stock in the aggregate is $0.70, while the conversion price for the holder of the other 8 shares of Series C Redeemable Preferred Stock is the lower of (i) $0.60 and (ii) the greater of (x) the average daily volume-weighted average price per share of Common Stock during the five trading days before the closing of the exchange and (y) $0.40.\nThe holders of the 97 shares of Series C Redeemable Preferred Stock were permitted to exchange their shares by December 31, 2020, after which time an additional condition to such exchange was imposed that requires the average daily volume-weighted average trading price of the Company\u2019s common stock to be at least $0.60 per share, for the five consecutive trading days, before an exchange. The same additional condition was also imposed on of holders of the other 8 shares of Series C Redeemable Preferred Stock, if such holders held their shares after December 24, 2020.\nNote 13. Related Party Transactions\nAs of December 31, 2019 and 2018, Pareteum BV has an outstanding loan payable to Comsystems (a company owned by Gerard Dorenbos). Prior to the acquisition by Pareteum, Gerard Dorenbos was a shareholder of Artilium PLC, with approximately 15% of the total shares of Artilium PLC, and a board member of Artilium PLC.\nThe loan has a maturity date of December 31, 2021. The total amount outstanding as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 was $420 and $342, respectively, which carries an 8% interest rate and is reflected as a related party loan in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. No repayments were made on the loan during the year ended December 31, 2019. All principal and interest are due on the maturity date.\nDuring 2019 and 2018, the Company retained Robert Turner of InTown Legal Services, who is the son of Robert H. Turner, the former Executive Chairman of the Board. InTown Legal Services has a five thousand dollars per month minimum retainer with the Company and was paid $278 in 2019 and $133 in 2018. The agreement between the Company and InTown Legal Services is an at will agreement.\nNote 14. Lease Commitments\nThe Company leases property under operating leases with varying expiration dates between 2020 and 2025. The Company also leases equipment and automobiles under operating leases with expiration dates between 2021 and 2024. The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. The Company presents the operating leases in long-term assets and current and long-term liabilities. Finance lease assets are included in property and equipment, net, and finance lease liabilities are presented in current and long-term liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2019.\nAs of December 31, 2019, the Company had 10 leased properties with remaining lease terms that ranged from of 1.0 year to 5.5 years. Two leases expired on December 31, 2019. The Company is also party to three equipment leases and 41 automobile leases. Many of our leases include options to extend the term with several allowed to renew indefinitely.\nPareteum Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Amounts in thousands except share and per share data and unless otherwise indicated)\nThe components of the lease expense recorded in the consolidated statement of operations were as follows:\nYear ended\nDecember 31, 2019\nOperating lease cost\n$ 2,313\nFinance lease cost:\nAmortization of assets\nInterest on lease liabilities\nTotal net lease cost\n$ 2,324\nSupplemental balance sheet information related to leases was as follows:\nLeases Classification As of\nDecember 31, 2019\nAssets:\nOperating lease assets Operating right-of-use asset, net of accumulated amortization(1) $ 2,241\nFinance lease assets Property and equipment, net of accumulated depreciation(2)\nTotal leased assets\n$ 2,374\nLiabilities:\nCurrent\nOperating Operating lease liability, current $ 2,376\nFinance Financing lease liability, current\nNoncurrent\nOperating Operating lease liability, noncurrent\nFinance Finance lease liability, noncurrent\nTotal lease liabilities\n$ 2,837\n(1) Operating lease assets are recorded net of accumulated amortization of $2,006 as of December 31, 2019.\n(2) Finance lease assets are recorded net of accumulated depreciation of $9 as of December 31, 2019.\nSupplemental cash flow and other information related to leases was as follows:\nYear ended\nDecember 31, 2019\nCash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities:\nOperating cash outflows from operating leases\n$ 1,656\nOperating cash outflows from finance leases (interest)\n$\nFinancing cash outflows from finance leases\n$\nWeighted-average remaining lease term (in years):\nOperating leases\n1.64\nFinance leases\n2.67\nWeighted-average discount rate:\nOperating leases\n9.22 %\nFinance leases\n5.00 %\nPareteum Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Amounts in thousands except share and per share data and unless otherwise indicated)\nMaturities of lease liabilities were as follows:\nAs of December 31, 2019\nOperating\nLeases Finance\nLeases\n$ 2,524 $ 51\n-\n-\nThereafter -\nTotal lease payments 2,886\nLess: imputed interest (177 ) (8 )\nTotal lease liabilities 2,709\nLess: current liabilities (2,376 ) (46 )\nLong-term lease liabilities $ 333 $ 82\nAs of \u202fDecember 31, 2019, the Company had additional operating lease obligations totaling $551 that had not yet commenced, all of which commenced in 2020 and had lease terms ranging from of 3 to 4 years.\nNote 15. Stockholders\u2019 Equity\nSecurities Purchase Agreement\nIn September 2019, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement (the \u201cSecurities Purchase Agreement\u201d) with institutional and accredited investors and sold:\n(i) 18,852,272 common stock units at a price of $1.76. Each common stock unit consisted of one share of common stock, one Series A warrant and one Series B warrant to purchase shares of common stock. The number of Series A warrants and Series B warrants that were issued totaled 18,852,272 and 9,426,136, respectively.\n(ii) 3,875,000 pre-funded warrants for the purchase of common stock units at price of $1.75 per share. Upon the exercise of the pre-funded warrants at an exercise price of $0.01, the investor is entitled to receive one unit which consists of one share of common stock (or 3,875,000 shares in the aggregate), 3,875,000 Series A warrants to purchase shares of common stock and 1,937,500 Series B warrants to purchase shares of common stock.\nThe Company received net proceeds of $37,680 after deducting expenses of $2,281. In connection with the Securities Purchase Agreement, the Company issued warrants to a placement agent to purchase 909,091 shares of its common stock. These warrants have exercise price of $3.00 per share and expire in September 2024. All the warrants in this transaction are classified as equity and the Series A and B warrants are participating securities for purposes of calculating basic loss per share.\nThe Series A warrant provides for an exercise price of $2.25 per share, exercisable beginning September 2020 and expire in September 2024. The Series B warrant provides for an exercise price of $1.84, exercisable beginning September 2019 and expire in March 2021. The pre-funded warrants do not expire and are immediately exercisable except that the pre-funded warrants cannot be exercised by the holder if, after giving effect thereto, the holder would beneficially own more than 9.99% of the Company\u2019s common stock, subject to certain exceptions. The pre-funded warrants are classified as equity in accordance with ASC 480, \u201cDistinguishing Liabilities from Equity\u201d and the fair value of the pre-funded warrants was recorded in the Company\u2019s Statement of Changes in Stockholders Equity (Deficit) as \u201cPre-funded warrants.\u201d In October 2019, all of the pre-funded warrants were exercised in a cashless transaction resulting in the issuance of 3,845,193 shares of common stock, net of shares surrendered for payment of the exercise price.\nOn May 9, 2018, we entered into a securities purchase agreement (the \u201c2018 Offering\u201d) with select accredited investors relating to a registered direct offering, issuance and sale of an aggregate of 2,440,000 shares of our common stock at a purchase price of $2.50 per share for gross proceeds of $6,100 and offering expenses of $701. The shares were issued pursuant to a Registration Statement on Form S-3 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on September 9, 2016, as amended October 21, 2016 and November 10, 2016 and declared effective November 14, 2016. The Company also agreed to pay a placement agent a commission to reimburse the placement agent\u2019s out-of-pocket expenses, to issue the placement agent, in a private transaction, a warrant to purchase 122,000 shares of common stock at an exercise price equal to 125% of the offering price per share, and to indemnify the placement agent against certain liabilities.\nPareteum Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Amounts in thousands except share and per share data and unless otherwise indicated)\nCommon Stock\nThe Company is authorized to issue 500,000,000 shares of common stock. The Company had 139,060,180 shares of common stock issued and outstanding as of December 31, 2019, an increase of 40,767,650 shares from December 31, 2018, mainly due to shares issued in the acquisitions of iPass and Devicescape (10,265,412), shares issued in the Securities Purchase Agreement (18,852,272) and from the exercise of the pre-funded warrants issued in the Securities Purchase Agreement (3,845,193). As of December 31, 2019, approximately 1,733,698 stock awards vested under the Company\u2019s non-cash compensation plans and the shares are reflected on the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Stockholders\u2019 Equity/Deficit as outstanding at December 31, 2019, for which the issuance of the shares from the Company\u2019s stock transfer agent are pending.\nPreferred Stock\nThe Company\u2019s Certificate of Incorporation authorizes the issuance of 50,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock, $0.00001 par value per share. Under the Company\u2019s Certificate of Incorporation, the Board of Directors has the power, without further action by the holders of the common stock, subject to the rules of the Exchange, to designate the relative rights and preferences of the preferred stock, and issue preferred stock in such one or more series as designated by the Board of Directors. The designation of rights and preferences could include preferences as to liquidation, redemption and conversion rights, voting rights, dividends or other preferences, any of which may be dilutive of the interest of the holders of the common stock or the preferred stock of any other series. The issuance of preferred stock may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of the Company without further stockholder action and may adversely affect the rights and powers, including voting rights, of the holders of common stock. In certain circumstances, the issuance of preferred stock could depress the market price of the common stock.\nOn December 10, 2019, the Company\u2019s Board of Directors designated 255 shares of Preferred Stock to be Series C Redeemable Preferred Stock with a stated value of $100,000 per share (the \u201cStated Value\u201d). Non-cumulative dividends are required to be paid on each share of the Series C Redeemable Preferred Stock at a rate of 8% per annum of the Stated Value. The Series C Redeemable Preferred Stock ranks senior to our common stock with respect to dividend rights and rights upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company. Upon any liquidation event, the holders of the Series C Redeemable Preferred Stock are entitled to be paid out of the assets of the Company legally available for distribution to its stockholders a liquidation preference of $0.00001 per share, plus an amount equal to any unpaid dividends to and including the date of payment, but without interest, before any distribution of assets is made to holders of the Company\u2019s common stock, or any other class or series of stock. The Series C Redeemable Preferred Stock has no voting rights except as required by law. Under the terms of the certificate of designations for the Series C Redeemable Preferred Stock, on the one-year anniversary of the date of issuance of the Series C Redeemable Preferred Stock, the Company is required to redeem, out of legally available funds, each such share of Series C Redeemable Preferred Stock at a price per share equal to 112.5% of the Stated Value. However, as previously disclosed in Note 12, Long-term Debt to the Financial Statements, the Company entered into the Series C Exchange Agreements with each holder of Series C Redeemable Preferred Stock, under which the shares will remain outstanding.\nThere were 105.33 shares of Series C Redeemable Preferred Stock outstanding as of December 31, 2019, see Note 12, Long-term Debt for further information, and no preferred shares outstanding as of December 31, 2018.\nWarrants\nThroughout the years, the Company has issued warrants with varying terms and conditions related to multiple financing rounds, acquisitions and other transactions. Often these warrants could be classified as equity instead of a derivative. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, no warrants have been classified as derivative warrants.\nPareteum Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Amounts in thousands except share and per share data and unless otherwise indicated)\nThe table below summarizes the warrants outstanding (in share amounts) as of December 31, 2019 and as of December 31, 2018:\nWarrants: Number of Warrants\nOutstanding as of January 1, 2018 18,135,832\nIssued 196,750\nExercised (14,463,097 )\nExpirations (80,003 )\nOutstanding as of December 31, 2018 3,789,482\nIssued 39,199,998\nExercised (4,818,269 )\nExpirations (60,000 )\nOutstanding as of December 31, 2019 38,111,211\nOutstanding Warrants\nExercise/\nConversion\nprice(s)\n(range)\nExpiring\nDecember 31,\nDecember 31,\nEquity Warrants - Fundraising\n$1.05 - $5.375\n2019 - 2024\n38,111,211\n3,789,482\nThe discussion below describes the warrant activity (in thousands of shares) during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nWarrants - Issued\nIn connection with the September 2019 Securities Purchase Agreement, 38,874,998 warrants were issued, of which, 3,875,000 were pre-funded and 909,091 warrants were issued to the placement agent.\nIn February 2019, the Company issued warrants to purchase an aggregate of 325,000 shares of common stock pursuant to Fortress consenting to the consummation of the Merger Agreement by and among the Company, iPass and TBR, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.\nWarrants - Exercised\nDuring 2019, 4,818,269 warrants were exercised, out of which 800,235 were cash exercises resulting in proceeds of $1,394 received at an average exercise price of $1.74 and 4,018,034 warrants were exercised cashless resulting in the delivery of 3,903,302 shares.\nWarrants - Expirations\nDuring 2019, 60,000 warrants expired unexercised.\nNote 16. Basic and diluted net loss per share\nNet loss per share is calculated in accordance with ASC 260, Earnings per Share (\u201cASC 260\u201d). Basic net loss per share is based upon the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding. The Series A and B warrants issued in the Securities Purchase Agreement are participating securities due to the warrant holder\u2019s participation in dividends distributed by the Company on a one-for-one basis with common stockholders thus requiring the application of the two-class method in computing basic net income per share. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company was in a loss position and none of the loss was allocated to the participating securities as they do not participate in the losses of the Company.\nDilution is computed by applying the treasury stock method. Under this method, options and warrants are assumed to be exercised at the beginning of the period (or at the time of issuance, if later), and as if funds obtained thereby were used to purchase Common Stock at the average market price during the period. The Company uses the \u2018if converted\u2019 method for its senior secured convertible notes.\nThe diluted share base includes shares related to convertible debt, warrants to purchase Common Stock and employee awards and or stock options as follows:\nDilutive Securities\nConvertible Notes\n-\n39,500\nWarrants\n38,111,211\n3,789,482\nTime Conditioned Share Awards\n2,563,359\n1,480,557\nEmployee Stock Options\n6,924,436\n3,663,812\n47,599,006\n8,973,351\nPareteum Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Amounts in thousands except share and per share data and unless otherwise indicated)\nWeighted-average number of shares used to compute basic and diluted loss per share is the same since the effect of the dilutive securities is anti-dilutive due to the Company\u2019s reported net loss for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nNote 17. Employee Benefit Plan\nThe Company grants stock options and restricted stock awards under the 2017 Long-Term Incentive Compensation Plan (\u201c2017 Plan\u201d) and the 2018 Long-Term Incentive Plan (\u201c2018 Plan\u201d). The Company also maintains the 2008 Long-term Incentive Plan (\u201c2008 Plan\u201d). There have been no new grants of share-based compensation under the 2008 Plan during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. Stock options under each long-term incentive plan are granted with an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the Company\u2019s common stock on the date of grant, and generally vest from one to three years from the date of grant. Options are generally granted with a five-year term. The fair value of each stock option granted is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The fair value of restricted stock awards is based on the fair market value at the date of grant and expensed over the vesting period, which generally range from one to three years from the date of the grant.\nLong-Term Incentive Compensation Plan\nThe 2008 Plan allowed for the grant of awards of up to 2,240,000 shares of common stock, after giving effect to a 1-for-25 reverse stock-split in 2008, in the form of incentive and non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, performance units, restricted stock awards and performance bonuses. As of December 31, 2019, no further awards may be granted under the 2008 Plan and 131,268 awards remain outstanding in accordance with their terms. In addition, there are 62,180 previously granted restricted stock awards that have vested for which shares have not been issued as of December 31, 2019.\nThe stock option activity of the 2008 Plan for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 follows:\nNumber of\nOptions\nWeighted\nAverage\nExercise\nPrice\nInitial Fair\nMarket Value\n(Outstanding\nOptions)\nOutstanding as of December 31, 2017\n1,128,384\n$ 9.40\n$ 6,854\nRevoked (cancelled)\n(786,697 )\n6.33\n(3,495 )\nForfeitures\n(175 )\n3.07\n-\nExpirations\n(138,246 )\n25.60\n(1,997 )\nOutstanding as of December 31, 2018\n203,266\n10.74\n1,381\nForfeitures\n(71,998 )\n7.72\n(335 )\nOutstanding as of December 31, 2019\n131,268\n$ 12.40\n$ 1,046\nLong-Term Incentive Compensation Plan\nThe 2017 Plan allows for the grant of awards of up to 6,500,000 shares of common stock in the form of options, restricted stock awards, stock appreciation rights (\u201cSAR\u2019s\u201d), performance units and performance bonuses to eligible employees and the grant of nonqualified stock options, restricted stock awards, SAR\u2019s and performance units to consultants and eligible directors. As of December 31, 2019, there were 57,155 shares available for grant under the 2017 Plan. As of December 31, 2019, there were 2,950,519 stock options outstanding under the 2017 Plan. In addition, there are 53,399 previously granted restricted stock awards that have vested for which shares have not been issued as of December 31, 2019.\nThe remaining 57,155 shares available for grant under the 2017 Plan may be issued to former directors and staff. The Company plans on filing a registration statement on Form S-8 for issuances that have been approved by stockholders, but still require registration.\nPareteum Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Amounts in thousands except share and per share data and unless otherwise indicated)\nThe stock option activity of the 2017 Plan for the years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 follows:\nNumber of Options\nWeighted\nAverage\nExercise\nPrice\nInitial Fair Market\nValue\n(Outstanding\nOptions)\nOutstanding as of December 31, 2017\n1,899,800\n$ 1.00\n$ 1,053\nGranted\n1,999,685\n2.42\n3,378\nExercised\n(59,220 )\n1.00\n(59 )\nForfeitures\n(374,663 )\n1.55\n(766 )\nExpirations\n(5,056 )\n1.00\n(5 )\nOutstanding as of December 31, 2018\n3,460,546\n$ 1.76\n$ 3,601\nExercised\n(177,678 )\n1.19\n(129 )\nForfeitures\n(294,178 )\n2.37\n(442 )\nExpirations\n(38,171 )\n1.09\n(25 )\nOutstanding as of December 31, 2019\n2,950,519\n$ 1.74\n$ 3,005\nThere were no stock options granted under 2017 Plan during 2019.

This incentive plan provides for awards of up to 8,000,000 shares of common stock, in the form of options, restricted stock awards, stock appreciation rights (\u201cSAR\u2019s\u201d), performance units and performance bonuses to eligible employees and the grant of nonqualified stock options, restricted stock awards, SAR\u2019s and performance units to consultants and eligible directors.\nPursuant to the terms of the 2018 Plan, as amended, the number of shares available under the plan shall increase on the first day of each fiscal year in an amount equal to the lesser of (i) 15% of the total number of shares of common stock outstanding as of December 31st of the preceding fiscal year or (ii) such number of shares of common stock determined by the Board of Directors (the \u201cEvergreen Increase\u201d).

The applicable statutory tax rates vary from none (zero) to 34%. However, because the Company and its subsidiaries have incurred annual corporate income tax losses since their inception, management has determined that it is more likely than not that the Company will not realize the benefits of its US and foreign net deferred tax assets. Therefore, in all jurisdictions where the Company has a net deferred tax asset, the Company has recorded a full valuation allowance to reduce the net carrying amount of the deferred tax assets to zero. The Company\u2019s 2019 income tax benefit of $8.4 million relates to $8.7 million of benefit associated with the net losses in certain foreign jurisdictions offset by current taxes of $0.3 million in other foreign jurisdictions with taxable income.\nPareteum Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Amounts in thousands except share and per share data and unless otherwise indicated)\nIncome tax (benefit) expense is summarized as follows:\nFor the years ended\nDecember 31,\nCurrent:\nFederal\n$ -\n$ -\nState\n-\n-\nForeign\nDeferred:\nFederal\n-\n-\nState\n-\n-\nForeign\n(8,611 )\n(255 )\n(8,611 )\n(255 )\nIncome tax (benefit) expense\n$ (8,295 )\n$ (174 )\nThe following is a reconciliation of the provision for income taxes at the U.S. federal statutory rate (21%) to the foreign income tax rate for the years ended:\nFor the years ended\nDecember 31,\nTax expense at statutory rate federal\n%\n%\nForeign income tax rate difference\n%\n-\nTransaction costs\n-\n(7 )%\nCompensation\n-\n(6 )%\nGILTI\n-\n(1 )%\nNon-operating gain on stock acquisition\n-\n%\nGoodwill Impairment\n(11 )%\n-\nChange in valuation allowance\n(7 )%\n(15 )%\nOther\n-\n%\n%\n%\nThe tax effects of temporary differences that gave rise to significant portions of deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows:\nDecember 31,\nDeferred tax attributable to:\nNet operating losses\n$ 55,859\n$ 31,928\nShare-based compensation expense\nAccrued liabilities and allowances\n1,287\nFixed Assets\n-\nROU lease liability\n-\nOther\nLess: valuation allowance\n(55,561 )\n(29,812 )\nTotal deferred tax assets\n2,796\n2,741\nDeferred tax liabilities attributable to:\nIntangible assets\n(1,976 )\n(10,003 )\nROU Asset\n(194 )\n-\nDeferred revenue\n(626 )\n(1,124 )\nTotal deferred tax liabilities\n(2,796 )\n(11,127 )\nNet deferred tax liabilities\n$ -\n$ (8,386 )\nAs of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company had no unrecognized tax benefits and no related interest and penalties for the years then ended.\nPareteum Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Amounts in thousands except share and per share data and unless otherwise indicated)\nAs of December 31, 2019, and 2018, the Company had net operating losses carryforwards of approximately $258 million and $150 million, respectively. Any net deferred tax assets in a jurisdiction have been offset by a full valuation allowance in both 2019 and 2018 due to the uncertainty of realizing any tax benefit for such losses. Releases of the valuation allowances in the future, if any, will be recognized through earnings.\nSection 382 of the Internal Revenue Code limits the use of net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards in certain situations where changes occur in the stock ownership of a company. In the event the Company has a change in ownership, utilization of the carry forward could be limited.\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company is subject to tax examinations in the jurisdictions in which it files tax returns. The Company\u2019s statute of limitations for assessment is three years for federal and three to four years for state purposes. The federal net operating loss carry forwards remain open for adjustment until the net operating losses are fully utilized. The Company\u2019s statute of limitations is four to six years in the major foreign jurisdictions in which the Company files.\nThe Company files income tax returns in the US federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company did not have any liabilities for uncertain tax positions.\nNote 19. Commitments and Contingencies\nCommitments\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company entered into certain off-balance sheet commitments that require the future purchase of goods or services (\u201cunconditional purchase obligations\u201d). The Company entered into the Strategic Connectivity Agreement (the \u201cConnectivity Agreement\u201d) with Hutchison 3G UK Limited (\u201c3UK\u201d) on July 23, 2019.

Subsequent events\nThe Company has evaluated subsequent events through the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and determined that there have been no events that have occurred that would require adjustments to our disclosures in the consolidated financial statements except for the transactions described below.\nSenior Second Lien Secured Convertible Note\nOn February 22, 2021, the Company issued a $2.4 million in principal amount 8% Senior Second Lien Secured Convertible Note due April 1, 2025 (the \u201cSenior Second Lien Note\u201d) to an institutional investor (the \u201cPurchaser\u201d) for $2.0 million.\nThe Second Lien Note is a senior, secured obligation of the Company, but ranks junior to the High Trail Note (as defined below), issued by the Company and held by High Trail (as defined below). Interest is payable monthly beginning April 1, 2021 at a rate of 8% per annum. The Second Lien Note is secured by a second lien on substantially all assets of the Company and substantially all assets of its material U.S.-organized subsidiaries. Interest may be paid, at the election of the Company, in cash or in shares of common stock of the Company; provided, that, so long as the High Trail Note remains outstanding, such payments may only be made in shares. The number of shares of common stock to be issued to pay interest in shares of the Company\u2019s common stock is determined by the application of a formula in which the amount of the interest due is divided by 85% of the lowest volume-weighted average price of the Company\u2019s common stock on the principal market for the Company\u2019s common stock over the 10 days preceding the date of such payment.\nSubject to an intercreditor agreement with the holder of the High Trail Note, upon notice by the Company, the Company may elect to redeem all or a portion of the then-outstanding principal amount outstanding under the Second Lien Note. The Purchaser or the Company may also elect for the Company to redeem the Second Lien Note at a 20% premium if the Company undergoes a fundamental change. The Second Lien Note will be convertible into common stock of the Company, in part or in whole, from time to time, at the election of the Purchaser. The initial conversion rate is equal to 1666.6667 shares of the Company\u2019s common stock for each $1,000 of principal amount of the Second Lien Note or $0.60 per share. The conversion rate is subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments in the event the Company issues stock dividends or effects a split or reverse split of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nIn connection with the Second Lien Note, the Company also granted a warrant to purchase 2,750,000 shares of its common stock to the Purchaser at an exercise price of $0.40 per share expiring on February 22, 2026. The warrants are exercisable any time after February 22, 2021.\n8% Series C Redeemable Preferred Stock\nOn various dates from February 21, 2020 through August 18, 2020, the Company issued an additional 116 shares of Series C Redeemable Preferred Stock with a stated value of $11,600 for an aggregate purchase price of $9,100. By their terms, those shares are not convertible into other securities of the Company. However, on various dates from July 17, 2020 through October 1, 2020, the Company entered into the Series C Exchange Agreements with the holders of those 116 shares which allow either the Company or the holders to convert amounts due in connection with those shares of Series C Redeemable Preferred Stock into shares of the Company common stock.\nSenior Convertible Note\nOn June 8, 2020, the Company issued an $17.5 million in principal amount of an 8% Senior Secured Convertible Note due April1, 2025 (the \u201cHigh Trail Note\u201d or the \u201cNote\u201d) to High Trail Investments SA LLC (\u201cHigh Trail\u201d) for $14 million.\nOn June 8, 2020, the Company received $4 million of the $14 million and incurred legal fees of $0.3 million. The remaining $10 million balance was received by the Company but was deposited into a non-springing bank account based on terms of a Control Agreement. Under the terms of the Control Agreement, the Company has no right or any other right or ability to control, access, pick up, withdraw or transfer, deliver or dispose of items or funds from the non-springing account. Under the terms of the High Trail Note, the remaining $10 million balance will be released to the Company subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions as follows:\n\u2022 $3 million when the Company receives $4 million in additional financing. The Company received the additional financing in July 2020 and the $3 million was released to the Company to be used for working capital purposes.\n\u2022 $7 million when the Company meets certain specified conditions (the \u201cSpecified Conditions\u201d) on or prior to October 31, 2020 the \u201cSpecified Conditions Date\u201d). The $7 million will be reported as restricted cash until the Specified Conditions are met on the Specified Conditions Date.\nThe Specified Conditions include satisfaction of certain equity conditions and other conditions as of any date and on each of the 20 previous trading days prior to such date as defined in the High Trail Note. The satisfaction of the certain equity conditions includes:\n\u2022 the Company\u2019s being able to issue shares of its common stock upon conversion that are not subject to restrictions on resale;\n\u2022 High Trail not, upon conversion, beneficially owning in excess of 4.99% of the Company\u2019s outstanding common stock;\n\u2022 the Company at all times having sufficient authorized and unissued shares of its common stock available for the issuance of common stock upon conversion equal to the outstanding principal amount plus accrued interest;\nPareteum Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Amounts in thousands except share and per share data and unless otherwise indicated)\n\u2022 the average daily volume weighted-average price per share of the Company\u2019s common stock being not less than $0.50 (for a common stock change event as defined in the Note) and the daily dollar trading volume (as reported on Bloomberg) for the Company\u2019s common stock on such date and for at least 17 of the prior 20 trading days being not less than $750,000;\n\u2022 there being no defaults or events of a default that have occurred or are continuing;\n\u2022 the Company having obtained the requisite stockholder approval required by the Nasdaq Stock Market for the issuance of the shares of its common stock upon conversion;\n\u2022 the average daily volume-weighted average price per share of the Company\u2019s common stock being not less than $0.85 (for a common stock change event as defined in the Note); and\n\u2022 the absence of any defaults or events of default.\nThe Note contains customary events of default, as well as events of default if the Company fails to use reasonable efforts to obtain the approval of its stockholders of the issuance of the shares issuable upon conversion by October 31, 2020, the Company\u2019s shares cease to be traded on the NASDAQ Stock Market, or the Company fails to restate its financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018 and the quarters ended March 31, 2019 and June 30, 2019, in each case, prior to October 31, 2020 or fails to timely file its subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q or its subsequent annual reports on Form 10-K with the SEC in the manner and within the time periods required by the Exchange Act. The Company is currently in default.\nBeginning October 1, 2020, and on the first day of each calendar month thereafter, at the election of High Trail, the Company can be required to redeem a portion of the Note. The amount of each redemption payment will be up to $3.5 million, provided, that in any case the amount of any redemption payment will not exceed the principal amount then outstanding under the Notes.\nIf the Company elects the option to pay an optional redemption payment in shares of its common stock on any optional redemption date, High Trail shall have the right to allocate all or any portion of the applicable optional redemption payment (or applicable portion thereof) to one or more scheduled trading days during the period beginning on, and including, the applicable optional redemption date and ending on, and including, the scheduled trading day immediately before the subsequent optional redemption date or defer such optional redemption payment (or applicable portion thereof) to any future optional redemption date selected by High Trail.\nThe High Trail Note has a stated interest rate of 8.0%per year, payable monthly in arrears at the Company\u2019s option in cash or shares of its common stock or a combination of both cash and shares of the Company\u2019s common stock beginning on August 1, 2020. On December 8, 2020, the Company and High Trail entered into a letter agreement whereby the Company agreed that High Trail would accept 1,093,750 shares of the Company\u2019s common stock in full satisfaction of the Company\u2019s obligation to make a $0.3 million interest payment on December 1, 2020.\nIf the Company fails to pay any amount payable on this Note on or before the due date as provided in the Note, then, regardless of whether such failure constitutes an event of default, or a default or event of default occurs as set forth in the Note (such amount payable or the principal amount outstanding as of such failure to pay or default or event of default, (as applicable, a \u201cDefaulted Amount\u201d), then in each case, interest (\u201cDefault Interest\u201d) will accrue on such Defaulted Amount at a rate per annum equal to 18.0%, from, and including, such due date or the date of such default or event of default, as applicable, to, but excluding, the date such failure to pay or default or event of default is cured and all outstanding Default Interest under the Note has been paid, as applicable. As a result of the Company\u2019s defaults under the terms of the High Trail Note, it is currently paying the Default Interest rate.\nIf the Company elects to pay the stated interest (or any applicable portion thereof) in shares of its common stock, High Trail shall have the right to allocate all or any portion of the applicable payment of the stated interest (or applicable portion thereof) to one or more scheduled trading days as defined in the High Trail Note) during the period beginning on, and including, the applicable interest payment date and ending on, and including, the scheduled trading day immediately before the subsequent interest payment date (or defer such payment of the stated interest (or applicable portion thereof) to any future Interest payment date selected by High Trail.\nThe number of shares of common stock to be issued by the Company for payment for both the optional redemption payment and the stated interest amounts are determined as set forth in the Note by dividing each amount by 85% of the lowest average daily volume-weighted-average price per share of the Company\u2019s common stock during the 10 trading day period ending on the trading day immediately prior to such interest payment or the optional redemption payment payable in shares of common stock.\nPareteum Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Amounts in thousands except share and per share data and unless otherwise indicated)\nThe High Trail Note is convertible into shares of the Company\u2019s common stock including any portion constituting an optional redemption payment amount and other circumstances as set forth in the Note at High Trail\u2019s election. The initial conversion rate is equal to 1,666.667 shares of the Company\u2019s common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the Note, or $0.60 per share. However, when the Company receives the $4 million in additional financing and if the additional financing date conversion rate is lower than the initial current conversion rate, the initial conversion rate shall be reduced to equal the additional financing date conversion rate; and, provided, further, that on the Specified Conditions Date, if the Specified Conditions conversion rate is lower than the then current conversion rate, the conversion rate at the time shall be reduced to equal the Specified Conditions conversion rate. The conversion rate is further subject to changes based on subsequent equity issuances as defined in the Note.\nThe additional financing conversion rate is computed as follows: per $1,000 principal amount of the High Trail Note divided by the last reported stock price on the trading date prior to the additional financing date multiplied by 105% (based on the last reported stock price prior to the Company receiving the additional financing). In July 2020, the Company received the additional financing amount and the additional financing conversion rate was higher than the initial conversion rate of 1,666.667, based on the last reported stock on the trading date prior to the Company receiving the additional financing. As a result, the initial conversion rate remained the same.\nThe Specified Conditions conversion rate is computed as follows: per $1,000 principal amount of the High Trail Notes divided by the last reported stock price on the trading date prior to the additional financing date multiplied by 105% on the weighted-average price of the Company\u2019s common stock in respect of the period from the scheduled open of trading until the scheduled close of trading immediately before the Specified Conditions Date, which the Company has not yet met.\nThe Note is secured by a first lien on substantially all assets of the Company and substantially all assets of its material U.S. organized subsidiaries and the assets of Pareteum Europe BV, a subsidiary organized in the Netherlands. In addition, the Note contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, including restrictions on indebtedness, equity securities, liens, dividends, distributions, acquisitions, investments, sale or transfer of assets, transactions with affiliates and maintenance of certain financial ratios.\nAll payments due under the Note rank senior to all other indebtedness of the Company to the extent of the value of the Collateral and any Subordinated Indebtedness.\nIf the Company undergoes a fundamental change as set forth in the Note, High Trail will have the right to require the Company to repurchase all or part of the Note in cash equal to of the greater of (i) 120% of the then outstanding principal amount of the Note (or portion thereof) and (ii) 120% of the product of (A) the conversion rate in effect as of the trading day immediately preceding the effective date of such fundamental change; (B) the principal amount of this Note to be repurchased upon a fundamental change divided by $1,000; and (C) the highest daily volume weighted-average price per share of the Company\u2019s common stock occurring during the consecutive volume-weighted average price per share of the Company\u2019s common stock trading days ending on, and including, the daily volume-weighted average price per share of the Company\u2019s common stock on the trading day immediately before the effective date of such fundamental change.\nIf the Company enters into a bankruptcy proceeding as set forth in the Note, then the then-outstanding portion of the principal amount and all accrued and unpaid interest will immediately become due and payable to High Trail. In addition, at High Trail\u2019s option, the Note will become due and payable immediately for cash equal to an default acceleration amount upon certain events of default as set forth in the Note, which includes, the Company not filing its restated financial statements with the SEC for (A) the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, (B) the quarter ended March 31, 2019 and (C) the quarter ended June 30, 2019, in each case on or prior to October 31, 2020 and in compliance with all requirements under the Exchange Act and after October 31, 2020 (A) the Company timely filing its subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q or its subsequent annual reports on Form 10-K with the SEC in the manner and within the time periods required by the Exchange Act.\nThe default acceleration amount is equal to the greater of (A) 120% of the then outstanding principal amount of this Note plus accrued and unpaid interest; and (B) 120% of the product of (i)the conversion rate in effect as of the trading day immediately preceding the date such notice is delivered; (ii) the total then outstanding principal portion of the Note plus accrued and unpaid interest; and (iii) the greater of (x) the highest daily volume-weighted average price per share of the Company\u2019s common stock occurring during the 30 consecutive volume-weighted average price per share of the Company\u2019s common stock trading days ending on, and including, the daily volume-weighted average price per share of the Company\u2019s common stock on the trading day before the date the applicable event of default occurred.\nIn connection with High Trail Note, the Company granted a warrant to purchase 15,000,000 shares of its common stock to High Trail at an exercise price of $0.58 per share expiring on June 8, 2025. Under the Forbearance Agreement, the exercise price of the warrant was reduced to $0.37 per share.\nPareteum Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Amounts in thousands except share and per share data and unless otherwise indicated)\nDelisting of the Company\u2019s Common Stock\nOn November 5, 2020, the Company notified the Nasdaq Hearings Panel that it would not be able to file its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2019, its amended Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2018, its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 or its Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the periods ended March 31, 2020 and June 30, 2020 by November 9, 2020, the date by which the Hearing Panel had required the Company to make such filings in order for the Company\u2019s common stock to remain listed on Nasdaq. In response to the Company\u2019s notice to Nasdaq that it would not satisfy the conditions to the exception to the listing requirements granted by the Hearings Panel, Nasdaq notified the Company by letter dated November 10, 2020 that the Company\u2019s common stock would be delisted, and trading of the Company\u2019s common stock on Nasdaq\u2019s Capital Market was suspended effective at the open of business on November 12, 2020. After the trading of the Company\u2019s common stock was suspended by Nasdaq, prices for the Company\u2019s common stock began to be quoted on the OTC Markets Group Inc.\u2019s Pink Open Market. The delisting became effective on February 12, 2021.",

    "item_9A": "Item 9A. Controls and Procedures\n(a) Material Weaknesses Identified - Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nWe maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC\u2019s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our interim chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.\nIn connection with preparing this filing, management has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)). In accordance with guidance issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission, companies are permitted to exclude acquisitions from their final assessment of internal control over financial reporting for the first fiscal year in which the acquisition occurred. Our management\u2019s evaluation of internal control over financial reporting excluded the internal control activities of iPass Inc., which we acquired in February 2019, as discussed in Note 2, Acquisitions, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We have included the financial results of these in the consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. Based on that evaluation the Company concluded that we did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, as further described below, because of material weaknesses in our control environment and therefore our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2019.\n(b) Material Weaknesses Identified - Management\u2019s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Our internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that:\n\u2022 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets;\n\u2022 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and\n\u2022 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements.\nIn connection with preparing this filing, our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and in making this assessment used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013). Based on the foregoing evaluation, our management has identified the following deficiencies that constitute material weaknesses in the Company\u2019s internal controls over financial reporting:\n\u2022 Inadequate and ineffective management assessment of internal control over financial reporting, including insufficient experienced resources to complete the documentation of internal control assessment;\n\u2022 Ineffective design, implementation and monitoring of information technology general controls pertaining to the Company\u2019s change management process;\n\u2022 entity-level controls were not effective due to certain executive management \u201ctone at the top\u201d issues which contributed to an ineffective control environment and to deficiencies aggregating to material weaknesses;\n\u2022 the Company not having sufficient accounting and finance department resources to effectively assess risk and design, operate and oversee effective internal controls over financial reporting, which contributed to the failure in the effectiveness and adequate identification of certain controls (as identified in Note 21, Unaudited Quarterly Data (Restated)) including:\no application of appropriate revenue recognition standards;\no proper accounting of share-based compensation;\no appropriate settlement of payables via issuance of shares;\no complete and appropriate application of foreign currency translations;\no identification and accounting of operating leases in accordance with ASC 842; and\no method of accounting for acquisitions and business combinations.\nBased on these material weaknesses, the Company\u2019s management concluded that the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting was not effective at December 31, 2019.\nBaker Tilly US, LLP (formerly Squar Milner, LLP), the Company\u2019s independent registered public accounting firm, expressed an unqualified opinion for the audit of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2019 and issued an adverse opinion in its report on the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019.\nRemediation to Address Material Weaknesses\nManagement and the Company\u2019s board of directors have been implementing and continue to implement measures designed to ensure that control deficiencies contributing to the material weakness are remediated, such that these controls are designed, implemented and operating effectively.\nThe audit committee of the Company\u2019s board of directors, with the assistance of independent legal counsel and a separate independent accounting firm, took action to immediately begin investigating the causes of the 2018 Restatement, first and second quarter 2019 restatements, and delay in 2019 filings as soon as the board, upon the recommendation of the audit committee, and after consultation with management and the auditors, concluded that the Company\u2019s financial statements and other reports could not be relied upon. As a result of this independent investigation and related deliberations, the board of directors terminated or otherwise separated each of the following executive officers who served during the time period of the conduct that gave rise to the Company\u2019s need to effect the Restatement: Robert H. Turner, the Company\u2019s former chief executive officer, Edward O\u2019Donnell, the Company\u2019s former chief financial officer, Denis McCarthy, the Company\u2019s former chief operating officer, and Victor Bozzo, the Company\u2019s former chief commercial officer. The Company has also taken and will continue to take significant and comprehensive remedial actions in response to the conduct and other factors that led to the 2018 Restatement and delay in 2019 filings, including actions to begin to remediate the material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting. Remediation actions already implemented include (i) a thorough review and documentation of all processes involved in our financial reporting to ensure that there is segregation of duties, (ii) access security and documented review processes in place that happen at appropriate intervals throughout the year that covers all elements of the Company\u2019s financial reporting. This includes, but is not limited to, testing samples and documenting that testing has occurred with the results of the findings being reported to senior management and that they occur at appropriate intervals and continuously making improvements to our processes as necessary.\nTo address ineffective design, implementation and monitoring of information technology general controls pertaining to the Company\u2019s change management process, the Company has (iii) removed all live access to all developers, internal and external, from being able to make coding changes directly in our reporting system; (iv) will continue to monitor and document all changes made in our reporting system and add additional layers of documented review of these changes; (v) will institute sample testing of changes made in our reporting system to ensure the documented policies are being followed and report the results of these tests to senior management in regular appropriate intervals; (vi) document and implement information technology policies based upon industry leading practices; (vii) adding personnel who will have information technology control oversight and support roles and (viii) enhance our quarterly reporting on the remediation measures to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.\nAdditionally, to ensure the Company maintains a strong internal control environment and to remediate the additional material weakness in internal controls over financial reporting identified in this Form 10-K, the Company: (ix) has ceased the employment of personnel responsible for the revenue restatement and oversight of accounting and finance operations; (x) is designing and implementing enhancements to internal controls over financial reporting including those related to sales processing, revenue recognition and equity accounting; (xi) has implemented a periodic review of financial reports and month-over-month balances with the purpose of identifying and investigating fluctuations and discrepancies in key accounts and transactions; (xii) will provide training to its finance and sales staff and key personnel on the appropriate guidelines to account for revenue in the telecom industry and emphasizing the importance of adherence to policies and procedures; (xiii) is implementing a new application to manage equity; (xiv) engaged outside resources and hired in-house controls personnel to monitor and assess internal controls over financial reporting.\nWe believe that these actions will remediate the material weaknesses. While we have taken measures to strengthen our internal controls related to these additional material weaknesses, we have not fully completed our assessment. The material weaknesses will not be considered remediated until the applicable controls operate for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are operating effectively.\nAs our management continues to evaluate and work to improve our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, we may determine to take additional measures to address these deficiencies or determine to modify certain of the remediation measures described above.\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Pareteum Corporation\nOpinion on the Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Pareteum Corporation and its subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013. In our opinion, because of the effect of the material weaknesses described below on the achievement of the objectives of the control criteria, the Company has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013.\nAs described in the accompanying Management\u2019s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, management has excluded iPass Inc. from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, because it was acquired by the Company in a purchase business combination in the first quarter of 2019. We have also excluded iPass from our audit of internal control over financial reporting. iPass is a wholly owned subsidiary whose total assets and net loss represent approximately 11 percent and 23 percent, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 and the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, changes in stockholders\u2019 equity (deficit) and cash flows for the years then ended (collectively, the financial statements) and our report dated March 12, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and included explanatory paragraphs relating to the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern, the change in accounting principle related to lease accounting, and the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets.\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company\u2019s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The following material weaknesses have been identified and included in management\u2019s assessment:\nThe Company\u2019s entity-level controls were not effective due to certain \u201ctone at the top\u201d issues which contributed to an ineffective control environment and to deficiencies aggregating to material weaknesses.\nThe Company conducted an inadequate and ineffective management assessment of internal control over financial reporting, including insufficient experienced resources to complete the documentation of internal control assessment and ineffective design, implementation and monitoring of information technology general controls pertaining to the Company\u2019s change management process.\nThe Company did not have sufficient accounting and finance department resources to effectively assess risk, and design, operate and oversee effective internal controls over financial reporting, which contributed to the failure in the effectiveness of certain controls. In addition, the Company\u2019s controls related to revenue recognition, share-based compensation, business combination, foreign currency translation, leases and settlement of payables were not effective.\nThese material weaknesses were considered in determining the nature, timing and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the 2019 financial statements, and this report does not affect our report dated March 12, 2021 on those financial statements.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company\u2019s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting in the accompanying Management\u2019s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Baker Tilly US, LLP\nLos Angeles, California\nMarch 12, 2021",

However, our Nominating Committee generally evaluates and recommends candidates with a focus on the following qualities: educational background, ethnic and gender diversity, breadth of professional experience, knowledge of our industry and business, integrity, professional reputation, independence, wisdom and ability to represent the best interests of our stockholders and other stakeholders.\nOur Board of Directors and officers are composed of a diverse group of leaders.

Lippert M \u221a \u221a\n\u221a\nRobert H. Turner M \u221a \u221a \u221a\nIndependence Standards for Directors\nThere are no arrangements between our directors and any other person pursuant to which our directors were nominated or elected for their positions.\nThree of our current directors, Luis Jimenez-Tu\u00f1on, Robert L. Lippert and Mary Beth Vitale are \u201cindependent\u201d under Nasdaq rules. All of the individuals nominated for election at the Meeting are \u201cindependent\u201d under Nasdaq rules. Each of Messrs. Jimenez-Tu\u00f1on and Lippert and Ms. Vitale serve on the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee, the Nominating Committee and the Strategy and Business Committee. Our Interim Non-Executive Chairman, Ms. Vitale, is independent.\nIn addition, Mr. Jimenez-Tu\u00f1on, Mr. Lippert and Ms. Vitale qualify as \u201cindependent\u201d under the standards established by the SEC for members of audit committees. The Board of Directors has determined that Robert L. Lippert and Mary Beth Vitale is each an \u201caudit committee financial expert\u201d as defined in Item 407(d)(5)(ii) of Regulation S-K. Stockholders should understand that this designation is a disclosure requirement of the SEC related to these individuals\u2019 experience and understanding with respect to certain accounting and auditing matters. The designation does not impose upon Mr. Lippert or Ms. Vitale any duties, obligations or liability that are greater than those generally imposed on them as a member of the Audit Committee and the Board of Directors, and their designation as audit committee financial experts pursuant to this SEC requirement does not affect the duties, obligations, or liability of any other member of the Audit Committee or the Board of Directors.

Accordingly, our Board reserves the right to vest the responsibilities of the Chief Executive Officer and Chair in the same person or in two different individuals depending on what it believes is in our best interest. At this time, our Board has determined that separation of these roles most appropriately suits us. The Board will, however, appoint a lead director if the Chair and Chief Executive Officer roles are in the future combined, to conduct executive sessions, and Chair the Board if the Chief Executive Officer is unavailable and for such other purposes as the board finds useful.\nThe Board\u2019s policy is to periodically hold executive sessions without the presence of management, including the Chief Executive Officer or other non-independent directors. In general, time is reserved during each regularly scheduled Board meeting should the outside directors wish to meet in private executive session. When the outside directors meet without a non-independent chairperson of the Board, the lead director shall chair the meeting. The outside directors may also meet at such other times as determined by the presiding director.\nRisk Oversight\nOur Business and Strategy Committee and our Audit Committee share responsibility for oversight of risk management, with members of management also playing a key role. Our Business and Strategy Committee is responsible for the oversight of the Company\u2019s overall enterprise risk management, risk profile and risk assessment, although it coordinates with other committees of the Board, and the full Board, as it from time to time deems appropriate. The Business and Strategy Committee also oversees risk in the areas of corporate strategy and corporate growth and development. Our Audit Committee also assists the full Board in overseeing, approving and monitoring the company-wide enterprise risks identified by various levels of management and the Board. These risks generally cover, but are not limited to: compliance, environmental, financial, operational, reputational, as well as digital risks (fraud, cybersecurity and network). Management is responsible for developing a plan to monitor, assign ownership and respond to early threats and for communicating the methods and processes to manage and leverage opportunities associated with each risk on a regular cadence with the Board. With respect to high-risk areas, we have directed management to present detailed mitigation activities to the Board on an annual basis.\nThe Audit Committee has also directed management to develop a risk management policy, which plan must be submitted and approved on an annual basis by such committee. The risk management plan is required to consider the maturity of the risk management of the Company, to be tailored to the specific circumstances of the Company, include the Company\u2019s risk management structure, the standards and methodology adopted, risk management guidelines, reference to integration and details of the assurance and review of the risk management process.\nEmployee, Officer and Director Hedging\nThe Company\u2019s Insider Trading Policy and our Corporate Governance Guidelines contain restrictions on the ability of directors, officers, and employees to engage in certain transactions that hedge or modify the effect of any transaction in Company securities. Specifically, our Corporate Governance Guidelines prohibit such persons from (i) selling the Company\u2019s securities short, (ii) buying or selling put or call options, or other derivative securities, with respect to the Company\u2019s securities, (iii) engaging in transactions that hedge or offset or that are designed to hedge or offset any decrease in the market value of shares of the Company\u2019s stock (or the stock of any of the Company\u2019s subsidiaries) granted to such persons as compensation or otherwise held by such persons either directly or indirectly, including through the purchase of financial instruments such as prepaid variable forwards, equity swaps, collars and exchange funds and (iv) holding any Company securities in a margin account or pledging Company securities as collateral for any loan.\nAttendance at Board, Committee and Stockholder Meetings\nOur Board of Directors met in person and telephonically 5 times during 2019 and acted by unanimous written consent14 times during 2019. Each of the then-members of our Board of Directors was present at 75% or more of the Board of Directors meetings held in 2019.\nWe have encouraged, but do not require, that all of our directors be in attendance at our annual shareholder meeting either in person or by remote communication.
