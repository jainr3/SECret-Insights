    "item_1": "Item 1. Business\nOverview\nPareteum Corporation (OTC: TEUM) is a cloud software communications platform company with a mission - to Connect Every Person and Every(Thing)\u2122.\nMillions of people and devices are connected around the world using Pareteum\u2019s global cloud software communications platform, enhancing their mobile experience. Pareteum\u2019s goal is to unleash the power of applications and mobile services, which we believe will bring secure, ubiquitous, scalable, and seamlessly available voice, video, SMS/text messaging, and data services to our customers, making worldwide communications services easily and economically accessible to everyone. By harnessing the value of our cloud communications platform, Pareteum serves enterprises, communications service providers, early-stage innovators, developers, Internet-of-Things (\u201cIoT\u201d), and telecommunications infrastructure providers.\nWith estimates of up to 30 billion devices to be managed and connected according to ABI Research, a market research firm that specializes in global connectivity and emerging technology, the total available market is vast. Service providers, brand marketing companies, and enterprise and IoT providers use Pareteum\u2019s cloud communication services and turnkey solutions featuring relevant content, applications, and connectivity worldwide. Pareteum integrates a variety of disparate communications methods and services and offers them to customers and application developers, allowing communications to become a value-added service. We believe that this is a major strategic goal for many industries, from legacy telecommunications providers to the disruptive technology and data enterprises of today and the future.\nThe vast majority of our platform is comprised of our internally-developed software and intellectual property, which provides our customers with flexibility in how they use our products and allows us to be market-driven going forward. We have been granted more than 70 patents related to techniques and processes that support our cloud software and communications platform solutions. Our platform services partners (whose technologies are integrated into our cloud) include: Hewlett Packard Enterprise, IBM, AT&T, Amazon Web Services, Sonus, Veniam, Oracle, Microsoft, NetNumber, Affirmed Networks and other world-class technology providers.\nPareteum is a mission-focused company that seeks to empower \u201cEvery Person and Every(Thing)\u201d to be globally connected, hence our slogan - ANY DEVICE, ANY NETWORK, ANYWHERE\u2122. The Pareteum cloud communications platform targets large and growing sectors from IoT, Mobile Virtual Network Operators, Enablers and Aggregators (\u201cMVNO,\u201d \u201cMVNE\u201d and \u201cMVNA\u201d), Smart Cities, and application developer markets, each in need of mobile platforms, management and connectivity. These sectors need Communications Platform-as-a-Service (\u201cCPaaS\u201d), which Pareteum delivers.\nCoronavirus Pandemic\nIn March 2020, COVID-19 began spreading across the globe and was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization; the President of the United States (\u201cU.S.\u201d) declared this a national emergency. The economic effects of the pandemic and resulting social changes are not predictable. There are a number of uncertainties arising from COVID-19 that have impacted and could continue to impact our operating results: the effectiveness of COVID-19 mitigation measures, the duration of the pandemic, the pace and effectiveness of vaccination efforts, and the effect on global economic conditions. Likewise, business operational changes, work from home, school from home and shop from home all impact consumer confidence and the availability of supply chains to support these activities. We expect our operating and financial results to continue to be impacted by COVID-19 for the duration of the pandemic.\nWe have seen an increase in usage consumption, particularly for messaging and consumer mobile services during the pandemic. However, our products and services for customers in the travel and hospitality industries have been and continue to be negatively impacted. We expect volatility in customer demand and consumption habits as the pandemic continues, and we may experience constrained supply or curtailed customer demand that could adversely impact our operations. Specifically, we have seen slowing sales cycles, including customers and prospective customers delaying contracts or renewals. Customers in the pipeline are uncertain and may minimize commitments related to the products and services we offer.\nInnovative Use Cases\nMany sectors, from traditional network operators to disruptive technology and data-driven companies, have found many innovative use cases for our platforms. Beyond simply enabling communications between people and devices, the Company\u2019s platforms are designed to enable any of the following, among others:\n\u2022Smart homes, including smart appliances, smart energy meters, wearables etc.\n\u2022Connected cars\n\u2022Smart cities\n\u2022Smart logistics and supply chains\n\u2022Smart healthcare applications\nIn addition to the foregoing, as a result of acquisitions completed in October 2018 and February 2019, the Company has acquired certain intellectual property portfolios (the \u201cAcquired IP Rights\u201d), which it now manages through various wholly owned direct and indirect subsidiaries. The Company utilizes patent, copyright, trademark, and trade secret laws in the U.S., Europe, and elsewhere to protect the Acquired IP Rights.\nBusiness Model\nAt Pareteum, our mission is to \u201cEmpower Communications Service Providers (\u201cCSPs\u201d), Enterprises and Developers to simply create and control their own wireless communications products and experience through our powerful combination of software, services and global connectivity.\u201d We believe that open software and interfaces for communications services will create more innovation, economic freedom, and opportunity equality worldwide, just like the internet did for information. Our value proposition intersects with numerous applications and industries. It is our strong belief that no other company in the CPaaS market offers similarly broad value in such a comprehensive way.\nHowever, an easily accessible open mobility system for the world is challenging to scale because it requires a \u201cnetwork effect.\u201d The network effect is the principle that a service yields increased value as it grows. The essence of this point is that our business and our services will grow in value as we grow and scale. We aim to achieve that growth by providing the marketplace exchange on which these communications and transactions take place, and in doing so we attract new users and more customers.\nTo achieve our desired growth, we use our managed services solutions as a launching pad from which to grow our Pareteum Experience Cloud Platform by offering mobility, engagement, intelligence and control products and services to our existing and prospective customers. This process is already well underway, including with our anchor customer Vodafone.\nGo-to-Market and Growth Strategy\nPareteum is in growth mode, which we expect to achieve through a combination of organic growth as well as targeted mergers and acquisitions, such as the 2018 and 2019 Artilium, iPass and Devicescape acquisitions.\nPareteum seeks to continue winning new long-term contractual business. We expect this pace to increase throughout 2021 and beyond. Our focus is on selling and implementing new communications services and IoT opportunities as fast as reasonably possible, as the world of connected devices and people continues to rise on a daily basis.\nOur go-to-market strategy uses a four-phase approach:\nPhase 1: Continue to attract new subscribers across all verticals to all our platforms through direct sales, existing channel partnerships and new initiatives such as referral programs.\nPhase 2: Continue to on-board new communications services providers, multiplying our own growth, largely through business development and direct sales in each of our six defined sales regions (North America, Latin America, Europe, Middle East, Africa, and Asia Pacific).\nPhase 3: Drive adoption through a twin approach. First, we will be on-boarding more \u201cthings\u201d (whether Subscriber Identification Module (\u201cSIM\u201d) cards, handsets, devices, vehicles etc.) to our Pareteum Experience Cloud Platform, as our initial user base. Second, we will be drawing in new and existing customers and end-users to add and consume more services into our existing Pareteum Experience Cloud Platform. These will be people with the greatest pain point, who are underserved by the current mobility networks and applications out in the market (including in developing markets).\nPhase 4: At this stage, our strategic Pareteum Experience Cloud Platform customers will have their own go-to-market strategy, creating shared value, ranging from traditional consumer strategies to sophisticated B2B and B2B2C strategies, driving and expanding our ecosystem to new heights.\nThe phases described above are already being implemented, in parallel as far as possible, for the fastest, most sustainable growth, highlighting our strategy for accelerating the world\u2019s shift to an open mobility and application network. When we\u2019re successful, we believe it may accelerate the pace of innovation in the world, create more economic freedom, and provide better mobility services to billions of underserved people.\nWe also follow an organic growth plan focused on three core areas:\n\u2022Exploring cross-sale and up-sale opportunities among Pareteum\u2019s recent customer acquisitions - focused on offering new products and services that complement or supplement their existing or future needs so to accelerate their strategy;\n\u2022Platform evolution - enhance and expand existing products and services; and\n\u2022Geographic expansion-focusing on entering new markets, such as South East Asia and Latin America.\nEmployees\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company had 200 total employees worldwide, of which 199 were full-time employees.\nResearch & Development\nPareteum\u2019s research and development function attempts to ensure that its communications platforms grow in line with customer needs and technological advancement, and remain resilient, reliable and secure. Product development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were $10.3 million and $13.0 million, respectively.\nIntellectual Property\nPareteum relies on a combination of patents, copyright, trademark, and trade secret laws in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere. The Company protects its brand and reputation through the exploitation of a number of registered and unregistered trademarks and service marks. Pareteum has a patent portfolio of over 70 granted patents. The current patent portfolio includes, but is not limited to, a set of developments embracing areas such as advanced network characterization and migration, automated configuration for network appliances, method and system for changing security information in a computer network, method and system for verifying and updating the configuration of an access device during authentication, service quality monitoring process, system and method for enabling wireless social networking, and system and method for network curation, all expiring through 2034, and subject to renewals.\nPareteum further protects its intellectual property rights by requiring all its employees and independent contractors involved in the development of intellectual property to assign those rights to the Company, to the greatest extent permitted by applicable law.\nSales and Marketing\nPareteum\u2019s sales and marketing teams work together to identify and establish relationships with prospective customers, acquire new ones and expand relationships with existing customers by encouraging their consumption of additional services and products existing in our Pareteum Experience Cloud Platform. Our marketing team generates leads through our website, online marketing campaigns, webinars, white papers, public relations and other outbound lead development efforts.\nWe engage with prospective and existing customers through an enterprise sales approach. Our sales executives directly engage C-Level executives and other senior business, product, and technical decision makers responsible for the end-user experience and financial results at their companies. Our sales executives work to educate these decision makers and their teams about the benefits of using the Pareteum Experience Cloud Platform to launch and scale robust communications experiences.\nCustomers\nOur customers are tier 1 communications service providers that provide telecommunications services to end-users, Fortune 1,000 companies, mobile virtual network enablers of all sizes, software developers, banks, financial and online payment services companies, global consulting companies, mobile marketing platforms, telecommunications applications, and many others.\nA customer advocate is assigned to each new contract, and a multi-step process of hand-off from sales to service is handled by this distinct team that is made up of experienced staff around the globe and supported by back office professionals throughout the U.S., United Kingdom (\"U.K.\"), Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Asia Pacific and Latin America.\nPareteum provides multiple levels of customer support, including 24/7 support, to ensure service levels and network reliability to meet the expectations and requirements of Pareteum\u2019s customers. We believe that customers that use the Pareteum Experience Cloud Platform value our network reliability and availability, responsive customer support, competitive pricing, and collaborative approach.\nThe Company has significant customers and the loss of these customers could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. For the year ended December 31, 2020, two significant customers each individually accounted for 21% and 20% of our revenue and for the year ended December 31, 2019, one customer accounted for 20% of our revenue.\nCompetition\nWe compete with telecommunications solution providers, cloud software and service providers, communications\u2019 platforms, and the in-house IT and network departments of communications companies as well as firms that provide IT services (including consulting, systems integration and managed services), software vendors that sell products for particular aspects of a total information system, software vendors that specialize in systems for particular communications services (such as Internet, land-line and mobile services, cable, satellite and service bureaus) and companies that offer software systems in combination with the sale of network equipment.\nWe believe that our ability to compete depends on several factors, including:\n\u2022the development of software products by others that are competitive with our products and services;\n\u2022the price at which others offer competitive software and services;\n\u2022the ability to make use of the networks of mobile network operators;\n\u2022the technological changes of telecommunication operators affecting our ability to run services over their networks;\n\u2022the ability of competitors to deliver projects at a level of quality that rivals our own;\n\u2022the responsiveness of our competitors to customer needs; and\n\u2022the ability of our competitors to hire, retain and motivate key personnel.\nA number of our competitors have long operating histories, large customer bases, substantial financial, technical, sales, marketing and other resources, and strong name recognition. Current and potential competitors have established, and may establish in the future, cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties.\nThe CPaaS market is moving quickly. We believe that the key competitive differentiators for Pareteum in the near-term will be:\n\u2022Scale and international reach of connectivity;\n\u2022Comprehensiveness of platform offerings;\n\u2022Ease of deployment and implementation; and\n\u2022Scalability and reliability of service.\nPareteum considers itself well-placed to be judged on those criteria. The Company is confident that its network of global and international connectivity partners will enable it to access markets that currently are under-served and compete equally with larger competitors in mature markets. In addition, Pareteum is confident that few other players have the breadth of value-added services to complement the core connectivity platforms, resulting in competitive positioning for each of the areas where it competes:\n\u2022MVNE services for CSPs: In a fragmented market without large competitors, Pareteum is well-known in the industry for a wide range of platform functionalities and high-flexibility to adapt to customer needs and accommodate complex requirements at a competitive price. As a result, Pareteum is serving leading CSPs in Europe, Asia Pacific, North America, Latin American and Africa, untapping solid growth potential in each of these markets.\n\u2022Wi-Fi connectivity aggregation for enterprise customers: Pareteum has built an extensive Wi-Fi footprint with exclusive deals, covering more hotels, airports, business, leisure and outdoor areas. Pareteum offers a unified user experience with seamless access across Wi-Fi hotspots to blue chip customers, with a variety of successful business models.\n\u2022Short Message Service Application-To-Person (\u201cSMS A2P\u201d) messaging for Enterprise customers: Leveraging global connectivity agreements enabling competitive price points and a strong competitive position in Europe, Pareteum offers fully programmable business-to-consumer messaging across a wide range of mobile and social channels with simple Application Programming Interface (\u201cAPI\u201d) integration.\n\u2022IoT connectivity platform for IoT solution providers: Leveraging on the above capabilities, Pareteum is in an advantageous position to build a unique proposition for IoT solution providers that would benefit from the large growth potential in IoT. The foundations are in place and Pareteum has already received very positive commercial traction.\nNevertheless, some of our competitors have greater financial, technical and sales and marketing resources, as well as greater brand and market awareness, and consequently may be able to react more quickly to competitive pressures. As we execute on our growth strategies, and enter new markets, or disrupt markets and replace incumbents, we expect competition to become more intense.\nOne key tenet in our competitive strategy, however, is to actually lower the competitive barriers to market for new customers to create new mobility and communications applications and businesses. We intend to disrupt existing markets and have the advantage of quick time-to-market for those newly enabled business models and opportunities. These include, for example:\n\u2022Uniquely tailored data services such as unlimited social media, messaging apps or streaming music services.\n\u2022Global roaming connectivity without local infrastructure: e.g., business executives using a multi-SIM worldwide phone.\n\u2022Creation of personal, branded, mobile services.\n\u2022One-stop shop for bundles of IoT and machine-to-machine (\u201cM2M\u201d) services: through plug-ins to multiple vertical applications and specialized platforms. One-stop shop for current and next-gen Global System for Mobile (\u201cGSM\u201d) communications and Wi-Fi connectivity, deployed seamlessly through our CPaaS solutions.\nRegulatory\nPareteum is subject to several U.S. federal, state and foreign laws and regulations that involve matters central to our business. These laws and regulations involve privacy, data protection, intellectual property, telecommunications, trade and export sanctions or other subjects. Many of the laws and regulations to which we are subject are still evolving and may be tested or varied in courts and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business. In addition, the application and interpretation of these laws and regulations are often uncertain, particularly in the new and rapidly evolving markets in which we operate. Because applicable international laws and regulations have continued to develop and evolve rapidly, it is possible that we, our products or our platform may not be, or may not have been, compliant with each such applicable law or regulation.\nPrivacy and Data Protection\nThe regulatory framework for privacy, data protection and security issues worldwide is complex and rapidly evolving and as a result, implementation standards and enforcement practices are likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. These data privacy laws and regulations are especially relevant and applicable to us as a technology company because we process vast amounts of personal and non-personal data on behalf of our customers and we also host significant and increasing amounts of data in our cloud solutions. The application of existing laws to cloud-based solutions is particularly uncertain and cloud-based solutions may be subject to further regulation, the impact of which cannot be fully understood at this time. Moreover, it is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data processing and privacy practices. Complying with these various laws and regulations may cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business.\nBecause the interpretation and application of many privacy and data protection laws along with contractually imposed industry standards are uncertain, it is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our existing data management practices or the features of our services and platform capabilities. If so, in addition to the possibility of fines, lawsuits, regulatory investigations, imprisonment of company officials and public censure, other claims and penalties, significant costs for remediation and damage to our reputation, we could be required to fundamentally change our business activities and practices or modify our services and platform capabilities and/or implement additional organizational and technical measures, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business.\nAny failure by us, our suppliers or other parties with whom we do business to comply with our contractual commitments or policies or with federal, state, local or international regulations could result in proceedings against us by governmental, regulatory and supervisory authorities or others. In many jurisdictions (especially the European Union (\"EU\")), enforcement actions and consequences for noncompliance are rising. In the U.S., these include enforcement actions in response to rules and regulations promulgated under the authority of federal agencies, state attorneys general and legislatures and consumer protection agencies. In addition, security advocates and industry groups have regularly proposed, and may propose in the future, self-regulatory standards with which we must legally comply or that contractually apply to us. If we fail to follow these security standards even if no personal information is compromised, we may incur significant fines or experience a significant increase in costs.\nInternationally, most jurisdictions in which we operate have established or strengthened their own data security and privacy legal framework with which we and our customers must comply, including but not limited to the EU, the U.K. and Switzerland. The EU and U.K. data protection landscape changed significantly in 2018, resulting in significant operational costs for internal compliance and risk to our business. The EU adopted the General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d), which went into effect in May 2018, and together with national legislation, regulations and guidelines of the EU, U.K. and Switzerland, ushered in a new and complex data protection regime including principles, rights and obligations with extraterritorial reach of the EU, U.K. and Swiss data protection authorities. The European data protection and security laws, including GDPR, provide for extensive data subject rights, robust obligations on data controllers and processors and additional requirements on businesses to put in place data protection and security compliance programs, systems and processes. Continued evolvement of, and varied implementation and interpretation of such European data protection and security laws has increased, and continues to extend, our obligations and potential liability for failing to meet these requirements and our obligations under such laws. Among other requirements, the GDPR (and its U.K. equivalent commonly referred to as the \u201cU.K. GDPR\u201d) regulates transfers of personal data (subject to such laws) from the European Economic Area (\u201cEEA\u201d) and the U.K. to the U.S. as well as other countries outside the EEA and the U.K. which are deemed not to provide adequate standards of data protection to the levels required by GDPR. The recent European Court of Justice judgement in July 2020 which nullified the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield, its critical remarks about lack of data protection safeguards for non-US nationals, and subsequent and consequent measures taken by European data protection regulators in response to this judgement, has increased uncertainty in respect of data transfers from the EEA, U.K. and Switzerland to the U.S., creating serious challenges, uncertainties and increased costs for businesses such as ours. The GDPR and U.K. GDPR also impose numerous privacy-related obligations and requirements for companies operating in the EU and the U.K. including requiring data controllers not to transfer personal data to U.S.-based processors unless they agree to certain legally binding processing obligations, greater control for data subjects (for example, the \u201cright to be forgotten\u201d), increased data portability for EU and U.K. consumers, data breach notification requirements and exposure to substantial fines for non-compliance. Under the GDPR and U.K. GDPR, fines of up to 20 million euros or 4% of the annual global revenue of the non-compliant company, whichever is greater, could be imposed for violations of certain of the GDPR\u2019s and U.K. GDPR\u2019s requirements. Such penalties are in addition to any civil litigation claims by customers and data subjects. The frequency and quantum of fines imposed by EU and U.K. data protection regulators under GDPR and U.K. GDPR has been increasing since 2019. The GDPR and U.K. GDPR requirements apply not only to third-party transactions, but also to transfers of information between us and our subsidiaries and affiliates, including employee personal data.\nOn January 31, 2020, the U.K. ceased to be a member of the EU, an event generally referred to as \u201cBrexit\u201d. Following the end of the transition period on December 31, 2020, the U.K. left the EU Single Market and Customs Union, and is no longer subject to EU law or a party to the EU\u2019s trade agreements. Effective from January 1, 2021, the free movement of persons, goods, services and capital between the U.K. and the EU, as it existed before December 31, 2020, ended and the EU and the U.K. now form two separate markets; two distinct regulatory and legal spaces. This will create barriers to trade in goods, services and to cross-border mobility and exchanges (including data) that did not exist prior to December 31, 2020.\nEven though the U.K. reached an agreement with the EU on the terms of their future cooperation, as reflected in the EU-U.K. Trade and Cooperation Agreement (\"TCA\") and related documents, and the U.K. government has sought to reproduce the effects of the EU trading agreements and EU laws (including the implementation of U.K. GDPR) that previously applied to it, material changes took effect from January 1, 2021. It is unclear how the TCA will actually be implemented, how it will affect the nature of the U.K.\u2019s relationship with the EU and how it will impact our business. It is also unclear how the U.K.\u2019s new arrangements with other countries will actually be implemented and the coverage of those agreements. The effects of this uncertainty will continue to impact the political and economic environment in the U.K. and across other EU member states, and may impair our ability to transact business. This uncertainty could also continue to affect the U.K., the EU and worldwide economic or market conditions and contribute to instability in global financial markets, and the value of the pound sterling or other currencies, including the Euro.\nAdditionally, now that the U.K. and EU regulatory and legal spaces are distinct and separate, the regulatory frameworks of the U.K. and the EU may subsequently change and potentially divergent laws and regulations may develop, including those relating to data protection and security. This may have adverse practical and/or operational implications for our business that involves data processing and cross-border data transfers, including the potential disruption to data transfers, additional compliance and operational costs and necessary operational changes.\nAlthough the current arrangements between the EU and U.K. permit flow of data between these two regions for a period of up to 6 months from January 1, 2021, the European Commission has not yet made any determination as to whether U.K. is a safe country for personal data transfer. Even if such finding is made, with the U.K. not required to follow EU laws, there is an increased risk of divergence in data protection and security laws (and related guidance) between the U.K. and the EU, with the possibility of EU restricting data flows to the U.K. and vice versa. This has the potential to cause disruption to data transfers and our operations and result in additional compliance and operational costs.\nNon-compliance with relevant data privacy laws, directives and regulations, such as the GDPR and U.K. GDPR, could result in proceedings against us by governmental regulatory and supervisory authorities, customers, suppliers, data subjects and others. We may also experience difficulty retaining or obtaining new European or multi-national customers due to the legal requirements, concerns about U.S. data protection safeguards for non-U.S. nationals, compliance cost, potential risk exposure and uncertainty for these entities and businesses, and we may experience significantly increased liability with respect to these customers pursuant to the terms set forth in our engagements with them.\nU.S. federal and state laws in this area are also complex and developing rapidly. Many state legislatures have adopted legislation that regulates how businesses operate online, including measures relating to privacy, data security and data breaches, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Federal Trade Commission, have adopted, or are considering adopting, laws and regulations concerning personal information and data security. In addition, laws in all 50 states require businesses to provide notice to customers whose personally identifiable information has been disclosed as a result of a data breach. The laws are not consistent, and compliance in the event of a widespread data breach is costly. States are also constantly amending existing laws, requiring attention to frequently changing regulatory requirements. Further, California recently enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, which took effect on January 1, 2020 and imposes obligations on companies that process personal information of California residents. The CCPA was amended prior to going into effect, and it is possible that further amendments will be enacted, but even in its current form it remains unclear how various provisions of the CCPA will be interpreted and enforced. Among other things, the CCPA gives California residents expanded rights to access and delete their personal information, opt out of certain personal information sharing and receive detailed information about how their personal information is used. The CCPA also provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches that is expected to increase data breach litigation. The CCPA may increase our compliance costs and potential liability. Some observers have noted that the CCPA could mark the beginning of a trend toward more stringent privacy legislation in the U.S., which could increase our potential liability and adversely affect our business.\nTelecommunications Regulations\nCurrently, few existing laws or regulations specifically apply to the Internet, other than laws generally applicable to businesses. Many Internet-related laws and regulations, however, are pending and may be adopted in the U.S., in individual states and local jurisdictions and in other countries. These laws may relate to many areas that impact our business, including encryption, network and information security, and the convergence of traditional communication services, such as telephone services, with Internet communications, taxes and wireless networks. These types of regulations could differ between countries and other political and geographic divisions both inside and outside the U.S. Non-U.S. countries and political organizations may impose, or favor, more and different regulation than that which has been proposed in the U.S., thus furthering the complexity of regulation. Certain countries have implemented, or may implement, legislative and technological actions that either do or can effectively regulate access to the Internet, including the ability of Internet Service Providers to limit access to specific websites or content. In addition, state and local governments within the U.S. may impose regulations in addition to, inconsistent with, or stricter than federal regulations. The adoption of such laws or regulations, and uncertainties associated with their validity, interpretation, applicability and enforcement, may affect the available distribution channels for, and the costs associated with, our products and services. The adoption of such laws and regulations may harm our business.\nCorporate Information\nPareteum Corporation, a Delaware corporation, was originally formed in 2001 as Elephant Talk Communications Corp. as a result of a merger between Staruni Corporation (USA, 1962) and Elephant Talk Limited (Hong Kong, 1994).\nFollowing approval at the Company\u2019s 2016 annual stockholders\u2019 meeting, the Company was rebranded and formally renamed \u201cPareteum Corporation.\u201d Since November 12, 2020, prices for the Company\u2019s common stock have been quoted on the OTC Markets Group Inc.\u2019s Pink Open Market under the symbol \"TEUM.\"\nPareteum currently has offices in the U.S., Spain, Indonesia, Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands and India and maintains a minor presence in other locations.\nPareteum\u00ae, the Pareteum logo, the strapline to \u201cConnect Every Person and Every(Thing)\u2122\u201d and other trademarks or service marks of Pareteum, as well as those trademarks or service marks of the Artilium and iPass group companies, which appear in this Annual Report are the property of Pareteum Corporation or its subsidiaries. Trade names, trademarks and service marks of other companies appearing in this Annual Report are the property of their respective holders.\nAcquisitions\nDevicescape Asset Purchase\nOn April 22, 2019, the Company, together with Devicescape Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (the \u201cHoldco\u201d and together with the Company, the \u201cBuyer\u201d), entered into an asset purchase agreement (the \u201cPurchase Agreement\u201d) with Devicescape Software, Inc., a California corporation (\u201cDevicescape\u201d), whereby the Buyer acquired certain assets of Devicescape and assumed certain liabilities of Devicescape, such that Holdco continued as a surviving subsidiary of the Company holding the acquired assets and assuming those certain liabilities of Devicescape (the \u201cDevicescape Purchase\u201d). The Company paid cash consideration of $2.0 million and issued to the stockholders of Devicescape an aggregate of 400,000 shares of the Company\u2019s common stock at a value of $1.7 million based on the Company's closing stock price on April 22, 2019, of $4.23 per share. See Note 2, Acquisitions and Disposition - Devicescape Asset Purchase in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report for additional information.\niPass, Inc. Acquisition\nOn November 12, 2018, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the \u201ciPass Merger Agreement\u201d) by and among the Company, iPass Inc. (\u201ciPass\u201d), and TBR, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (\u201cTBR\u201d). In aggregate, the Company issued 9,865,412 shares of common stock to the iPass stockholders in February 2019. iPass is a leading provider of global mobile connectivity, offering simple, secure, always-on Wi-Fi access on any mobile device. See Note 2, Acquisitions and Disposition - iPass, Inc. Acquisition in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report for additional information.\nFinancial Information About Segments\nThe Company has three operating segments, Legacy Pareteum, Artilium and iPass, which have been aggregated into one reportable segment. Segment information is prepared on the same basis that our chief operating decision-maker (\u201cCODM\u201d) manages segments, evaluates financial results, and makes key operating decisions, and for which discrete financial information is available. The CODM assesses performance of the Company\u2019s major lines of business, MVNO, MVNE, Messaging, and Enterprise (\u201cBusiness Lines\u201d), based on revenue, however the lowest level of discrete financial information, including revenue, cost of sales, gross margin and earnings, is at the primary business units, which represent the Company\u2019s operating segments. The CODM makes resource allocation decisions, primarily regarding the number of employees allocated, based on revenue, gross margin, earnings and cash flows on a consolidated basis. The CODM is not provided and does not use asset information when making operating decisions, assessing performance, or allocating resources. For additional information regarding our reportable segment, see \u201cNote 1, Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Segment Reporting\u201d in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report for additional information.",
    "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nAn investment in our common stock is subject to risks inherent in our business. Before making an investment decision, you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information included in this Annual Report. In addition to the risks and uncertainties described below, other risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. The value or market price of our common stock could decline due to any of these identified or other risks, and you could lose all of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nThe restatement of our previously issued financial statements contained in Amendment No. 1 to our Annual Report for the year ended December 31, 2018 on Form 10-K/A and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, may lead to additional risks and uncertainties, including regulatory, stockholder or other actions, loss of investor confidence and negative impacts on our stock price.\nOn October 21, 2019, our board of directors determined that the Company\u2019s financial statements that were included in its annual report for the year ended December 31, 2018 and quarterly reports for the quarters ended March 31, 2019 and June 30, 2019 (collectively, the \u201cNon-Reliance Periods\u201d) should no longer be relied upon. Similarly, related press releases, earnings releases, and investor communications describing the Company\u2019s financial statements for the Non-Reliance Periods should no longer be relied upon. The Company restated its financial statements for the Non-Reliance Periods in the previously filed amendment to our Annual Report for the year ended December 31, 2018 on Form 10-K/A and the previously filed Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nAs a result of these restatements and associated non-reliance on previously issued financial information, we have become subject to a number of additional costs and risks, including unanticipated costs for accounting and legal fees in connection with or related to the restatement and the remediation of our ineffective disclosure controls and procedures and material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting. Likewise, the attention of our management team has been diverted by these efforts. In addition, we have become subject to, and could also be subject to additional, stockholder, governmental, regulatory, or other actions or demands in connection with the restatement or other matters. Any such proceedings will, regardless of the outcome, consume a significant amount of management\u2019s time and attention and may result in additional legal, accounting, insurance and other costs. If we do not prevail in any such proceedings, we could be required to pay damages or settlement costs. In addition, the restatement and related matters could impair our reputation or could cause our customers, stockholders, or other counterparties to lose confidence in us. Any of these occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price. In connection with the restatement of our financial statements for the Non-Reliance Periods, our management identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, as described in Item 9A, \u201cControls and Procedures\u201d of this report. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies in internal controls over financial reporting that results in a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Further, management determined that control deficiencies existed with respect to certain aspects of our historical financial reporting and, accordingly, management has concluded that management\u2019s reports related to the effectiveness of internal and disclosure controls may not have been correct. As a result, loss of investor confidence and negative impacts on our stock price are possible.\nOur business may be adversely impacted by risks, or the public perception of the risks, related to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe outbreak of COVID-19 and response to control its spread have adversely affected the economies and financial markets of many countries, resulting in a global economic downturn. As a response to the spread of COVID-19 many countries, including the U.S., Great Britain and other jurisdictions in Europe, South America, and the Middle East where we have employees, have taken measures designed to limit the spread of COVID-19, including the closure of workplaces, restricting travel, prohibiting assembling, closing international borders and quarantining populated areas. Governments around the world have required residents to remain in their homes along with limitations on which businesses are allowed to open and the number of workers allowed at each site. Although many of these orders have been partially or fully lifted in certain jurisdictions, the full impact of these indefinite travel restrictions and alternative working arrangements are unknown, may negatively impact the productivity of our employee base, and may have a negative effect on our sales and operations functions, which could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nThe continued spread of COVID-19 has had an adverse impact on the business of some of our customers while other customers in certain industries have seen an increase in customer demand. COVID-19 could still have an adverse impact on our business partners and third-party business partners.\nWhile the full impact of the COVID-19 outbreak is unknown at this time, we are closely monitoring the developments and continually assessing the potential impact on our business. Our business may be adversely affected by the COVID-19 outbreak due to the following risks, any of which may lead to an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations:\n\u2022a number of our employees may be infected and/or subject to quarantine periods and may be unable to perform their duties and our offices may be forced to operate with a reduced workforce and/or be forced to close under the temporary emergency regulations. This may lead to ineffective control over our business and a lower work efficiency, productivity and financial performance;\n\u2022a reduced workforce, lack of international travel, and few face-to-face meetings with customers and potential customers may adversely affect our operations;\n\u2022we may experience difficulties in collecting amounts due from customers, including major customers, due to a downturn in their financial condition; and\n\u2022due to the COVID-19 pandemic, a significant number of our employees have moved to work from their homes and remotely access our IT networks. Such remote working mode creates the risk of attacking the end-point user stations, connection channels and gateways. These potential breaches of our security measures may harm our business.\nHistorically, a significant portion of our sales were conducted in person. Currently, as a result of the work and travel restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic, substantially all of our sales and professional services activities are being conducted remotely. As of the date of this Annual Report, we do not yet know the extent of the negative impact on our ability to attract, serve or retain customers. Furthermore, as a result of uncertainty due to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as general economic uncertainty and associated macroeconomic conditions, existing and potential customers may choose to reduce or delay technology spending in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, or attempt to renegotiate contracts and obtain concessions, which may materially and negatively impact our operating results, financial condition and prospects. This could result in reductions in sales of our platform and services, longer sales cycles, reductions in subscription duration and value, slower adoption of new technologies and increased price competition. Any of these events could harm our business and operating results. In addition, there can be no assurance that cloud-based collaborative work management and productivity spending levels will increase following any recovery, which could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nThe number of companies whose employees are working remotely as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting government-ordered shutdowns has caused use of our platform to increase. If our data centers are unable to keep up with this increased usage, customers may experience delays or interruptions in service, which could result in the loss of customers who use our communications platform because of its reliability and performance, which could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nOur independent auditor\u2019s report contains an explanatory paragraph that expresses a substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm\u2019s report on our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 contains a paragraph expressing substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Based on our current projection of revenue, expenses, capital expenditures and cash flows, we will not have sufficient resources to fund our operations and meet the obligations specified in the documents governing our convertible financing for the next twelve months following the filing of this Annual Report. Our software platforms require ongoing funding to continue the current development and operational plans and we have a history of net losses. We believe that we will continue to expend substantial resources for the foreseeable future in connection with the continued development of our software platforms. These expenditures will include costs associated with research and development activity, corporate administration, business development, and marketing and selling of our services. In addition, other unanticipated costs may arise. As a result, we believe that additional capital will be required to fund our operations. To access capital to fund operations and provide growth capital to meet the obligations under our outstanding convertible note, we may need to restructure our convertible indebtedness and raise capital in one or more debt and/or equity offerings. However, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in raising the necessary capital or that any such offering will be available to us on terms acceptable to us, or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital that may be needed on terms acceptable to us, it could have a material adverse effect on the Company. In particular, a decline in the market price of our common stock, coupled with the delisting of our common stock from the Nasdaq Stock Market, could make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem appropriate.\nThe current economic climate, especially in Europe, may have an adverse effect in the markets in which we operate.\nMuch of our customers\u2019 business is consumer driven, and to the extent there is a decline in consumer spending, our customers could experience a reduction in the demand for their services and consequently affect the demand for our services and a decrease in our revenue, net income and an increase in bad debts arising from non-payment of our trade receivables. The potential adverse effects of an economic downturn include:\n\u2022reduced demand for services, resulting in increased price competition or deferrals of purchases, with lower revenue not fully compensated through reduced costs;\n\u2022risk of financial difficulties or failures among our suppliers;\n\u2022increased demand for customer finance, difficulties in collection of accounts receivable and increased risk of counterparty default;\n\u2022risk of impairment losses related to our intangible assets as a result of lower forecasted sales of certain products;\n\u2022increased difficulties in forecasting sales and financial results as well as increased volatility in our reported results; and\n\u2022end-user demand could also be adversely affected by reduced consumer spending on technology, changed operator pricing, security breaches and trust issues.\nUncertainties and risks associated with international markets could adversely impact our international operations.\nWe have significant international operations in Europe, and to a lesser extent in the U.S., Middle East and elsewhere. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain the permits and operating licenses required for us to operate, obtain access to local transmission facilities on economically acceptable terms, or market services in international markets. In addition, operating in international markets generally involves additional risks, including unexpected changes in regulatory requirements, taxes, tariffs, customs, duties and other trade barriers, difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations, problems in collecting accounts receivable, political risks, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, restrictions associated with the repatriation of funds, technology export and import restrictions, and seasonal reductions in business activity. Our ability to operate and grow our international operations successfully could be adversely impacted by these risks.\nWe operate in a complex regulatory environment, and failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could adversely affect our business.\nOur operations are subject to a broad range of complex and evolving laws and regulations. Because of our coverage in many countries, we must perform our services in compliance with the legal and regulatory requirements of multiple jurisdictions. Some of these laws and regulations may be difficult to ascertain or interpret and may change from time to time. Violation of such laws and regulations could subject us to fines and penalties, damage our reputation, constitute a breach of our client agreements, impair our ability to obtain and renew required licenses, and decrease our profitability or competitiveness. If any of these effects were to occur, our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected. Additionally, to serve our international markets, we maintain business entities in various jurisdictions around the world. Accordingly, we must maintain and operate these business entities in compliance with the applicable corporate, tax, employment and other laws of\nthese various jurisdictions, which adds complexity to our operations. Our failure to maintain compliance with such laws and regulations could give rise to liabilities that could materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may not be able to integrate new technologies and provide new services in a cost-efficient manner.\nThe telecommunications industry is subject to rapid and significant changes in technology, frequent new service introductions and evolving industry standards. We cannot predict the effect of these changes on our competitive position, our profitability or the industry in general. Technological developments may reduce the competitiveness of our networks and our software solutions and require additional capital expenditures or the procurement of additional products that could be expensive and time consuming. In addition, new products and services arising out of technological developments may reduce the attractiveness of our services. If we fail to adapt successfully to technological advances or fail to obtain access to new technologies, we could lose customers and be limited in our ability to attract new customers and/or sell new services to our existing customers. In addition, delivery of new services in a cost-efficient manner depends upon many factors, and we may not generate anticipated revenue from such services.\nWe may not be able to develop and successfully market our mobile telecommunications platform and services as planned.\nPareteum operates in an exceptionally competitive environment where there is continuous innovation and new development. We are required to be a top performer in over a dozen highly specialized domains to effectively compete with our competitors. Ongoing investments are required to stay ahead of the competition. The sales process for our platform and the deployment process may be complicated and very slow. We are highly dependent on convincing mobile network operators and mobile virtual network operators to believe that outsourcing their requirements to us is the best way to go. We are exposed to business risks associated with turnkey projects and the scalability of our service and support organization. Although our policy is to avoid or minimize risks, it cannot be ruled out that in certain cases events occur that may seriously impact us and our performance.\nImplementation and development of our software platform business depends on our ability to obtain adequate funding.\nOur software platforms require ongoing funding to continue our current development and operational plans and we have a history of net losses. We believe that we will continue to expend substantial resources for the foreseeable future in connection with the continued development of our software platforms. These expenditures will include costs associated with research and development activity, corporate administration, business development, and marketing and selling of our services. In addition, other unanticipated costs may arise. When our available cash and cash equivalents become insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements, or if and when we identify additional opportunities to do so, we will likely seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain additional credit facilities.\nFailure to obtain such adequate financing could substantially delay our development, slow down current operations, result in loss of customers and adversely impact our results of operations. Additionally, the funds we need may not be available when we need them, on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. In particular, a decline in the market price of our common stock, coupled with the delisting of our common stock from the Nasdaq Stock Market, could make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem appropriate.\nDisruptions in our networks and infrastructure may result in customer dissatisfaction, customer loss or both, which could materially and adversely affect our reputation and business.\nOur systems are an integral part of our customers\u2019 business operations. It is critical for our customers that our systems provide a continued and uninterrupted performance. Customers may be dissatisfied by any system failure that interrupts our ability to provide services to them. Sustained or repeated system failures would reduce the attractiveness of our services significantly and could result in decreased demand for our services.\nWe face the following risks to our networks, infrastructure and software applications:\n\u2022significant weather events can physically damage access lines;\n\u2022power surges and outages, computer viruses or hacking, earthquakes, terrorism attacks, vandalism and software or hardware defects which are beyond our control; and\n\u2022unusual spikes in demand or capacity limitations in our or our suppliers\u2019 networks.\nDisruptions may cause interruptions in service or reduced capacity for customers, either of which could cause us to lose customers and/or incur expenses, and thereby adversely affect our business, revenue and cash flow.\nCybersecurity breaches and other disruptions could adversely affect our business, and could compromise our information and expose us to liability and reputational harm.\nThe size and complexity of our information systems make such systems potentially vulnerable to service interruptions or to security breaches from inadvertent or intentional actions by our employees or vendors, or from attacks by malicious third parties. Such attacks are of ever-increasing levels of sophistication and are made by groups and individuals with a wide range of motives and expertise. While we have invested in the protection of data and information technology, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent or quickly identify service interruptions or security breaches. Any such interruption or breach of our systems could adversely affect our business operations and/or result in the loss of critical or sensitive confidential information or intellectual property, and could result in financial, legal, business and reputational harm to us. Similarly, we could be subject to liability or our reputation could be harmed if technologies integrated into our products fail to prevent cyberattacks, or if our customers fail to safeguard the systems with security policies that conform to industry best practices. In addition, any cyberattack or security breach that affects a competitor\u2019s product could lead to the negative perception that our products are similarly vulnerable to attacks or breaches.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property and proprietary and/or personally identifiable information of customers, partners, employees, and other third parties. The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations. Despite our security measures and precautions, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. Any hack or breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any unauthorized access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, disrupt our operations, lead to reputational harm or loss of confidence in our products and services, all of which could adversely affect our business.\nIntegration of acquisitions ultimately may not provide the benefits originally anticipated by management and may distract the attention of our personnel from the operation of our business.\nWe strive to broaden our solutions offerings as well as to increase the number of subscribers hosted on our platforms, volume of voice and data that we carry over our existing global network in order to reduce transmission costs and other operating costs as a percentage of net revenue, improve margins, improve service quality and enhance our ability to introduce new products and services. Strategic acquisitions in desired markets play a part of our growth strategy, and we may pursue additional acquisitions in the future to further strengthen our strategic objectives. Acquisitions of businesses and customer lists involve operational risks, including the possibility that an acquisition may not ultimately provide the benefits originally anticipated by management. Moreover, we may not be successful in identifying attractive acquisition candidates, completing and financing additional acquisitions on favorable terms, or integrating the acquired business or assets into our own. There may be difficulty in integrating technologies and solutions, in migrating customer bases and in integrating the service offerings, distribution channels and networks gained through acquisitions with our own. For example, our recent acquisitions have led to the unexpected addition of a significant amount of aged accounts payable to our balance sheet. Successful integration of operations and technologies requires the dedication of management and other personnel, which may distract their attention from the day-to-day business, the development or acquisition of new technologies, and the pursuit of other business acquisition opportunities. Therefore, successful integration may not occur in light of these factors.\nOur revenue, earnings and profitability are affected by the length of our sales cycle, and a longer sales cycle could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business is directly affected by the length of our sales cycle and strategic mobile partnership cycles with mobile network operators and other large enterprises. Our software platforms, outsourced solutions and value-added communication services are relatively complex and their purchase may involve a significant commitment of mostly human capital, with attendant delays frequently associated with the allocation of substantial human resources and procurement procedures within an organization. The purchase of these types of products typically also requires coordination and agreement across many departments within a potential customer. Delays associated with such timing factors could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In periods of economic slowdown in the communications industry, which may recur in the current economic climate, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the government shutdown orders that have been implemented in many jurisdictions around the world in an effort to slow the spread of the pandemic, our typical sales cycle may lengthen, which means that the average time between our initial contact with a prospective customer and the signing of a sales contract increases. The lengthening of our sales and strategic mobile partnership cycle could reduce growth in\nour revenue in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nBecause most of our business is conducted outside the U.S., fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates versus the U.S. Dollar could adversely affect our results of operations.\nCurrently most of our net revenue, expenses, and capital expenditures are derived and incurred from sales and operations outside the U.S., whereas the reporting currency for our consolidated financial statements is the U.S. Dollar (\u201cUSD\u201d). The local currency of each country is the functional currency for each of our respective entities operating in that country, making the Euro the predominant currency in which our business is conducted. Considering the fact that most income and expenses are not subject to relevant exchange rate differences, it is only at a reporting level that the translation needs to be made to the reporting unit of USD. In the future, we expect to continue to derive a significant portion of our net revenue and incur a significant portion of our operating costs outside the U.S., and changes in exchange rates have had and may continue to have a significant, and potentially distorting effect (either negative or positive) on the reported results of operations, not necessarily being the result of operations in real terms. Our primary risk of loss regarding foreign currency exchange rate risk is caused by fluctuations in the USD/Euro exchange rates.\nWe historically have not engaged in hedging transactions since we primarily operate in same-currency countries, currently being the Euro (\u201cEUR\u201d). However, the operations of affiliates and subsidiaries in non-US countries have been funded with investments and other advances denominated in foreign currencies and more recently in USD. Historically, such investments and advances have been long-term in nature, and we have accounted for any adjustments resulting from currency translation as a charge or credit to Accumulated other comprehensive loss within the Stockholders\u2019 Deficit section of our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Although we have not engaged in hedging in the past, we continue to assess on a regular basis the possible need for hedging.\nWe are substantially smaller than our major competitors, whose marketing and pricing decisions, and relative size advantage, could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain customers and are likely to continue to cause significant pricing pressures that could adversely affect our net revenue, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur services related to cloud-based communications software and information systems, outsourced solutions, and value-added communication services are subject to competitive pressure, and we expect competition to continue to increase. We compete with telecom solution providers, independent software and service providers, and the in-house IT and network departments of communications companies as well as firms that provide IT services (including consulting, systems integration and managed services), software vendors that sell products for particular aspects of a total information system, software vendors that specialize in systems for particular communications services (such as Internet, land-line and mobile services, cable, satellite and service bureaus) and companies that offer software systems in combination with the sale of network equipment. Also, in this more fragmented market, larger players exist with associated advantages described earlier with which we need to compete against.\nWe believe that our ability to compete depends on several factors, including:\n\u2022the development by others of software products that are competitive with our products and services;\n\u2022the price at which others offer competitive software and services;\n\u2022the ability to make use of the networks of mobile network operators;\n\u2022the technological changes of telecommunication operators affecting our ability to run services over their networks;\n\u2022the ability of competitors to deliver projects at a level of quality that rivals our own;\n\u2022the responsiveness of our competitors to customer needs; and\n\u2022the ability of our competitors to hire, retain and motivate key personnel.\nA number of our competitors have long operating histories, large customer bases, substantial financial, technical, sales, marketing and other resources, and strong name recognition. Current and potential competitors have established, and may establish in the future, cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties. Many of our competitors are also able to offer service at lower prices than we are, forcing us to match their prices in response. This negatively affects our gross margins and financial results of operations. If we fail to effectively compete, we may experience lower revenue and/or net income, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur positioning in the marketplace as a smaller provider places a significant strain on our resources, and if not managed effectively, could result in operational inefficiencies and other difficulties.\nOur positioning in the marketplace may place a significant strain on our management, operational and financial resources, and increase demand on our systems and controls. To manage this position effectively, we must continue to implement and improve our operational and financial systems and controls, invest in development and engineering, critical systems and network infrastructure to maintain or improve our service quality levels, purchase and utilize other systems and solutions, and train and manage our employee base. As we proceed with our development, operational difficulties could arise from additional demand placed on customer provisioning and support, billing and management information systems, product delivery and fulfillment, sales and marketing and administrative resources.\nFor instance, we may encounter delays or cost overruns or suffer other adverse consequences in implementing new systems when required. In addition, our operating and financial control systems and infrastructure could be inadequate to ensure timely and accurate financial reporting, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWe need to grow our business and revenue in order to achieve profitability.\nWe need to expand our network to maintain and grow our business and revenue. If we fail to expand and maintain an effective sales force or successfully develop our relationships with new customers, our business, prospects and brand may be materially and adversely affected. We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully grow our client base or expand the number of services provided to them. If we fail to do so, our sales could fail to grow or could decline, and our ability to grow our business could be adversely affected, which could prevent our revenue from covering our fixed costs and deny the Company operating leverage, delaying the date at which we achieve profitability. Accordingly, if we do not grow our revenue and business, we will not achieve profitability in the near term, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and the trading price of our common stock.\nWe could suffer adverse tax and other financial consequences if U.S. or foreign taxing authorities do not agree with our interpretation of applicable tax laws.\nOur corporate structure is based, in part, on assumptions about the various tax laws, including withholding tax, and other relevant laws of applicable non-U.S. jurisdictions. Foreign taxing authorities may not agree with our interpretations or reach different conclusions. Our interpretations are not binding on any taxing authority and, if these foreign jurisdictions were to change or to modify the relevant laws, we could suffer adverse tax and other financial consequences or have the anticipated benefits of our corporate structure materially impaired. This could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur management has identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, that, if not remediated, or if we identify additional material weaknesses or other adverse findings in the future, may not allow us to be able to report our financial condition or results of operations accurately or timely, which may result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports, significant expenses to remediate any internal control deficiencies, and ultimately have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\nPursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, our management is required to report on, and our independent registered public accounting firm is required to attest to, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. As disclosed in Part II, Item 9A, \"Controls and Procedures,\" of this Annual Report, our management identified material weaknesses in internal controls related to:\n\u2022Not applying appropriate foreign currency translations during prior years impacting the account valuation of Property, Plant & Equipment;\n\u2022Complying to identify and account for operating leases in accordance with ASC 842; and\n\u2022Proper capitalization of software identified during review of projects.\n\u2022Entity-level controls were not effective due to certain executive management \u201ctone at the top\u201d issues which contributed to an ineffective control environment and to deficiencies aggregating to material weaknesses;\n\u2022Inadequate and ineffective management assessment of internal control over financial reporting due to unremediated design weakness;\n\u2022Ineffective design, implementation and monitoring of information technology general controls pertaining to the Company\u2019s change management and security processes;\n\u2022The Company not having sufficient finance and information technology department resources to effectively assess risk and design, operate and oversee effective internal controls over financial reporting while maintaining proper segregation of duties, which contributed to the failure in the effectiveness and adequate identification of certain controls including:\n\u25e6Inadequate retention of key documentation evidencing execution of internal controls;\n\u25e6Improper and untimely recognition of revenue for prior year end and interim periods for certain customers in accordance with ASC 606, leading to the 2018 Restatement (as defined below) and 2019 interim period restatements; and\n\u25e6Incorrect accounting of stock-based compensation for awards granted to employees and non-employees, and of extinguishment of preferred stock.\nAs a result, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2020. As described in Part II, Item 9A, \"Controls and Procedures,\" of this Annual Report, we are implementing remedial measures that we believe will effectively remedy the material weakness. If we are unable to remediate the material weakness timely and sufficiently, or are otherwise unable to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting, we could suffer future material misstatements in our financial statements and fail to meet our reporting obligations, which would likely cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information. This could harm our operating results and lead to a decline in our stock price. Additionally, ineffective internal control over financial reporting could expose us to increased risk of fraud or misuse of corporate assets and subject regulatory investigations, civil or criminal sanctions and class action litigation.\nWe must attract and retain skilled personnel. If we are unable to hire and retain technical, technical sales and operational employees, our business could be harmed.\nOur ability to manage our growth will be particularly dependent on our ability to develop and retain an effective sales force and qualified technical and managerial personnel. We need software development specialists with in-depth knowledge of a blend of IT and telecommunications or with a blend of security and telecommunications. We intend to hire additional necessary employees, including software engineers, communication engineers, project managers, sales consultants, employees and operational employees, on a permanent basis. The competition for qualified technical sales, technical, and managerial personnel in the communications and software industry is intense in the markets where we operate, and we may not be able to hire and retain sufficient qualified personnel. In addition, we may not be able to maintain the quality of our operations, control our costs, maintain compliance with all applicable regulations, and expand our internal management, technical, information and accounting systems in order to support our desired growth, which could have an adverse impact on our operations. Volatility in the stock market and other factors could diminish our use, and the value, of our equity awards as incentives to employees, putting us at a competitive disadvantage or forcing us to use more cash compensation. Accordingly, our failure to attract and retain skilled personnel may materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf we are not able to use and protect our intellectual property domestically and internationally, it could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur ability to compete depends, in part, on our ability to use intellectual property internationally. We rely on a combination of patents, copyright, trade secrets and confidentiality, trademarks and licenses to protect our intellectual property. There is limited protection under patent law to protect the source codes we developed or acquired on our platform. The copyright and know-how protection on which we rely may not be sufficient. Our granted patents and pending patent applications may be challenged. We are also subject to the risks of claims and litigation alleging infringement of the intellectual property rights of others. The telecommunications industry is subject to frequent litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. We rely upon certain technology, including hardware and software, licensed from third parties. The technology licensed by us may not continue to provide competitive features and functionality. Licenses for technology currently used by us or other technology that we may seek to license in the future may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all, which could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe depend on several significant customers for a substantial portion of our business and the loss of one or more of these customers could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020, we had two customers that each individually accounted for 21% and 20% of revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company had one customer that accounted for 20% of revenue. Although\nno other customer accounted for greater than 10% of revenue during these periods, other customers may account for more than 10% of revenue in future periods. In addition, the concentration of customers in the industries in which we operate may impact our overall exposure to credit risk, either positively or negatively, in that customers may be similarly affected by changes in economic and industry conditions.\nOur success depends on our continued investment in research and development, the level and effectiveness of which could reduce our profitability.\nWe intend to continue to make investments in research and development and product development in seeking to sustain and improve our competitive position and meet our customers\u2019 needs. These investments currently include streamlining our suite of software functionalities, including modularization and improving scalability of our integrated solutions. To maintain our competitive position, we may need to increase our research and development investment, which could reduce our profitability and cash flows, thereby causing a material and adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we cannot assure you that we will achieve a return on these investments, nor can we assure you that these investments will improve our competitive position or meet our customers\u2019 needs.\nProduct defects or software errors could adversely affect our business.\nDesign defects or software errors may cause delays in product introductions and project implementations, damage customer satisfaction and may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our software systems are highly complex and may, from time to time, contain design defects or software errors that may be difficult to detect and correct. Because our products are generally used by our customers to perform critical business functions, design defects, software errors, misuse of our products, incorrect data from external sources, or other potential problems within or outside of our control may arise during implementation or from the use of our products and may result in financial or other damages to our customers, for which we may be held responsible. Although we have license agreements with our customers that contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential claims and liabilities arising from customer problems, these provisions may not effectively protect us against such claims in all cases and in all jurisdictions. Our insurance coverage is not sufficient to protect against all possible liability for defects or software errors. In addition, as a result of business and other considerations, we may undertake to compensate our customers for damages caused to them arising from the use of our products, even if our liability is limited by a license or other agreement. Claims and liabilities arising from customer problems could also damage our reputation, adversely affecting our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nPolitical risks, including changes to U.S. tariff and import/export regulations may have a negative effect on our business.\nThere have been recent changes to U.S. trade policies, treaties and tariffs, including determinations made by the U.S. to reinstate or impose new sanctions levied by the U.S. Department of the Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control against certain nation states. The Company or its subsidiaries may engage in business with entities located in certain regions which may be impacted, directly or indirectly by such changes. If the Company is precluded as a result of changes to sanctions laws from doing business in certain jurisdictions or with certain entities, the loss of any related revenue could impact our business, results of operations and/or financial condition.\nWe, and certain of our directors and current and former officers, have been named as parties to various lawsuits and those lawsuits could adversely affect us, require significant management time and attention, result in significant legal expenses or damages, and cause our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows to suffer.\nA number of lawsuits have been filed against us, including securities class action complaints. If these matters cannot be resolved expeditiously, management\u2019s attention may be diverted to this matter and there can be no assurance that the litigation would be settled. If the current litigation proceeds or if additional claims are filed, the legal and other costs associated with the defense of these actions and their ultimate outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. While we expect insurance to cover many of the costs associated with defending such litigation, insurance coverage may be insufficient and could require a diversion of our resources. There also may be adverse publicity associated with litigation that could negatively affect customer perception of our business, regardless of whether the allegations are valid or whether we are ultimately found liable.\nAlthough we have directors and officers liability insurance, such insurance may be insufficient to cover the liabilities incurred under all claims and any claims against us may result in our incurring substantial costs and a diversion of resources.\nAlthough we have directors and officers liability insurance, the coverage under such policies may be insufficient to cover any claim, including the claims pending against us and certain of our directors and officers resulting from the restatement of our financial statements (see Item 3. \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d). Because we also have obligations to indemnify our current and former officers and directors under our governing documents, liabilities in excess of the limits of our insurance policies that may be imposed in connection with actions against certain of the Company\u2019s past and present directors and officers and certain current and former employees who are entitled to indemnification will be funded by the Company with its existing cash resources. Such expenses could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRisks Related to Our Industry\nChanges in the regulation of the telecommunications industry could adversely affect our business, revenue or cash flow.\nWe operate in a heavily regulated industry. As a provider of communications technology, we are directly and indirectly subject to varying degrees of regulation in each of the jurisdictions in which we provide our services. Local laws and regulations, and the interpretation of such laws and regulations, differ significantly among the jurisdictions in which we operate. Enforcement and interpretations of these laws and regulations can be unpredictable and are often subject to the informal views of government officials. Certain European, foreign, U.S. federal, and state regulations and local franchise requirements have been, are currently, and may in the future be, the subject of judicial proceedings, legislative hearings and administrative proposals. Such proceedings may relate to, among other things, the rates we may charge for our local, network access and other services, the manner in which we offer and bundle our services, the terms and conditions of interconnection, unbundled network elements and resale rates, and could change the manner in which telecommunications companies operate. We cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings or the impact they will have on our business, revenue and cash flow.\nThere can be no assurance that future regulatory changes will not have a material adverse effect on us, or that regulators or third parties will not raise material issues regarding our compliance or noncompliance with applicable regulations, any of which could have a material adverse effect upon us. Potential future regulatory, judicial, legislative, and government policy changes in jurisdictions where we operate could have a material adverse effect on us. Domestic or international regulators or third parties may raise material issues regarding our compliance or noncompliance with applicable regulations, and therefore may have a material adverse impact on our competitive position, growth and financial performance.\nThe telecommunications industry is rapidly changing, and if we are not able to adjust our strategy and resources effectively in the future to meet changing market conditions, we may not be able to compete effectively.\nThe telecommunications industry is changing rapidly due to deregulation, privatization, consolidation, technological improvements, availability of alternative services such as mobile, broadband, DSL, Internet, VoIP, and wireless DSL through use of the fixed wireless spectrum, and the globalization of the world\u2019s economies. In addition, alternative services to traditional land-line services, such as mobile, broadband, Internet and VoIP services, have shown a competitive threat to our legacy land-line traffic business. If we do not continue to invest and exploit the contemplated plan of development of our communications information systems, outsourced solutions and value-added communication services to meet changing market conditions, or if we do not have adequate resources, we may not be able to compete effectively in providing technology solutions to our customers. The telecommunications industry is marked by the introduction of new product and service offerings and technological improvements. Achieving successful financial results will depend on our ability to anticipate, assess and adapt to rapid technological changes, and offer, on a timely and cost-effective basis, services including the bundling of multiple services into our technology platforms that meet evolving industry standards. If we do not anticipate, assess or adapt to such technological changes at a competitive price, maintain competitive services or obtain new technologies on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms, our financial results may be materially and adversely affected.\nIf we are not able to operate a cost-effective network, we may not be able to grow our business successfully.\nOur long-term success depends on our ability to design, implement, operate, manage, and maintain a reliable and cost-effective network. In addition, we rely on third parties to enable us to expand and manage our global network and to provide local, broadband Internet and mobile services. If we are unable to grow and operate a cost-effective network for our customers, our business may fail to grow or decline, which would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Capital Stock\nCovenant restrictions in our debt instruments may limit our flexibility to operate and grow our business, and if we are not able to comply with such covenants, our lenders could accelerate our indebtedness, proceed against certain collateral or exercise other remedies, which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nOn June 8, 2020, we closed the issuance of $17.5 million aggregate principal amount of our Senior Secured Convertible Notes due 2025 (the \u201cHigh Trail Note\u201d) under the terms of a securities purchase agreement, also dated as of June 8, 2020 (together with the High Trail Note, the \u201cNote Facility\u201d). The covenants in the Note Facility documents contain a number of provisions that impose operating and financial restrictions which, subject to certain exceptions, limit our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to, among other things: incur additional indebtedness, pay dividends or make distributions or redeem or repurchase our securities, make certain investments, grant liens on assets, sell or dispose of any material assets; and acquire the assets of, or merge or consolidate with, other companies. Additionally, the Note Facility documents contain affirmative covenants that require to us take, and have taken by certain dates, specific actions, some of which have not been satisfied by the dates required, including (i) us filing our restated Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 with the SEC on or prior to October 31, 2020, (ii) after October 31, 2020, our timely filing subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q with the SEC and (iii) us maintaining the listing of our common stock on the Nasdaq Stock Market. As a result, on December 1, 2020, we entered into a forbearance agreement with the holder of the High Trail Note under which we admitted that we were in default of several obligations and such holder acknowledged such defaults and agreed not to exercise any right or remedy under the Note Facility documents, including its right to accelerate the aggregate amount outstanding under the High Trail Note, until the earlier of December 31, 2020 (subsequently extended to March 31, 2021), the date of any new event of default or the initiation of any action by the Company to invalidate any of the representations and warranties made in such forbearance agreement. On May 24, 2021, the Company entered into a new forbearance agreement with the holder of the High Trail Note under which (i) the Company again admitted it was in default under several obligations under the High Trail Note and related agreements, (ii) the holder acknowledged such defaults and agreed not to exercise any right or remedy under the High Trail Note or the related securities purchase agreement, warrant or security documents, including its right to accelerate the aggregate amount outstanding under the High Trail Note, until the earlier of May 31, 2020 or any later date to which such date may be extended (the \u201cOutside Date\u201d), and the date of any new event of default or initiation of any action by the Company to invalidate any of the representations and warranties made in this new forbearance agreement. The Outside Date automatically extends for successive two-week periods unless on or before the then-applicable Outside Date the lender provides notice that the Outside Date is not being extended.\nComplying with these covenants, as well as those that may be contained in any future debt agreements, may limit our ability to finance our future operations or working capital needs or to take advantage of future business opportunities. Our ability to comply with these covenants will depend on our future performance, which may be affected by events beyond our control. If we do not maintain and regain compliance with our continuing obligations or any covenants, terms and conditions of the Note Facility, after the expiration of the forbearance agreement, we could be in default and required to repay outstanding borrowings on an accelerated basis, which could subject us to decreased liquidity and other negative impacts on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In the case of an event of default, we may not have sufficient funds available to make the required payments under the Note Facility. If we are unable to repay amounts owed under the terms of our Note Facility, the lenders thereunder may choose to exercise their remedies in respect to the collateral, including a foreclosure of their lien which may result in a sale of certain of our assets to satisfy our obligations under the Note Facility.\nWe could issue additional common stock, which might dilute the book value of our capital stock.\nOur Board of Directors has authority, without action or vote of our stockholders, to issue all or a part of our authorized but unissued shares of common stock. Any such stock issuance could be made at a price that reflects a discount or a premium to the then-current trading price of our common stock. In addition, in order to raise future capital, we may need to issue securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for a significant amount of our common stock. These issuances, if any, would dilute your percentage ownership interest in the Company, thereby having the effect of reducing your influence on matters on which stockholders vote. You may incur additional dilution if holders of stock options, whether currently outstanding or subsequently granted, exercise their options, or if warrant holders exercise their warrants to purchase shares of our common stock. As a result, any such issuances or exercises would dilute your interest in the Company and the per share book value of the common stock that you owned, either of which could negatively affect the trading price of our common stock and the value of your investment.\nShares eligible for future sale may adversely affect the market for our common stock.\nAs of December 31, 2020, there are (i) 6,704,803 shares of common stock that may be issued upon the exercise of outstanding options, 37,298,850 shares of common stock that may be issued upon the exercise of outstanding warrants and 29,166,667 shares of common stock that may be issued upon the conversion of outstanding convertible indebtedness. Options are exercisable at exercise prices between $0.36 and $62.50 and the warrants are exercisable at exercise prices between $0.37 and $5.38. Accrued interest owed on the High Trail Note may also be paid in the form of shares of our common stock from time to time. If and when these securities are exercised or converted into shares of our common stock, the number of our shares of common stock outstanding will increase. Such increase in our outstanding shares, and any subsequent sales of such shares, could have a material adverse effect on the market for our common stock and the market price of our common stock.\nIn addition, from time to time, certain of our stockholders may be eligible to sell all or some of their shares of common stock by means of ordinary brokerage transactions in the open market pursuant to Rule 144, promulgated under the Securities Act, subject to certain limitations. In general, pursuant to Rule 144, after satisfying a six month holding period: (i) affiliated stockholders (or stockholders whose shares are aggregated) may, under certain circumstances, sell within any three-month period a number of securities that does not exceed the greater of 1% of the then outstanding shares of common stock or the average weekly trading volume of the class during the four calendar weeks prior to such sale and (ii) non-affiliated stockholders may sell without such limitations, provided that we are current in our public reporting obligations. Rule 144 also permits the sale of securities by non-affiliates that have satisfied a one year holding period without any limitation or restriction. Any substantial sale of our common stock pursuant to Rule 144 or pursuant to any resale prospectus may have a material adverse effect on the market price of our securities.\nOur common stock is quoted on the OTC Markets Group Inc.\u2019s Pink Open Market which may have an unfavorable impact on our stock price and liquidity.\nOn November 10, 2020, The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (\u201cNasdaq\u201d) notified the Company that, because of the Company\u2019s failure to satisfy the conditions to the exception to Nasdaq\u2019s listing standards granted by the Nasdaq Hearings Panel, our common stock would be delisted, and trading of our common stock on Nasdaq\u2019s Capital Market was suspended effective at the open of business on November 12, 2020. After trading of the Company\u2019s common stock was suspended by Nasdaq, prices for our common stock began being quoted on the OTC Markets Group Inc.\u2019s Pink Open Market (the \u201cPink Sheets\u201d). The delisting became effective on February 12, 2021. The Pink Sheets is a significantly more limited market than Nasdaq or the New York Stock Exchange. The quotation of our shares on the Pink Sheets may result in a less liquid market available for existing and potential stockholders to trade shares of our common stock, could depress the trading price of our common stock and could have a long-term adverse impact on our ability to raise capital in the future on favorable terms, or at all.\nBecause our common stock is no longer listed on a registered national securities exchange, we are subject to certain \u201cblue sky\u201d laws of the various states that impose restrictions on our ability to offer and sell our securities. These \u201cblue sky\u201d laws may make it more difficult for us to raise capital or to issue our common stock for equity compensation or other strategic purposes, which could adversely affect our ability to fund our operations or to attract and retain employees.\nIn addition, our common stock may be classified as a \u201cpenny stock\u201d under Rule 3a51-1 under the Exchange Act. \u201cPenny stocks\u201d are subject to Rule 15g-9, which imposes additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers that sell low-priced securities to persons other than established customers and institutional accredited investors. For transactions covered by this rule, a broker-dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchaser and have received the purchaser\u2019s written consent to the transaction prior to sale. Consequently, the rule may affect the ability of broker-dealers to sell our common stock and affect the ability of holders to sell their shares of our common stock in the secondary market. To the extent our common stock is subject to the penny stock regulations, the market liquidity for the shares will be adversely affected and could have a long-term adverse impact on our ability to raise capital in the future on favorable terms, or at all.\nWe have no dividend history and have no intention to pay dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe have never paid dividends on or in connection with our common stock and do not intend to pay any dividends to common stockholders for the foreseeable future.",
    "item_1B": "Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments\nNone.",
    "item_2": "Item 2. Properties\nOur headquarters are located in New York City, NY. In addition, we lease office/building space around the world, primarily in Europe, the U.S., and Asia. We do not own any properties but lease data center colocations for housing our equipment, applications, and network interconnections to our customers and telecommunication network providers in Europe, the U.S., South America, and Asia.\nWe intend to procure additional space in the future as we continue to add employees and expand geographically. We believe our facilities are adequate and suitable for our current needs and that, should it be needed, suitable additional or alternative space will be available to accommodate our operations and headquarters.",
    "item_3": "Item 3. Legal Proceedings\nThe Company is currently a defendant in various legal actions and asserted claims arising in the normal course of business. We anticipate that we will become involved in new litigation matters from time to time in the future. We will incur legal and related costs concerning litigation and may, from time to time, determine to settle some or all of the cases, regardless of the assessment of our legal position. The amount of legal defense costs and settlements in any period will depend on many factors, including the status of cases, the number of cases that are in trial or about to be brought to trial, and the opposing parties\u2019 aggressiveness in pursuing their cases and their perception of their legal position. The following sets forth a description of material pending legal proceedings to which the Company is a party.\nSEC Investigation. In August 2019 and February 2020, the SEC issued the Company subpoenas requiring the production of documents related to, among other things, the Company\u2019s recognition of revenue, practices with certain customers, and internal accounting controls. The SEC staff has also interviewed and taken testimony from individuals previously employed by the Company in connection with the investigation. The Company is cooperating with the SEC staff in the SEC investigation and discussions with the SEC staff regarding a potential resolution of the investigation with respect to the Company are ongoing.\nIn re Pareteum Securities Litigation is the consolidation of various putative class actions that were filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (the \u201cSouthern District Court\u201d). The cases were assigned to Judge Alvin Hellerstein, who consolidated the actions on January 10, 2020 and named the Pareteum Shareholder Investor Group as the Lead Plaintiff. The Lead Plaintiff is asserting claims on behalf of purported purchasers and/or acquirers of Company securities between December 14, 2017 and October 21, 2019. The defendants are the Company, Robert H. Turner, Edward O\u2019Donnell, Victor Bozzo, Denis McCarthy, Dawson James Securities Inc., and Squar Milner LLP (\u201cDefendants\u201d). The Lead Plaintiff alleges that Defendants caused the Company to issue certain materially false or misleading statements in SEC filings and other public pronouncements in violation of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act, and Sections 11, 12 and 15 of the Securities Act. The Lead Plaintiff seeks to recover compensatory damages with interest for itself and the other class members for all damages sustained as a result of Defendants\u2019 alleged wrongdoing and reasonable costs and attorney\u2019s fees incurred in the case.\nDouglas Loskot v. Pareteum Corporation, et al., is a putative class action pending in the Superior Court of California, County of San Mateo. It was filed on May 29, 2020 on behalf of all former shareholders of iPass Inc. who received shares of the Company\u2019s common stock pursuant to a February 12, 2019 exchange tender offer. The defendants are the Company, Robert H. Turner, Edward O\u2019Donnell, Victor Bozzo, Yves van Sante, Robert Lippert and Luis Jimenez-Tu\u00f1on (the \u201cLoskot Defendants\u201d). The Complaint alleges that the Loskot Defendants caused the Company to issue materially false or misleading statements in SEC filings submitted in connection with the tender offer in violation of Sections 11 and 15 of the Securities Act.\nMiller ex rel. Pareteum Corporation v. Victor Bozzo, et al. was filed on February 28, 2020 in the Supreme Court for the State of New York, New York County. It is a stockholder derivative suit brought by Plaintiff William Miller (\u201cPlaintiff\u201d), derivatively on behalf of Pareteum, the Nominal Defendant, against certain officers and directors of Pareteum, including Victor Bozzo, Laura Thomas, Yves van Sante, Luis Jimenez-Tu\u00f1on, Robert Lippert, Robert H. Turner, Edward O\u2019Donnell, and Denis McCarthy (the \u201cIndividual Defendants\u201d). Plaintiff alleges that the Individual Defendants caused the company to issue false or misleading statements in Securities Exchange Commission filings and other public pronouncements in violation of certain federal securities regulations. Plaintiff alleges that as a result of their misconduct, the Individual Defendants are liable for violations of Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act, breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, abuse of control, gross mismanagement and waste of corporate assets. Plaintiff seeks a judgment awarding Pareteum damages with interest sustained as a result of the Individual Defendants\u2019 alleged misconduct, directing the Individual Defendants to take certain measures to reform and improve Pareteum\u2019s corporate governance and internal procedures, awarding Pareteum restitution from the Individual Defendants, and awarding Plaintiff all costs and expenses incurred in pursuing the claims.\nZhang ex rel. Pareteum Corporation v. Robert H. Turner, et al. was filed on May 26, 2020 in the Supreme Court for the State of New York, New York County. It is a stockholder derivative suit brought by Plaintiff Wei Zhang (\u201cPlaintiff\u201d), derivatively on behalf of Pareteum, the Nominal Defendant, against certain officers and directors of Pareteum, including Robert H. Turner, Edward O\u2019Donnell, Denis McCarthy, Victor Bozzo, Rob Mumby, Luis Jimenez-Tu\u00f1on, Robert Lippert, Laura Thomas, and Yves van Sante (the \u201cIndividual Defendants\u201d). Plaintiff alleges that the Individual Defendants caused the company to issue false or misleading statements in Securities Exchange Commission filings and other public pronouncements in violation of certain federal securities regulations. Plaintiff alleges that as a result of their misconduct, the Individual Defendants are liable for violations of Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act, breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, abuse of control, gross mismanagement and waste of corporate assets. Plaintiff seeks a judgment awarding Pareteum damages with interest sustained as a result of the Individual Defendants\u2019 alleged misconduct, directing the Individual Defendants to take certain measures to reform and improve Pareteum\u2019s corporate governance and internal procedures, awarding Pareteum restitution from the Individual Defendants, and awarding Plaintiff all costs and expenses incurred in pursuing the claim.\nShaw ex. rel. Pareteum Corporation v. Luis Jimenez-Tu\u00f1on, et al. was filed on July 10, 2020 in the Supreme Court for the State of New York, New York County. It is a stockholder derivative suit brought by Plaintiff Michael Shaw (\u201cPlaintiff\u201d), derivatively on behalf of Pareteum, the Nominal Defendant, against certain officers and directors of Pareteum, including Luis Jimenez-Tu\u00f1on, Robert Lippert, Yves van Sante, Robert H. Turner, Edward O\u2019Donnell, Denis McCarthy, Victor Bozzo, and Laura Thomas (the \u201cIndividual Defendants\u201d). Plaintiff alleges that the Individual Defendants caused the company to issue false or misleading statements in Securities Exchange Commission filings and other public pronouncements in violation of certain federal securities regulations. Plaintiff alleges that as a result of their misconduct, the Individual Defendants are liable for violations of Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act, breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, abuse of control, gross mismanagement, and waste of corporate assets. Plaintiff seeks a judgment awarding Pareteum damages sustained as a result of the Individual Defendants\u2019 alleged misconduct, directing the Individual Defendants to take certain measures to reform and improve Pareteum\u2019s corporate governance and internal procedures, and awarding Plaintiff all costs and expenses incurred in the Shaw Action.\nIn re Pareteum Corporation Stockholder Derivative Litigation (the \u201cDelaware Derivative Action\u201d) is a consolidated action that was originally filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware and joins several related derivative actions. On April 3, 2020, the District Court consolidated related suits brought by stockholders Edward Hayes, Juanita Silvera, and Brad Linton (\u201cPlaintiffs\u201d), derivatively on behalf of Pareteum, the Nominal Defendant, against certain officers and directors of Pareteum, including Robert H. Turner, Edward O\u2019Donnell, Denis McCarthy, Laura Thomas, Victor Bozzo, Luis Jimenez-Tu\u00f1on, Robert Lippert, Rob Mumby and Yves van Sante (the \u201cIndividual Defendants\u201d). Plaintiffs in the related actions have alleged that the Individual Defendants caused Pareteum to issue false or misleading statements in Securities Exchange Commission filings and other public pronouncements in violation of certain federal securities regulations. Plaintiffs allege that as a result of the Individual Defendants\u2019 misconduct, they are liable for violations of Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act, breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, and gross mismanagement. Plaintiffs seek a judgment (1) declaring that the Individual Defendants breached their fiduciary duties and/or aided and abetted the breach of their fiduciary duties; (2) awarding Pareteum damages sustained as a result of the Individual Defendants\u2019 breaches of fiduciary duty and violations of federal securities laws; (3) ordering that the Individual Defendants disgorge any performance-based compensation that was received during, or as a result of, the Individual Defendants\u2019 breaches of fiduciary duty; (4) directing the Individual Defendants to take certain measures to reform and improve Pareteum\u2019s corporate governance and internal procedures; (5) granting appropriate equitable or injunctive relief to remedy the Individual Defendants\u2019 breaches of fiduciary duties and other violations of laws; (6) awarding Pareteum restitution from the Individual Defendants; and (7) awarding Plaintiff all costs and expenses incurred in pursuing various actions against the Company and the Individual Defendants. On July 22, 2020, this action was transferred to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York.\nSabby Volatility Warrant Master Fund, Ltd. v. Pareteum Corp., et al., No. 19-cv-10460 (S.D.N.Y.) (the \u201cSection 11 Action\u201d), is an action brought under Section 11 of the Securities Act by an investor, Sabby Volatility Master Fund, Ltd. (\u201cPlaintiff Sabby\u201d), against the Company, Robert H. Turner, Edward O\u2019Donnell, Denis McCarthy, Victor Bozzo, Robert Lippert, Yves van Sante, and Luis Jimenez Tu\u00f1on (collectively, the \u201cDefendants\u201d). It was filed on November 11, 2019. Plaintiff Sabby alleges that the Defendants caused the Company to issue false or misleading statements in a Registration Statement filed with the SEC. Plaintiff Sabby claims that as a result of the alleged misconduct, the Defendants are liable for violations of Section 11 of the Securities Act, breaches of a Securities Purchase Agreement (the \u201cSPA\u201d) entered into between Plaintiff Sabby and Pareteum, and contractual indemnification allegedly owed to Plaintiff Sabby under the SPA. Plaintiff Sabby seeks monetary damages and/or rescission of the SPA, and indemnification by Pareteum for any losses resulting from its alleged breach of the SPA, including costs and expenses incurred in connection with the Section 11 Action.\nArtilium Africa, LLC et al. v. Artilium, PLC et al.; ICDR Case No. 01-19-0003-1680 and Artilium Africa, LLC and Tristar Africa Telecom, LLC v. Pareteum Corporation are related matters arising out of the same dispute. The former matter is\nan arbitration filed with the International Center for Dispute Resolution (\u201cICDR\u201d) on October 1, 2019 alleging that Artilium Group Limited, a subsidiary of Pareteum Corporation formerly known as Artilium PLC (\u201cArtilium\u201d), breached an Operating Agreement relating to a joint venture called Artilium Africa formed by Artilium, Green Globe Services LLC and Tristar Africa Telecom, LLC (\u201cTristar\u201d and together with Artilium Africa, the \u201cDelaware Plaintiffs\u201d) to provide mobile data, cloud, and telecommunications services throughout Africa. The Claimants in the ICDR arbitration are seeking $30 million. The latter matter is a civil case filed on October 10, 2019 in the Delaware District Court. The Delaware Plaintiffs allege that Pareteum Corporation tortiously interfered with Tristar\u2019s contract with Artilium in order to enter into the same type of agreement with Artilium. The Plaintiffs are seeking $150,000 in damages.

Pareteum\u2019s goal is to unleash the power of applications and mobile services, bringing secure, ubiquitous, scalable, and seamlessly available voice, video, SMS/text messaging, and data services to its customers, making worldwide communications services easily and economically accessible to everyone. By harnessing the value of our cloud communications platform, Pareteum serves enterprises, communications service providers, early-stage innovators, developers, IoT and telecommunications infrastructure providers.\nPareteum integrates a variety of disparate communications methods and services and offers them to customers and application developers, allowing communications to become a value-added service. The vast majority of our platform is comprised of our internally-developed software and intellectual property, which provides our customers with flexibility in how they use our products and allows us to be market driven going forward. We have been granted over 70 patents related to techniques and processes which support our cloud software and communications platform solutions. Our platform services partners (whose technologies are integrated into our cloud) include Hewlett Packard, IBM, Sonus, Oracle, Microsoft, NetNumber, Affirmed and other world-class technology providers.\nThe Pareteum cloud communications platform targets large and growing sectors from IoT, MVNO, Smart Cities, and application developer markets - each in need of mobile platforms, management and connectivity. These sectors need Communications Platform-as-a-Service (CPaaS), which Pareteum delivers. Our vision is to empower Communication Service Providers, Enterprises and Developers to simply create and control their own wireless communications products and experiences through our powerful combination of software, services and global connectivity.\nPareteum Corporation, a Delaware corporation, was originally formed in 2001 as Elephant Talk Communications Corp. as a result of a merger between Staruni Corporation (USA, 1962) and Elephant Talk Limited (Hong Kong, 1994). Since 2016, our name has been Pareteum Corporation, and from November 12, 2019 until November 12, 2020, our common stock was traded on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the ticker symbol \u201cTEUM.\u201d Prices for our common stock are now quoted on the Pink Sheets under the same symbol.\nRecent Developments\nAsset Disposition\nIn August 2020, the Company entered into an asset transfer agreement and a software license agreement with a data communications provider (the \"Purchaser\"), pursuant to which Purchaser agreed to purchase certain property and equipment and software licenses related to an MVNE solution for total cash consideration of $12.3 million. The Purchaser paid $4.7 million in August 2020 and the remainder in December 2020 upon the completion of the transfer to the Purchaser. The Company recorded a gain on sale of assets of $10.8 million for the difference between the consideration received and the book value of the property and equipment and the software license (see Note 2, Acquisitions and Disposition - Asset Disposition).\nDelisting of the Company\u2019s Common Stock\nOn November 5, 2020, the Company notified the Nasdaq Hearings Panel that it would not be able to file its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2019, its amended Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2018, its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 or its Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the periods ended March 31, 2020 and June 30, 2020 by November 9, 2020, the date by which the Nasdaq Hearings Panel had required the Company to make such filings in order for the Company\u2019s common stock to remain listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market.\nIn response to the Company\u2019s notice to the Nasdaq Stock Market that it would not satisfy the conditions to the exception to the listing requirements granted by the Hearing Panel, the Nasdaq Stock Market notified the Company by letter dated November 10, 2020 that the Company\u2019s common stock would be delisted, and trading of the Company\u2019s common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market was suspended effective at the open of business on November 12, 2020. Since the trading of the Company\u2019s common stock was suspended, prices for our common stock have been quoted on Pink Sheets. The formal delisting of the Company\u2019s common stock from the Nasdaq became effective on February 12, 2021.\nSenior Secured Convertible Note\nOn June 8, 2020, the Company issued an $17.5 million in principal amount of an 8% Senior Secured Convertible Note due April 1, 2025 (the \u201cHigh Trail Note\u201d) to High Trail Investments SA LLC for $14.0 million. On June 8, 2020, the Company received $4.0 million. The remaining $10.0 million balance was deposited into a blocked bank account that will be released to the Company upon the satisfaction of certain conditions. The Company is currently default under the High Trail Note, and High Trail has caused $6.0 million of the purchase price maintained in such blocked account to be transferred to High Trail in partial satisfaction of the amounts outstanding under the High Trail Note. (see Note 5, Debt and Series C Redeemable Preferred Stock - Senior Secured Convertible Note)\nSeries C Redeemable Preferred Stock\nOn various dates from February 21, 2020 through August 18, 2020, the Company issued shares of Series C Redeemable Preferred Stock and on various dates from July 17, 2020 through October 1, 2020, the Company entered into agreements with those holders that allow either the Company or the holders to exchange outstanding shares of Series C Redeemable Preferred Stock for shares of the Company\u2019s common stock. Such exchanges are subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including approval of the Company\u2019s stockholders of the issuance of such common stock and the Company\u2019s ability to issue shares of common stock not subject to restrictions on resale. The number of shares of common stock issuable upon exchange of the Series C Redeemable Preferred Stock under the Series C Exchange Agreements will determined by the application of a formula in which (i) the stated value of the shares of Series C Redeemable Preferred Stock being converted plus the value of any accrued and unpaid dividends plus, with respect to certain agreed upon shares of the Series C Redeemable Preferred Stock, a premium of 12.5% on the stated value is divided by (ii) the conversion price. The conversion price for certain holders of Series C Redeemable Preferred Stock in the aggregate is $0.70, while the conversion price for certain other holders of shares of Series C Redeemable Preferred Stock is the lower of (i) $0.60 and (ii) the greater of (x) the average daily volume-weighted average price per share of Common Stock during the five trading days before the closing of the exchange and (y) $0.40.

Capitalized costs are amortized on a straight-line basis to depreciation and amortization. When assigning useful lives to internal-use software, the Company considers the effects of obsolescence, competition, technology, and other economic factors.\nInterest Expense, net\nInterest expense, net is comprised of interest expense accrued or paid on our indebtedness and the amortization of debt discount and deferred financing costs, net of interest income earned on cash balances.\nGain on sale of assets\nGain on sale of assets consists of the gain recorded for the sale of certain assets, the transfer of which was completed in December 2020, measured as the difference between the consideration received and the book value of the property and equipment and the software licenses (see Note 2, Acquisitions and Disposition - Asset Disposition).\nChange in fair value of derivative and warrant liabilities\nChange in fair value of embedded derivatives and warrant liabilities consist of the change in the fair value of the embedded derivatives and warrant liabilities related to the Company's Senior Secured Convertible Note issued in June 2020 (see Note 5, Debt and Series C Redeemable Preferred Stock - Senior Secured Convertible Note - Derivative liability / Warrant liability).\nLoss on Extinguishment of Debt\nLoss on extinguishment of debt during 2020 consists of the loss recognized as a result of the modification of certain provisions of the Series C redeemable preferred stock that was accounted for as an extinguishment (see Note 5, Debt and Series C Redeemable Preferred Stock - Series C redeemable preferred stock).

The conversion of Euros and USD leads to period-to-period fluctuations in our reported USD results arising from changes in the exchange rate between the USD and the Euro. Generally, when the USD strengthens relative to the Euro, it has an unfavorable impact on our reported revenue and income and a favorable impact on our reported expenses. Conversely, when the USD weakens relative to the Euro, it produces a favorable impact on our reported revenue and income, and an unfavorable impact on our reported expenses. These fluctuations in the USD/Euro exchange rate therefore result in currency translation effects (not to be confused with real currency exchange effects), which impact our reported USD results and may make it difficult to determine actual increases and decreases in our revenue and expenses that are attributable to our actual operating activities. We carry out our business activities primarily in Euros, and we do not currently engage in hedging activities.\nThe following table shows the average USD equivalent of the major currencies used to translate our financial results for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nUSD\nEquivalent\nEuro $ 1.13958 $ 1.14460\nBritish Pound $ 1.28235 $ 1.27369\nRevenue\nRevenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $69.6 million, an increase of $7.6 million, or 12.2%, compared to $62.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was primarily due to strong demand for services in our mobility business, partially offset by a decrease in connectivity services, which includes travel-related communications. We attribute the net increase in demand to the overall impact that the COVID-related restrictions have had on demand for our various services, especially for messaging and consumer mobile services.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $49.0 million, an increase of $1.8 million, or 3.9%, compared to $47.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily due to the increase in revenue and, to a lesser extent, an unfavorable service mix.\nProduct Development\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company capitalized $6.5 million and $6.4 million, respectively, of internal-use software.\nProduct development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were $10.3 million and $13.0 million, respectively, a decrease of $2.6 million, or 20.2%. This decrease was mainly due to a decline in personnel and related costs in 2020 in part due to restraints on the Company's access to capital.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expenses for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were $6.1 million and $10.3 million, respectively, a decrease of $4.2 million, or 40.6%. Sales and marketing expenses declined mainly due to a decrease in personnel and related costs and a reduction in sales costs due to COVID-related restrictions.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were $29.8 million and $34.6 million, respectively, a decrease of $4.8 million, or 13.8%. This decrease is primarily due to an absence in 2020 of iPass acquisition-related costs and reduction in 2020 of personnel costs, partially offset by an increase in costs associated with the restatement of the Company's historical financial statements.\nAcquisition Costs\nThere were no acquisition costs for the year ended December 31, 2020. The acquisition costs for the year ended December 31, 2019 were $3.5 million related to our acquisition of iPass.\nImpairment of goodwill and intangible assets\nThere was no impairment of goodwill and intangible assets for the year ended December 31, 2020. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recognized a non-cash impairment charge of $156.8 million, consisting of a $125.9 million impairment of goodwill and a $30.8 million impairment of intangible assets (see Note 4, Goodwill and Intangible Assets)\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $10.8 million and $12.7 million, a decrease of $1.9 million, or 15.3%. The decrease is primarily due to the impairment of finite-lived intangible assets in 2019.\nInterest Expense, net\nInterest expense, net for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $9.1 million and $2.6 million, respectively, an increase of $6.5 million due to increases in borrowings and the Company's effective borrowing rate, including borrowings under the High Trail Note and the Senior Second Lien Note.\nGain on sale of assets\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized a $10.8 million gain on the sale of certain assets, the transfer of which was completed in December 2020 (see Note 2, Acquisitions and Disposition - Asset Disposition).\nChange in fair value of derivative and warrant liabilities\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized, in aggregate, a favorable $7.0 million change in fair value based on the fair value changes of embedded derivatives and warrant liability related to the Company's Senior Secured Convertible Note issued in June 2020 and Series C Redeemable Preferred Stock (see Note 5, Debt and Series C Redeemable Preferred Stock - Senior Secured Convertible Note - Derivative liability / Warrant liability and Series C Redeemable Preferred Stock - Derivative liability / Warrant liability).\nLoss on Extinguishment of Debt\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of $17.0 million related to the modification of certain provisions of the Series C redeemable preferred stock that was accounted for as an extinguishment (see Note 5, Debt and Series C Redeemable Preferred Stock - Series C redeemable preferred stock). For the year ended December 31, 2019, we recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of $8.9 million related to the extinguishment of debt previously outstanding under that certain Fortress Credit Agreement, under which we had borrowed funds from Fortress Credit Corp., and under that certain credit agreement with Post Road Special Opportunity Fund I LLP in February 2019 and September 2019 (see Note 2, Acquisitions and Disposition - iPass, Inc. Acquisition and Note 5, Debt and Series C Redeemable Preferred Stock - Former Post Road Group Debt Facility).\nOther Income (Expense), net\nOther income (expense) net, is generated from non-operating activities and includes foreign currency transaction gains and losses. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded other income, net of $0.1 million compared to other expense, net of $3.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The favorable change of $3.3 million was primarily due to a reserve recorded in 2019 on a note receivable and the favorable impact in 2020 for the forgiveness of a Paycheck Protection Program (\"PPP\") loan in the amount of $0.6 million on our results in 2020 as compared to 2019.\nIncome Tax Benefit\nIncome tax benefit for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $0.1 million and $8.3 million, respectively. This change was primarily due to the full valuation of the deferred tax liability from the Artilium acquisition, which was a discrete item in 2019.\nAccretion and dividends of series C redeemable preferred stock\nAccretion and dividends of series C redeemable preferred stock for the years ended December 31, 2020 was $0.8 million. There were no amounts recorded to accretion and dividends of series C redeemable preferred stock in 2019 since the modification and classification to temporary equity of the series C redeemable preferred stock occurred during 2020.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, the Company had accumulated deficits of $584.6 million and $539.5 million and reported net losses of $44.7 million and $222.3 million as of and for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. During 2019, the Company recognized a non-cash impairment charge of $156.8 million, consisting of a $125.9 million impairment of goodwill and a $30.8 million intangible assets impairment.\nThe Company's cash balance, including restricted cash, was $14.8 million and $5.9 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nOn June 8, 2020, we issued the High Trail Note with a principal amount of $17.5 million to High Trail Investments SA LLC (\u201cHigh Trail\u201d) due April 1, 2025 for an aggregate purchase price of $14.0 million, of which $6.0 million was previously maintained in one or more blocked accounts. The terms of the High Trail Note require the Company to meet certain specified conditions and covenants, some of which have not been satisfied by the dates required, including (i) the Company filing its restated financial statements with the SEC for (a) the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, (b) the quarter ended March 31, 2019 and (c) the quarter ended June 30, 2019, in each case on or prior to October 31, 2020, (ii) after October 31, 2020, the Company timely filing its subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and its subsequent annual reports on Form 10-K with the SEC in the manner and within the time periods required under the Exchange Act, and (iii) the Company maintaining the listing of its common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market. As a result, we have been in default under the terms of the High Trail Note since October 31, 2020 and at High Trail\u2019s option, High Trail can demand payment for the outstanding principal amount. In addition, the interest rate increased to 18% per annum. On April 8, 2021, High Trail provided notice to the Company that it was causing $6.0 million of the purchase price maintained in such blocked account to be transferred to High Trail in partial satisfaction of the amounts outstanding under the High Trail Note.\nOn November 30, 2020, we entered into a Forbearance Agreement (the \u201cForbearance Agreement\u201d) with High Trail. Under the terms of the Forbearance Agreement, High Trail agreed to forebear from exercising certain rights and remedies. High Trail agreed that it would not, directly or indirectly, exercise any right or remedy under any transaction document or take any other enforcement action in respect of the occurrence and continuance of any existing events of default, or encourage any other person to take or initiate any such enforcement action or other action through the forbearance termination date as defined as: (a) December 31, 2020 (or any later date agreed to in writing by High Trail; (b) the occurrence of any event of default (other than an existing event of default); and (c) the initiation of any action by the Company or any other person to invalidate or limit the enforceability of any of the acknowledgments set forth in the Forbearance Agreement. Subsequently, High Trail agreed to extend the forbearance termination date to March 31, 2021. The forbearance period under the Forbearance Agreement has not been subsequently extended.\nOn May 24, 2020, the Company entered into a new forbearance agreement (the \u201cNew Forbearance Agreement\u201d) with High Trail under which (i) the Company again admitted it was in default under several obligations under the High Trail Note and related agreements, (ii) High Trail acknowledged such defaults and agreed not to exercise any right or remedy under the High Trail Note or the related securities purchase agreement, warrant or security documents, including its right to accelerate the aggregate amount outstanding under the High Trail Note, until the earlier of May 31, 2020 or any later date to which such date may be extended (the \u201cOutside Date\u201d), and the date of any new event of default or initiation of any action by the Company to invalidate any of the representations and warranties made in the New Forbearance Agreement. The Outside Date automatically extends for successive two-week periods unless on or before the then-applicable Outside Date the lender provides notice that the Outside Date is not being extended.\nAs partial consideration for its agreement not to exercise any right or remedy under the High Trail Note and related documents, High Trail and the Company agreed to make certain changes to the documents. In this regard, the parties agreed to amend the \u201cEvent of Default Acceleration Amount\u201d definition in the High Trail Note so that the amount due and payable by the Company on account of an event of default would be an amount in cash equal to 125% of the then-outstanding principal and accrued and unpaid interest under the High Trail Note. This represents an increase from 120% of the then-outstanding principal and accrued and unpaid interest, and removes the market-price-based alternative for such acceleration amount.\nAdditionally, the parties also agreed that the principal amount outstanding under the High Trail Note would be increased by certain paid-in-kind amounts in full satisfaction of the Company\u2019s obligation to make payments of interest to High Trail on each of April 1, 2021 and May 1, 2021, which amounts were not paid by the Company in cash or Common Stock. In consideration of High Trail\u2019s agreement to enter into the New Forbearance Agreement and agree to the amendments to the High Trail Note, the Company agreed to pay High Trail a fee in the amount of $1.5 million. Accordingly, following these increases in the principal amount payable, but applying against the outstanding principal and such fee the $6.0 million previously\nmaintained in a certain blocked account against that was foreclosed upon by High Trail, the total amount of principal outstanding under the High Trail Note as of the date of the New Forbearance Agreement was approximately $13.5 million.\nOn February 22, 2021, we issued a $2.4 million 8% Senior Second Lien Secured Convertible Note due 2025 (the \u201cSenior Second Lien Note\u201d) to an institutional investor and received $2.0 million. The aggregate purchase price for the Senior Second Lien Note was $2.0 million. The Senior Second Lien Notes are senior, secured obligations of the Company, but rank junior to the High Trail Note. Interest is payable monthly beginning April 1, 2021 The Senior Second Lien Note is secured by a second lien on substantially all assets of the Company and substantially all assets of its material U.S.-organized subsidiaries.\nOn April 29, 2021, we entered into a securities purchase agreement with two initial investors and other investors as may become party thereto from time to time (collectively, the \u201cSecond Lien Note Purchasers\u201d) providing for the issuance and sale by the Company of up to $6.0 million aggregate principal amount of its Senior Second Lien Secured Convertible Notes due 2025 (the \u201cNotes\u201d) and warrants to purchase up to 5,000,000 shares of its common stock (the \u201cApril 2021 Warrants\u201d) to purchase up to 5,000,000 shares of our common stock. The Senior Second Lien Notes and accompanying April 2021 Warrants may be sold from time to time to one or more Second Lien Note Purchasers under the terms of the purchase agreement. On April 29, 2021, we closed on the sale of Senior Second Lien Notes in the aggregate principal amount of approximately $1.79 million and April 2021 Warrants to purchase 1,490,000 shares of common stock under the purchase agreement for an aggregate purchase price of $1.49 million.\nBecause of the limited nature of the relief provided under the Forbearance Agreement, which does not lower the amounts payable in principal or interest, the limited amount of additional capital we have raised and can raise by selling the Senior Second Lien Notes and the foreclosure by High Trail on $6.0 million of the High Trail Note purchase price, we believe that we will not have sufficient resources to fund our operations and meet the obligations specified in the Senior Second Lien Note and any obligations under the High Trail Note for the next twelve months following the filing of this Annual Report. Our software platforms require ongoing funding to continue the current development and operational plans and we have a history of net losses. We will continue to expend substantial resources for the foreseeable future in connection with the continued development of our software platforms. These expenditures include costs associated with research and development activity, corporate administration, business development, and marketing and selling of our services. In addition, other unanticipated costs may arise.\nAs a result, we believe that additional capital will be required to fund our operations and provide growth capital to meet the obligations under the High Trail Note and the Senior Second Lien Notes. Accordingly, we will have to raise additional capital in one or more debt and/or equity offerings and continue to work with High Trail to enter into a new forbearance arrangement or agree to restructure the indebtedness owed to High Trail. Accordingly, our management has been actively exploring these and other options for addressing our liquidity issues. However, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in raising the necessary capital or that any such offering will be available to us on terms acceptable to us, or at all, or that High Trail will agree to forbear or restructure our indebtedness. If we are unable to raise additional capital that may be needed, this would have a material adverse effect on the Company. In particular, a decline in the market price of our common stock, coupled with the stock\u2019s delisting from the Nasdaq Capital Market, could make it more difficult to sell equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem appropriate. The factors discussed above raise substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that these consolidated financial statements are issued.\nOperating Activities\nWe reported net cash used in operating activities of $18.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to net cash used in operating activities of $17.8 million in 2019, an increase in cash used of $0.7 million. Net cash used in operating activities increased primarily as a result of the timing of payments to fund operations.\n($ in thousands) 2020 2019\nNet loss $ (44,661) $ (222,347)\nAdjustments to reconcile net loss to net cash used in operating activities: 22,534 188,194\n(22,127) (34,153)\nChanges in operating assets and liabilities: 3,686 16,392\nNet cash used in operating activities $ (18,441) $ (17,761)\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash provided by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020, was $4.3 million, an increase of $15.4 million or 139%, compared to $11.1 million net cash used in investing activities in 2019. This increase in cash provided during 2020 as compared to 2019 was primarily the result of proceeds received during 2020 for the sale of assets.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020, was $23.3 million, compared to $28.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Net cash provided by financing activities decreased as a result of a reduction in net cash proceeds during 2020 from the issuance of loans and redeemable preferred stock.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nPurchase Commitment\nDuring 2019, the Company entered into certain off-balance sheet commitments that require the future purchase of goods or services (\u201cunconditional purchase obligations\u201d) (see Note 12, Commitments and Contingencies).\nApplication of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nRevenue Recognition and Net billings in Excess of Revenue\nRevenue represents amounts earned for (non-software) arrangements consisting of hosting subscriptions for our CPaaS solutions. We also offer customer support and professional services related to implementing and supporting our suite of applications. Revenue is generally recognized net of any taxes collected from customers and subsequently remitted to governmental authorities.\nMonthly Service Revenue:\nThe Company\u2019s performance obligations in monthly Software as a Service (SaaS) and service offerings are simultaneously received and consumed by the customer and therefore are recognized over time. For recognition purposes, we do not unbundle such services into separate performance obligations. The Company typically bills its customer at the end of each month, with payment to be received shortly thereafter. The fees charged may include a combination of fixed and variable charges with the variable charges tied to the number of subscribers or some other measure of volume. Although the consideration may be variable, the volumes are estimable at the time of billing, with \u201ctrue-up\u201d adjustments occurring in the subsequent month. Such amounts have not been historically significant.\nInstallation and Software Development Revenue:\nThe Company\u2019s other revenue consist generally of installation and software development projects.\nInstallation represents the activities necessary for a customer to obtain access and connectivity to the Company\u2019s monthly SaaS and service offerings. While installation may require separate phases, it represents one promise within the context of the contract.\nSoftware development consists of programming and other services which adds new functionality to a customer\u2019s existing or new service offerings. Each development project defines its milestones and will have its own performance obligation.\nRevenue is recognized over time if the installation and software development activities create an asset that has no alternative use for which the Company is entitled to receive payment for performance completed to date. If not, then revenue is not recognized until the applicable performance obligation is satisfied.\nArrangements with Multiple Performance Obligations:\nThe Company\u2019s contracts with customers may include multiple performance obligations. For such arrangements, the Company allocates revenue to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. The Company generally determines standalone selling prices based on the prices charged to customers.\nContract assets and liabilities:\nGiven the nature of the Company\u2019s services and contracts, it has no contract assets. The Company records net billings in excess of revenue when payments are made in advance of our performance, including amounts which are refundable.\nPayment terms vary by the type and location of our customer and the products or services offered. The term between invoicing and when payment is due is not significant. For certain products or services and customer types, payment is required before control is transferred or services are delivered to the customer.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nWe record an allowance for estimated uncollectible accounts in an amount approximating anticipated losses. Accounts receivable are periodically evaluated for collectability based on past credit history with customers. An allowance is recorded on the basis of loss experience, known and inherent risk in the account balance and current economic conditions. Individual uncollectible accounts are written off against the allowance when collection of the individual accounts appears doubtful.\nIncome Taxes\nWe estimate our income taxes separately for each tax jurisdiction in which we conduct operations. The provision for federal, state, foreign and local income taxes is calculated on income before income taxes based on current tax law and includes the cumulative effect of any changes in tax rates from those used previously in determining deferred tax assets and liabilities. Such provision differs from the amounts currently payable because certain items of income and expense are recognized in different reporting periods for financial reporting purposes than for income tax purposes.\nWe record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized. In determining the net deferred tax assets and valuation allowances, we are required to make judgments and estimates in assessing the realizability of the deferred tax assets. In making such determination, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent results of operations. If we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount or would no longer be able to realize our deferred income tax assets in the future as currently recorded, we would make an adjustment to the valuation allowance which would decrease or increase the provision for income taxes.\nShare-based Compensation\nThe Company follows the provisions of ASC 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation, (\u201cASC 718\u201d). ASC 718 requires all stock-based payments to employees, directors and non-employees to be recognized in the statements of operations and comprehensive loss by measuring the fair value of the award on the date of grant and recognizing this fair value as expense using a straight-line method over the requisite service period, generally the vesting period. The Company estimates forfeitures at the time of grant and, if necessary, revises those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.\nThe Company estimates the grant date fair value of stock-based payments that vest over time using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The use of the Black-Scholes option pricing model requires management to make certain assumptions and estimates that impact the valuation of stock-based payments.\nWarrant and Embedded Derivative Liabilities\nWarrant and embedded derivative liabilities are remeasured at fair value each reporting period in accordance with the provisions of ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement. The Company utilizes the Monte Carlo valuation model to determine the value of the outstanding warrants and the conversion feature in the convertible notes. Since the Monte Carlo valuation model requires special software and expertise to model the assumptions to be used, the Company uses a third-party valuation expert to fair value these liabilities.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe generally recognize the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any non-controlling interests in an acquiree at their fair values as of the date of acquisition, under the acquisition method of accounting. We measure goodwill as the excess of consideration transferred, which we also measure at fair value, over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The acquisition method of accounting requires us to exercise judgment and make significant estimates and assumptions regarding the fair values of the elements of a business combination as of the date of acquisition, including the fair values of identifiable intangible assets, deferred tax asset valuation allowances, liabilities related to uncertain tax positions, and contingencies. This method also requires us to refine these estimates over a one-year measurement period to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the measurement of the amounts recognized as of that date. If we are required to retroactively adjust provisional amounts that we have recorded for the fair value of assets and liabilities in connection with acquisitions, these adjustments could materially change our operating income and net income and result in different asset values on our balance sheet.\nSignificant estimates and assumptions that we must make in estimating the fair value of acquired technology, customer lists, and other identifiable intangible assets include future cash flows that we expect to generate from the acquired assets. If the subsequent actual results and updated projections of the underlying business activity change compared with the assumptions and projections used to develop these values, we could record impairment charges. In addition, we have estimated the economic lives of certain acquired assets and these lives are used to calculate depreciation and amortization expense. If our estimates of the economic lives change, depreciation or amortization expenses could be accelerated or slowed.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets Impairment\nGoodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level, which is defined as an operating segment. We operate in one reportable segment.\nWe test for an indication of goodwill impairment in the fourth quarter of each year, or sooner, when indicators of impairment exist, by comparing the fair value of our reporting unit to its carrying value. If there is an indication of impairment, we perform a \u201cstep two\u201d test to measure the impairment. Impairments, if any, are recorded to the statement of operations in the period the impairment is recognized.\nA significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred. Such indicators include a sustained and significant decline in our stock price and market capitalization, a decline in our expected future cash flows, a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate and unanticipated competition.\nIn accordance with ASC 360, Property, Plant and Equipment (\u201cASC 360\u201d), finite-lived intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortization and impairment charges. Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets, between three and ten years. Finite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment in accordance with ASC 360, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Measurement of any impairment loss is based on the amount of the carrying value that exceeds the fair value of the asset.\nContingent Losses\nFrom time to time, during the normal course of operations, we are party to litigation and regulatory matters, claims and other contingent matters. Litigation and regulatory reviews can be expensive and disruptive to normal business operations. Moreover, the results of complex proceedings and reviews are difficult to predict and our view of these matters may change in the future as events related thereto unfold. We expense legal fees as incurred. We record a provision for contingent losses when it is both probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount or range of the loss can be reasonably estimated. An unfavorable outcome to any legal or regulatory matter, if material, could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s operations or its financial position, liquidity or results of operations.\nImpact of Recent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 1, Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for a discussion of the impact of recent accounting pronouncements.",

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nGoing Concern Uncertainty\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company has suffered recurring losses from operations, negative cash flows from operations, and had a negative working capital of $37.2 million and an accumulated deficit of $584.6 million as of December 31, 2020. This raises substantial doubt about the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern. In addition, with respect to the ongoing and evolving coronavirus (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) outbreak, which was designated as a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 12, 2020, the outbreak has cause substantial disruption in international and U.S. economies and markets and if repercussions of the outbreak are prolonged, could have a significant adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business. Management\u2019s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 1. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company\u2019s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current year audit of the financial statements that were communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nSenior Secured Convertible Note Agreement (Including Embedded Derivatives)\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nAs disclosed in Note 5 to the financial statements, On June 8, 2020, the Company issued $17.5 million in principal amount of an 8% Senior Secured Convertible Note due April 1, 2025 (the High Trail Note) to High Trail Investments SA LLC for $14 million. In addition, 15,000,000 warrants were issued in connection with the issuance of the High Trail Note.\nThe High Trail Note contained embedded features which were required to be bifurcated upon issuance and recorded at fair value and remeasured with the changes in fair value recognized in other income (expense), net in the Company\u2019s consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. These embedded features include conversion features that allow for a change in the conversion rate in connection with certain equity issuances, payments based on a fundamental change and certain events of defaults.\nWe identified the High Trail Note as a critical audit matter.

Subsequently, the Company and High Trail Investments SA LLC (High Trail) entered into a settlement agreement dated March 17, 2020 (Settlement Agreement) whereby the Company agreed to grant High Trail a warrant to purchase 2,000,000 shares of its common stock and exercise price of $0.70 per share.\nWe identified the Settlement Agreement with High Trail as a critical audit matter. Auditing the multiple elements of the transaction involved complex accounting for the notes and warrant which required specialized skills and auditor judgement to assess the fair value and reasonableness of the inputs used in the Company\u2019s fair value measurement.\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit\nThe primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included:\n\u2022Obtaining an understanding of the Company\u2019s process to account for the issuance of the warrant.\n\u2022Reviewing the settlement agreement and warrant agreement.\n\u2022Evaluating management's memorandum for accounting treatment and valuation of the warrant.\n\u2022Testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used in the valuation models by tracing to terms contained in the settlement and warrant agreement and outside third-party data.\nAsset Transfer Agreement & Software Licensing Agreement\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nAs disclosed in Note 2 of the financial statements, in August 2020, the Company entered into an asset transfer agreement and a software license agreement with a data communications provider (the Purchaser), pursuant to which the Purchaser agreed to purchase various property and equipment and a software license related to a Mobile Virtual Network Enabler solution for total cash consideration of $12.3 million. The Purchaser paid $4.7 million in August 2020 and the remainder in December 2020 upon the completion of the transfer to the Purchaser. The Company recorded a gain on sale of assets of $10.7 million for the difference between the book value of the property and equipment and the software license.\nWe identified the Asset Transfer Agreement & Software Licensing Agreement as a critical audit matter. Auditing the elements of this transaction involved especially challenging due to the nature and extent of audit effort required, the interaction of contracts that constituted the collective agreement and the level of auditor judgment involved to determine the appropriate accounting treatment.\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit\nThe primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included:\n\u2022Obtaining an understanding of the Company\u2019s process to account for the asset transfer and software license agreements.\n\u2022Reviewing the terms of the agreements including payments, terminations, and obligation fulfillments and testing the components.\n\u2022Evaluating management's memorandum for accounting treatment of the asset transfer and software license agreements under the applicable accounting guidance.\n\u2022Testing the appropriateness of the resultant journal entries.\nSeries C Redeemable Preferred Stock Financing (Including Embedded Derivatives and Exchange Agreements)\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nAs disclosed in Note 5 to the financial statements, On December 24, 2019, the Company issued 105 shares of 8% Series C Redeemable Preferred Stock. In a series of transactions from February 21, 2020 through August 18, 2020, the Company issued an additional 112 shares of Series C Redeemable Preferred Stock. The Series C Redeemable Preferred Stock requires mandatory redemption one year after issuance at the stated value together with the 8% dividend and a 12.5% premium. Such redemption dates ranged from December 24, 2020 through August 18, 2021. Redemption terms were subsequently modified by the Series C Exchange Agreements on various dates from July 17, 2020 through October 29, 2020 (Exchange Agreements) which extended the mandatory redemption date and added an exchange feature.\nAs a result of modifying certain provisions of the Series C Redeemable Preferred Stock, which was classified as a liability prior to the dates of the Exchange Agreements, the Company accounted for the modification as an extinguishment since the exchange feature is substantive. Due to the changes in the terms of the Exchange Agreements, the Company has reclassified the Series C Redeemable Preferred Stock from a liability to temporary equity outside of permanent equity in its Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2020.\nWe identified the Series C Redeemable Preferred Stock as a critical audit matter. Auditing the valuation of the embedded features involved complex accounting for derivatives which required specialized skills and knowledge to assess the fair value and reasonableness of the inputs used to value the derivatives. Additionally, accounting for the modification as an extinguishment that was classified as temporary equity which required specialized skills and knowledge to assess the fair value and reasonableness of the inputs used to value the derivatives and determine the balance sheet classification.\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit\nThe primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included:\n\u2022Obtaining an understanding of the Company\u2019s process to account for the issuance of the Series C Redeemable Preferred Stock.\n\u2022Reviewing the Series C Redeemable Preferred Stock agreements.\n\u2022Evaluating management's memorandum for accounting treatment and management specialist\u2019s valuation on the embedded derivatives.\n\u2022Testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used in the valuation models by tracing to terms contained in the initial Series C Redeemable Preferred Stock agreements and the Exchange Agreements.\n\u2022With the assistance of our valuation specialist, evaluating the valuation methodology used by the Company and significant assumptions used in the valuation model by evaluating individual assumptions used by management.\n/s/ Baker Tilly US, LLP\nWe have served as the Company\u2019s auditor since 2014.\nLos Angeles, California\nJune 17, 2021\nPareteum Corporation and Subsidiaries\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(in thousands, except share and per share amounts)\nAs of December 31,\n2020 2019\nASSETS\nCurrent assets:\nCash and cash equivalents $ 8,275 $ 4,447\nRestricted cash 6,479 1,455\nAccounts receivable, net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of $2,077 and $1,546 at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively\n11,608 8,307\nNotes receivable, current 300 -\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets 3,672 4,453\nTotal current assets 30,334 18,662\nRight-of-use assets, net 1,044 2,241\nNotes receivable -

Artilium is a software development company active in the enterprise communications and core telecommunications markets delivering software solutions which layer over disparate fixed, mobile and IP networks to enable the deployment of converged communication services and applications.\nAs of February 12, 2019, the Company acquired iPass Inc. (\u201ciPass\u201d), which operates as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. iPass is a cloud-based service provider of global mobile connectivity, offering Wi-Fi access on any mobile device through its SaaS platform.\nDelisting of the Company\u2019s Common Stock\nOn November 5, 2020, the Company notified the Nasdaq Hearings Panel that it would not be able to file its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2019, its amended Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2018, its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 or its Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the periods ended March 31, 2020 and June 30, 2020 by November 9, 2020, the date by which the Nasdaq Hearings Panel had required the Company to make such filings in order for the Company\u2019s common stock to remain listed on the Nasdaq. In response to the Company\u2019s notice to Nasdaq that it would not satisfy the conditions to the exception to the listing requirements granted by the Hearings Panel, Nasdaq notified the Company by letter dated November 10, 2020 that the Company\u2019s common stock would be delisted, and trading of the Company\u2019s common stock on Nasdaq\u2019s Capital Market was suspended effective at the open of business on November 12, 2020. After the trading of the Company\u2019s common stock was suspended by Nasdaq, prices for the Company\u2019s common stock have been quoted on the OTC Markets Group Inc.\u2019s Pink Open Market. The delisting became effective on February 12, 2021.\nLiquidity\nAs reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, the Company had accumulated deficits of $584.6 million and $539.5 million and reported net losses of $44.7 million and $222.3 million as of and for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. During the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company recognized a non-cash impairment charge of $156.8 million, consisting of a $125.9 million goodwill impairment and $30.8 million intangible assets impairment. The Company's cash balance, including restricted cash, was $14.8 million and $5.9 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nPareteum Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Amounts in thousands except share and per share data and unless otherwise indicated)\nOn June 8, 2020, the Company issued a $17.5 million 8% Senior Secured Convertible Note (the \u201cHigh Trail Note\u201d) to High Trail Investments SA LLC (\u201cHigh Trail\u201d) due April 1, 2025 for an aggregate purchase price of $14.0 million, of which $6.0 million was maintained in one or more blocked accounts. The terms of the High Trail Note require the Company to meet certain specified conditions and covenants, some of which have not been satisfied by the dates required, including (i) the Company filing its restated financial statements with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") for (a) the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, (b) the quarter ended March 31, 2019 and (c) the quarter ended June 30, 2019, in each case on or prior to October 31, 2020, (ii) after October 31, 2020, the Company timely filing its subsequent quarterly reports and Form 10-Q or its subsequent annual reports on Form 10-K with the SEC in the manner and within the time periods required under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act\"), and (iii) the Company maintaining the listing of its common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market. As a result, we have been in default under the terms of the High Trail Note since October 31, 2020 and at High Trail\u2019s option, High Trail can demand payment for the outstanding principal amount and the interest rate increased to 18% per annum. On April 8, 2021, High Trail provided notice to the Company that it was causing $6.0 million of the purchase price maintained in such blocked account to be transferred to High Trail in partial satisfaction of the amounts outstanding under the High Trail Note.\nOn April 29, 2021, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement, dated as of April 13, 2021, with two initial investors and other investors as may become party thereto from time to time (collectively, the \u201cSecond Lien Note Purchasers\u201d) providing for the issuance and sale by the Company of up to $6.0 million aggregate principal amount of its Senior Second Lien Notes and warrants (the \u201cApril 2021 Warrants\u201d) to purchase up to 5,000,000 shares of its common stock. The Senior Second Lien Notes and accompanying April 2021 Warrants may be sold from time to time to one or more Second Lien Note Purchasers under the terms of the purchase agreement. On April 29, 2021, the Company closed on the sale of Senior Second Lien Notes in the aggregate principal amount of approximately $1.79 million and April 2021 Warrants to purchase 1,490,000 shares of common stock under the purchase agreement for an aggregate purchase price of $1.49 million.\nOn November 30, 2020, we entered into a Forbearance Agreement (the \u201cForbearance Agreement\u201d) with High Trail. Under the terms of the Forbearance Agreement, High Trail agreed to forebear from exercising certain rights and remedies. High Trail agreed that it would not, directly or indirectly, exercise any right or remedy under any transaction document or take any other enforcement action in respect of the occurrence and continuance of any existing events of default, or encourage any other person to take or initiate any such enforcement action or other action through the forbearance termination date as defined as: (a) December 31, 2020 (or any later date agreed to in writing by High Trail); (b) the occurrence of any event of default (other than an existing event of default); and (c) the initiation of any action by the Company or any other person to invalidate or limit the enforceability of any of the acknowledgments set forth in the Forbearance Agreement. Subsequently, High Trail agreed to extend the forbearance termination date to March 31, 2021.\nOn May 24, 2020, the Company entered into the New Forbearance Agreement with High Trail under which (i) the Company again admitted it was in default under several obligations under the High Trail Note and related agreements, (ii) High Trail acknowledged such defaults and agreed not to exercise any right or remedy under the High Trail Note or the related securities purchase agreement, warrant or security documents, including its right to accelerate the aggregate amount outstanding under the High Trail Note, until the Outside Date, as the same may be extended from time to time in accordance with the terms of the New Forbearance Agreement.\nAs partial consideration for its agreement not to exercise any right or remedy under the High Trail Note and related documents, High Trail and the Company agreed to make certain changes to the documents. In this regard, the parties agreed to amend the \u201cEvent of Default Acceleration Amount\u201d definition in the High Trail Note so that the amount due and payable by the Company on account of an event of default would be an amount in cash equal to 125% of the then-outstanding principal and accrued and unpaid interest under the High Trail Note. This represents an increase from 120% of the then-outstanding principal and accrued and unpaid interest, and removes the market-price-based alternative for such acceleration amount.\nAdditionally, the parties also agreed that the principal amount outstanding under the High Trail Note would be increased by certain paid-in-kind amounts in full satisfaction of the Company\u2019s obligation to make payments of interest to High Trail on each of April 1, 2021 and May 1, 2021, which amounts were not paid by the Company in cash or Common Stock. In consideration of High Trail\u2019s agreement to enter into the New Forbearance Agreement and agree to the amendments to the High Trail Note, the Company agreed to pay High Trail a fee in the amount of $1.5 million. Accordingly, following these increases in the principal amount payable, but applying against the outstanding principal and such fee the $6.0 million previously\nPareteum Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Amounts in thousands except share and per share data and unless otherwise indicated)\nmaintained in a certain blocked account against that was foreclosed upon by High Trail, the total amount of principal outstanding under the High Trail Note as of the date of the New Forbearance Agreement was approximately $13.5 million.\nOn February 22, 2021, we issued a $2.4 million 8% Senior Second Lien Secured Convertible Note due 2025 (the \u201cSenior Second Lien Note\u201d) to an institutional investor and received $2.0 million. The aggregate purchase price for the Senior Second Lien Note was $2.0 million. The Senior Second Lien Notes are senior, secured obligations of the Company, but rank junior to the High Trail Note. Interest is payable monthly beginning April 1, 2021. The Senior Second Lien Note is secured by a second lien on substantially all assets of the Company and substantially all assets of its material U.S.-organized subsidiaries.\nBecause of the limited nature of the relief provided under the Forbearance Agreement, which does not lower the amounts payable in principal or interest, the limited amount of additional capital we have raised and can raise by selling Senior Second Lien Notes, and the foreclosure by High Trail on $6.0 million of the High Trail Note purchase price, the Company's management believes that it will not have sufficient resources to fund its operations and meet the obligations specified in the Senior Second Lien Note and any obligations under the High Trail Note for the next twelve months following the filing of this Annual Report. The Company's software platforms require ongoing funding to continue the current development and operational plans and we have a history of net losses. The Company will continue to expend substantial resources for the foreseeable future in connection with the continued development of its software platforms. These expenditures will include costs associated with research and development activity, corporate administration, business development, and marketing and selling of the Company's services. In addition, other unanticipated costs may arise.\nAs a result, the Company's management believes that additional capital will be required to fund the Company's operations and provide growth capital to meet the obligations under the High Trail Note and the Senior Second Lien Note. Accordingly, we will have to raise additional capital in one or more debt and/or equity offerings and continue to work with High Trail to enter into a new forbearance arrangement or agree to restructure the indebtedness owed to High Trail. Accordingly, our management has been actively exploring these and other options for addressing our liquidity issues. However, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in raising the necessary capital or that any such offering will be available to us on terms acceptable to us, or at all and that High Trail will forbear or restructure our indebtedness. If we are unable to raise additional capital that may be needed, this would have a material adverse effect on the Company. In particular, a decline in the market price of the Company's common stock, coupled with the stock\u2019s delisting from the Nasdaq Capital Market, could make it more difficult to sell equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem appropriate. The factors discussed above raise substantial doubt as to the Company's ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that these consolidated financial statements are issued.\nRevision of Previously Issued Financial Statements\nIn finalizing the financial reporting close process for the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company identified certain immaterial errors impacting prior reporting periods beginning as of and for the three months ended December 31, 2018 and subsequent annual and quarterly reporting periods through December 31, 2019. Specifically, the Company identified that it incorrectly translated the foreign currency impact on goodwill and intangible assets related to an acquisition completed in the fourth quarter of 2018. These immaterial errors also impacted the impairment charge recognized on these assets and amortization of the intangible assets.\nThe Company assessed the materiality of this correction to prior periods\u2019 financial statements in accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No. (SAB) 99, Materiality, and SAB 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements, and ASC 250, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections.\nIn accordance with ASC 250, the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements have been revised from the amounts previously reported to correct these immaterial errors as shown in the tables below and are reflected throughout the financial statements and related notes, as applicable.\nPareteum Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Amounts in thousands except share and per share data and unless otherwise indicated)\nThe Consolidated Balance Sheet has been revised to reflect the immaterial error as of December 31, 2019 as follows:\nAs of December 31, 2019\nConsolidated Balance Sheet As Reported Adjustment As revised\nAccumulated deficit (543,902) $ 4,409 $ (539,493)\nAccumulated other comprehensive loss (5,608) (4,409) (10,017)\nTotal stockholders' deficit (1,562) - (1,562)\nThe cumulative effect of adjustments required to correct the errors in the financial statements for years prior to 2019 are reflected in the revised opening goodwill, intangible assets, net, accumulated other comprehensive income and accumulated deficit balance as of January 1, 2019.

All material intercompany transactions and account balances have been eliminated in consolidation.\nForeign Currency Translation\nThe Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements were translated into U.S. dollars in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") ASC 830, Foreign Currency Matters (\u201cASC 830\u201d). The majority of the Company\u2019s operations are carried out in Euros. For all operations outside of the U.S., assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars using the period end exchange rates and the average exchange rates as to revenue and expenses, and capital accounts were translated at their historical exchange rates when the capital transaction occurred. In accordance with ASC 830, net gains and losses resulting from translation of foreign currency financial statements are included in the Statement of Changes in Series C Redeemable Preferred Stock and Stockholders\u2019 Deficit as Other comprehensive income (loss). Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss, under the line item \u201cOther income (expense), net\u201d.\nContingent Losses\nThe Company records a provision for contingent losses when it is both probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount or range of the loss can be reasonably estimated. An unfavorable outcome to any legal or regulatory matter, if material, could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s operations or its financial position, liquidity or results of operations. The Company expenses legal fees as incurred.\nPareteum Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Amounts in thousands except share and per share data and unless otherwise indicated)\nUse of Estimates\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and intangible assets acquired through acquisitions. Significant estimates include the bad debt allowance; revenue recognition; impairment of goodwill, intangible assets and long-lived assets; valuation of financial instruments; realization of deferred tax assets; useful lives of long-lived assets; share-based compensation and contingent losses. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents.\nRestricted Cash\nRestricted cash as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $6,479 and $1,455, respectively, and consists primarily of cash deposited in blocked accounts for the High Trail Note and as bank guarantees for, corporate credit cards and letters of credit issued to vendors related to contract performance.\nAccounts Receivable\nAccounts receivable are presented on the consolidated balance sheet net of estimated uncollectible amounts. The Company records an allowance for estimated uncollectible accounts in an amount approximating anticipated losses. Individual uncollectible accounts are written off against the allowance when collection of the individual accounts appears doubtful. In determining the amount of the allowance, the Company considers its historical level of credit losses. The Company also makes judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations, and the Company assesses current economic trends that might impact the level of credit losses in the future. The Company\u2019s allowances have generally been adequate to cover its actual credit losses. However, since the Company cannot reliably predict future changes in the financial stability of its customers, it cannot guarantee that its allowances will continue to be adequate. If actual credit losses are significantly greater than the allowance, the Company would increase its general and administrative expenses and increase its reported net losses. Conversely, if actual credit losses are significantly less than the Company's reserve, this would eventually decrease the Company\u2019s general and administrative expenses and decrease its reported net losses. Allowances are recorded primarily on a specific identification basis.\nOther Assets\nOther assets consist mainly of long-term deposits to various telecom carriers, facility deposits, and other deposits. The deposits are refundable at the termination of the business relationship with the carriers or at the end of the lease term.\nLeasing Arrangements\nThe Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating leases are included in right-of-use (\u201cROU\u201d) assets and lease liabilities in the Company\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheets. Finance leases are included in property and equipment, net and lease liabilities in the Company\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nROU assets represent the Company\u2019s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Company\u2019s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As the Company\u2019s leases do not generally provide an implicit rate, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. The implicit rate is used when it is readily determinable. The Company\u2019s lease agreements may have lease and non-lease components, which the Company accounts for as\nPareteum Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Amounts in thousands except share and per share data and unless otherwise indicated)\na single lease component under the available practical expedient. The Company\u2019s lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. Lease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and variable payments are recognized in the period they are incurred. The Company\u2019s lease agreements do not contain any residual value guarantees. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company's revenue represents amounts earned for its mobile and CPaaS solutions. The Company's solutions take many forms, but its revenue generally consists of fixed and/or variable charges for services delivered monthly under a combined services and SaaS model. The Company also offer discrete (one-time) services for implementation and for development of specific functionality to properly service its customers.\nThe following table presents the Company's revenue disaggregated by revenue source:\nYears Ended\nDecember 31,\n2020 2019\nMonthly Service $ 68,561 $ 61,206\nInstallation and Software Development 1,076 843\nTotal revenue $ 69,637 $ 62,049\nBoth monthly service revenue and installation and software development revenue are recognized over time.\nThe following table presents the Company's revenue disaggregated by geography, based on the billing addresses of its customers:\nYears Ended\nDecember 31,\n2020 2019\nInternational $ 43,053 $ 41,925\nUnited States 26,584 20,124\nTotal revenue $ 69,637 $ 62,049\nMonthly Service Revenue\nThe Company\u2019s performance obligations in monthly SaaS and service offerings are simultaneously received and consumed by the customer and therefore, are recognized over time. For recognition purposes, we do not unbundle such services into separate performance obligations. The Company typically bills its customer at the end of each month, with payment to be received shortly thereafter. The fees charged may include a combination of fixed and variable charges with the variable charges tied to the number of subscribers or some other measure of volume. Although the consideration may be variable, the volumes are estimable at the time of billing, with \u201ctrue-up\u201d adjustments occurring in the subsequent month.\nInstallation and Software Development Revenue\nThe Company\u2019s other revenue consist of installation and software development projects.\nInstallation represents the activities necessary for a customer to obtain access and connectivity to the Company\u2019s monthly SaaS and service offerings. While installation may require separate phases, it represents one promise within the context of the contract.\nSoftware development consists of programming and other services which add new functionality to a customer\u2019s existing or new service offering. Each development project defines its milestones and will have its own performance obligations.\nPareteum Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Amounts in thousands except share and per share data and unless otherwise indicated)\nRevenue is recognized over time if the installation and software development activities create an asset that has no alternative use for which the Company is entitled to receive payment for performance completed to date. If not, then revenue is not recognized until the applicable performance obligation is satisfied.\nArrangements with Multiple Performance Obligations\nThe Company\u2019s contracts with customers may include multiple performance obligations. For such arrangements, the Company allocates revenue to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. The Company generally determines standalone selling prices based on the prices charged to customers.\nContract Assets and Liabilities\nGiven the nature of the Company\u2019s services and contracts, it has no contract assets.\nThe Company records net billings in excess of revenue when payments are made in advance of the Company's performance, including amounts which are refundable.\nPayment terms vary by the type and location of the customer and the products or services offered. The term between invoicing and when payment is due is not significant. For certain products or services and customer types, payment is required before control is transferred or services are delivered to the customer.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue includes origination, termination, network and billing charges from telecommunications operators, costs of telecommunications service providers, supplies and materials, network costs, data center costs, facility costs of hosting network and equipment and costs of providing resale arrangements with long distance service providers, costs of leasing transmission facilities, international gateway switches for voice, data transmission services, and the cost of professional services of staff directly related to the generation of revenue, consisting primarily of employee-related costs associated with these services, including share-based compensation and the cost of subcontractors. Cost of revenue excludes depreciation and amortization.\nSegment Reporting\nThe segment reporting guidance in ASC 280, Segments Reporting (\u201cASC 280\u201d), defines operating segments as components of an enterprise for which discrete financial information is available and that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker (\u201cCODM\u201d) for purposes of allocating resources and in assessing performance. The Company has determined its Chief Executive Officer, together with its Chief Financial Officer, to be the CODM. During the assessment of segment reporting for each of the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company identified three operating segments. The three operating segments, Legacy Pareteum, Artilium and iPass, have been aggregated into one reportable segment as they have similar economic characteristics in that they provide communications connectivity through CPaaS to similar customers wishing to be connected to everything mobile. The results of this assessment also consider the impacts of recent acquisitions of Artilium and iPass and the way in which internally reported financial information is used by the CODM to make decisions and allocate resources.\nFair Value Measurements\nIn accordance with ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement (\u201cASC 820\u201d), fair value is the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability (i.e., the exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available.\nObservable inputs are those that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Company. Unobservable inputs reflect the Company\u2019s assumptions about the inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on the best information available in the circumstances.\nPareteum Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Amounts in thousands except share and per share data and unless otherwise indicated)\nThe fair value hierarchy is categorized into three levels based on the inputs as follows:\nLevel 1 - Quoted prices are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reported date.\nLevel 2 - Pricing inputs are other than quoted prices in active markets, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reported date. The nature of these financial instruments include cash instruments for which quoted prices are available but are traded less frequently, derivative instruments whose fair values have been derived using a model where inputs to the model are directly observable in the market and instruments that are fair valued using other financial instruments, the parameters of which can be directly observed.\nLevel 3 - Instruments that have little to no pricing observability as of the measurement date. These financial instruments are measured using management\u2019s best estimate of fair value, where the inputs into the determination of fair value require significant management judgment or estimation.\nThe degree of judgment exercised by the Company in determining fair value is greatest for assets categorized in Level 3. In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, for disclosure purposes, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement falls in its entirety is determined by the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.\nNonrecurring Fair Value Measurements\nThe Company\u2019s nonfinancial assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis include goodwill and intangible assets acquired in business combinations as well as fair value measurements used when performing its annual impairment test. The valuation methods used to determine fair value require a significant degree of management judgment to determine the key assumptions which include projected revenue and appropriate discount rates. As such, the Company classifies nonfinancial assets subjected to nonrecurring fair value adjustments as Level 3 measurements. The Company hired a third-party valuation expert to value the trade names, customer relationships and developed technology acquired as part of the acquisitions of Artilium and iPass due to the expertise required to model the assumptions used. At December 31, 2019, goodwill and certain intangible assets were impaired and written down to their fair value; see Note 4, Goodwill and Intangible Assets.\nRecurring Fair Value Measurements - Warrant Liability and Derivative Liability\nIn connection with the issuance of the High Trail Note on June 8, 2020, the Company identified various embedded conversion features that were required to be bifurcated upon issuance and recorded at fair value and then remeasured to fair value at each balance sheet date. In addition, the 15,000,000 warrants issued in connection with the issuance of the High Trail Note were classified as a liability and recorded at fair value and then remeasured to fair value at each balance sheet date (see Note 5, Debt and Series C Redeemable Preferred Stock).\nFinancial Instruments\nThe carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable, notes receivable, promissory notes (payable) and customer deposits approximate their fair values based on their short-term nature.\nThe recorded values of long-term debt, including the Series C Redeemable Preferred Stock, approximate their fair values, as interest approximates market rates (Level 2).\nShare-based Compensation\nThe Company follows the provisions of ASC 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation, (\u201cASC 718\u201d). ASC 718 requires all share-based payments to employees, directors and non-employees to be recognized in the statements of operations and comprehensive loss by measuring the fair value of the award on the date of grant and recognizing this fair value as expense using a straight-line method over the requisite service period, generally the vesting period. The Company estimates forfeitures at the time of grant and, if necessary, revises those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.\nPareteum Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Amounts in thousands except share and per share data and unless otherwise indicated)\nThe Company estimates the grant date fair value of stock-based payments that vest over time using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The use of the Black-Scholes option pricing model requires management to make assumptions with respect to the following:\nExpected Term\nThe expected term represents the period that the stock-based awards are expected to be outstanding. The Company uses the simplified method for estimating the expected term of the option, by taking the average between time to vesting and the contract term of the award. For warrants issued to nonemployees, the Company uses the contractual term of the warrant.\nExpected Volatility\nThe Company estimates expected volatility giving consideration to the expected term of the stock-based awards, and the calculated annual volatility by using the continuously compounded return calculated by using the Company's closing stock prices of an equal number of days prior to the grant-date (reference period). The annual volatility is used to determine the (cumulative) volatility of its common stock.\nRisk-free Interest Rate\nThe Company estimates the risk-free interest rate using the \u201cDaily Treasury Yield Curve Rates\u201d from the U.S. Treasury Department with a term equal to the reported rate or derived by using both spread in intermediate term and rates, to the expected term of the award.\nExpected Dividend Yield\nThe Company applies an expected dividend yield of zero after giving consideration to its current dividend policies as well as those anticipated in the future considering its current plans and projections.\nIncome Taxes\nCurrent income tax is based on the income or loss from ordinary activities adjusted for items that are non-assessable or disallowable for income tax purposes and is calculated using tax rates enacted at the balance sheet date. Deferred tax assets are recognized for the expected future tax benefit to be derived from various sources such as tax losses and tax credit carry-forwards. Establishment of a valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that net deferred tax assets will not be fully realized.\nIn the ordinary course of a global business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of revenue sharing and reimbursement arrangements among related entities, the identification of revenue and expenses that qualify for preferential tax treatment and assessment of the sustainability of tax positions is based on several factors including changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, settled audit issues and new audit activity.\nThe Company files federal income tax returns in the U.S., various U.S. state jurisdictions and various foreign jurisdictions. The Company\u2019s income tax returns are open to examination by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, generally for 3 years but can be extended to 6 years under certain circumstances. In other jurisdictions, the period for examinations depends on local legislation, typically ranging from three to eight years. The Company\u2019s policy is to record estimated interest and penalties on unrecognized tax benefits as part of its income tax provision.\nComprehensive Loss\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company\u2019s comprehensive loss consisted of net losses and foreign currency translation adjustments.\nBusiness Combinations\nThe Company's use of the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations in accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations (\u201cASC 805\u201d) requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions, including fair value estimates, as of the business combination date and to refine those estimates as necessary during the measurement period defined as the\nPareteum Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Amounts in thousands except share and per share data and unless otherwise indicated)\nperiod, not to exceed one year, in which the Company may adjust the provisional amounts recognized in a business combination.\nUnder the acquisition method of accounting, the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any non-controlling interests acquired in the acquisition are recognized as of the closing date for purposes of determining fair value. The Company measures goodwill as of the acquisition date as the excess of consideration transferred, over the net of the acquisition date fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Costs that the Company incurs to complete the business combination such as investment banking, legal and other professional fees are not considered part of consideration and the Company charges them to acquisition costs as they are incurred.\nDuring the measurement period, the Company adjusts the provisional amounts recognized at the acquisition date to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the measurement of the amounts recognized as of that date. Measurement period adjustments are recognized in the reporting period in which they are determined.\nGoodwill\nIn accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other, (\"ASC 350\"), the Company recognizes goodwill for the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in each business combination. Goodwill is not subject to amortization, but the Company tests it for impairment annually during its fourth quarter and whenever an event or change in circumstances indicates that the carrying value of the asset is impaired.\nUnder the guidance, the Company is permitted to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. The more-likely-than-not threshold is defined as having a likelihood of more than 50 percent. If it is not more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, there is no goodwill impairment. In the absence of sufficient qualitative factors indicating that it is more-likely-than-not that no impairment occurred, the Company performs a quantitative assessment by determining the fair value of the reporting unit and comparing the fair value to its book value. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its book value, goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired. If the book value exceeds fair value, the Company recognizes an impairment loss equal to the difference between book value and fair value.\nThe Company adopted ASU 2017-04, Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment effective January 1, 2020. The new standard simplified the subsequent measurement of goodwill by removing Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test, which step required a hypothetical purchase price allocation. Under the new standard, an impairment loss is recognized in the amount by which a reporting unit's carrying value exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill.\nDuring 2019, goodwill was impaired and written down to fair value; see Note 4, Goodwill and Intangible Assets.\nLong-lived Assets and Intangible Assets\nIn accordance with ASC 360, Property, Plant and Equipment, long-lived assets, including intangible assets subject to amortization, are carried at cost less accumulated amortization and impairment charges. Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets, between three and ten years. Long-lived assets, including intangible assets subject to amortization, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets or asset group may not be recoverable. Measurement of any impairment loss is based on the amount of the carrying value that exceeds the fair value of the asset or asset group. During 2019, certain intangible assets were impaired and written down to their fair value; see Note 4, Goodwill and Intangible Assets.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are initially recorded at cost and presented on the consolidated balance sheet net of accumulated depreciation and amortization. Additions and improvements are capitalized, while expenditures that do not enhance the assets or extend the useful life are charged to operating expenses as incurred. Included in property and equipment are certain costs related to the development of the Company\u2019s internally developed software technology platform.\nPareteum Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Amounts in thousands except share and per share data and unless otherwise indicated)\nThe Company has adopted the provisions of ASC 350-40, Internal-Use Software, and, as such, costs incurred in the preliminary stages of development are expensed as incurred. The Company capitalizes all costs related to software developed or obtained for internal use when management commits to funding the project; the preliminary project stage is completed and when technological feasibility is established. Software developed for internal use has generally been used to deliver hosted services to the Company\u2019s customers. Technological feasibility is considered to have occurred upon completion of a detailed program design that has been confirmed by documenting the product specifications, or to the extent that a detailed program design is not pursued, upon completion of a working model that has been confirmed by testing to be consistent with the product design. Once a new functionality or improvement is released for operational use, the asset is moved from the \u201cconstruction in progress\u201d category to a category subject to depreciation. In addition, account management also records equipment acquired from third parties, until it is ready for use. Capitalization of costs ceases when the project is substantially complete and ready for its intended use. Depreciation is applied using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets once the assets are placed in service.\nManagement evaluates the useful lives of these assets on an annual basis and tests for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets. There were no material impairment losses recognized in 2020 and 2019 related to property and equipment, internal use software and third-party software.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nIn August 2018, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued ASU 2018-15, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer\u2019s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement that is a Service Contract (\u201cASU 2018-15\u201d), which aligns the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software (and hosting arrangements that include an internal-use software license). ASU 2018-15 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019 and interim periods within those fiscal years. The guidance can be applied either prospectively to all implementation costs incurred after the date of adoption or retrospectively. The Company adopted this standard on January 1, 2020 on a prospective basis. The adoption of ASU 2018-15 did not have a material impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and financial statement disclosures.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-4, Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment, which simplifies the accounting for goodwill impairment testing by eliminating Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess, versus determining an implied fair value in Step 2 to measure the impairment loss. ASU 2017-4 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019. The Company adopted this standard on January 1, 2020. The adoption of ASU 2017-4 did not have a material impact on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820)-Disclosure Framework-Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement, to modify the disclosure requirements for fair value measurements. The standard adds, modifies, and removes previous disclosure requirements. Eliminated disclosures include items such as removing disclosures for the valuation process for Level 3 measurements, policy for timing of transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy and changes in unrealized gains and losses included in earnings for recurring Level 3 measurements held at the reporting period. The guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019. The Company adopted this standard on January 1, 2020 and it had no effect on the disclosures in the consolidated financial statements.\nIn November 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-8, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718) and Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Codification Improvements - Share-Based Consideration Payable to a Customer. Under this new guidance, share-based payment awards issued to a customer are recorded as a reduction of the transaction price in revenue with an amount measured under the grant-date fair value of the award. Changes in the measurement of the share-based payments after the grant date that are due to the form of the consideration are not included in the transaction price and are recorded elsewhere in the income statement. The award is measured and classified under ASC 718 for its entire term, unless the award is modified after it vests and the grantee is no longer a customer. The new guidance is effective in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company adopted this standard on January 1, 2020. The adoption of ASU 2019-8 did not have a material impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nPareteum Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Amounts in thousands except share and per share data and unless otherwise indicated)\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments,\u201d (\u201cASU 2016-13\u201d) which requires measurement and recognition of expected versus incurred credit losses for financial assets held. ASU 2016-13 is effective for the Company\u2019s annual and interim reporting periods beginning January 1, 2023, with early adoption permitted on January 1, 2019. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adoption of ASU 2016-13 on its consolidated financial statements.\nIn December 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes (\u201cASU 2019-12\u201d), which is intended to simplify various aspects related to accounting for income taxes. ASU 2019-12 removes certain exceptions to the general principles in Topic 740 and also clarifies and amends existing guidance to improve consistent application. ASU 2019-12 is effective for the Company beginning in fiscal 2021. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adoption of ASU 2019-12 on its consolidated financial statements.\nIn August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-6, Debt-Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging-Contracts in Entity\u2019s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity\u2019s Own Equity (\u201cASU 2020-6\u201d), which simplifies the accounting for convertible instruments by removing the separation models for (1) convertible debt with a cash conversion feature and (2) convertible instruments with a beneficial conversion feature. Upon adoption, a convertible debt instrument will be accounted for as a single liability at amortized cost unless (a) the convertible instrument contains features that require bifurcation as a derivative under ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging, or (b) the convertible debt instrument was issued at a substantial premium. These changes will reduce reported interest expense and increase reported net income for entities that have issued a convertible instrument that was bifurcated according to previously existing rules. ASU 2020-6 also requires the application of the if-converted method for calculating diluted earnings per share and the treasury stock method will be no longer available. The new guidance is effective for public entities excluding smaller reporting companies in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, with early adoption permitted no earlier than fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020. For public business entities that meet the definition of a smaller reporting company, the amendments in ASU 2020-6 are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2023. ASU 2020-6 is effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2024. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adoption of ASU 2020-6 on its consolidated financial statements.\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-4, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848), Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting (\"ASU 2020-4\"), which provides optional guidance for a limited period of time to ease the burden in accounting for (or recognizing the effects of) reference rate reform on financial reporting. This would apply to companies meeting certain criteria that have contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions that reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued because of reference rate reform. This standard is effective as of March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022 and may be applied to contract modifications made and hedging relationships entered into from the beginning of an interim period that includes or is subsequent to March 12, 2020. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adoption of ASU 2020-4 on its consolidated financial statements.\nNote 2. Acquisitions and Disposition\nAsset Disposition\nIn August 2020, the Company entered into an asset transfer agreement and a software license agreement with a data communications provider (the \"Purchaser\"), pursuant to which the Purchaser agreed to purchase certain property and equipment and software license related to a Mobile Virtual Network Enabler solution for total cash consideration of $12.3 million. The Purchaser paid $4.7 million in August 2020 and the remainder in December 2020 upon the completion of the transfer to the Purchaser. The Company recorded a gain on sale of assets of $10.8 million for the difference between the consideration received and the carrying value of the property and equipment and the software license.\nDevicescape Asset Purchase\nOn April 22, 2019, the Company, together with Devicescape Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (the \u201cHoldco\u201d and together with the Company, the \u201cBuyer\u201d) entered into an asset purchase agreement (the \u201cPurchase Agreement\u201d) with Devicescape Software, Inc., a California corporation (\u201cDevicescape\u201d), whereby the\nPareteum Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Amounts in thousands except share and per share data and unless otherwise indicated)\nBuyer acquired certain assets of Devicescape and assumed certain liabilities of Devicescape, such that Holdco continued as a surviving subsidiary of the Company holding the acquired assets and assuming those certain liabilities of Devicescape (the \u201cDevicescape Purchase\u201d). In connection with the Devicescape Purchase, and pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Purchase Agreement, the Company paid cash consideration of $2,000 and issued to the stockholders of Devicescape an aggregate of 400,000 shares of the Company\u2019s common stock at a value of $1,692 based on the closing price of the Company's common stock on April 22, 2019 of $4.23 per share.\nThe Devicescape Purchase has been treated as an asset purchase under U.S. GAAP. Under an asset purchase, assets are recognized based on their cost to the acquiring entity, which generally includes the transaction costs of the asset acquired and is allocated to the individual assets acquired or liabilities assumed based on their relative fair values and does not give rise to goodwill.\nThe allocation of the purchase price was as follows:\nPurchase consideration:\nCash consideration and transaction costs $ 2,137\nShares issued to stockholders 1,692\nTotal purchase consideration\n$ 3,829\nPurchase price allocation:\nAssets:\nAccounts receivable\n$ 71\nEscrow receivable\nIntangible assets\n3,646\nTotal assets\n3,917\nLiabilities:\nAccounts payable & other liabilities\nTotal liabilities\nEstimated fair value of net assets acquired $ 3,829\nThe fair value of intangible assets acquired was estimated as follows:\nEstimated\nFair Value Useful Life\n(Years)\nDeveloped technology $ 3,525 8\nCustomer relationships 121 8\nIntangible assets\n$ 3,646\nThe value of the developed technology intangible asset was calculated using the relief-from-royalty method, an income approach. The relief-from-royalty method measures the fair value of an asset by identifying the avoided royalty costs of licensing an asset of similar utility from a third party. The value of the customer relationships intangible asset was calculated using the excess earnings method of the income approach. The excess earnings method calculates the present value of the residual after-tax cash flows, or excess earnings, attributable to the subject intangible asset after certain deductions are applied for the use of the other assets that contribute to the generation of the cash flows.\niPass, Inc. Acquisition\nOn November 12, 2018, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the \u201ciPass Merger Agreement\u201d) by and among the Company, TBR, Inc., and iPass. Pursuant to the iPass Merger Agreement, TBR, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of\nPareteum Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Amounts in thousands except share and per share data and unless otherwise indicated)\nthe Company, commenced an offer for all of the shares of iPass it did not already own for the transaction consideration, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Prospectus/Offer to Exchange dated December 4, 2018 (together with any amendments and supplements thereto, the \u201cOffer to Exchange\u201d), and the related Letter of Transmittal. The Offer to Exchange and withdrawal rights expired at 5:00 p.m. New York City time on February 12, 2019, and promptly following such time TBR, Inc. accepted for payment and promptly paid for all validly tendered iPass shares in accordance with the terms of the Offer to Exchange. The Company acquired 100% of the voting shares of iPass.\nOn February 12, 2019, Pareteum Corporation entered into the Consent with iPass SPV, and Fortress Credit Corp. (together with its affiliates, \u201cFortress\u201d). Also, on February 12, 2019 the Company entered into the Joinder to Security Agreement, the Joinder to Guarantee and the Pledge Agreement, each for the benefit of or with Fortress, guaranteeing the Loan and granting a first-priority security interest in all of the assets of the Company to Fortress. Pursuant to the Consent, Fortress consented to the consummation of the iPass Merger Agreement. The Company paid Fortress a cash fee of $150 and issued to Fortress warrants to purchase an aggregate of 325,000 shares of common stock.\nOn February 12, 2019, following acceptance and payment for the validly tendered iPass shares and pursuant to the terms and conditions of the iPass Merger Agreement, the Company completed its acquisition of iPass from the stockholders of iPass when TBR, Inc. merged with and into iPass, with iPass surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (the \u201cMerger\u201d). The Merger was governed by Section 251(h) of the Delaware General Corporation Law, as amended with no stockholder vote required to consummate the Merger. At the effective time of the Merger, each iPass share outstanding was converted into the right to receive the transaction consideration. The iPass shares are no longer listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market.\nBased on the terms of the iPass Merger Agreement, the Company issued 9,865,412 shares of common stock to former stockholders of iPass. In accordance with ASC 805, the Company recognized a settlement of a pre-existing relationship in the form of a software license that the Company purchased from iPass on May 8, 2018, on the acquisition date, which is included in consideration transferred. The aggregate consideration transferred totaled $30,141, which consisted of: i) 9,865,412 shares issued to the former stockholders of iPass valued at $28,610 (based on the Company\u2019s closing stock price of $2.90 per share on February 12, 2019) and ii) non-monetary consideration relating to the settlement of the pre-existing relationship software license of $1,531, which approximates the estimated fair value at the date of acquisition.\nThe allocation of the purchase price was as follows:\nPurchase price allocation:\nAssets:\nCash and cash equivalents\n$ 860\nAccounts receivable\n4,344\nProperty, plant and equipment\nOther assets\n4,890\nIntangible assets\n11,106\nTotal assets\n22,073\nLiabilities:\nAccounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities\n$ 17,207\nDeferred revenue\n1,700\nLoans outstanding\n9,989\nOther liabilities\nTotal liabilities\n29,753\nEstimated fair value of net assets acquired (7,680)\nGoodwill $ 37,821\nOn February 26, 2019, concurrently with the Company entering into a credit agreement with Post Road Administrative Finance, LLC and its affiliate Post Road Special Opportunity Fund I LLP (see Note 5, Debt and Series C Redeemable Preferred Stock -\nPareteum Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Amounts in thousands except share and per share data and unless otherwise indicated)\nFormer Post Road Group Debt Facility), the Company paid approximately $11,000 for payment in full of the outstanding secured debt assumed in the acquisition of iPass owed to Fortress and recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of approximately $1,000.\nThe consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 included iPass and its subsidiaries from the closing date of February 12, 2019 through December 31, 2020.\nThe fair value of intangible assets acquired was estimated as follows:\nEstimated\nFair Value Useful Life\n(Years)\nDeveloped technology $ 2,585 8\nCustomer relationships 8,378 5\nTrade name 143 2\nIntangible assets\n$ 11,106\nThe value of the developed technology intangible asset was calculated using the relief-from-royalty method, an income approach. The value of the customer relationships intangible asset was calculated using the excess earnings method of the income approach. The value of the trade name intangible asset was calculated using the relief-from-royalty method.\nThe weighted-average useful life of the intangible assets acquired is estimated at 5.7 years.\nNote 3. Supplemental Balance Sheet Information\nSupplemental information for certain Consolidated Balance Sheet accounts as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 are as follows:\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets December 31,\n2020 December 31,\nPrepaid insurance and legal fees $ 536 $ 762\nPrepaid software license and support 471 890\nPrepaid payroll taxes 196 214\nPrepaid expenses-other 1,337 714\nValued added tax 738 591\nOther receivables 64 451\nOther assets 330 831\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets\n$ 3,672 $ 4,453\nNotes Receivable December 31,\n2020 December 31,\nValidSoft $ 300 $ 512\nYonder Media Mobile - 3,355\nReserve - Yonder Media Mobile - (3,355)\nNote Receivables $ 300 $ 512\nThe ValidSoft note bears interest at 5% and, pursuant to an amendment dated June 2020, matured March 31, 2021.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets\nDuring the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2020, the Company performed its annual impairment test for goodwill and determined that there was no indication of impairment and accordingly, no further testing was performed.\nDuring the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2019, the Company performed its annual impairment test for goodwill. As a result of the deteriorating business conditions, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $156,765 during the year ended December 31, 2019 related to goodwill and intangible assets associated with the Company\u2019s acquisitions of iPass and Artilium.\nThe Company operates in a single reportable segment. The impairment test indicated that the net book value of goodwill associated with the Company\u2019s acquisitions of iPass and Artilium exceeded their implied fair value. The Company utilized the income approach to determine the enterprise value of the Company in its goodwill impairment test. The fair value was based on forecasted future cash flows discounted back to the present value; significant judgments related to the risk adjusted discount rates, terminal growth rates and weighted-average cost of capital. The intangible assets acquired in the iPass and Artilium acquisitions also indicated an impairment as the carrying values exceeded the fair value determined in the impairment test. The impairment charge for goodwill and finite-lived intangible assets represented the amount by which the carrying values exceed their estimated fair values.\nPareteum Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Amounts in thousands except share and per share data and unless otherwise indicated)\nChanges in goodwill were as follows:\nGoodwill\nBalance at December 31, 2018 $ 101,375\nBusiness acquisition 37,821\nImpairment (125,923)\nForeign currency translation (3,174)\nBalance at December 31, 2019 $ 10,099\nForeign currency translation 944\nBalance at December 31, 2020 $ 11,043\nIntangible assets consisted of the following:\nAs of December 31, 2020\nIntangible Assets Gross\nCarrying\nAmount Accumulated\nAmortization Accumulated Impairment Foreign Currency Translation Total\nDeveloped technology $ 26,829 $ (5,792) $ (14,651) $ (520) $ 5,866\nCustomer relationships 25,300 (3,972) (14,434) (454) 6,440\nTrade names 3,544 (1,050) (1,757) (45) 692\nTotal $ 55,673 $ (10,814) $ (30,842) $ (1,019) $ 12,998\nAs of December 31, 2019\nIntangible Assets Gross\nCarrying\nAmount Accumulated\nAmortization Accumulated Impairment Foreign Currency Translation Total\nDeveloped technology $ 26,829 $ (4,800) $ (14,651) $ (623) $ 6,755\nCustomer relationships 25,300 (2,409) (14,434) (511) 7,946\nTrade names 3,544 (885) (1,757) (103) 799\nTotal $ 55,673 $ (8,094) $ (30,842) $ (1,237) $ 15,500\nAt December 31, 2020, the estimated useful lives of its intangible assets by category was 8 years, 5 to 8 years and 2 to 6 years for developed technology, customer relationships and trade names, respectively. The change in the estimated useful lives from the estimates at the acquisition dates was due to diminished expectations of the future periods that would benefit from the Company's original estimates. At December 31, 2020, the weighted-average amortization period for intangible assets was 5.2 years. At December 31, 2020, the weighted-average amortization periods for developed technology, customer relationships, and trade names was 6.7 years, 4.1 years and 4.6 years, respectively.\nAmortization expense related to intangible assets for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $2,720 and $6,820, respectively.\nThe estimated annual amortization expense related to finite-lived intangible assets as of December 31, 2020, is as follows:\nYear Ending December 31, Amortization\n2021 $ 2,765\n2022 $ 2,715\n2023 $ 2,715\n2024 $ 2,715\n2025 and thereafter $ 2,088\n$ 12,998\nPareteum Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Amounts in thousands except share and per share data and unless otherwise indicated)\nNote 5.

Since October 31, 2020, the Company has been in default under the High Trail Note and as of December 31, 2020, the Company has classified the High Trail Note as a current liability on the consolidated balance sheet.\nOn June 8, 2020, the Company received $4.0 million of the $14.0 million and incurred legal fees of $469. The remaining $10.0 million balance was received by the Company but was deposited into a blocked bank account based on terms of a Control Agreement. Under the terms of the Control Agreement, the Company has no right or any other right or ability to control, access, pick up, withdraw or transfer, deliver or dispose of items or funds from the blocked account. Under the terms of the High Trail Note, the remaining $10.0 million balance was to be released to the Company subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions as follows:\n\u2022$3.0 million when the Company receives $4.0 million in additional financing. The Company received the additional financing in July 2020 and the $3.0 million was released to the Company to be used for working capital purposes.\n\u2022$7.0 million when the Company meets certain specified conditions (the \u201cSpecified Conditions\u201d) on or prior to October 31, 2020 the \u201cSpecified Conditions Date\u201d). The $7.0 million will be reported as restricted cash until the Specified Conditions are met on the Specified Conditions Date.\nOn April 8, 2021, High Trail provided notice to the Company that it was causing $6.0 million of the purchase price maintained in such blocked account to be transferred to High Trail in partial satisfaction of the amounts outstanding under the High Trail Note.\nThe Specified Conditions include satisfaction of certain equity conditions and other conditions as of any date and on each of the 20 previous trading days prior to such date as defined in the High Trail Note. The satisfaction of the certain equity conditions includes:\n\u2022the Company\u2019s being able to issue shares of its common stock upon conversion that are not subject to restrictions on resale;\n\u2022High Trail, upon conversion of any portion of the High Trail Note, not beneficially owning in excess of 4.99% of the Company\u2019s outstanding common stock;\n\u2022the Company at all times having sufficient authorized and unissued shares of its common stock available for the issuance of common stock upon conversion equal to the outstanding principal amount plus accrued interest;\n\u2022the average daily volume-weighted-average price per share of the Company\u2019s common stock being not less than $0.50 per share (for a common stock change event as defined in the High Trail Note) and the daily dollar trading volume (as reported on Bloomberg) for the Company\u2019s common stock on such date and for at least 17 of the prior 20 trading days being not less than $750;\n\u2022there being no defaults or events of a default that have occurred or are continuing;\n\u2022the Company having obtained the requisite stockholder approval required by the Nasdaq Stock Market for the issuance of the shares of its common stock upon conversion;\n\u2022the average daily volume-weighted average price per share of the Company\u2019s common stock being not less than $0.85 per share (for a common stock change event as defined in the High Trail Note); and\n\u2022the absence of any defaults or events of default.\nThe High Trail Note contains customary events of default, as well as events of default if the Company fails to use reasonable efforts to obtain the approval of its stockholders of the issuance of the shares issuable upon conversion by October 31, 2020, the Company\u2019s shares cease to be traded on the Nasdaq Stock Market, or the Company fails to restate its financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2019 and the quarters ended March 31, 2019 and June 30, 2019, in each case, prior to October 31, 2020 or fails to timely file its subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q or its subsequent annual reports on Form 10-K with the SEC in the manner and within the time periods required by the Exchange Act. As of October 31, 2020, the High Trail Note was in default due to the Company not meeting the following conditions which are defined as existing event of defaults:\nPareteum Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Amounts in thousands except share and per share data and unless otherwise indicated)\n(i) the Company\u2019s failure, as of October 2, 2020, to have caused either: (i) the conversion or exchange of all shares of the Series C Redeemable Preferred Stock into shares of the Company\u2019s common stock or (ii) the extension of any mandatory redemption date, final maturity date or other applicable repurchase obligation with respect to such Series C Redeemable Preferred Stock by October 1, 2020;\n(ii) the Company\u2019s failure, as of November 1, 2020, to have obtained the requisite stockholder approval by October 31, 2020; and the Company\u2019s failure to have used commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the requisite stockholder approval by October 31, 2020;\n(iii) the Company\u2019s failure to have timely filed all reports required to be filed with the SEC pursuant to the Exchange Act;\n(iv) the Company\u2019s failure after October 31, 2020 to timely file its quarterly reports on Form 10-Q or its annual reports on Form 10-K with the SEC in the manner and within the time periods required by the Exchange Act; and\n(v) the Company\u2019s failure, as of November 1, 2020, to file restated financial statements with the SEC for (A) the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, (B) the quarter ended March 31, 2019 and (C) the quarter ended June 30, 2019, in each case on or prior to October 31, 2020 and in compliance with all requirements under the Exchange Act.\nBeginning on October 1, 2020, and on the first day of each calendar month thereafter, at the election of High Trail, the Company can be required to redeem a portion of the High Trail Note equal to the applicable optional redemption payment which is $3.5 million, as determined by High Trail in its sole discretion; provided, that High Trail and the Company may agree to increase the size of any optional redemption payment by mutual written consent; and provided, further, that in no event shall the amount of any optional redemption payment exceed the then outstanding principal amount of the High Trail Note on each redemption date.\nIf the Company elects the option to pay an optional redemption payment in shares of its common stock on any optional redemption date, High Trail shall have the right to allocate all or any portion of the applicable optional redemption payment (or applicable portion thereof) to one or more scheduled trading days during the period beginning on, and including, the applicable optional redemption date and ending on, and including, the scheduled trading day immediately before the subsequent optional redemption date or defer such optional redemption payment (or applicable portion thereof) to any future optional redemption date selected by High Trail.\nThe High Trail Note has a stated interest rate of 8% per year, payable monthly in arrears at the Company\u2019s option in cash or shares of its common stock or a combination of both cash and shares of the Company\u2019s common stock beginning on August 1, 2020.\nIf the Company fails to pay any amount payable on this High Trail Note on or before the due date as provided in the High Trail Note, then, regardless of whether such failure constitutes an event of default, or a default or event of default occurs as set forth in the High Trail Note (such amount payable or the principal amount outstanding as of such failure to pay or default or event of default, (as applicable, a \u201cDefaulted Amount\u201d), then in each case, interest (\u201cDefault Interest\u201d) will accrue on such Defaulted Amount at a rate per annum equal to 18%, from, and including, such due date or the date of such default or event of default, as applicable, to, but excluding, the date such failure to pay or default or event of default is cured and all outstanding Default Interest under the High Trail Note has been paid, as applicable.\nFrom August 1, 2020 through October 31, 2020, the Company paid interest expense of $818 to High Trail. On December 1, 2020, the Company issued 1,093,750 shares of its common stock for payment of November 2020 accrued interest of $263 (based on default interest rate of 18%). On January 1, 2021, the Company issued 583,334 shares of its common stock for payment of the December 2020 accrued interest of $263 (based on default interest rate of 18%). For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recognized interest expense $1,081.\nIf the Company elects to pay the stated interest (or any applicable portion thereof) in shares of its common stock, High Trail has the right to allocate all or any portion of the applicable payment of the stated interest (or applicable portion thereof) to one or more scheduled trading days as defined in the High Trail Note during the period beginning on, and including, the applicable interest payment date and ending on, and including, the scheduled trading day immediately before the subsequent interest\nPareteum Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Amounts in thousands except share and per share data and unless otherwise indicated)\npayment date (or defer such payment of the stated interest (or applicable portion thereof) to any future interest payment date selected by High Trail.\nThe number of shares of common stock to be issued by the Company for payment for both the optional redemption payment and the stated interest amounts are determined as set forth in the High Trail Note by dividing the optional redemption and stated interest amounts by the market stock payment price. The market stock payment price is defined in the High Trail Note as the greater of: (A) $0.10 the floor price or (B) 85% of the lowest average daily volume-weighted-average price per share of the Company\u2019s common stock during the 10 trading day period ending on the trading day immediately prior to such interest payment or the optional redemption payment payable in shares of common stock. In the event that the number of shares of the Company\u2019s common stock issued to High Trail on any optional redemption date and the interest payment date is reduced as a result of the floor price, the Company will be required to pay to High Trail an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of common stock by which the applicable optional redemption payment and interest payment amount (or portion thereof) was reduced as a result of the floor price, multiplied by the market stock payment price.\nThe High Trail Note is convertible into shares of the Company\u2019s common stock including any portion constituting an optional redemption payment amount and other circumstances as set forth in the High Trail Note at High Trail\u2019s election. The conversion rate is equal to 1,666.667 shares of the Company\u2019s common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the High Trail Note, or $0.60 per share.\nThe Specified Conditions conversion rate is computed as follows: per $1,000 principal amount of the High Trail Notes divided by the last reported stock price on the trading date prior to the additional financing date multiplied by 105% on the weighted-average price of the Company\u2019s common stock in respect of the period from the scheduled open of trading until the scheduled close of trading immediately before the Specified Conditions Date, which the Company has not yet met.\nUpon an event of default, the conversion rate applicable to such conversion will be increased by a number of shares equal to the event of default additional shares, which is defined in the High Trail Note as an amount equal to the excess, if any, of (A) the event of default conversion rate, which is defined in the High Trail Note as an amount (rounded to the nearest 1/10,000th of a share of the Company\u2019s common stock (with 5/100,000ths rounded upward)) equal to (A) $1,000 divided by (B) the event of default conversion price applicable to such conversion. The event of default conversion price as defined in the High Trail Note is the greater of (i) the Floor Price ($0.10) and (ii) the lesser of (A) the conversion price that would be in effect immediately after the close of business on the conversion date for such conversion as defined in the High Trail Note and (B) 75% of the lowest daily volume-weighted-average price per share of the Company\u2019s common stock during the 10 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, such conversion date (or, if such conversion date is not a trading day, the immediate preceding trading day).\nThe High Trail Note is secured by a first lien on substantially all assets of the Company and substantially all assets of its material U.S. organized subsidiaries and the assets of Pareteum Europe BV, a subsidiary organized in the Netherlands. In addition, the High Trail Note contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, including restrictions on indebtedness, liens, dividends, distributions, acquisitions, investments, sale or transfer of assets, transactions with affiliates and maintenance of certain financial ratios.\nAll payments due under the High Trail Note rank senior to all other indebtedness of the Company to the extent of the value of the collateral and any Subordinated Indebtedness.\nIf the Company undergoes a fundamental change as set forth in the High Trail Note, High Trail will have the right to require the Company to repurchase all or part of the High Trail Note in cash equal to of the greater of (i) 120% of the then outstanding principal amount of the High Trail Note (or portion thereof) and (ii) 120% of the product of (A) the conversion rate in effect as of the trading day immediately preceding the effective date of such fundamental change; (B) the principal amount of this High Trail Note to be repurchased upon a fundamental change divided by $1,000; and (C) the highest daily volume weighted-average price per share of the Company\u2019s common stock occurring during the 30 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the trading day immediately before the effective date of such fundamental change.\nIf the Company enters into a bankruptcy proceeding as set forth in the High Trail Note, the then-outstanding portion of the principal amount and all accrued and unpaid interest will immediately become due and payable (automatic accelerations).\nPareteum Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Amounts in thousands except share and per share data and unless otherwise indicated)\nIn addition, at High Trail\u2019s option, (optional acceleration), the High Trail Note will become due and payable immediately in cash in an amount equal to a default acceleration amount upon certain events of default as set forth in the High Trail Note, which includes, the Company not filing its restated financial statements with the SEC for (A) the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, (B) the quarter ended March 31, 2019, and (C) the quarter ended June 30, 2019, in each case on or prior to October 31, 2020 and in compliance with all requirements under the Exchange Act and after October 31, 2020.\nThe default acceleration amount is equal to the greater of (A) 120% of the then outstanding principal amount of this High Trail Note plus accrued and unpaid interest; and (B) 120% of the product of (i) the conversion rate in effect as of the trading day immediately preceding the date such notice is delivered; (ii) the total then outstanding principal portion of the High Trail Note plus accrued and unpaid interest; and (iii) the greater of (x) the highest daily volume-weighted average price per share of the Company\u2019s common stock occurring during the 30 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the trading day immediately before the date the notice of default is delivered and (y) the highest daily volume-weighted average price per share of the Company's common stock occurring the 30 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the trading day immediately before the date the applicable event of default occurred.\nThe Company recorded a debt discount of $3.5 million for the difference between the face amount of the $17.5 million and the $14.0 million cash received. In addition, the Company incurred $469 of financing costs that are recorded as debt issuance costs. Both the debt discount and debt issuance costs are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as a direct deduction from the face amount of the High Trail Note which are being amortized using the straight-line method through April 1, 2025 as interest expense.\nOn November 30, 2020, the Company and High Trail entered into a Forbearance Agreement. Under the terms of the Forbearance Agreement, High Trail agreed to forebear from exercising certain rights and remedies. High Trail agreed that it would not, directly or indirectly, exercise any right or remedy under any transaction document or take any other enforcement action in respect of the occurrence and continuance of any existing event of default (as explained above), or encourage any other person to take or initiate any such enforcement action or other action through the forbearance termination date as defined as: (a) December 31, 2020 (or any later date agreed to in writing by High Trail; (b) the occurrence of any event of default (other than an existing event of default); and (c) the initiation of any action by the Company or any other person to invalidate or limit the enforceability of any of the acknowledgments set forth in the Forbearance Agreement.\nAs a condition of the Forbearance Agreement, the Company and High Trail agreed that if the Company elects the option to pay either the optional redemption payment or the stated interest in shares of its common stock, the market stock payment price was amended to remove the floor price of $0.10, such that the price would be is: an amount equal to 85% of the lowest daily volume-weighted-average price per share of the Company\u2019s common stock during the 10 trading days immediately prior to such interest payment date or optional redemption stock payment date.\nIn addition, the event of default conversion price was changed to remove the floor price of $0.10, such that the conversion price would be equal to the lesser of (A) the conversion price that would be in effect immediately after the close of business on the conversion date for such conversion as defined in the High Trail Note, and (B) 75% of the lowest daily volume-weighted-average price per share of the Company\u2019s common stock during the 30 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, such conversion date (or, if such conversion date is not a trading day, the immediately preceding trading day).\nOn December 23, 2020, High Trail agreed to release $1.0 million of the $7.0 million that was held in the blocked bank account based on terms of a Control Agreement until the Specified Conditions were met by October 31, 2020 to the Company for working capital purposes even though the Specified Conditions were not met. In consideration for High Trail agreeing to release the $1.0 million, the Company increased the initial conversion rate to 2,702.702 from 1,666.6667 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the High Trail Note, which resulted in a decrease to the conversion price to $0.37 from $0.60\nSubsequently, High Trail agreed to extend the forbearance termination date to March 31, 2021. On April 8, 2021, High Trail provided notice to the Company that it was causing $6.0 million of the purchase price maintained in such blocked account to be transferred to High Trail in partial satisfaction of the amounts outstanding under the High Trail Note.\nOn May 24, 2020, the Company entered into the New Forbearance Agreement with High Trail under which (i) the Company again admitted it was in default under several obligations under the High Trail Note and related agreements, (ii) High Trail\nPareteum Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Amounts in thousands except share and per share data and unless otherwise indicated)\nacknowledged such defaults and agreed not to exercise any right or remedy under the High Trail Note or the related securities purchase agreement, warrant or security documents, including its right to accelerate the aggregate amount outstanding under the High Trail Note, until the Outside Date, as the same may be extended from time to time under the terms of the New Forbearance Agreement.\nAs partial consideration for its agreement not to exercise any right or remedy under the High Trail Note and related documents, High Trail and the Company agreed to make certain changes to the documents. In this regard, the parties agreed to amend the \u201cEvent of Default Acceleration Amount\u201d definition in the High Trail Note so that the amount due and payable by the Company on account of an event of default would be an amount in cash equal to 125% of the then-outstanding principal and accrued and unpaid interest under the High Trail Note. This represents an increase from 120% of the then-outstanding principal and accrued and unpaid interest, and removes the market-price-based alternative for such acceleration amount.\nAdditionally, the parties also agreed that the principal amount outstanding under the High Trail Note would be increased by certain paid-in-kind amounts in full satisfaction of the Company\u2019s obligation to make payments of interest to High Trail on each of April 1, 2021 and May 1, 2021, which amounts were not paid by the Company in cash or Common Stock. In consideration of High Trail\u2019s agreement to enter into the New Forbearance Agreement and agree to the amendments to the High Trail Note, the Company agreed to pay the lender a fee in the amount of $1.5 million. Accordingly, following these increases in the principal amount payable, but applying against the outstanding principal and such fee the $6.0 million previously maintained in a certain blocked account against that was foreclosed upon by High Trail, the total amount of principal outstanding under the High Trail Note as of the date of the New Forbearance Agreement was approximately $13.5 million.\nDerivative liability\nThe High Trail Note included conversion features that allow for a change in the conversion rate in connection with certain equity issuances, payments based on a fundamental change feature and payments based on certain events of defaults that are required to be bifurcated and were accounted for as a single compound derivative liability. The compound derivative liability that, upon issuance, is recorded at fair value and then remeasured separately at each reporting date with the changes in fair value recognized in other income (expense), net in the Company\u2019s consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss under ASC 815 Derivatives and Hedging (\"ASC 815\").\nThe Company estimated the fair value of the compound derivative liability using a Monte Carlo Simulation, which utilizes inputs including the Company\u2019s common stock price, probability assumptions, its historical volatility, risk-free rate and time to maturity. The estimated fair values are a Level 3 measurement as defined by ASC 820, as it is based on significant inputs not observable in the market.\nOn June 8, 2020, the initial estimated fair value of the compound derivative liability was $785 and recorded as a debt discount on the consolidated balance sheet as a direct deduction from the face amount of the High Trail Note which is being amortized using the straight-line method since the redemption amounts are not fixed and, in addition, are contingent upon High Trail exercising the redemption amounts through April 1, 2025. The amortization of the initial fair value of the compound derivative liability is recorded to interest expense.\nAt December 31, 2020, the estimated fair value of the compound derivative liability was $1,053. As a result, for the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recognized as other expense $268 in its consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss for the change in the difference between the estimated fair value of the compound derivative liability at June 8, 2020 and at December 31, 2020.\nWarrant liability\nIn connection with High Trail Note, the Company granted a warrant to purchase 15,000,000 shares of its common stock to High Trail at an exercise price of $0.58 per share expiring on June 8, 2025 (5 years). The warrant is not indexed to the Company\u2019s own stock under ASC 815, therefore, this warrant is classified as a liability and subsequently measured at fair value with the changes in fair value recognized in other income (expense), net in the Company\u2019s consolidated statements of operations. On November 30, 2020, per the Forbearance Agreement, the exercise price of the warrant was reduced to $0.37 per share.\nThe fair value of the warrants at June 8, 2020 and December 31, 2020 was estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model using the assumptions described below. At each date, the Company\u2019s stock price and the exercise price of the warrant, the expected volatility based on the Company\u2019s historical volatility over the remaining contractual term of the warrant and the risk-free interest rate, which was based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve over the remaining contractual term of the warrant.\nPareteum Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Amounts in thousands except share and per share data and unless otherwise indicated)\nThe following table presents the fair value of the warrant liability and inputs to the Black-Scholes option pricing valuation model used for the periods noted:\nWarrant liability June 8, 2020 Fair Value Adjustment December 31, 2020\nExpected volatility 128 % 135 %\nRisk-free rate 0.45 % 0.36 %\nRemaining contractual term (years) 5.0 4.4\nExpected dividends None None\nWarrant liability $ 7,256 $ 512 $ 7,768\nThe initial fair value of the warrant liability totaling $7,256 was recorded as a debt discount on the consolidated balance sheet as a direct deduction from the face amount of the High Trail Note, which is being amortized using the straight-line method through April 1, 2025 as interest expense.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recognized as other expense $512 in its consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss for the change in the difference between the estimated fair value of the warrant at June 8, 2020 and at December 31, 2020.\nAt December 31, 2020, the net carrying amount of the High Trail Note is as follows:\nSenior secured convertible note, net December 31, 2020\nOutstanding principal amount $ 17,500\nUnamortized debt discount and debt issuance costs (10,845)\nSenior secured convertible note, net $ 6,655\nA summary of the components of the amortization expense recorded in interest expense relating to the High Trail Note for the year ended December 31, 2020 is as follows:\nSenior secured convertible note, net - Components of amortization December 31, 2020\nAmortization of debt discount $ 339\nAmortization of debt issuance costs 45\nAmortization of High Trail warrant 704\nAmortization of embedded derivatives 76\nTotal amortization $ 1,164\nSeries C Redeemable Preferred Stock\nOn December 24, 2019, the Company issued 105 shares of 8% Series C Redeemable Preferred Stock (the \u201cSeries C Redeemable Preferred Stock\u201d) with a stated value of $100,000 per share in a private placement transaction exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"Securities Act\"), for an aggregate purchase price of $5,033. The Company received net proceeds of $4,478 after deducting legal fees of $361 and $193 of proceeds was remitted to an escrow account, recorded as \u201cPrepaid expenses and other current assets\u201d on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2020, and subsequently remitted to the Company in January 2020.\nIn a series of transactions from February 21, 2020 through August 18, 2020, the Company issued an additional 113 shares of Series C Redeemable Preferred Stock for gross proceeds of $8,850. The Company received net proceeds of $8,385 after deducting transaction costs of $465.\nThe Series C Redeemable Preferred Stock requires mandatory redemption one year after issuance at the stated value together with the 8% dividend and a 12.5% premium. Such redemption dates ranged from December 24, 2020 through August 18, 2021. Redemption terms were subsequently modified by the Series C Exchange Agreements, as described below. Through the date of this report, none of the Series C Redeemable Preferred Stock have been redeemed or exchanged.\nPareteum Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Amounts in thousands except share and per share data and unless otherwise indicated)\nThe Series C Redeemable Preferred Stock was accounted for as a liability in accordance with ASC 480, \u201cDistinguishing Liabilities from Equity\u201d (\"ASC 480\"). Accordingly, on December 24, 2019, the Company recorded a liability of $10,533 equal to the stated value of the issued shares and a debt discount of $5,500 representing the difference between the stated value and the gross proceeds of $5,033. Additionally, from February 21, 2020 through August 18, 2020, the Company recorded a liability of $11,234 equal to the stated value of the issued shares and a debt discount of $2,384 representing the difference between the stated value and the gross proceeds of $8,850.\nThe debt discount is being amortized using the effective interest method. Transaction costs were also recorded as debt discounts and are being amortized over the same period. Additionally, the 8% dividend is accrued over the same period and the 12.5% redemption premium is accreted through the redemption dates, both recorded to \u201cInterest expense, net\u201d on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nThe components of the Series C redeemable preferred stock liability as of December 31, 2019 consisted of the following:\nDecember 31,\nSeries C Redeemable Preferred Stock, stated value $ 10,533\nUnamortized debt discount (5,776)\nAccretion of redemption premium 25\nAccrued dividend 16\nSeries C Redeemable Preferred Stock, net\n$ 4,798\nThe components of financing expense related to the Series C Redeemable Preferred Stock liability classified within \u201cInterest expense, net\u201d on the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2019 consisted of the following:\nAmortization of debt discount $ 85\nAccretion of redemption premium 25\nAccrual of dividends 16\nTotal interest expense $ 126\nBy their terms, shares of Series C Redeemable Preferred Stock were not convertible into or exchangeable for other securities of the Company. However, on various dates from July 17, 2020 through October 29, 2020, the Company entered into Exchange Agreements with all of the holders of Series C Redeemable Preferred Stock (collectively, the \u201cExchange Agreements\u201d) that effectively modified certain terms of the Series C Redeemable Preferred Stock as described below.\nUnder the terms of the Exchange Agreements, the mandatory redemption date was extended and an exchange feature was added. Under the terms of the exchange feature, the Series C Redeemable Preferred Stock is exchangeable for shares of the Company\u2019s common stock at either the option of the holder or the Company at any time prior to December 24, 2021, subject to the satisfaction of the following closing conditions: (i) the Company obtaining NASDAQ approval for the issuance of the shares upon the exchange, (ii) approval of the Company\u2019s stockholders for the issuance of such common stock and (iii) the Company\u2019s ability to issue shares of common stock not subject to restrictions on resale or if the conditions are not met, The foregoing conditions can be waived by the Company and the holder. Certain other conditions to the exchange relating to the Company\u2019s common stock trading at a certain minimum price can only be waived by the holder. However, if the closing conditions are not met or waived by December 24, 2021, the Series C Redeemable Preferred Stock is mandatorily redeemable in cash on December 25, 2021 at the stated value together with the 8% dividend and the 12.5% redemption premium.\nThe number of shares of the Company\u2019s common stock issuable to the holders upon exchange of the Series C Redeemable Preferred Stock is determined by the application of a formula in which (i) the stated value of the shares of Series C Redeemable Preferred Stock being exchanged plus the value of any accrued and unpaid dividends plus, with respect to certain agreed upon shares of the Series C Redeemable Preferred Stock, a premium of 12.5% on the stated value, is divided by (ii) the \"conversion price.\" The conversion price for two holders who own 62 shares of the Series C Redeemable Preferred Stock is the lower of (i) $0.60 and (ii) the greater of (x) the average daily volume-weighted average price per share of common stock during the five trading days before the closing of the conversion or (y) $0.40. For the remaining holders who own 156 shares the conversion price is $0.70.\nPareteum Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Amounts in thousands except share and per share data and unless otherwise indicated)\nAs a result of modifying certain terms of the Series C Redeemable Preferred Stock, which was classified as a liability prior to the dates of the Exchange Agreements, the Company accounted for the modification as an extinguishment since the exchange feature is substantive under ASC 470-50, Modifications and Extinguishments.\nSince the Series C Redeemable Preferred Stock is a hybrid instrument which contains embedded conversion features, the Company followed ASC 815 to determine whether the host contract (the Series C Redeemable Preferred Stock) is more akin to debt or to equity. The Company concluded that the Series C Redeemable Preferred Stock was more akin to debt than to equity and that the embedded conversion feature meets the definition of a derivative. As a result, the embedded conversion feature is required to be bifurcated upon issuance as an embedded derivative and recorded at fair value and then remeasured separately at each reporting date with the changes in fair value recognized in other income (expense), net in the Company\u2019s consolidated statements of operations under ASC 815.\nThe Company estimated the fair value of the embedded conversion features at the dates of the Exchange Agreements to be $12,883 using a Monte Carlo Simulation, which utilizes inputs including the Company\u2019s common stock price, probability assumptions of the closing conditions being met or waived by both the Company and the holder, its historical volatility and risk-free rate and time to maturity. The estimated fair values are a Level 3 measurement as defined by ASC 820, as it is based on significant inputs not observable in the market.\nThe components of the Series C Redeemable Preferred Stock liability up through to the dates of the Exchange Agreements in 2020 consisted of the following:\nSeries C Redeemable Preferred Stock, stated value $ 21,767\nUnamortized debt discount (4,113)\nAccretion of redemption premium 1,417\nAccrued dividend 900\nSeries C Redeemable Preferred Stock, net\n$ 19,971\nThe components of financing expense related to the Series C Redeemable Preferred Stock liability classified within interest expense in the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 up through the dates of the Exchange Agreements consisted of the following:\nAmortization of debt discount $ 4,513\nAccretion of redemption premium 1,391\nAccrual of dividends 890\nTotal interest expense $ 6,794\nFor year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recognized a loss on extinguishment of $16,996 for the difference between the reacquisition price which includes the estimated fair value of the embedded conversion features and the net carrying value of the Series C Redeemable Preferred Stock as follows:\nSeries C Redeemable Preferred Stock, net carrying value $ 19,971\nReacquisition price:\nStated redemption value 21,767\nAccretion of redemption premium 1,417\nAccrued dividends 900\nEstimated fair value of embedded conversion features 12,883\nReacquisition price 36,967\nLoss on extinguishment $ 16,996\nPareteum Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Amounts in thousands except share and per share data and unless otherwise indicated)\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recognized as other income $7,773 in its Consolidated statements of operations for the change in the difference between the estimated fair value of the embedded conversion features of $12,883 at the dates of the Exchange Agreements and of $5,110 at December 31, 2020.\nAs a result of modifying the terms of the Series C Redeemable Preferred Stock in connection with the Exchange Agreements, the Company evaluated the provisions of the instrument under ASC 480 and concluded that the Series C Redeemable Preferred Stock is not within the scope of ASC 480. As a result, the Company applied the guidance in ASC 480-10-S99, which states that if an equity classified instrument is redeemable for cash at a fixed or determinable price on a fixed or determinable date (e.g., convertible preferred shares that are mandatorily redeemable for cash on a specified date in the future if not previously converted by the holder) the equity classified instrument is presented as temporary equity. Based on the terms of the Exchange Agreements, if the Series C Redeemable Preferred Stock is not convertible into shares of common stock upon satisfaction or obtaining waivers of the various closing conditions by December 24, 2021, the Series C Redeemable Preferred Stock is then mandatorily redeemable for cash on December 25, 2021 in an amount equal to the stated value plus all accrued dividends and a redemption premium of 12.5%. Accordingly, since the date of the Exchange Agreements, the Company has reclassified the Series C Redeemable Preferred Stock from a liability to temporary equity outside of permanent equity in its Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2020. The Company will continue to accrue the 8% dividends and accrete the 12.5% redemption amount through December 25, 2021 since upon exchange each holder is entitled to the stated value together with the 8% dividend and with respect to certain holders, the 12.5% redemption premium. From the dates of the Exchange Agreements through December 31, 2020, the Company has recorded the 8% dividends totaling $527 and the 12.5% redemption amount totaling $288 to common stock amount in its Consolidated statements of changes in series C redeemable preferred stock and stockholders\u2019 equity (deficit).\nThe components of the Series C Redeemable Preferred Stock classified as temporary equity as of December 31, 2020 consisted of the following:\nDecember 31, 2020\nSeries C Redeemable Preferred Stock, stated value $ 21,767\nAccretion of redemption premium 1,705\nAccrued dividend 1,427\nSeries C Redeemable Preferred Stock, net $ 24,899\nFormer Post Road Group Debt Facility\nOn February 26, 2019, the Company entered into a credit agreement (the \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d) with Post Road Administrative Finance, LLC and its affiliate Post Road Special Opportunity Fund I LLP (collectively, \u201cPost Road\u201d). Pursuant to the Credit Agreement, Post Road provided the Company a senior secured loan of up to $50,000 (the \u201cSenior Secured Facility\u201d). The initial draw under the Senior Secured Facility was $25,000 funded on February 26, 2019. The Credit Agreement matured on February 26, 2022 and was subject to prepayment upon the Company's receipt of proceeds outside the ordinary course of business in excess of $1,000.\nThe Company received net proceeds under the Credit Agreement of $23,321 after payment of $813 in commitment fees and $867 of other issuance costs. In addition, the Company issued $1,607 of the Company's common stock to Post Road.\nIn September 2019, the Company paid off the Credit Agreement from the proceeds received from the Securities Purchase Agreement (as defined below in Note 8, Stockholders' Deficit). As a result, the Company recognized a $7,873 loss on extinguishment of debt, which is comprised on the unamortized debt discount and issuance costs of $4,926 and an $2,947 exit fee paid to Post Road.\nNote 6. Lease Commitments\nThe Company leases property under operating leases with varying expiration dates between 2021 and 2025.

Stockholders\u2019 Deficit\nCommon Stock\nThe Company\u2019s certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of 500,000,000 shares of common stock with a par value of $0.00001 per share. The holders of common stock are entitled to one vote per share and are entitled to receive dividends, if any, as may be declared by the Board of Directors out of legally available funds. The holders of the Company\u2019s common stock have no preemptive, subscription, redemption, or conversion rights. The rights, preferences, and privileges of holders of the Company\u2019s common stock are subject to, and may be adversely affected by, the rights, preferences, and privileges of the holders of any series of preferred stock designated by actions of the Board of Directors in the past or in the future.\nSale of Common Stock Units and Pre-Funded Warrants\nIn September 2019, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement (the \u201cSecurities Purchase Agreement\u201d) with institutional and accredited investors and sold:\n(i)18,852,272 common stock units at a price of $1.76 per share. Each common stock unit consisted of one share of common stock, one Series A warrant and one Series B warrant to purchase shares of common stock. Each of the Series A and Series B warrants entitle the holder to purchase one share of common stock. The number of Series A warrants and Series B warrants that were issued totaled 18,852,272 and 9,426,136, respectively.\n(ii)3,875,000 pre-funded warrants for the purchase of common stock units at price of $1.75 per share. Upon the exercise of the pre-funded warrants at an exercise price of $0.01 per share, the investor is entitled to receive one common stock unit which consists of one share of common stock, one Series A warrant and one Series B warrant to purchase shares of common stock. Each of the Series A and Series B warrants entitle the holder to purchase one share of common stock. The number of Series A warrants and Series B warrants that were issued totaled 3,875,000 and 1,937,500, respectively.\nThe Company received net proceeds of $37,680 after deducting expenses of $2,281. In connection with the Securities Purchase Agreement, the Company issued warrants to a placement agent to purchase 909,091 shares of its common stock. These warrants have an exercise price of $3.00 per share and expire in September 2024. All the warrants in this transaction are classified as equity and the Series A and B warrants are participating securities for purposes of calculating loss per share.\nThe Series A warrant provides for an exercise price of $2.25 per share, exercisable beginning September 2020 and expiring in September 2024. The Series B warrant provides for an exercise price of $1.84 per share, exercisable beginning September 2019 and expiring in March 2021. The pre-funded warrants do not expire and are immediately exercisable except that the pre-funded warrants cannot be exercised by the holder if, after giving effect thereto, the holder would beneficially own more than 9.99% of the Company\u2019s common stock, subject to certain exceptions. The pre-funded warrants are classified as equity in accordance with ASC 480 and the fair value of the pre-funded warrants was recorded in the Company\u2019s Statement of Changes in Series C Redeemable Preferred Stock and Stockholders' Equity (Deficit) as \u201cWarrants issued in September financing - Pre-funded.\u201d In October 2019, all of the pre-funded warrants were exercised in a cashless transaction resulting in the issuance of 3,845,193 shares of common stock, net of shares surrendered for payment of the exercise price.\nPreferred Stock\nThe Company\u2019s certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $0.00001 par value per share. Under the Company\u2019s certificate of incorporation, the Board of Directors has the power, without further action by the holders of common stock to designate the relative rights and preferences of the preferred stock, and issue preferred stock in such one or more series as designated by the Board of Directors.

Non-cumulative dividends are required to be paid on each share of the Series C Redeemable Preferred Stock at a rate of 8% per annum on the Stated Value. The Series C\nPareteum Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Amounts in thousands except share and per share data and unless otherwise indicated)\nRedeemable Preferred Stock ranks senior to the Company's common stock with respect to dividend rights and rights upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company.

Acquisition.\n\u2022In September 2019, the Company issued warrants for the purchase of 38,874,998 common shares in connection with the sale of common stock units as described earlier in this footnote in the section titled Sale of Common Stock Units and Pre-Funded Warrants.\n\u2022In October 2019, warrants for the purchase of 3,875,000 common shares were exercised in connection with the sale of common stock units as described earlier in this footnote in the section titled Sale of Common Stock Units and Pre-Funded Warrants.\nPareteum Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Amounts in thousands except share and per share data and unless otherwise indicated)\n\u2022In March 2020, the Company and High Trail agreed to settle a dispute whereby the Company agreed to grant High Trail a warrant for the purchase of 2,000,000 shares of its common stock as further described in Note 10, Share-based Compensation.\n\u2022In June 2020, the Company issued warrants for the purchase of 15,000,000 common shares in connection with the issuance of the High Trail Note as further described in Note 5, Debt and Series C Redeemable Preferred Stock - Senior Secured Convertible Note.\nWarrants outstanding (in share amounts) as of December 31, 2020 consist of the following:\nWarrants: Shares Underlying Warrants\nWarrants issued prior to January 1, 2019 with conversion prices ranging from $1.05 to $3.75 per share with a weighted average exercise price of $2.08 per share and expiring on various dates from 2021 through 2023\n1,973,852\nWarrants issued in February 2019 as described above with a conversion price of $2.78 per share expiring in 2024\n325,000\nWarrants issued in September and October 2019 as described above with conversion prices ranging from $1.84 to $3.00 per share with a weighted average exercise price of $2.14 per share and expiring on various dates from 2021 through 2024\n34,999,998\nWarrants issued through June 2020 as described above with conversion price of $0.37 per share and expiring in 2025\n17,000,000\nOutstanding as of December 31, 2020 54,298,850\nNote 9. Basic and diluted net loss per common share\nNet loss per common share is calculated in accordance with ASC 260, Earnings per Share. Basic net loss per common share is based upon the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding. The Series A and B warrants issued in the Securities Purchase Agreement are participating securities due to the warrant holder\u2019s participation in dividends distributed by the Company on a one-for-one basis with common stockholders thus requiring the application of the two-class method in computing basic net income per share. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company was in a loss position and none of the losses were allocated to the participating securities as they do not participate in the losses of the Company.\nDilution is computed by applying the treasury stock method. Under this method, options and warrants are assumed to be exercised at the beginning of the period (or at the time of issuance, if later), and as if funds obtained thereby were used to purchase common stock at the average market price during the period. The Company uses the \u2018if converted\u2019 method for the High Trail Note.\nThe diluted share base includes shares related to preferred stock, warrants to purchase common stock and employee awards and or stock options as follows:\nDilutive Securities December 31, 2020 December 31, 2019\nWarrants 54,298,850 38,111,211\nRestricted stock awards 1,164,877 2,563,359\nEmployee stock options 10,647,696 6,924,436\nTotal dilutive securities 66,111,423 47,599,006\nWeighted-average number of shares used to compute basic and diluted loss per common share is the same as the effect of the dilutive securities is anti-dilutive due to the Company\u2019s reported net loss per common share for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nPareteum Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Amounts in thousands except share and per share data and unless otherwise indicated)\nNote 10.

The Company also maintains the 2008 Long-term Incentive Plan (\u201c2008 Plan\u201d). There have been no new grants of share-based compensation under the 2008 Plan during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. Stock options under each long-term incentive plan are granted with an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the Company\u2019s common stock on the date of grant, and generally vest from one to three years from the date of grant. Options are generally granted with a five-year term. The fair value of each stock option granted is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The fair value of restricted stock awards is based on the fair market value at the date of grant and expensed over the vesting period, which generally ranges from one to three years from the date of the grant.\n2008 Long-term Incentive Compensation Plan\nThe 2008 Plan allowed for the grant of awards of up to 2,240,000 shares of common stock, after giving effect to a 1-for-25 reverse stock-split in 2008, in the form of incentive and non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, performance units, restricted stock awards and performance bonuses.

This incentive plan provides for awards of up to 8,000,000 shares of common stock, in the form of options, restricted stock awards, stock appreciation rights (\u201cSAR\u2019s\u201d), performance units and performance bonuses to eligible employees and the grant of nonqualified stock options, restricted stock awards, SAR\u2019s and performance units to consultants and eligible directors.\nPursuant to the terms of the 2018 Plan, as amended, the number of shares available under the plan shall increase on the first day of each fiscal year in an amount equal to the lesser of (i) 15% of the total number of shares of common stock outstanding as of December 31st of the preceding fiscal year or (ii) such number of shares of common stock determined by the Board of Directors (the \u201cEvergreen Increase\u201d). As a result of the 2019 Evergreen Increase, the number of shares available under the 2018 Plan increased by 7,500,000 shares, such number determined by the Board of Directors being the lesser of (i) and (ii) as described herein (the \u201c2018 Plan Increase\u201d). The 2018 Plan Increase took effect upon the filing of the Registration Statement on Form S-8 on June 28, 2019.\nIn December 2020, the Company acquired and retired its common stock that had been issued pursuant to equity awards granted during 2020 to two members of the Company's board of directors in exchange for 2,646,268 fully vested stock options with an exercise price of $0.55. The Company recorded this issuance of fully vested stock options in exchange for its common stock within the Company's stockholders' equity (deficit).\nThere are 1,413,178 previously granted restricted stock awards that have vested for which shares have not been issued as of December 31, 2020.\nThe stock option activity under the 2018 Plan follows:\nOptions: Number of Options Weighted\nAverage\nExercise\nPrice Initial Fair Market\nValue\n(Outstanding\nOptions)\nOutstanding as of December 31, 2018 - $ - $ -\nGranted 5,649,649 2.24 10,629\nForfeitures (1,542,000) 2.38 (2,927)\nExpirations (265,000) 3.07 (813)\nOutstanding as of December 31, 2019 3,842,649 2.13 6,889\nGranted 7,056,293 0.54 3,677\nForfeitures (1,038,927) 1.66 (1,461)\nExpirations (564,757) 2.00 (951)\nOutstanding as of December 31, 2020 9,295,258 $ 0.98 $ 8,154\nPareteum Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Amounts in thousands except share and per share data and unless otherwise indicated)\nThe key assumptions included in Black-Scholes option pricing model for stock options granted in periods noted were as follows:\nYear-ended December 31, 2020 Year-ended December 31, 2019\nExpected Volatility 136% 121%\nWeighted-average Expected Term 2.8 years 3.2 years\nWeighted-average Risk-free Interest Rate 0.31% 2.40%\nDividend yield -% -%\nWeighted-average Fair Value at Grant-date $ 0.52 $ 1.88\nAdditional information for stock options issued under the 2018 Plan follows:\nDecember 31, 2020 December 31, 2019\nOptions Outstanding\nTotal Options Outstanding 9,295,258 3,842,649\nWeighted-average Remaining Contractual Term 4.1 years 4.1 years\nWeighted-average Remaining Expected Term 2.2 years 2.4 years\nWeighted-average Exercise Price $ 0.98 $ 2.13\nAggregate Intrinsic Value (1)\n$ 374 $ -\nOptions Exercisable\nTotal Options Exercisable 5,597,444 100,000\nWeighted-average Exercise Price $ 0.99 $ 0.36\nWeighted-average Remaining Contractual Term 4.2 years 3.8 years\nAggregate Intrinsic Value (1)\n$ 254 $ 8\nUnvested Options\nTotal Unvested Options 3,697,814 3,742,649\nWeighted-average Exercise Price $ 0.96 $ 2.18\nForfeiture Rate Used for this Period Ending 21% 28%\nOptions expected to vest\nNumber of options Expected to Vest Corrected by Forfeiture 2,935,768 2,678,081\nUnrecognized Share-based Compensation Expense $ 7,589 $ 7,625\nWeighting Average Remaining Contract Term 3.1 years 2.9 years\nExercises\nTotal shares delivered/issued - -\nWeighted-average Exercise Price $ - $ -\nIntrinsic Value of Options Exercised $ - $ -\n(1)Excludes options with exercise prices that were greater than the average market price of the Company's common shares for the period.\nPareteum Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Amounts in thousands except share and per share data and unless otherwise indicated)\nA roll forward of restricted stock activity under the 2018 Plan follows:\nNumber of Shares Weighted-average Grant Date\nFair Value\nOutstanding as of December 31, 2018 1,000,000 $ 3.00\nGranted 345,000 2.56\nVested (950,967) 3.03\nForfeited (333,337) 2.28\nOutstanding as of December 31, 2019 60,696 3.92\nGranted 775,000 0.55\nVested (169,584) 0.87\nForfeited (19,584) 3.92\nOutstanding as of December 31, 2020 646,528 0.71\nShare-based Compensation Expense\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company recognized share-based compensation of $4,321 and $11,236, respectively. At December 31, 2020, the unrecognized expense portion of outstanding share-based compensation awards was approximately $7,589 adjusted for cancellations, forfeitures and returns during the preceding period, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.86 years. The grant date fair value of the time-conditioned awards that vested during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $204 and $2,884, respectively.\nWarrant issued to High Trail\nOn March 17, 2020, the Company and High Trail agreed to settle a dispute whereby the Company granted a warrant for the purchase of 2,000,000 shares of its common stock to High Trail. The warrant has an exercise price of $0.70 per share and expires on March 17, 2025. On March 17, 2020, the Company estimated the fair value of the warrant to be $653 using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and recorded the settlement amount in general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. The Company used the following assumptions to estimate the fair value of the warrant: (1) expected volatility of 131%, (2) risk-free rate of 0.66% and (3) 5 year contractual term.\nThe Company determined that the warrant is an equity instrument under ASC 480 and ASC 815-40. On November 30, 2020, per the Forbearance Agreement with High Trail, the exercise price of the warrant was reduced to $0.37 per share; see Note 5, Debt and Series C Redeemable Preferred Stock. The Company accounted for the reduction to the exercise price as a modification of a share-based payment award in accordance with ASC 718. As a result, the Company recorded an additional $44 of stock-based compensation in general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\nNote 11. Income Taxes\nLoss before the income tax benefit consists of the following:\nFor the years ended\nDecember 31,\n2020 2019\nU.S. $ (52,170) $ (106,113)\nForeign 7,457 (124,529)\nTotal loss before income tax provision $ (44,713) $ (230,642)\nThe Company files income tax returns in the US federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions. The applicable statutory tax rates vary from none (zero) to 34%. However, because the Company and its subsidiaries have incurred annual\nPareteum Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Amounts in thousands except share and per share data and unless otherwise indicated)\ncorporate income tax losses since their inception, management has determined that it is more likely than not that the Company will not realize the benefits of its US and foreign net deferred tax assets. Therefore, in all jurisdictions where the Company has a net deferred tax asset, the Company has recorded a full valuation allowance to reduce the net carrying amount of the deferred tax assets to zero. The Company\u2019s 2019 income tax benefit of $8.3 million relates to $8.7 million of benefit associated with the net losses in certain foreign jurisdictions offset by current taxes of $0.2 million in other foreign jurisdictions with taxable income.\nIncome tax (benefit) expense is summarized as follows:\nFor the years ended\nDecember 31,\n2020 2019\nCurrent:\nFederal $ - $ -\nState - -\nForeign (52) 316\n(52) 316\nDeferred:\nFederal - -\nState - -\nForeign - (8,611)\n- (8,611)\nIncome tax benefit $ (52) $ (8,295)\nThe following is a reconciliation of the provision for income taxes at the U.S. federal statutory rate (21%) to the foreign income tax rate for the years ended:\nFor the years ended\nDecember 31,\n2020 2019\nTax expense at statutory rate federal 21 % 21 %\nForeign income tax rate difference - 1\nState tax expense 5 -\nCompensation (2) -\nDebt discount amortization (3) -\nLoss on extinguishment of debt (8) -\nGoodwill Impairment - (11)\nChange in valuation allowance (16) (7)\nChange in fair value conversion 3 -\nExpiration of tax attributes (3) % - %\nOther 3 % - %\n- % 4 %\nPareteum Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Amounts in thousands except share and per share data and unless otherwise indicated)\nThe tax effects of temporary differences that gave rise to significant portions of deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows:\nDecember 31,\n2020 2019\nDeferred tax attributable to:\nNet operating losses $ 60,276 $ 55,859\nShare-based compensation expense 957 666\nAccrued liabilities and allowances 1,275 1,287\nFixed Assets 148 188\nROU lease liability - 288\nOther 375 69\nLess: valuation allowance (61,178) (55,561)\nTotal deferred tax assets 1,853 2,796\nDeferred tax liabilities attributable to:\nIntangible assets (1,627) (1,976)\nROU Asset - (194)\nDeferred revenue (226) (626)\nTotal deferred tax liabilities (1,853) (2,796)\nNet deferred tax liabilities $ - $ -\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company had no unrecognized tax benefits and no related interest and penalties for the years then ended.\nAs of December 31, 2020, and 2019, the Company had net operating losses carryforwards of approximately $272 million and $258 million, respectively. Any net deferred tax assets in a jurisdiction have been offset by a full valuation allowance in both 2020 and 2019 due to the uncertainty of realizing any tax benefit for such losses. Releases of the valuation allowances in the future, if any, will be recognized through earnings.\nSection 382 of the Internal Revenue Code limits the use of net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards in certain situations where changes occur in the stock ownership of a company. In the event the Company has a change in ownership, utilization of the carry forward could be limited.\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company is subject to tax examinations in the jurisdictions in which it files tax returns. The Company\u2019s statute of limitations for assessment is three years for federal and three to four years for state purposes. The federal net operating loss carry forwards remain open for adjustment until the net operating losses are fully utilized. The Company\u2019s statute of limitations is four to six years in the major foreign jurisdictions in which the Company files.\nThe Company files income tax returns in the US federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company did not have any liabilities for uncertain tax positions.\nNote 12. Commitments and Contingencies\nCommitments\nDuring 2019, the Company entered into certain off-balance sheet commitments that require the future purchase of goods or services (\u201cunconditional purchase obligations\u201d). The Company entered into the Strategic Connectivity Agreement (the \u201cConnectivity Agreement\u201d) with Hutchison 3G UK Limited (\u201c3UK\u201d) on July 23, 2019. The Company entered into this agreement for the purpose of providing and expanding its services in Europe. Contractual amounts have been converted from British Pound Sterling to U.S. dollar amounts at a rate of $1.37 to \u00a31.0. Under the Connectivity Agreement, the Company is obligated to pay 3UK $0.4 million dollars for the implementation of a MVNO (the \u201c3UK MVNO\u201d), and for monthly services\nPareteum Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Amounts in thousands except share and per share data and unless otherwise indicated)\nprovided, based on usage, after the 3UK MVNO is launched, which management anticipates to be in the fourth quarter of 2021. As of December 31, 2020, $0.1 million was invoiced by 3UK and is recorded in Accrued expenses and other payables in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2020.\nConcurrent with the execution of the Connectivity Agreement, the Company entered into the Agreement for the Sale and Purchase of Credit Voucher (the \u201cCredit Voucher Agreement\u201d) with PCCW Global Limited (\u201cPCCW\u201d) under which the Company is obligated to purchase a credit voucher for $33.4 million. The credit voucher will be used to offset certain monthly service charges incurred under the Connectivity Agreement. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had not made any payments under either agreement. The $33.4 million unconditional purchase obligation is due and payable following the launch date of the 3UK MVNO, thereafter on a monthly basis, the Company is required to remit the amount of the credit voucher used to offset monthly charges incurred under the Connectivity Agreement to PCCW.\nShould the aggregate of the monthly charges offset with the credit voucher from the Connectivity Agreement launch date through June 30, 2022 be less than $8.9 million, the Company is obligated to remit a make-up payment (the \u201c2022 Make-up Payment\u201d) for the difference between $8.9 million and the aggregate monthly charges offset with the credit voucher. Should the aggregate of the monthly charges offset with the credit voucher from the Connectivity Agreement launch date through June 30, 2023, plus any 2022 Make-up Payment, if applicable, be less than $6.8 million, the Company is obligated to remit a make-up payment (the \u201c2023 Make-up Payment\u201d) for the difference between $15.7 million and the aggregate monthly charges offset with the credit voucher, plus any 2022 Make-up Payment. Should the aggregate of the monthly charges offset with the credit voucher from the Connectivity Agreement launch date through June 30, 2024, plus any 2022 Make-up Payment and any 2023 Make-up Payment, if applicable, be less than $8.2 million, the Company is obligated to remit a make-up payment (the \u201c2024 Make-up Payment\u201d) for the difference between $23.9 million and the aggregate monthly charges offset with the credit voucher, plus the 2022 Make-up Payment and the 2023 Make-up Payment. Should the aggregate of the monthly charges offset with the credit voucher from the Connectivity Agreement launch date through June 30, 2025, plus any 2022 Make-up Payment and any 2023 Make-up Payment and any 2024 Make-up Payment, if applicable, be less than $9.6 million, the Company is obligated to remit a final make-up payment for the difference between $33.4 million and the aggregate monthly charges offset with the credit voucher, plus any 2022 Make-up Payment and any 2023 Make-up Payment and any 2024 Make-up Payment.\nThe following table presents the minimum amounts due under the Company\u2019s unconditional purchase obligations as of December 31, 2020:\nConnectivity\nAgreement Credit\nVoucher\nAgreement Total\n2021 $ 410 $ - $ 410\n2022 - 8,873 8,873\n2023 - 6,825 6,825\n2024 - 8,190 8,190\n2025 - 9,555 9,555\nThereafter - - -\nTotal\n$ 410 $ 33,443 $ 33,852\nPareteum Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Amounts in thousands except share and per share data and unless otherwise indicated)\nThe following table presents management\u2019s estimate of the timing of amounts due under the Company\u2019s unconditional purchase obligations as of December 31, 2020:\nConnectivity\nAgreement Credit\nVoucher\nAgreement Total\n2021 $ 410 $ 373 $ 783\n2022 - 10,002 10,002\n2023 - 8,172 8,172\n2024 - 9,789 9,789\n2025 - 5,106 5,106\nThereafter - - -\nTotal $ 410 $ 33,443 $ 33,852\nContingencies\nThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and that have not been fully resolved. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts above management\u2019s expectations, the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results for that period could be materially adversely affected. In the opinion of management, the ultimate resolution of such legal proceedings and claims will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position, liquidity, or results of operations.\nEllenoff Grossman & Schole LLP. On May 5, 2017, the Company\u2019s former legal counsel, Ellenoff Grossman & Schole LLP, commenced litigation proceedings in New York alleging breach of contract and claiming $0.8 million in unpaid legal fees for January 2015 through November 2016. On June 29, 2017, the parties entered into a settlement agreement for the full $0.8 million with agreed-upon monthly installment payments through August 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2020, the amount outstanding on the settlement agreement is $0.1 million.\nSEC Investigation. In August 2019 and February 2020, the SEC issued the Company subpoenas requiring the production of documents related to, among other things, the Company\u2019s recognition of revenue, practices with certain customers, and internal accounting controls. The SEC staff has also interviewed and taken testimony from individuals previously employed by the Company in connection with the investigation The Company is cooperating with the SEC staff in the SEC investigation and discussions with the SEC staff regarding a potential resolution of the investigation are ongoing.\nIn re Pareteum Securities Litigation is the consolidation of various putative class actions that were filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (the \u201cSouthern District Court\u201d).

In addition to seeking the turnover of unclaimed property subject to escheat laws, the states may seek interest, penalties, costs of examinations, and other relief. If the potential loss from any payment claim is considered probable and the amount or the range of the loss can be estimated, the Company accrues a liability for the estimated loss. To date, the Company is not able to estimate the possible payment, if any, due to the early state of this matter.\nNote 13.

Subsequent Events\nThe Company has evaluated subsequent events through the filing of these consolidated financial statements and determined that there have been no events that have occurred that would require adjustments to the Company's disclosures in the consolidated financial statements except for the transactions described below.\nSenior Second Lien Secured Convertible Note\nOn February 22, 2021, the Company issued the $2.4 million in principal amount Senior Second Lien Notes to an institutional investor for $2.0 million.\nThe Senior Second Lien Note is a senior, secured obligation of the Company, but ranks junior to the High Trail Note, issued by the Company and held by High Trail. Interest is payable monthly beginning April 1, 2021 at a rate of 8% per annum. The Senior Second Lien Note is secured by a second lien on substantially all assets of the Company and substantially all assets of its material U.S.-organized subsidiaries. Interest may be paid, at the election of the Company, in cash or in shares of common stock of the Company; provided, that, so long as the High Trail Note remains outstanding, such payments may only be made in shares. The number of shares of common stock to be issued to pay interest in shares of the Company\u2019s common stock is determined by the application of a formula in which the amount of the interest due is divided by 85% of the lowest volume-weighted average price of the Company\u2019s common stock on the principal market for the Company\u2019s common stock over the 10 days preceding the date of such payment.\nSubject to an intercreditor agreement with the holder of the High Trail Note, upon notice by the Company, the Company may elect to redeem all or a portion of the then-outstanding principal amount outstanding under the Senior Second Lien Note. The holder of the Senior Second Lien Note or the Company may also elect for the Company to redeem the Senior Second Lien Note at a 20% premium if the Company undergoes a fundamental change. The Senior Second Lien Note will be convertible into common stock of the Company, in part or in whole, from time to time, at the election of the holder of the Senior Second Lien Note. The initial conversion rate is equal to 1,666.6667 shares of the Company\u2019s common stock for each $1,000 of principal amount of the Senior Second Lien Note or $0.60 per share. The conversion rate is subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments in the event the Company issues stock dividends or effects a split or reverse split of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nIn connection with the Senior Second Lien Note:\n\u2022Series B warrants previously issued to this institutional investor for the purchase of up to 258,523 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $1.84 per share were cancelled. Such warrants had been issued on September 24, 2019 in connection with the financing described in Note 8 - Stockholders\u2019 Deficit - Sale of Common Stock Units and Pre-Funded Warrants; and\n\u2022The Company issued a warrant to this institutional investor for the purchase of up to 2,750,000 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $0.40 per share expiring on February 22, 2026. This warrant is exercisable any time after February 22, 2021.\nForeclosure on Funds in Blocked Account\nOn April 8, 2021, High Trail provided notice to the Company that it was causing $6.0 million of the funds maintained in the blocked account to be transferred to High Trail in partial satisfaction of the amounts outstanding under the High Trail Note.\nAdditional Sale of Senior Second Lien Notes\nOn April 29, 2021, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement, dated as of April 13, 2021 (the \u201cSecurities Purchase Agreement\u201d), with two initial investors and other investors as may become party thereto from time to time (collectively, the \u201cNote Purchasers\u201d) providing for the issuance and sale by the Company of up to $6.0 million aggregate principal amount of its Senior Second Lien Secured Convertible Notes due 2025 (the \u201cNotes\u201d) and warrants (the \u201cWarrants\u201d) to purchase up to 5,000,000 shares of its common stock (\u201cCommon Stock\u201d). The Notes and accompanying Warrants may be sold from time to time to one or more Note Purchasers under the terms of the Securities Purchase Agreement. On April 29, 2021, the Company closed on the sale of Notes in the aggregate principal amount of approximately $1.79 million and Warrants to purchase 1,490,000 shares of Common Stock under the Securities Purchase Agreement for an aggregate purchase price of $1.49 million.\nThe Notes are senior secured obligations of the Company, but rank junior to the Senior Secured Convertible Note due 2025, dated as of June 8, 2020, issued by the Company and held by High Trail Investments SA LLC. Interest on each Note is payable monthly beginning on the first day of each calendar month beginning with the first such day beginning 31 days after such Note\u2019s issuance date. The rate of interest under the Notes is 8% per annum; provided that if an event of default occurs and the applicable Purchaser delivers notice thereof, interest will accrue at 18% per annum. The Notes are secured by a second lien on substantially all assets of the Company and substantially all assets of its material U.S.-organized subsidiaries. Interest may be paid, at the election of the Company, in cash or in shares of Common Stock; provided, that, so long as the High Trail Note remains outstanding, such payments may only be made in shares. The number of shares issuable to pay interest in shares is determined by the application of a formula in which the amount of the interest due is divided by 85% of the lowest volume-weighted average price of Common Stock on the principal market for the Common Stock over the 10 days preceding the date of such payment.\nSubject to an intercreditor agreement with the holder of the High Trail Note, upon notice by the Company, the Company may elect to redeem all or a portion of the then-outstanding principal amount outstanding under the Notes. Each holder of Notes or the Company may also elect for the Company to redeem the Notes at a 20% premium if the Company undergoes a fundamental change.\nEach Note will be convertible into Conversion Shares, in part or in whole, from time to time, at the election of the holder of such Note. The initial conversion rate is 1666.6667 shares of Common Stock for each $1,000 of principal amount of Notes. The conversion rate is subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments in the event the Company issues stock dividends or effects a split or reverse split of the Common Stock.\nThe Notes impose certain customary affirmative and negative covenants upon the Company, as well as covenants requiring that (i) payments under the Notes rank senior to all unsecured indebtedness of the Company and (ii) restrict the declaration of any dividends or other distributions. The Notes contain customary events of default.\nThe Company intends to use the net proceeds from the offering of the Notes for general corporate purposes.\nSecurities Purchase Agreement\nThe Securities Purchase Agreement provides for the Note Purchasers to purchase up to 5,000,000 shares of the Company's common stock. The Securities Purchase Agreement contains customary representations and warranties, including representations from the Purchaser regarding its status as an \u201caccredited investor\u201d and its investment purpose, and representations from the Company regarding its organization, authorization to enter into the transaction, ability to conduct its business, capitalization, absence of conflicts and compliance with law, among other things. In addition, the Securities Purchase Agreement includes a number of customary covenants with which the Company must comply, including covenants that require the Company to, among other things, use the proceeds of the sale of the Notes and Warrants for general corporate purposes and keep reserved a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the number issuable upon conversion of the Notes and exercise of the Warrants.\nWarrant\nThe Purchase Agreement provides for the issuance, from time to time, of Warrants to purchase up to 5,000,000 shares of Common Stock. The number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of each Warrant held by a Purchaser is determined by multiplying 0.8333333333 by the dollar value of the principal amount of the Notes purchased by such Purchaser. Each Warrant entitles the holder to purchase the applicable shares of Common Stock at an exercise price of $0.40 per share. The Warrants are immediately exercisable by the holders, in whole or in part, at any time, and from time to time, until the fifth anniversary of the date of issuance. The terms of the Warrants provide that the exercise price of the Warrant, and the number of shares of common stock for which the Warrant may be exercised, are subject to adjustment to account for increases or decreases in the number of outstanding shares of common stock resulting from stock splits, reverse stock splits, consolidations, combinations and reclassifications.\nWarrant Extension\nOn April 24, 2021, the Company effected a waiver of the expiration date of its then-remaining outstanding Series B Common Stock Purchase Warrants, dated September 24, 2019, to purchase an aggregate of 11,105,113 shares of the Company\u2019s common stock (the \u201cSeries B Warrants\u201d). The Company had originally issued the Series B Warrants on September 24, 2019 for the purchase of up to 11,363,636 shares of the Company\u2019s common stock at an exercise price of $1.84 per share through March 24, 2021. On February 22, 2021, Series B Warrants to purchase an aggregate 258,523 shares of common stock were cancelled in connection with the February 22, 2021 issuance of Senior Second Lien Notes described above. On March 22, 2021 and then on April 24, 2021, the Company extended the expiration dates of the remaining outstanding Series B Common Stock Purchase Warrants, dated September 24, 2019, to purchase an aggregate of 11,105,113 shares of the Company\u2019s common stock that had the effect of extending the expiration date through June 30, 2021.\nHigh Trail Note - New Forbearance Agreement\nOn May 24, 2020, the Company entered into a new forbearance agreement (the \u201cNew Forbearance Agreement\u201d) with High Trail under which (i) the Company again admitted it was in default under several obligations under the High Trail Note and related agreements, (ii) High Trail acknowledged such defaults and agreed not to exercise any right or remedy under the High Trail Note or the related securities purchase agreement, warrant or security documents, including its right to accelerate the aggregate amount outstanding under the High Trail Note, until the earlier of May 31, 2020 or any later date to which such date may be extended (the \u201cOutside Date\u201d), and the date of any new event of default or initiation of any action by the Company to invalidate any of the representations and warranties made in the New Forbearance Agreement. The Outside Date automatically extends for successive two-week periods unless on or before the then-applicable Outside Date the lender provides notice that the Outside Date is not being extended.\nAs partial consideration for its agreement not to exercise any right or remedy under the High Trail Note and related documents, High Trail and the Company agreed to make certain changes to the documents. In this regard, the parties agreed to amend the \u201cEvent of Default Acceleration Amount\u201d definition in the High Trail Note so that the amount due and payable by the Company on account of an event of default would be an amount in cash equal to 125% of the then-outstanding principal and accrued and unpaid interest under the High Trail Note. This represents an increase from 120% of the then-outstanding principal and accrued and unpaid interest, and removes the market-price-based alternative for such acceleration amount.\nAdditionally, the parties also agreed that the principal amount outstanding under the High Trail Note would be increased by certain paid-in-kind amounts in full satisfaction of the Company\u2019s obligation to make payments of interest to High Trail on each of April 1, 2021 and May 1, 2021, which amounts were not paid by the Company in cash or Common Stock. In consideration of High Trail\u2019s agreement to enter into the New Forbearance Agreement and agree to the amendments to the High Trail Note, the Company agreed to pay High Trail a fee in the amount of $1.5 million. Accordingly, following these increases in the principal amount payable, but applying against the outstanding principal and such fee the $6.0 million previously maintained in a certain blocked account against that was foreclosed upon by High Trail, the total amount of principal outstanding under the High Trail Note as of the date of the New Forbearance Agreement was approximately $13.5 million.",

    "item_9A": "Item 9A. Controls and Procedures\n(a)Material Weaknesses Identified - Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nWe maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC\u2019s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our interim chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.\nIn connection with preparing this filing, management has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)). Based on that evaluation, we concluded that because of material weaknesses in our control environment resulting in ineffective internal control over financial reporting, as described below, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2020.\n(b)Material Weaknesses Identified - Management\u2019s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Our internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that:\n\u2022pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets;\n\u2022provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and\n\u2022provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements.\nIn connection with preparing this filing, our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and in making this assessment used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013). Based on the foregoing evaluation, our management has identified the following deficiencies that constitute material weaknesses in the Company\u2019s internal controls over financial reporting:\n\u2022Entity-level controls were not effective due to certain executive management \u201ctone at the top\u201d issues which contributed to an ineffective control environment and to deficiencies aggregating to material weaknesses;\n\u2022Inadequate and ineffective management assessment of internal control over financial reporting due to unremediated design weaknesses;\n\u2022Ineffective design, implementation and monitoring of information technology general controls pertaining to the Company\u2019s change management and security process;\n\u2022 The Company not having sufficient finance and information technology department resources to effectively assess risk and design, operate and oversee effective internal controls over financial reporting while maintaining proper segregation of duties, which contributed to the failure in the effectiveness and adequate identification of certain controls including:\n\u25e6Inadequate retention of key documentation evidencing execution of internal controls;\n\u25e6Improper and untimely recognition of revenue for prior year end and interim periods for certain customers in accordance with ASC 606, leading to the 2018 Restatement and 2019 interim period restatements;\n\u25e6Incorrect accounting of stock-based compensation for awards granted to employees and non-employees, and of extinguishment of preferred stock;\n\u25e6Not applying appropriate foreign currency translations during prior years impacting the account valuation of Property, Plant & Equipment;\n\u25e6Complying to identify and account for operating leases in accordance with ASC 842; and\n\u25e6Proper capitalization of software identified during review of projects.\nBased on these material weaknesses, the Company\u2019s management concluded that at December 31, 2020, the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting was not effective.\nRemediation to Address Material Weaknesses\nManagement and the Company\u2019s board of directors have been implementing and continue to implement measures designed to ensure that control deficiencies contributing to the material weakness are remediated, such that these controls are designed, implemented and operating effectively.\nThe audit committee of the Company\u2019s board of directors, with the assistance of independent legal counsel and a separate independent accounting firm, took action to immediately begin investigating the causes of the circumstances leading to the restatement of our financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 and the interim periods contained therein (the \u201c2018 Restatement\"), the restatements of our financial statements for the first and second quarters of 2019, and the delay in 2019 filings as soon as the board, upon the recommendation of the audit committee, and after consultation with management and the auditors, concluded that the Company\u2019s financial statements and other reports could not be relied upon. As a result of this independent investigation and related deliberations, the board of directors terminated or otherwise separated the executive officers who served during the time period of the conduct that gave rise to the Company\u2019s need to effect the Restatement. The Company has also taken and will continue to take significant and comprehensive remedial actions in response to the conduct and other factors that led to the 2018 Restatement and delay in 2019 filings, including actions to begin to remediate the material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting. Remediation actions already implemented include (i) a thorough review and documentation of all processes involved in our financial reporting to ensure that there is segregation of duties, (ii) documented review processes in place that happen at appropriate intervals throughout the year that cover all elements of the Company\u2019s financial reporting. This includes, but is not limited to, testing samples and documenting that testing has occurred with the results of the findings being reported to senior management and that they occur at appropriate intervals and continuously making improvements to our processes as necessary.\nTo address ineffective design, implementation and monitoring of information technology general controls pertaining to the Company\u2019s change management and security process, the Company (iii) is implementing information technology policies that govern change management and security procedures; (iv) will institute sample testing of changes made in our reporting system to ensure the documented policies are being followed and report the results of these tests to senior management in regular appropriate intervals; (v) added personnel who have information technology control oversight and support roles and (vi) will enhance our quarterly reporting on the remediation measures to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.\nAdditionally, to ensure the Company maintains a strong internal control environment and to remediate the additional material weakness in internal controls over financial reporting identified in this Annual Report, the Company: (vii) has added resources responsible for the execution and oversight of accounting and finance operations; (viii) is designing and implementing enhancements to internal controls over financial reporting including those related to sales processing, revenue recognition, equity accounting and accounting for leases; (ix) has implemented a periodic review of financial reports and month-over-month balances with the purpose of identifying and investigating fluctuations and discrepancies in key accounts and transactions; (x) implemented uniform processes across all business entities with the emphasis on sound control practices; (xi) will provide training to its finance and sales staff and key personnel on the appropriate guidelines to account for revenue in the telecom industry and emphasizing the importance of adherence to policies and procedures; (xii) implemented a new application to manage equity.\nWe believe that these actions will remediate the material weaknesses. While we have taken measures to strengthen our internal controls related to these additional material weaknesses, we have not fully completed our assessment. The material weaknesses will not be considered remediated until the applicable controls operate for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are operating effectively.\nAs our management continues to evaluate and work to improve our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, we may determine to take additional measures to address these deficiencies or determine to modify certain of the remediation measures described above.",

However, our Nominating Committee generally evaluates and recommends candidates with a focus on the following qualities: educational background, ethnic and gender diversity, breadth of professional experience, knowledge of our industry and business, integrity, professional reputation, independence, wisdom and ability to represent the best interests of our stockholders and other stakeholders.\nOur Board of Directors and officers are composed of a diverse group of leaders.

Most of our officers and directors also have experience serving on boards of directors and board committees of other public companies or private companies, and have an understanding of\ncorporate governance practices and trends, which provides an understanding of different business processes, challenges and strategies.

This summary is not an exhaustive list of each nominee\u2019s contributions to the Board. However, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee utilized this matrix in determining the individuals selected for nomination.\nGender Public\nCompany\nReporting\nExperience M&A\nExperience Technology\nBusiness &\nIndustry\nExperience Legal\nExpertise Strategic\nExperience Cybersecurity\nExpertise\nMary Beth Vitale F \u221a \u221a \u221a \u221a \u221a\nLuis Jimenez-Tu\u00f1on M \u221a \u221a \u221a \u221a\nRobert L. Lippert M \u221a \u221a \u221a\nRobert H. Turner M \u221a \u221a \u221a\nIndependence Standards for Directors\nThere are no arrangements between our directors and any other person pursuant to which our directors were nominated or elected for their positions.\nThree of our current directors, Luis Jimenez-Tu\u00f1on, Robert L. Lippert and Mary Beth Vitale are \u201cindependent\u201d under Nasdaq rules. All of the individuals nominated for election at the Meeting are \u201cindependent\u201d under Nasdaq rules. Each of Messrs. Jimenez-Tu\u00f1on and Lippert and Ms. Vitale serve on the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee, the Nominating Committee and the Strategy and Business Committee. Our Interim Non-Executive Chair, Ms. Vitale, is independent.\nIn addition, Mr. Jimenez-Tu\u00f1on, Mr. Lippert and Ms. Vitale qualify as \u201cindependent\u201d under the standards established by the SEC for members of audit committees. The Board of Directors has determined that Robert L. Lippert and Mary Beth Vitale is each an \u201caudit committee financial expert\u201d as defined in Item 407(d)(5)(ii) of Regulation S-K. Stockholders should understand that this designation is a disclosure requirement of the SEC related to these individuals\u2019 experience and understanding with respect to certain accounting and auditing matters. The designation does not impose upon Mr. Lippert or Ms. Vitale any duties, obligations or liability that are greater than those generally imposed on them as a member of the Audit Committee and the Board of Directors, and their designation as audit committee financial experts pursuant to this SEC requirement does not affect the duties, obligations, or liability of any other member of the Audit Committee or the Board of Directors. Our Board of Directors also determined that Mr. Jimenez-Tu\u00f1on, Mr. Lippert and Ms. Vitale have sufficient knowledge in reading and understanding financial statements to serve on the Audit Committee.\nBoard Leadership Structure and Executive Sessions\nThe positions of Chair of the Board and Chief Executive Officer are currently held by different persons, although the Board does not have a policy on whether or not the roles of Chief Executive Officer and chairperson of the Board should be separate and, if they are to be separate, whether the chairperson should be selected from the non-employee directors or be an employee of the Company. Accordingly, our Board reserves the right to vest the responsibilities of the Chief Executive Officer and Chair in the same person or in two different individuals depending on what it believes is in our best interest. At this time, our Board has determined that separation of these roles most appropriately suits us. The Board will, however, appoint a lead director if the Chair and Chief Executive Officer roles are in the future combined, to conduct executive sessions, and Chair the Board if the Chief Executive Officer is unavailable and for such other purposes as the board finds useful.\nThe Board\u2019s policy is to periodically hold executive sessions without the presence of management, including the Chief Executive Officer or other non-independent directors. In general, time is reserved during each regularly scheduled Board meeting should the outside directors wish to meet in private executive session. When the outside directors meet without a non-independent chairperson of the Board, the lead director shall chair the meeting. The outside directors may also meet at such other times as determined by the presiding director.\nRisk Oversight\nOur Business and Strategy Committee and our Audit Committee share responsibility for oversight of risk management, with members of management also playing a key role. Our Business and Strategy Committee is responsible for the oversight of the Company\u2019s overall enterprise risk management, risk profile and risk assessment, although it coordinates with other committees of the Board, and the full Board, as it from time to time deems appropriate. The Business and Strategy Committee also oversees risk in the areas of corporate strategy and corporate growth and development. Our Audit Committee also assists the full Board in overseeing, approving and monitoring the company-wide enterprise risks identified by various levels of management and the Board. These risks generally cover, but are not limited to: compliance, environmental, financial, operational, reputational, as well as digital risks (fraud, cybersecurity and network). Management is responsible for developing a plan to monitor, assign ownership and respond to early threats and for communicating the methods and processes to manage and leverage opportunities associated with each risk on a regular cadence with the Board. With respect to high-risk areas, we have directed management to present detailed mitigation activities to the Board on an annual basis.\nThe Audit Committee has also directed management to develop a risk management policy, which plan must be submitted and approved on an annual basis by such committee. The risk management plan is required to consider the maturity of the risk management of the Company, to be tailored to the specific circumstances of the Company, include the Company\u2019s risk management structure, the standards and methodology adopted, risk management guidelines, reference to integration and details of the assurance and review of the risk management process.\nEmployee, Officer and Director Hedging\nThe Company\u2019s Insider Trading Policy and our Corporate Governance Guidelines contain restrictions on the ability of directors, officers, and employees to engage in certain transactions that hedge or modify the effect of any transaction in Company securities. Specifically, our Corporate Governance Guidelines prohibit such persons from (i) selling the Company\u2019s securities short, (ii) buying or selling put or call options, or other derivative securities, with respect to the Company\u2019s securities, (iii) engaging in transactions that hedge or offset or that are designed to hedge or offset any decrease in the market value of shares of the Company\u2019s stock (or the stock of any of the Company\u2019s subsidiaries) granted to such persons as compensation or otherwise held by such persons either directly or indirectly, including through the purchase of financial instruments such as prepaid variable forwards, equity swaps, collars and exchange funds and (iv) holding any Company securities in a margin account or pledging Company securities as collateral for any loan.\nAttendance at Board, Committee and Stockholder Meetings\nOur Board of Directors met in person and telephonically two (2) times during 2020 and acted by unanimous written consent two (2) times during 2020. Each of the then-members of our Board of Directors was present at 75% or more of the Board of Directors meetings held in 2020. In addition, there were two (2) additional formal meetings of the Independent Directors. The Independent Directors also met informally between themselves and/or with management at least once each week in 2020.\nWe have encouraged, but do not require, that all of our directors be in attendance at our annual shareholder meeting either in person or by remote communication. In 2020, the Company did not hold an annual stockholder meeting.\nStockholder Communications to the Board\nGenerally, stockholders who have questions, concerns, or wish to address questions regarding our business directly to the Board, or any individual director, should direct his or her questions in writing to Pareteum Corporation, 1185 Avenue of the Americas, 2nd Floor, New York, NY, 10036, attention: Secretary.

From time to time, the Board may change the process or means by which stockholders may communicate with the Board or its members.
