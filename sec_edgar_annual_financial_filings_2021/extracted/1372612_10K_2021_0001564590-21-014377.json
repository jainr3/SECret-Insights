    "item_1": "Item 1. BUSINESS\nOverview\nBox is the Content Cloud: one secure, cloud-native platform for managing the entire content journey. Content - from blueprints to wireframes, videos to documents, proprietary formats to PDFs - is the source of an organization\u2019s unique value. Our cloud content management platform enables our customers, including 67% of the Fortune 500, to securely manage the entire content lifecycle, from the moment a file is created or ingested to when it\u2019s shared, edited, published, approved, signed, classified, and retained. Box keeps content secure and compliant, while also allowing easy access and sharing of this content from anywhere, on any device.\nWith our Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) platform, users can collaborate on content both internally and with external parties, automate content-driven business processes, develop custom applications, and implement data protection, security and compliance features to comply with legal and regulatory requirements, internal policies and industry standards and regulations. Box provides a single content platform that accelerates business processes, improves employee productivity, enables secure remote work, and protects an organization\u2019s most valuable data. Our platform enables a broad set of high-value business use cases across enterprises, hundreds of file formats and media types, and user experiences. Our platform integrates with leading enterprise business applications, and is compatible with multiple application environments, operating systems and devices, ensuring that workers can securely access their critical business content whenever and wherever they need it.\nOur go-to-market strategy is focused on selling our platform as a solution for the entire enterprise with the full set of Box capabilities, leveraging our product suite offerings, and driving high-value significant business outcomes for our customers. This strategy combines top-down, high-touch sales efforts with end-user-driven bottoms-up adoption. We focus our efforts on larger enterprises, capitalizing on international growth, and utilizing our partner ecosystem, where most advantageous. Our sales representatives engage directly with IT decision makers including CEOs, CIOs, CISOs, IT directors and line of business department heads. We also field inbound inquiries and online sales opportunities. We further expand our market reach by leveraging our network of channel partners that comprises value-added resellers and systems integrators as well as our own consulting services. We offer individuals a free basic version of Box that allows them to experience first-hand our easy-to-use and secure solution. Use of Box often spreads virally within and across organizations, as users adopt Box and invite new users to collaborate. In addition, an organization will frequently purchase Box for one use case and then later expand its deployment to other use cases with larger groups of employees, leading to deeper engagement with our service. We focus our sales strategy on ensuring that new and existing customers understand and experience the transformative impact of Box.\nWe are building a rich technology partner ecosystem around Box. We offer nearly 1,500 pre-built integrations with partners including Microsoft, IBM, Salesforce.com, Apple, Google, Slack, Adobe, Palo Alto Networks, Okta, Zoom and others, giving our users easy access to their content in Box without leaving these applications. In addition, in-house enterprise developers and independent software developers can use our developer platform and open application programming interfaces (APIs) to rapidly build and provision new applications that leverage and extend the core functionality of our services, increasingly with a focus on specific industries and vertical market use cases. To date, tens of thousands of third-party developers have leveraged our platform as the secure content layer for their applications.\nWe are committed to powering how the world does more good together. Box.org mobilizes our technology, talent, partners and institutional assets to enable nonprofits to innovate and fulfill their missions. Founded in 2014, Box.org now serves over 11,000 nonprofits with donated or discounted Box access, employee volunteer hours and cash grants from the Box.org Fund.\nThe Box Solution\nWe offer web, mobile and desktop applications for cloud content management on a platform for developing custom applications, as well as industry-specific capabilities. Three core capabilities differentiate Box from potential competitors: frictionless security and compliance powered by our global cloud architecture, seamless external and internal collaboration and workflow, and expansive integrations and APIs that extend the value of our Content Cloud to every organization. Box features and functionality include the following:\nFrictionless Security and Compliance\n\u2022\nGlobal Cloud Architecture. We have built our platform from the ground up on a cloud-based architecture, which enables us to rapidly develop, update and provision our services to users. Our proprietary cloud architecture is particularly well-suited for today's dynamically changing business requirements because it enables use of the most up-to-date versions of our solutions at all times and administrators to immediately apply changes in policies and controls across all their organization\u2019s critical content simultaneously. Our modern cloud infrastructure also powers global scalability and reliability with minimal downtime for our customers, ensuring their business-critical content is always secure, compliant, and available.\n\u2022\nEnterprise-Grade Security. We have invested heavily to build robust security features to protect our customers from the most pervasive security threats. At the most basic level, all files stored in Box are encrypted at rest and in transit. Box\u2019s information rights management features enable secure access and management of files by providing granular control over users\u2019 ability to access, view, download, edit, print or share content. With Box KeySafe, organizations can implement higher levels of data security and protection by keeping control of the encryption keys that protect their content. This advanced encryption feature is valuable to many organizations, including those in highly regulated industries such as financial services, health care, government and legal.\n\u2022\nIntelligent Threat Detection and Smart Access with Box Shield. Box Shield uses machine learning to provide granular, real-time prevention and detection capabilities. Box Shield reduces the risk of accidental data leakage through native security classifications and granular access controls by, for example, automatically applying classification to files that contain personal identifiable information. It also detects potential insider threats and compromised accounts through alerts powered by Box's machine learning capabilities.\n\u2022\nComprehensive Data Governance Strategy. Box serves as a secure, centralized system of record for retaining content for operational use while ensuring adherence to the laws and regulations, using data retention and Data Loss Prevention (DLP) capabilities. Our data security policies allow customers to apply quarantine or notification-only policies to sensitive confidential files, such as those containing predefined attributes, such as credit card or social security system numbers, and we provide robust integrations for leading eDiscovery and DLP systems. Our Box Governance product allows customers to control how long documents are to be retained in Box and the disposition of those documents when the retention period expires.\n\u2022\nBox\u2005Zones\u2005for\u2005In-Region\u2005Data\u2005Storage.\u2005Box\u2005Zones\u2005enables\u2005businesses\u2005around\u2005the\u2005globe\u2005to\u2005adopt\u2005Box\u2005as\u2005their\u2005modern\u2005content\u2005management\u2005platform,\u2005while\u2005letting\u2005them\u2005store\u2005their\u2005data\u2005locally in certain regions.\u2005This\u2005helps\u2005organizations\u2005address\u2005region-specific\u2005compliance\u2005mandates\u2005associated\u2005with\u2005data\u2005residency\u2005and\u2005privacy.\u2005\n\u2022\nFocus on Industry-Specific Capabilities. In order to facilitate easier and faster time to market, we offer industry-specific capabilities for those industries that have significant content and collaboration challenges. These features target specific business problems within those industries with a combination of Box, integration with industry-specific partner technologies, and implementation expertise from Box Consulting and/or implementation partners. For example, Box GxP Validation provides life science companies with an approach for maintaining always-on GxP compliance in the cloud and enables organizations subject to Food and Drug Administration regulations to manage both unregulated and regulated content within Box. We successfully serve customers in highly regulated industries with specific requirements relating to compliance with certain security and regulatory standards, such as GxP and FedRAMP, and those required by HIPAA, FINRA, and the HITECH Act.\n\u2022\nAdministrative Controls. We give IT administrators powerful tools to define access rights by user, content type, device, and business need. Administrators can set specific content policies such as expiration dates to auto-delete files or deactivate links to time-sensitive materials. They can also manage mobile and sync security settings, including specification of which devices have access to Box and whether certain features are enabled.\n\u2022\nTracking and Reporting for Visibility. All actions taken by paying business users and their external collaborators in Box are tracked and auditable by our customers\u2019 authorized administrators through Box\u2019s native administrative applications. The tracking and audit data are also accessible to administrators with the appropriate access rights via our APIs.\n\u2022\nSimple and Rapid Deployment. Our cloud-based software allows organizations to deploy our products easily, quickly, and inexpensively. IT administrators can quickly add users, set up permissions, create folders and policies, and begin using our products almost immediately without the need to procure and provision hardware or install and configure software.\nTo give our customers the flexibility to choose between a la carte and bundled subscription options, we offer Box Shield, Box Governance, GxP, and Zones both as standalone add-ons and as part of our bundled Enterprise Suites.\nSeamless Collaboration and Workflow\n\u2022\nInternal and External Collaboration. Box offers deep integrations with all major productivity and collaboration platforms so that users can work together on any file type, in whatever format they choose, with content security and access permissions handled consistently within Box. By enabling users to share, preview, and annotate files in Box, we provide a consistent collaboration layer so that all feedback is captured and preserved within Box. Our Annotations feature enables users to add text-based comments or free-form markups on any file type without altering the underlying content so teams can work together without worrying about version control or data loss.\n\u2022\nReal-Time Collaboration and Content Authoring. Our native content authoring tool, Box Notes, enables users to seamlessly share and collaborate in real time with internal teams and external partners. Box Notes combines lightweight word processing functionality with easy-to-use tables, content organization, and commenting features to make it easy for users to work together on projects in real time.\n\u2022\nMobility. Our solution enables users to securely access, manage, share, and collaborate on their content anytime and from anywhere, using nearly any device and a variety of operating systems through both native and web browser applications. Our mobile apps allow users to preview, comment, and collaborate on content from anywhere, as well as make it easy to add content to Box with native scanning, uploading, and classification.\n\u2022\nElegant, Intuitive and User-Focused Interface. We are dedicated to keeping our solution easy for users to understand with little to no upfront training. We strive to enable quick and viral user adoption by maintaining a simple and elegant interface with compelling access, sharing and collaboration features.\n\u2022\nBuilt to Handle Content of Nearly Any Type. We have designed our solution to serve as the central content management layer for an organization\u2019s employees. Users can securely access, share, and collaborate on all types of information, regardless of format or file type, including large media files, from virtually any device or operating system.\n\u2022\nAutomation and Workflow Management. Box Relay, our no-code process automation tool for content-centric workflows, accelerates productivity by enabling both end users and administrators to build simple process automations. For example, documents can be routed to specific folders or flagged for user action based on the content of the document. In addition, we provide pre-built workflow templates and reporting capabilities to make it easy for users to track and manage their own workflows. This allows customers to accelerate the flow of information through their organizations and increase the efficiency of their business processes. Box Relay is available both as a standalone add-on and as part of our bundled Enterprise Suites.\nIntegrations and Developer Platform\n\u2022\nEasy Integration with Other Cloud-Based Applications. Our open platform allows for easy integration with other cloud-based and enterprise applications. We offer nearly 1,500 pre-built integrations with partners including IBM, Microsoft, Salesforce.com, Google, Facebook, Slack, Adobe, Palo Alto Networks, Zoom, and others, as well as an open API for organizations to integrate Box with other packaged and home-grown applications, including solution applications our customers build for their customers.\n\u2022\nBox Platform. We provide a content Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) product, known as Box Platform, which allows IT teams and third-party developers to extend the power of Box across their applications and build custom content experiences. With our easy-to-use APIs, businesses can create a single source of truth for their content, allowing IT teams to deploy key business applications while easily managing how content is accessed, collaborated on, and secured. Coupled with our robust developer tools, the Box Platform helps organizations accelerate their transformation into digital businesses by building applications faster, without having to invest in building their own content management infrastructure. We also give organizations the ability to apply machine learning algorithms from leading providers such as IBM, Microsoft, and Google, as well as specialized industry-specific vendors directly to content within Box using Box Skills. This eliminates the need for customers to create and manage separate document repositories for performing functions such as image and character recognition, video and audio analysis and transcriptions, and document analysis on business content, thus improving content searchability and business process automation. Box Platform is available as a standalone add-on and as part of our bundled Enterprise Suites.\nCustomers\nOur user base included over 77.7 million registered users as of January 31, 2021. We define a registered user as a Box account that has been provisioned a unique user identification number. As of January 31, 2021, approximately 80% of our registered users were non-paying users who independently registered for accounts (in many cases to enable them to collaborate securely with our paying enterprise user base) and approximately 20% of our registered users were paying users who registered as part of a larger enterprise or business account or by using a paid personal account.\nAs of January 31, 2021, we had over 105,000 paying organizations, and our solution was offered in 25 languages. We define paying organizations as separate and distinct buying entities, such as a company, an educational or government institution, or a distinct business unit of a large corporation, that have entered into a subscription agreement with us to utilize our services. Organizations typically purchase our solution in the following ways: (i) employees in one or more small groups within the organization may individually purchase our service; (ii) organizations may purchase IT-sponsored, enterprise-level agreements with deployments for specific, targeted use cases ranging from tens to thousands of user seats; (iii) organizations may purchase IT-sponsored, enterprise-level agreements where the number of user seats sold is intended to accommodate and enable nearly all information workers within the organization in whatever use cases they desire to adopt over the term of the subscription; and (iv) organizations may purchase our Box Platform service to create custom business applications for their internal use and extended ecosystem of customers, suppliers and partners.\nWe have developed several programs designed to provide customers with service options to quickly get them up and running and enhance their usage of Box. These services include 24x7 support provided by our Customer Success Management group and certain resellers; a professional services ecosystem that consists of our Box Consulting team and system integrators that help customers implement cloud content management oriented use cases; a Customer Success Management group to assist customers in production; and an online community with self-service training materials, best practice guides and product documentation.\nNo customer represented 10% or more of our revenue in the year ended January 31, 2021. Our geographic revenue and segment information is set forth in Notes 2 and 14, respectively, of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nSales and Marketing\nWe offer our solution to customers as a subscription-based service, with subscription fees based on customer requirements, including the number of users and functionality deployed. The majority of our customers subscribe to our service through one-year contracts, although we also offer our services for terms ranging from one month to three years or more. We typically invoice our customers at the beginning of the contract term, in multiyear, annual, quarterly or monthly installments. We recognize revenue as we satisfy a performance obligation. Accordingly, due to our subscription model, we recognize revenue for our subscription and premier services ratably over the term of the contract.\nWe employ a direct sales team to offer a higher touch experience. We also make it easy for users and organizations to subscribe to paid versions of our service on our self-service web portal. Our sales team is composed of inside sales, outbound sales and field sales personnel who are generally organized by account size and geography, and/or major industry focus. We also have a rich ecosystem of channel partners who expand our reach to both large and small enterprises.\nWe generate customer leads, accelerate sales opportunities and build brand awareness through our marketing programs and through our strategic relationships. Our marketing programs target senior IT leaders, technology professionals and senior line of business leaders.\nAs a core part of our strategy, we have developed an ecosystem of partners to both broaden and complement our application offerings and to provide a broad array of services that fall outside of Box\u2019s areas of focus. These relationships include software and technology partners, as well as consulting and implementation services providers that enable Box to address a broader set of use cases for our customers.\nSales and marketing expenses were $275.7 million, $317.6 million and $312.2 million for the years ended January 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nResearch and Development\nOur ability to compete depends in large part on our continuous commitment to product development and our ability to rapidly introduce new applications, technologies, features and functionality. In simple conceptual form, we provide a single, secure, easy-to-use platform built for the entire content lifecycle. In practice, we develop and maintain a set of sophisticated software services (e.g., search, share, secure, convert/view, logging) around content. These services, which comprise our platform, are used to develop our own applications (e.g., sync, desktop, web, native mobile) and also support the development of third-party applications.\nOur product development organization is responsible for the specification, design, development and testing of our platform and applications. We focus our efforts on providing a platform that accelerates business processes, improves employee productivity, enables secure remote work, and protects an organization\u2019s most valuable data. We strive to continually improve our applications so that they help users and teams become more productive in their day-to-day work.\nResearch and development expenses were $201.3 million, $199.8 million and $163.8 million for the years ended January 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nCompetition\nThe cloud content management market is large, highly competitive and highly fragmented. It is subject to rapidly evolving technology, shifting customer needs and frequent introductions of new products and services. We face competition from a broad spectrum of technology providers: traditional cloud content management vendors who deploy on-premise and offer deep records management, business process workflow, and archival capabilities; newer mobile enterprise vendors who are beginning to enter the content collaboration market; vendors whose core competency is simple file sync and share, which can be deployed on-premises, hybrid, or via a SaaS delivery model; and social collaboration vendors who focus on the conversations that occur between teams. Our primary competitors in the cloud content management market include, but are not limited to, Microsoft and OpenText (Documentum). In the enterprise file sync and share market, our primary competitors include, but are not limited to, Microsoft, Google and, to a lesser extent, Dropbox.\nWe may face future competition in our markets from other large, established companies, as well as from smaller specialized companies. In addition, we expect continued consolidation in our industry which could adversely alter the competitive dynamics of our markets including both pricing and our ability to compete successfully for customers.\nThe principal competitive factors in our market include:\n\u2022\nenterprise-grade security and compliance;\n\u2022\nscalability of product and infrastructure for large deployments;\n\u2022\nability to store content in multiple geographic locations;\n\u2022\nspeed, availability, and reliability of the service;\n\u2022\nlow-cost, quick deployment;\n\u2022\nagnostic to device, operating system, and file type;\n\u2022\nease of user experience;\n\u2022\ncustomer-centric product development;\n\u2022\ncurrent and forward-thinking product development;\n\u2022\nautomation and workflow management;\n\u2022\ndepth of integration into enterprise applications, including office productivity, desktop and mobile tools;\n\u2022\nrich ecosystem of channel partners and applications;\n\u2022\nopen, extensible platform and APIs for custom application development;\n\u2022\nintelligent content management including metadata capabilities;\n\u2022\nsuperior customer service and commitment to customer success; and\n\u2022\nstrength of professional services organization.\nWe believe that we compete favorably on the basis of these factors, primarily because of our industry-leading security and compliance, cloud-native approach to real-time, internal and external collaboration, and integrations and open platform. Our ability to remain competitive will depend to a great extent upon our ongoing performance in the areas of product development, core technical innovation, platform and partner ecosystem, and customer support. In addition, many of our competitors may have greater name recognition, longer operating histories, larger marketing budgets, significantly greater resources and established relationships with our partners and customers, which can give them advantageous positioning for their products despite other competitive merits of respective product features and functionality. Some competitors may be able to devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products than we can to ours, which could allow them to respond more quickly than we can to new technologies and changes in customer needs.\nIntellectual Property\nWe rely on a combination of trade secrets, patents, copyrights and trademarks, as well as contractual protections, to establish and protect our intellectual property rights. As of January 31, 2021, our patents were set to expire between 2028 and 2039. We intend to pursue additional patent protection to the extent that we believe it would be beneficial and cost effective.\nWe require our employees, contractors, consultants and other third parties to enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements and control access to software, documentation and other proprietary information. Although we rely on the intellectual property rights and contractual protections described above, we believe that factors such as the technological and creative skills of our personnel, creation of new modules, features and functionality, and frequent enhancements to our applications are more essential to establishing and maintaining our technology leadership position.\nDespite our efforts to protect our proprietary technology and our intellectual property rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or obtain and use our technology to develop applications with the same functionality as our services. Policing unauthorized use of our technology and intellectual property rights on a global basis is difficult.\nWe expect that software and other applications in our industry may be subject to third-party infringement claims as the number of competitors grows and the functionality of applications in different industry segments overlaps. Any of these third parties might make a claim of infringement against us at any time.\nBacklog\nWe generally sign annual and multiple-year subscription contracts for our cloud content management services. The frequency of our invoices to each customer is negotiated and varies among our subscription contracts. We continued to focus on annual payment frequencies for multi-year contracts in the twelve months ended January 31, 2021. As a result, for multi-year contracts, we frequently invoice an initial amount at contract signing followed by subsequent annual invoices. Until amounts are invoiced, they are typically not recorded in revenue, deferred revenue, billings or elsewhere in our consolidated financial statements other than disclosed as part of remaining performance obligations. To the extent future invoicing is determined to be certain, we consider such future subscription invoices to be non-cancellable backlog, which is disclosed as part of remaining performance obligations. Future invoicing is determined to be certain when we have an executed non-cancellable contract or a significant penalty is due upon cancellation, and invoicing is not dependent on a future event such as the delivery of a specific new product or feature, or the achievement of contractual contingencies. We had $438.1 million and $353.4 million of non-cancellable backlog as of January 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The increase of non-cancellable backlog as of January 31, 2021 was primarily driven by expansion within existing customers as they broadened their deployment of our product offerings, longer customer contract durations, the addition of new customers, and the timing of customer-driven renewals.\nWe expect that the amount of backlog relative to the total value of our contracts will change from year to year due to several factors, including the timing and duration of customer subscription agreements, varying price, volume, and invoicing cycles of subscription contracts, the timing of scheduled customer renewals, and foreign currency fluctuations. Accordingly, we believe that fluctuations in backlog are not always a reliable indicator of future revenue and we do not utilize backlog as a key management metric internally.\nHuman Capital Resources\nOur company is built on people: We call them Boxers. They come from a range of backgrounds and experiences, and each of them has a unique story to tell. Our goal is to fully leverage and engage the individual talents and capabilities of our diverse teams, ultimately creating an inclusive environment where Boxers feel they belong. As of January 31, 2021, we employed 1,934 people. None of our employees are represented by a labor union. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we consider our relations with our employees to be very good.\nDiversity and Inclusion\nOne of our core values is creating a space where all Boxers can \u201cBring your (_____) self to work.\u201d We take great pride in celebrating our differences, and we hire the best talent from all backgrounds. We want to build teams that are as diverse as our customers and the world we live in, with a broad representation of gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation, religion, backgrounds, and perspectives - among many other dimensions of diversity.\nWhen it comes to recruiting, our hiring philosophy is centered around the belief that building diverse teams enables us to do our best work. Last year, all of our recruiters and hiring managers completed unconscious bias training and we now offer the lessons of unconscious bias training and best practices around interviewing to all interviewers and employees during our LearnFest training series. At our executive recruiting level, our policy is to interview at least one candidate from underrepresented backgrounds for all positions at the director level or above before making a hiring decision. At the university recruiting level, we have instituted programs to connect with underrepresented student groups and create a more fair and equitable hiring process. For example, our Box Business Fellowship provides students of historically underrepresented backgrounds with an opportunity to explore business careers in the tech industry. This program helps students develop the skills to succeed in tech industry roles and provides them with insights into the career opportunities available to them. In addition, participants in this program are also invited to an expedited interview process for available roles at Box.\nWe also ensure that Boxers can Bring their (_____) Self to Work by creating safe spaces for engagement and providing opportunities for networking and development, while promoting a culture of learning and allyship to ensure that the needs of underrepresented Boxers are lifted. We support a dynamic array of employee-led resource communities for historically underrepresented groups and different communities at Box, including Box Women\u2019s Network, Black Excellence Network, Latinx, Pride, and Box Vets, among others. For more information about our diversity and inclusion initiatives, we encourage you to visit our website at https://www.box.com/about-us/diversity-and-inclusion.\nLearning and Development\nWe want all of our employees to have thriving careers where they grow and develop in meaningful ways. There is no one-size-fits-all career path at Box, so we seek to ensure that every Boxer has the tools and support they need to drive their career. We do this by giving all Boxers access to learning and development opportunities based around individual needs in order to build up skill sets and experience. These initiatives include:\n\u2022\nInternal mobility: We acknowledge that career progression looks less like a ladder and more like a climbing wall. We stand behind the idea that enabling our employees to work cross-functionally and within different teams provides a broader perspective of Box that will allow them to succeed in the future.\n\u2022\nLearnFest: LearnFest, our learning lineup for skill development and personal and professional growth, happens three times each year. During LearnFest, the entire company has focused time for trainings, workshops, book clubs, and other learning events.\n\u2022\nProfessional coaching and external leadership development programs: We offer targeted professional coaching for all levels of our executive leadership team (i.e., director-level and above) as well as access to business education and networking programs such as The Leadership Consortium (Harvard), Stanford\u2019s Women\u2019s Executive Leadership program and AWE, Advancing Women Executives.\n\u2022\nOn-Demand Learning: We offer all Boxers access to an on-demand learning platform so they can develop anywhere, anytime, in any skills. There are more than 2,000 courses available at the disposal of any Boxer eager to learn, including over 600 courses aimed at personal development, management, and leadership plus hundreds of tech-based functional skill trainings.\nPay Equity\nWe hold ourselves accountable, which is why we signed the California Equal Pay Pledge. As part of our commitment, we conduct an annual companywide gender pay analysis on hiring and promotion procedures to reduce unconscious bias and structural barriers to equitable compensation. In addition, we externally benchmark the compensation we provide for each role to ensure pay parity, and provide periodic pay equity updates to the compensation committee of our board of directors.\nBoxer Experience Surveys\nWe survey employees two times a year to ensure that everyone\u2019s voice gets heard and we better understand the key areas where we can improve employee experience. These key areas include our experience with our managers, our ability to get work done, and our sense of belonging at work. Survey results are reviewed and become part of our action plans at all levels of the organization. Our People and Communities team incorporates survey feedback into our programs, policies, and the cultivated experiences that drive our culture. Our functional leaders leverage the feedback to drive annual plans across their teams to improve efficiency, establish communication channels, and reinforce behaviors aligned with our values. Finally, following each survey, managers discuss employee experience results with their team and form a plan to address issues that are identified in survey results.\nEmployee Health and Safety\nThe health and safety of our employees is one of our top priorities. We strive to create an environment where Boxers are physically and mentally safe and healthy. We offer a comprehensive health and wellness benefits package to all employees.\nIn response to the COVID-19 crisis, we convened a cross-functional team made up of leaders from across our organization who met frequently to ensure Boxers' safety and that business crisis plans were enacted, communicated, and running smoothly. As part of these plans, Box is offering flexible remote work arrangements to employees through September 2021. To support the well-being of Boxers during these challenging times, we launched \u201cFresh Air Fridays\u201d and \"Mental Health Mondays,\" global company-wide days of paid time off, offered subscriptions to an app for meditation and mental health, partnered with a third-party family support system for families at Box, and provided additional paid time off for our employees, among other things.\nCorporate Information\nOur website address is www.box.com, and our investor relations website is located at www.box.com/investors. The information on, or that can be accessed through, our website is not part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We were incorporated in 2005 as Box.Net, Inc., a Washington corporation, and later reincorporated in 2008 under the same name as a Delaware corporation. In November 2011, we changed our name to Box, Inc. The Box design logo, \u201cBox\u201d and our other registered and common law trade names, trademarks and service marks are the property of Box, Inc.

    "item_1A": "Item 1A. RISK FACTORS\nInvesting in our Class A common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including in the section titled \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and our consolidated financial statements and related notes, before making a decision to invest in our Class A common stock. If any of the risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects could be materially and adversely affected. In that event, the market price of our Class A common stock could decline, and you could lose part or all of your investment.\nRisk Factors Summary\nOur business is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those risks discussed at length below. These risks include, among others, the following:\n\u2022\nThe continuing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the resultant economic impacts, may have an adverse effect on our business, operations and future financial performance.\n\u2022\nThe market in which we participate is intensely competitive, and if we do not compete effectively, our operating results could be harmed.\n\u2022\nOur business depends substantially on customers renewing their subscriptions with us and expanding their use of our services. Any decline in our customer renewals or failure to convince our customers to broaden their use of our services would harm our future operating results.\n\u2022\nIf the market for cloud-based enterprise services declines or develops more slowly than we expect, our business could be adversely affected.\n\u2022\nBecause we recognize revenue from subscriptions for our services over the term of the subscription, downturns or upturns in new business may not be immediately reflected in our operating results.\n\u2022\nIf we are unable to attract new customers at rates that are consistent with our expectations, our future revenue and operating results could be adversely impacted.\n\u2022\nActual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our services or any breaches of our security controls and unauthorized access to our or a customer\u2019s data could harm our business and operating results.\n\u2022\nAs a substantial portion of our sales efforts are increasingly focused on cloud content management use cases and are targeted at enterprise and highly-regulated customers, our sales cycles may become longer and more expensive, we may encounter greater pricing pressure and implementation and customization challenges, and we may have to delay revenue recognition for more complicated transactions, all of which could harm our business and operating results.\n\u2022\nIf we fail to meet the service level commitments we provide under our subscription agreements, we could be obligated to provide credits or refunds for prepaid amounts related to unused subscription services or face subscription terminations, which could adversely affect our revenue. Furthermore, any failure in our delivery of high-quality customer support services may adversely affect our relationships with our customers and our financial results.\n\u2022\nPrivacy concerns and laws or other domestic or foreign regulations may reduce the effectiveness of our services and harm our business.\n\u2022\nIf we are not able to satisfy data protection, security, privacy, and other government- and industry-specific requirements, our growth could be harmed.\n\u2022\nOur platform must integrate with a variety of operating systems and software applications that are developed by others, and if we are unable to ensure that our solutions interoperate with such systems and applications, our service may become less competitive, and our operating results may be harmed.\n\u2022\nIf we fail to effectively manage our technical operations infrastructure, our customers may experience service outages and delays in the deployment of our services, which may adversely affect our business.\n\u2022\nInterruptions or delays in service from our third-party data center hosting facilities and cloud computing and hosting providers could impair the delivery of our services and harm our business.\n\u2022\nOur services are becoming increasingly mission-critical for our customers and if these services fail to perform properly or if we are unable to scale our services to meet the needs of our customers, our reputation could be adversely affected, our market share could decline and we could be subject to liability claims.\n\u2022\nOur growth depends in part on the success of our strategic relationships with third parties.\n\u2022\nWe depend on highly skilled personnel to grow and operate our business, and if we are unable to hire, retain and motivate our personnel, we may not be able to grow effectively.\n\u2022\nFailure to adequately expand and optimize our direct sales force and successfully maintain our online sales experience will impede our growth.\n\u2022\nAny acquisitions and investments we make could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition and operating results.\n\u2022\nWe may be sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights.\n\u2022\nAny failure to protect our intellectual property rights could impair our ability to protect our proprietary technology and brand.\n\u2022\nServicing our future debt may require a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to settle conversions of our convertible senior notes in cash, repay the convertible senior notes at maturity, or repurchase the convertible senior notes as required following a fundamental change.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Our Industry\nThe continuing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic may have an adverse effect on our business, operations and future financial performance.\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic. Governments and municipalities around the world have instituted measures to control the spread of COVID-19, including quarantines, shelter-in-place orders, school closures, travel restrictions, and closure of non-essential businesses. These measures have led to significant adverse economic impacts which have had, and could continue to have, an adverse impact on our business operations in a number of ways, including, without limitation, (1) disruptions to our sales operations and marketing efforts as a result of the inability of our sales team to travel and meet customers in person, (2) negative impacts on our customers and prospects that could result in (i) extended customer sales cycles, delayed spending on our services, impairment of our ability to collect accounts receivable, and (ii) reduced payment frequencies, demand for our services, renewal rates, and spending on our services, and (3) negative impacts to the financial condition or operations of our vendors and business partners, as well as disruptions to the supply chain of hardware needed to offer our services. Moreover, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we are temporarily requiring nearly all of our employees to work remotely, which may lead to disruptions and decreased productivity and other adverse operational business impacts. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic and resultant economic impact affects our business, results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted.\nThe market in which we participate is intensely competitive, and if we do not compete effectively, our operating results could be harmed.\nThe market for cloud content management services is fragmented, rapidly evolving and highly competitive, with relatively low barriers to entry for certain applications and services. Many of our competitors and potential competitors are larger and have greater brand recognition, longer operating histories, and significantly greater resources than we do. Our primary competitors in the cloud content management market include Microsoft and OpenText (Documentum). In the enterprise file sync and share market, our primary competitors include Microsoft, Google and, to a lesser extent, Dropbox. With the introduction of new technologies and market entrants, we expect competition to intensify in the future. If we fail to compete effectively, our business will be harmed. Some of our competitors offer their products or services at a lower price or for free, which has placed pricing pressure on our business. If we are unable to achieve our target pricing levels, our operating results will be negatively impacted. In addition, pricing pressures and increased competition could result in reduced sales, lower margins, losses or the failure of our services to achieve or maintain widespread market acceptance, any of which could harm our business.\nMany of our competitors are able to devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products or services. In addition, many of our competitors have established marketing relationships and major distribution agreements with channel partners, consultants, system integrators and resellers. Moreover, many software vendors could bundle products or offer them at lower prices as part of a broader product sale or enterprise license arrangement. Some competitors may offer products or services that address business execution functions at lower prices or with greater depth than our services. Our competitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards or customer requirements. Furthermore, some potential customers, particularly large enterprises, may elect to develop their own internal solutions. For any of these reasons, we may not be able to compete successfully against our current and future competitors.\nOur business depends substantially on customers renewing their subscriptions with us and expanding their use of our services. Any decline in our customer renewals or failure to convince our customers to broaden their use of our services would harm our future operating results.\nIn order for us to maintain or improve our operating results, it is important that our customers renew their subscriptions with us when their existing subscription term expires. We cannot assure you that customers will renew their subscriptions upon expiration at the same or higher level of service, if at all. Our net retention rate has decreased over time, and may continue to decrease in the future, as some of our customers have elected and may elect not to renew their subscriptions with us or to decrease the scope of their deployments. Our net retention rate was approximately 102% and 104% as of January 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nOur net retention rate may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including our customers\u2019 satisfaction with our services, the effectiveness of our customer support services, the performance of our partners and resellers, our pricing, the prices of competing products or services, mergers and acquisitions affecting our customer base and our ability to successfully integrate acquired technology into our products, our ability to execute on our product roadmap, the effects of global economic conditions, such as those arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, or reductions in our customers\u2019 spending levels. If our customers do not renew their subscriptions, renew them on less favorable terms, purchase fewer seats, or fail to purchase new product offerings, our revenue may decline, and we may not realize improved operating results from our customer base.\nIn addition, our business growth depends in part on our customers expanding their use of our services. The use of our cloud content management platform often expands within an organization as new users are added or as additional services are purchased by or for other departments within an organization. Further, as we have introduced new services throughout our operating history, our existing customers have constituted a significant portion of the users of such services. If our customers do not expand their use of our services, our operating results may be adversely affected.\nIf the market for cloud-based enterprise services declines or develops more slowly than we expect, our business could be adversely affected.\nThe market for cloud-based enterprise services is not as mature as the on-premise enterprise software market. Because we derive, and expect to continue to derive, substantially all of our revenue and cash flows from sales of our cloud content management solutions, our success will depend to a substantial extent on the widespread adoption of cloud computing in general and of cloud-based content management services in particular. Many organizations have invested substantial personnel and financial resources to integrate traditional enterprise software into their organizations and, therefore, may be reluctant or unwilling to migrate to a cloud-based model for storing, accessing, sharing and managing their content. It is difficult to predict customer adoption rates and demand for our services, the future growth rate and size of the cloud computing market or the entry of competitive services. The expansion of the cloud content management market depends on a number of factors, including the cost, performance and perceived value associated with cloud computing, as well as the ability of companies that provide cloud-based services to address security and privacy concerns. If there is a reduction in demand for cloud-based services, it could result in decreased revenue, harm our growth rates, and adversely affect our business and operating results.\nBecause we recognize revenue from subscriptions for our services over the term of the subscription, downturns or upturns in new business may not be immediately reflected in our operating results.\nWe generally recognize revenue from customers ratably over the terms of their subscription agreements, which are typically one year, although we also offer our services for terms ranging from one month to three years or more. As a result, most of the revenue we report in each quarter is the result of subscription agreements entered into during prior quarters. Consequently, a decline in new or renewed subscriptions in any one quarter may not be reflected in our revenue results for that quarter. However, any such decline will negatively affect our revenue in future quarters. Accordingly, the effect of significant downturns in sales, our failure to achieve our internal sales targets, a decline in the market acceptance of our services, or a decrease in our net retention rate may not be fully reflected in our operating results until future periods. Our subscription model also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue through additional sales in any period, as revenue from additional sales must be recognized over the applicable subscription term.\nIf we are unable to attract new customers at rates that are consistent with our expectations, our future revenue and operating results could be adversely impacted.\nIn order for us to improve our operating results and continue to grow our business, it is important that we continue to attract new customers and expand deployment of our solutions and products with existing customers. To the extent we are successful in increasing our customer base, we could incur increased losses because costs associated with new customers are generally incurred up front, while revenue is recognized ratably over the term of our subscription services. Alternatively, to the extent we are unsuccessful in increasing our customer base, we could also incur increased losses as costs associated with marketing programs and new products intended to attract new customers would not be offset by incremental revenue and cash flow. Catastrophic events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, may financially impact our existing and prospective customers and cause them to delay or reduce their technology spending, which may adversely affect our ability to attract new customers. All of these factors could negatively impact our future revenue and operating results.\nAdverse economic conditions may negatively impact our business.\nOur business depends on the overall demand for cloud content management services and on the economic health of our current and prospective customers. The United States and other key international economies have experienced cyclical downturns from time to time that have resulted in a significant weakening of the economy, more limited availability of credit, a reduction in business confidence and activity, and other difficulties that may affect one or more of the industries to which we sell our services. An economic downturn, recession, or uncertainty about economic conditions, including the effects of COVID-19, in the United States, Europe, Japan and other key markets for our services could cause customers to delay or reduce their information technology spending. This could result in reductions in sales of our services, longer sales cycles, reductions in subscription duration and value, slower adoption of new technologies and increased price competition. Any of these events would likely have an adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial position. In addition, there can be no assurance that cloud content management and collaboration spending levels will increase following any recovery.\nIf we are not able to successfully launch new products and services or provide enhancements or new features to our existing products and services, our business could be adversely affected.\nOur industry is marked by rapid technological developments and new and enhanced applications and services. If we are unable to provide enhancements and new features for our existing services or offer new services that achieve market acceptance or keep pace with rapid technological developments, our business could be adversely affected. The success of any new products and services, enhancements, or modifications to our existing products and services depends on several factors, including their timely completion, introduction and market acceptance. We also may experience business or economic disruptions that could adversely affect the productivity of our employees and result in delays in our product development process. For example, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we are temporarily requiring nearly all of our employees to work remotely, which may lead to disruptions and decreased productivity that could result in delays in our product development process. Failure in this regard may significantly impair our revenue growth and our future financial results. In addition, because our services are designed to operate on a variety of systems, we must continuously modify and enhance our services to keep pace with changes in\ninternet-related hardware, mobile operating systems, and other software, communication, browser and database technologies. We may not be successful in developing these modifications and enhancements or bringing them to market in a timely fashion. Furthermore, modifications to existing platforms or technologies will increase our research and development expenses. Any failure of our services to operate effectively with existing or future network platforms and technologies could reduce the demand for our services, result in customer dissatisfaction and adversely affect our business.\nActual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our services or any breaches of our security controls and unauthorized access to our or a customer\u2019s data could harm our business and operating results.\nThe services we offer involve the storage of large amounts of our and our customers\u2019 sensitive and proprietary information, some of which may be considered personally identifiable. Cyberattacks and other malicious internet-based activity continue to increase in frequency and in magnitude and we face security threats from malicious third parties that could obtain unauthorized access to our systems, infrastructure and networks. These threats may come from a variety of sources including nation-state sponsored espionage and hacking activities, industrial espionage, organized crime, sophisticated organizations, hacking groups and individuals and insider threats. These sources can also implement social engineering techniques to induce our partners, users, employees or customers to disclose passwords or other sensitive information or take other actions to gain access to our data or our users\u2019 data. Hackers that acquire user account information at other companies can attempt to use that information to compromise the accounts of personnel, or our users\u2019 accounts if an account shares the same sensitive information such as passwords. In addition, because the Box service is configured by administrators and users to select their default settings, the third-party integrations they enable, and their privacy and permissions settings, an administrator or user could intentionally or inadvertently configure settings to share their sensitive data. For example, a Box user can choose to share the content they store in Box with third parties by creating a link that can be customized to be accessible by anyone with the link. While this feature is designed to be used for a variety of legitimate use cases in which a user wishes to share non-sensitive content with a broad or public audience, if a user were to intentionally or inadvertently configure a setting that allowed public access to their sensitive data, that data could be discovered and accessed by an unintended third party. As we increase our customer base and our brand becomes more widely known and recognized, and as our service is used in more heavily regulated industries where there may be a greater concentration of sensitive and protected data, such as healthcare, government, life sciences, and financial services, we may become more of a target for these malicious third parties.\nGiven that our customers manage significant amounts of sensitive and proprietary information on our platform, and many of our customers are in heavily regulated industries where there may be a greater concentration of sensitive and proprietary data, our reputation and market position are particularly sensitive to impacts from actual or perceived security breaches or concerns regarding security. If our security measures are or are believed to be inadequate or breached as a result of third-party action, employee negligence, error or malfeasance, product defects, social engineering techniques, improper user configuration or otherwise, and this results in, or is believed to result in, the disruption of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of our data or our customers\u2019 data, we could incur significant liability to various parties, including our customers and individuals or organizations whose information is stored by our customers, and our business, reputation or competitive position may be harmed. Techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to, or to sabotage, systems or networks, are constantly evolving and generally are not recognized until launched against a target. Therefore, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques, react in a timely manner, or implement adequate preventive measures, and we may face delays in our detection or remediation of, or other responses to, security breaches and other security-related incidents. We also expect to incur significant costs in an effort to detect and prevent security breaches and other security-related incidents, and we may face increased costs and expend substantial resources in the event of an actual or perceived security breach or other security-related incident. Additionally, our service providers may suffer, or be perceived to suffer, data security breaches or other incidents that may compromise data stored or processed for us that may give rise to any of the foregoing.\nOur customer contracts often include (i) specific obligations that we maintain the availability of the customer\u2019s data through our service and that we secure customer content against unauthorized access or loss, and (ii) provisions whereby we indemnify our customers for third-party claims asserted against them that result from our failure to maintain the availability of their content or securing the same from unauthorized access or loss. While our customer contracts contain limitations on our liability in connection with these obligations and indemnities, if an actual or perceived security breach occurs, the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed, we could be subject to indemnity or damage claims in certain customer contracts, and we could lose future sales and customers, any of which could harm our business and operating results. Furthermore, while our errors and omissions insurance policies include liability coverage for certain of these matters, if we experience a widespread security breach or other incident that impacts a significant number of our customers to whom we owe indemnity obligations, we could be subject to indemnity claims or other damages that exceed our insurance coverage. We also cannot be certain that our insurance coverage will be adequate for data handling or data security liabilities actually incurred, that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all, or that any insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claim. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage, or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, could have a material adverse effect on our business, including our financial condition, operating results, and reputation.\nOur sales to government entities are subject to a number of additional challenges and risks.\nWe sell to government customers, and we may increase sales to government entities in the future. Selling to government entities can be highly competitive, often requiring significant upfront time and expense without any assurance that these efforts will generate a sale. Government certification requirements may change, or we may lose one or more government certifications, and in doing so restrict our ability to sell into the government sector or maintain existing government customers until we attain revised certifications. Government demand and payment for our products and services are affected by public sector budgetary cycles and funding authorizations, with funding reductions or delays adversely affecting public sector demand for our solutions. For example, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, many governments and municipalities are experiencing budget shortfalls, which may cause them to delay or reduce their technology spending. Moreover, an extended federal government shutdown resulting from budgetary decisions may limit or delay federal government spending on our solutions and adversely affect our revenue. Government entities may also have statutory, contractual or other legal rights to terminate contracts with us for convenience or due to a default, and any such termination may adversely affect our future operating results.\nAs a substantial portion of our sales efforts are increasingly focused on cloud content management use cases and are targeted at enterprise and highly-regulated customers, our sales cycles may become longer and more expensive, we may encounter greater pricing pressure and implementation and customization challenges, and we may have to delay revenue recognition for more complicated transactions, all of which could harm our business and operating results.\nAs a substantial portion of our sales efforts are increasingly focused on cloud content management use cases and are targeted at enterprise and highly-regulated customers, we face greater costs, longer sales cycles and less predictability in the completion of some of our sales. In this market segment, the customer\u2019s decision to use our services may be an enterprise-wide decision. These types of sales opportunities require us to provide greater levels of customer education regarding the uses and benefits of our services, as well as education regarding security, privacy, and data protection laws and regulations, especially for those customers in more heavily regulated industries or those with significant international operations. In addition, larger enterprises may demand more customization, integration, support services, and features. Furthermore, our sales efforts may be impeded by catastrophic events, including public health epidemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, that limit our ability to travel or meet customers in person. These factors could increase our costs, lengthen our sales cycle and leave fewer sales support and professional services resources for other customers. Professional services may also be performed by a third party or a combination of our own staff and a third party. Our strategy is to work with third parties to increase the breadth of capability and depth of capacity for delivery of these services to our customers. If a customer is not satisfied with the quality or interoperability of our services with their own IT environment, we could incur additional costs to address the situation, which could adversely affect our margins. Moreover, any customer dissatisfaction with our services could damage our ability to encourage broader adoption of our services by that customer. In addition, any negative publicity resulting from such situations, regardless of its accuracy, may further damage our business by affecting our ability to compete for new business with current and prospective customers.\nIf we fail to meet the service level commitments we provide under our subscription agreements, we could be obligated to provide credits or refunds for prepaid amounts related to unused subscription services or face subscription terminations, which could adversely affect our revenue. Furthermore, any failure in our delivery of high-quality customer support services may adversely affect our relationships with our customers and our financial results.\nOur customer subscription agreements provide service level commitments. If we are unable to meet our service level commitments or suffer periods of downtime that exceed the periods allowed under our customer agreements, we may be obligated to provide customers with service credits which could significantly impact our revenue in the period in which the downtime occurs and the credits could be due. For example, in 2019, a modification to a perimeter network configuration caused an internal routing problem that led to all Box services being temporarily unavailable. We could also face subscription terminations, which could significantly impact our current and future revenue. Any extended service outages could also adversely affect our reputation, which would also impact our future revenue and operating results.\nOur customers depend on our customer success organization to resolve technical issues relating to our services. We may be unable to respond quickly enough to accommodate short-term increases in customer demand for support services. Increased customer demand for these services, without corresponding revenue, could increase costs and adversely affect our operating results. In addition, our sales process is highly dependent on the ease of use of our services, on our reputation and on positive recommendations from our existing customers. Any failure to maintain high-quality customer support, or a market perception that we do not maintain high-quality support, could adversely affect our reputation and our ability to sell our services to existing and prospective customers.\nWe are in the process of expanding our international operations, which exposes us to significant risks.\nA key element of our growth strategy is to expand our international operations and develop a worldwide customer base. In addition, we expect to open one or more additional international offices and hire employees to work at these offices in order to gain access to additional talent. For example, we recently established an office in Warsaw, Poland and acquired SignRequest B.V., a company located in The Netherlands. Operating in international markets requires significant resources and management attention and will subject us to regulatory, economic, geographic, social, and political risks that differ from those in the United States. Because of our limited experience with international operations and significant differences between international and U.S. markets, we may not succeed in creating demand for our services outside of the United States or in effectively selling our services in all of the international markets we enter. In addition, we will face specific risks in doing business internationally that could adversely affect our business, including:\n\u2022\nthe need to localize and adapt our services for specific countries, including translation into foreign languages and associated expenses;\n\u2022\nlaws (and changes to such laws) relating to privacy, data protection and data transfer that, among other things, could require that customer data be stored and processed in a designated territory;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations;\n\u2022\ndifferent pricing environments, longer sales cycles and longer accounts receivable payment cycles and collections issues;\n\u2022\nnew and different sources of competition;\n\u2022\nweaker protection for intellectual property and other legal rights than in the United States and practical difficulties in enforcing intellectual property and other rights outside of the United States;\n\u2022\nlaws and business practices favoring local competitors, including economic tariffs;\n\u2022\nchanges in the geopolitical environment, the perception of doing business with U.S. based companies, and changes in regulatory requirements that impact our operating strategies, access to global markets or hiring;\n\u2022\ncompliance challenges related to the complexity of multiple, conflicting and changing governmental laws and regulations, including employment, tax, privacy and data protection laws and regulations;\n\u2022\nincreased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on the transfer of funds;\n\u2022\nreliance on third-party resellers and other parties;\n\u2022\nadverse tax consequences; and\n\u2022\nunstable regional, economic, social and political conditions.\nWe sell our services and incur operating expenses in various currencies. Therefore, fluctuations in the relative value of the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies may impact our operating results. We currently manage our exchange rate risk by matching foreign currency assets with payables and by maintaining minimal non-U.S. dollar cash reserves, but we do not have any other hedging programs in place to limit the risk of exchange rate fluctuation. In the future, however, to the extent our foreign currency exposures become more material, we may elect to deploy normal and customary hedging practices designed to more proactively mitigate such exposure. We cannot be certain such practices will ultimately be available and/or effective at mitigating all foreign currency risk to which we are exposed. If we are unsuccessful in detecting material exposures in a timely manner, our deployed hedging strategies are not effective, or there are no hedging strategies available for certain exposures that are prudent given the associated risks and the potential mitigation of the underlying exposure achieved, our operating results or financial position could be adversely affected in the future.\nIn addition, the United Kingdom\u2019s (UK) withdrawal from the European Union (EU), or Brexit, became effective on January 31, 2020. The UK and EU have signed an EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement, which became provisionally applicable on January 1, 2021 and will become formally applicable once ratified by the UK and EU. This agreement provides details on how some aspects of the UK and EU\u2019s relationship will operate going forward, however there continues to be uncertainty over the practical consequences of Brexit. Many of the regulations that now apply in the UK will likely be amended in the future as the UK determines its new approach, which may result in significant divergence from EU regulations. This lack of clarity could lead to economic and legal uncertainty, including significant volatility in global stock markets and currency exchange rates, among other things. Any of these effects of Brexit, among others, could adversely affect our operations, especially in the United Kingdom, and our financial results.\nIf we are unable to maintain and promote our brand, our business and operating results may be harmed.\nWe believe that maintaining and promoting our brand is critical to expanding our customer base. Maintaining and promoting our brand will depend largely on our ability to continue to provide useful, reliable and innovative services, which we may not do successfully. We may introduce new features, products, services or terms of service that our customers do not like, which may negatively affect our brand and reputation. Additionally, the actions of third parties may affect our brand and reputation if customers do not have a positive experience using third-party apps or other services that are integrated with Box. Maintaining and enhancing our brand may require us to make substantial investments, and these investments may not achieve the desired goals. If we fail to successfully promote and maintain our brand or if we incur excessive expenses in this effort, our business and operating results could be adversely affected.\nWe have a history of cumulative losses, and we may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability.\nWe incurred net losses of $43.4 million, $144.3 million, and $134.6 million in our fiscal years ended January 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. As of January 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $1.3 billion. These losses and accumulated deficit reflect the substantial investments we made to acquire new customers and develop our services. We intend to continue scaling our business to increase our number of users and paying organizations and to meet the increasingly complex needs of our customers. We have invested, and expect to continue to invest, in our sales and marketing organizations to sell our services around the world and in our product development organization to deliver additional features and capabilities of our cloud services to address our customers\u2019 evolving needs. We also expect to continue making significant investments in our infrastructure and in our professional service organization as we focus on customer success. Furthermore, to the extent we are successful in increasing our customer base, we will also incur increased losses due to upfront costs associated with acquiring new customers, including as a result of the limited free trial version of our service, and the nature of subscription revenue, which is generally recognized ratably over the term of the subscription period, which we offer for terms ranging from one month to three years or more. As a result, we cannot assure you that we will achieve profitability in the future or that, if we do become profitable, we will sustain profitability.\nOur quarterly results may fluctuate significantly and may not fully reflect the underlying performance of our business.\nOur quarterly operating results may vary significantly in the future, and period-to-period comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful. Accordingly, the results of any one quarter should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. Our quarterly financial results may fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors, and as a result, may not fully reflect the underlying performance of our business. Factors that may cause fluctuations in our quarterly financial results include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nour ability to attract and retain new customers;\n\u2022\nour ability to convert users of our limited free version to paying customers;\n\u2022\nthe addition or loss of large customers, including through acquisitions or consolidations;\n\u2022\nchanges in our net retention rate;\n\u2022\nthe timing of revenue recognition;\n\u2022\nthe impact on billings of customer shifts between payment frequencies;\n\u2022\nthe amount and timing of operating expenses related to the maintenance and expansion of our business, operations and infrastructure;\n\u2022\nnetwork or service outages, internet disruptions, disruptions to the availability of our service, security breaches or perceived security breaches and vulnerabilities;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic, industry and market conditions, including those caused by the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022\nincreases or decreases in the number of features or capabilities in our services or pricing changes upon any renewals of customer agreements;\n\u2022\nchanges in our go-to-market strategies and/or pricing policies and/or those of our competitors;\n\u2022\nseasonal variations in our billings results and sales of our services, which have historically been highest in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year;\n\u2022\nthe timing and success of new services and product introductions by us and our competitors or any other change in the competitive dynamics of our industry, including consolidation or new entrants among competitors, customers or strategic partners;\n\u2022\nchanges in usage or adoption rates of the internet and content management services;\n\u2022\nthe success of our strategic partnerships, including the performance of our resellers; and\n\u2022\nthe timing of expenses related to the development or acquisition of technologies or businesses and potential future charges for impairment of goodwill from acquired companies.\nRisks Related to Data Privacy and Data Security\nPrivacy concerns and laws or other regulations may reduce the effectiveness of our services and harm our business.\nUsers can use our services to store identifying information or information that otherwise is considered personal information. Federal, state and foreign government bodies and agencies have adopted or are considering adopting laws and regulations regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal information obtained from consumers, businesses and other individuals and entities. Data protection, privacy, consumer protection and other laws and regulations, particularly in Europe, are often more restrictive than those in the United States. The costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, such laws, policies and regulations that apply to our business or our customers\u2019 businesses may limit the use and adoption of our services and reduce overall demand for them.\nThese laws and regulations, which may be enforceable by private parties and/or governmental entities, are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change. A number of new laws coming into effect and/or proposals pending before federal, state and foreign legislative and regulatory bodies could affect our business. For example, the European Commission enacted the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which imposes significant obligations on companies regarding the handling of personal data and provides for penalties for noncompliance of up to the greater of 20 million euros or four percent of a company\u2019s global revenue. Further, local data protection authorities in Europe may adopt regulations and/or guidance more stringent than the GDPR, which may impose additional compliance costs or other burdens that impact our business. In 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) invalidated the EU-US Privacy Shield framework, and imposed additional obligations on companies when relying on model contractual clauses approved by the European Commission (EC) to transfer personal data from the EU to the U.S. This CJEU decision may result in the EC and European data protection regulators applying differing standards for, and requiring ad hoc verification of, transfers of personal data from the EU to the U.S. The CJEU\u2019s decision may require us to take additional steps to legitimize any personal data transfers that are impacted by this decision, which may result in increased costs of compliance and limitations on our customers and us. This CJEU decision or other legal challenges relating to cross-border data transfers may serve as a basis for challenges to our personal data handling practices, or those of our customers, and may otherwise adversely impact our business, financial condition and operating results.\nMoreover, Brexit has created uncertainty around data protection issues and could lead to further legislative and regulatory changes. For example, pursuant to a post-Brexit trade deal between the UK and the EU, transfers of personal information from the European Economic Area (EEA) to the UK are non-restricted for a period of up to six months from January 1, 2021. However, unless the EC makes an adequacy decision with respect to the UK before the end of that period, the UK will be considered a \u201cthird country\u201d under the GDPR and transfers of European personal information to the UK will require additional safeguard as stipulated by Chapter 5 of the GDPR to render such transfers lawful. Additionally, the UK Data Protection Act of 2018 substantially implements the GDPR in the UK and was the subject of statutory amendments that further aligned it with the GDPR in 2019. It remains unclear, however, how the UK\u2019s data protection laws or regulations will develop in the medium to longer term and how data transfers to and from the United Kingdom will be regulated.\nAdditionally, in 2018, the State of California enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), that became operative on January 1, 2020. The CCPA requires covered companies to, among other things, provide new disclosures to California consumers, and afford such consumers new abilities to opt-out of certain sales of personal information. Additionally, a new privacy law, the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA), was approved by California voters in November 2020. The CPRA\u2019s substantive provisions become effective on January 1, 2023, and new guidance and supporting regulations are expected to be introduced by July 1, 2022. The CPRA will replace the CCPA and may potentially result in further uncertainty and require us to incur additional costs and expenses. Aspects of the interpretation and enforcement of the CCPA and CPRA remain unclear. We cannot fully predict the impact of the CCPA and CPRA on our business or operations, but they may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and incur substantial costs and expenses in an effort to comply. There also have been a number of other recent legislative proposals in the United States, at both the federal and state level, that would impose new obligations in areas such as privacy and liability for copyright infringement by third parties.\nIn addition, some countries are considering or have enacted legislation requiring local storage and processing of data that could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our services. If we are unable to develop and offer services that meet our legal duties or help our customers meet their obligations under the laws or regulations relating to privacy, data protection, or information security, we may become subject to significant fines and penalties, which would harm our business.\nMoreover, these existing and proposed laws and regulations can be costly to comply with, delay or impede the development or adoption of our products and services, reduce the overall demand for our products and services, increase our operating costs, require significant management time and attention, and slow the pace at which we close (or prevent us from closing) sales transactions. Additionally, any actual or alleged noncompliance with these laws and regulations could result in negative publicity and subject us to investigations, claims or other remedies, including demands that we modify or cease existing business practices, and expose us to significant fines, penalties and other damages.\nFurthermore, government agencies may seek to access sensitive information that our users upload to Box, or restrict users\u2019 access to Box. Laws and regulations relating to government access and restrictions are evolving, and compliance with such laws and regulations could limit adoption of our services by users and create burdens on our business. Moreover, regulatory investigations into our compliance with privacy-related laws and regulations could increase our costs and divert management attention.\nIf we are not able to satisfy data protection, security, privacy, and other government- and industry-specific requirements, our growth could be harmed.\nThere are a number of data protection, security, privacy and other government- and industry-specific requirements, including those that require companies to notify individuals of data security incidents involving certain types of personal data. Security compromises experienced by our competitors, by our customers or by us may lead to public disclosures, which could harm our reputation, erode customer confidence in the effectiveness of our security measures, negatively impact our ability to attract new customers, or cause existing customers to elect not to renew their agreements with us. Our customers also expect, and in some instances require, us to meet voluntary certifications or adhere to standards established by third parties. Although we currently have certain certifications such as ISO/IEC 27001, 27017, and 27018, we may not be successful in continuing to maintain those certifications or in obtaining other certifications. In addition, some of the industries we serve have industry-specific requirements relating to compliance with certain security and regulatory standards, such as GxP and FedRAMP, and those required by HIPAA, FINRA, and the HITECH Act. As we expand into new industries and regions, we will likely need to comply with these and other new requirements to compete effectively. If we cannot adequately comply with these requirements, our growth could be adversely impacted, and we could incur significant liability and our reputation and business could be harmed.\nRisks Related to Our Technical Operations Infrastructure and Dependence on Third Parties\nIf we are unable to ensure that our solutions interoperate with operating systems and software applications developed by others, our service may become less competitive, and our operating results may be harmed.\nWe offer our services across a variety of operating systems and through the internet. We are dependent on the interoperability of our platform with third-party mobile devices, tablets, desktop and mobile operating systems, as well as web browsers that we do not control. Any changes in such systems, devices or web browsers that degrade the functionality of our services or give preferential treatment to competitive services could adversely affect usage of our services and our ability to deliver high quality services. We may not be successful in developing relationships with key participants in the mobile industry or in developing services that operate effectively with these operating systems, networks, infrastructure, devices, web browsers and standards. In the event that our users experience difficulty accessing and using our services, our user growth may be harmed, and our business and operating results could be adversely affected.\nIf we fail to effectively manage our technical operations infrastructure, our customers may experience service outages and delays in the deployment of our services, which may adversely affect our business.\nWe have experienced significant growth in the number of users and the amount of data that our operations infrastructure supports. We seek to maintain sufficient excess capacity in our operations infrastructure to meet our customers\u2019 needs. We also seek to maintain excess capacity to facilitate the rapid provisioning of new customer deployments and the expansion of existing customer deployments. In addition, we need to properly manage our technological operations infrastructure in order to support version control, changes in hardware and software parameters and the evolution of our services. However, the provision of new hosting infrastructure requires significant lead-time. We have experienced, and may in the future experience, website disruptions, incidents of data corruption, service outages and other performance problems. These problems may be caused by a variety of factors, including infrastructure changes, changes to our core services architecture, changes to our infrastructure necessitated by legal and compliance requirements governing the storage and transmission of data, human or software errors, viruses, security attacks, fraud, spikes in customer usage, primary and redundant hardware or connectivity failures, dependent data center and other service provider failures and denial of service issues. Additionally, our ability to properly manage our technical operations infrastructure depends on the reliability of the global supply chain for hardware, network, and platform infrastructure equipment. Significant and unforeseen disruptions to the supply\nchain may impede our ability to meet our infrastructure capacity requirements. In some instances, we may not be able to identify the cause or causes of these performance problems within an acceptable period of time, which may harm our reputation and operating results. Furthermore, if we encounter any of these problems in the future, our customers may lose access to important data or experience data corruption or service outages that may subject us to financial penalties, other liabilities and customer losses. If our operations infrastructure fails to keep pace with increased sales, customers may experience delays as we seek to obtain additional capacity, which could adversely affect our reputation and our business.\nInterruptions or delays in service from our third-party data center hosting facilities and cloud computing and hosting providers could impair the delivery of our services and harm our business.\nWe currently store and process our customers\u2019 information within multiple third-party data center hosting facilities located in Nevada and in third-party cloud computing and hosting facilities inside and outside of the United States. As part of our disaster recovery arrangements, our production environment and metadata related to our customers\u2019 data is currently replicated in near real time in facilities located in Nevada. In addition, all of our customers\u2019 data is typically replicated on third-party storage platforms located inside and outside of the United States. These facilities may be located in areas prone to natural disasters and may experience events such as earthquakes, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunications failures and similar events. They may also be subject to break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism, cyber-attacks and similar misconduct, including by state-sponsored or otherwise well-funded actors. Any damage to, or failure of, our systems generally, or those of the third-party cloud computing and hosting providers, could result in interruptions in our service, which may reduce our revenue, cause us to issue credits or pay penalties, cause customers to terminate their subscriptions and adversely affect our renewal rate and our ability to attract new customers. In addition, we may not have adequate insurance coverage to compensate for losses from a major interruption. Our business will also be harmed if our customers and potential customers believe our service is unreliable. Despite precautions taken at our third-party data center hosting facilities, the occurrence of disasters, security issues (including an act of terrorism or an armed conflict), certain geopolitical events, labor or trade disputes, or pandemics (such as COVID-19), could lead to a decision to close the facilities without adequate notice or other unanticipated problems that result in lengthy interruptions in our service or cause us to not comply with certification requirements. Even with the disaster recovery arrangements, we have never performed a full live failover of our services and, in an actual disaster, we could learn our recovery arrangements are not sufficient to address all possible scenarios and our service could be interrupted for a longer period than expected. For example, in 2019, a modification to a perimeter network configuration caused an internal routing problem which led to all Box services being temporarily unavailable. As we continue to add data centers, increase our dependence on third-party cloud computing and hosting providers, and add capacity in our existing data centers, we may move or transfer our data and our customers\u2019 data. Despite precautions taken during any of these data center moves and data transfers, any unsuccessful data transfers may impair the delivery of our service and materially and adversely disrupt our operations and our service delivery to our customers, which could result in contractual penalties or damage claims from customers. In addition, changes to our data center infrastructure could occur over a period longer than planned, require greater than expected investment and other internal and external resources and cause us to incur increased costs as we operate multiple data center facilities. It may also take longer than expected to realize the intended benefits from any data center infrastructure migrations and improvements, and disruptions or unexpected costs may continue to occur while we enhance our data center infrastructure.\nOur services are becoming increasingly mission-critical for our customers and if these services fail to perform properly or if we are unable to scale our services to meet the needs of our customers, our reputation could be adversely affected, our market share could decline and we could be subject to liability claims.\nOur services are becoming increasingly mission-critical to our customers\u2019 business operations, as well as their ability to comply with legal requirements, regulations, and standards such as GxP, FINRA, HIPAA, and FedRAMP. These services and offerings are inherently complex and may contain material defects or errors that could cause interruptions in the availability of our services, as well as user error, which could result in loss or delayed market acceptance and sales, breach of contract or warranty claims, issuance of sales credits or refunds for prepaid amounts related to unused subscription services, loss of customers, diversion of development and customer service resources, and harm to our reputation. The costs incurred in correcting any material defects or errors might be substantial and could adversely affect our operating results. Further, our errors and omissions insurance may be inadequate or may not be available in the future on acceptable terms, or at all. In addition, our insurance may not cover all claims made against us and defending a lawsuit, regardless of its merit, could be costly and divert management\u2019s attention.\nBecause of the large amount of data that we collect and manage, it is possible that hardware failures, software errors, errors in our systems, or by third-party service providers, user errors, or internet outages could result in significant data loss or corruption. Furthermore, the availability or performance of our services could be adversely affected by a number of factors, including customers\u2019 inability to access the internet, the failure of our network or software systems, security breaches or variability in customer traffic for our services. We have been, and in the future may be, required to issue credits or refunds for prepaid amounts related to unused services or otherwise be liable to our customers for damages they may incur resulting from some of these events.\nFurthermore, we will need to ensure that our services can scale to meet the needs of our customers, particularly as we continue to focus on larger enterprise customers. If we are not able to provide our services at the scale required by our customers, potential customers may not adopt our solution and existing customers may not renew their agreements with us.\nWe rely on third parties for certain financial and operational services essential to our ability to manage our business. A failure or disruption in these services could materially and adversely affect our ability to manage our business effectively.\nWe rely on third parties for certain essential financial and operational services. Most of these services have traditionally been provided by large enterprise software vendors who license their software to customers. However, we receive many of these services on a subscription basis from various software-as-a-service companies that are smaller and have shorter operating histories than traditional software vendors. Moreover, these vendors provide their services to us via a cloud-based model instead of software that is installed on our premises. We depend upon these vendors to provide us with services that are always available and are free of errors or defects that could cause disruptions in our business processes, and any failure by these vendors to do so, or any disruptions in networks or the availability of the internet, would adversely affect our ability to operate and manage our operations.\nWe employ third-party software for use in or with our services, and the inability to maintain licenses to this software, or errors in the software, could result in increased costs, or reduced service levels, which would adversely affect our business.\nOur services incorporate certain third-party software obtained under open source licenses or licenses from other companies. We anticipate that we will continue to rely on such third-party software and development tools in the future. Although we believe that there are commercially reasonable alternatives to the third-party software we currently license, this may not always be the case, or it may be difficult or costly to replace. In addition, integration of the software used in our services with new third-party software may require significant work and require substantial investment of our time and resources. Also, to the extent that our services depend upon the successful operation of third-party software in conjunction with our software, any undetected errors or defects in this third-party software could prevent the deployment or impair the functionality of our services, delay the introduction of new services, result in a failure of our services, and injure our reputation. For example, we discovered that a bug in a third-party software library we use in our services caused a very small subset of files uploaded during a short period of time (from mid-December 2017 to early January 2018) to be stored in a partially-corrupted state. Our use of additional or alternative third-party software would require us to enter into additional license agreements with third parties. If we are unable to maintain licenses to software necessary to operate our business, or if third-party software that we use contains errors or defects, our costs may increase, or the services we provide may be harmed, which would adversely affect our business.\nOur growth depends in part on the success of our strategic relationships with third parties.\nIn order to grow our business, we anticipate that we will continue to depend on our relationships with third parties, such as alliance partners, resellers, distributors, system integrators and developers. For example, we have entered into agreements with partners such as IBM, Microsoft, Google, Macnica Networks, and Mitsui Knowledge Industry to market, resell, integrate with or endorse our services. Identifying partners and resellers, and negotiating and documenting relationships with them, requires significant time and resources.\nWe also depend on our ecosystem of system integrators, partners and developers to create applications that will integrate with our platform or permit us to integrate with their product offerings. This presents certain risks to our business, including:\n\u2022\nwe cannot provide any assurance that these third-party applications and products meet the same quality standards that we apply to our own development efforts, and to the extent that they contain bugs or defects or otherwise fail to perform as expected, they may create disruptions in our customers\u2019 use of our services or negatively affect our brand and reputation;\n\u2022\nwe do not currently provide support for software applications developed by our partner ecosystem, and users may be left without support and potentially cease using our services if these system integrators and developers do not provide adequate support for their applications;\n\u2022\nwe cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to successfully integrate our services with our partners\u2019 products or that our partners will continue to provide us the right to do so; and\n\u2022\nthese system integrators, partners and developers may not possess the appropriate intellectual property rights to develop and share their applications.\nIn addition, our competitors may be effective in providing incentives to third parties to favor their products or services, or to prevent or reduce subscriptions to our services. In some cases, we also compete directly with our partners\u2019 product offerings, and if these partners stop reselling or endorsing our services or impede our ability to integrate our services with their products, our business and operating results could be adversely affected. Moreover, competitor acquisitions of our partners could result in a decrease in the number of current and potential customers, as our partners may no longer facilitate the adoption of our services by potential customers.\nIf we are unsuccessful in establishing or maintaining our relationships with third parties, or realizing the anticipated benefits from such partnerships, our ability to compete in the marketplace or to grow our revenue could be impaired and our operating results may suffer. Even if we are successful, we cannot assure you that these relationships will result in increased customer usage of our services or increased revenue.\nOur business is subject to the risks of natural disasters, pandemics and other catastrophic events that could disrupt our business operations and our business continuity and disaster recovery plans may not adequately protect us from a serious disaster.\nThe occurrence of any catastrophic event, including a pandemic (such as COVID-19), earthquake, fire, flood, tsunami, or other weather event, power loss, telecommunications failure, software or hardware malfunctions, cyber-attack, war, or terrorist attack, could result in lengthy interruptions in our service. Our corporate headquarters is located in the San Francisco Bay Area, a region known for seismic activity. Our insurance coverage may not compensate us for losses that may occur in the event of an earthquake or other significant natural disaster. In addition, pandemics, acts of terrorism or war could cause disruptions to the internet or the economy as a whole, which could have a significant impact on our business and operating results. If our or our partners\u2019 business continuity and disaster recovery arrangements prove to be inadequate, our services could be interrupted. Our partners, suppliers, and customers are also subject to the risk of catastrophic events. In those events, our ability to deliver our services in a timely manner, as well as the demand for our services, may be adversely impacted by factors outside our control. If our systems were to fail or be negatively impacted as a result of a natural disaster, pandemic or other catastrophic event, our ability to deliver our services to our customers would be impaired, we could lose critical data, our reputation could suffer and we could be subject to contractual penalties.\nIf we overestimate or underestimate our data center capacity requirements, our operating results could be adversely affected.\nWe continuously evaluate our short- and long-term data center capacity requirements to ensure adequate capacity for new and existing customers while minimizing unnecessary excess capacity costs. If we overestimate the demand for our cloud content management services and therefore secure excess data center capacity, or if we are unable to meet our contractual minimum commitments, our operating margins could be reduced. If we underestimate our data center capacity requirements, we may not be able to service the expanding needs of customers and may be required to limit new customer acquisition, which would impair our revenue growth. Furthermore, regardless of our ability to appropriately manage our data center capacity requirements, only a small percentage of our customers currently use Box to organize all of their internal files, and an increase in the number of organizations, in particular large businesses and enterprises, that use our service as a larger component of their content storage requirements, could result in lower gross and operating margins or otherwise have an adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results.\nChanges in laws and regulations related to the internet or changes in the internet infrastructure itself, or disruption in access to the internet or critical services on which the internet depends, may diminish the demand for our services, and could have a negative impact on our business.\nThe future success of our business depends upon the continued use and availability of the internet as a primary medium for commerce, communication and business services. Federal, state or foreign government bodies or agencies have in the past adopted, and may in the future adopt, laws or regulations affecting the use of the internet as a commercial medium. The adoption of any laws or regulations that adversely affect the growth, popularity or use of the internet, including laws or practices limiting internet neutrality, could decrease the demand for, or the usage of, our services, increase our cost of doing business, adversely affect our operating results, and require us to modify our services in order to comply with these changes. In addition, government agencies or private organizations may begin to impose taxes, fees or other charges for accessing the internet or commerce conducted via the internet. These laws or charges could limit the growth of internet-related commerce or communications generally, or result in reductions in the demand for internet-based services such as ours.\nIn addition, the use of the internet and, in particular, the cloud as a business tool could be adversely affected due to delays in the development or adoption of new standards and protocols to handle increased demands of internet activity, security, reliability, cost, ease of use, accessibility, and quality of service. The performance of the internet and its acceptance as a business tool have been adversely affected by \u201cviruses,\u201d \u201cworms,\u201d \u201cdenial of service attacks\u201d and similar malicious activity. The internet has also experienced a variety of outages, disruptions and other delays as a result of this malicious activity targeted at critical internet infrastructure. These service disruptions could diminish the overall attractiveness to existing and potential customers of services that depend on the internet and could cause demand for our services to suffer.\nRisks Related to Employees and Managing Our Growth\nWe depend on highly skilled personnel to grow and operate our business, and if we are unable to hire, retain and motivate our personnel, we may not be able to grow effectively.\nOur future success depends upon our continued ability to identify, hire, develop, motivate and retain highly skilled personnel, representing diverse backgrounds, experiences, and skill sets, including senior management, engineers, designers, product managers, sales representatives, and customer support representatives. Identifying, recruiting, training and integrating qualified individuals will require significant time, expense and attention. In addition to hiring new employees, we must continue to focus on retaining our best employees, and fostering a diverse and inclusive work environment that enables all of our employees to prosper. Competition for highly skilled personnel is intense, particularly in the San Francisco Bay Area, where our headquarters is located. Moreover, our ability to attract and hire personnel may be materially adversely affected by changes to immigration laws or the availability of work visas. We may need to invest significant amounts of cash and equity to attract and retain new employees, and we may never realize returns on these investments. If we are not able to effectively add and retain employees, our ability to achieve our strategic objectives will be adversely impacted, and our business will be harmed.\nOur success is also dependent upon contributions from our executive officers and other key employees and, in particular, Aaron Levie, our co-founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. There may be changes in our senior management team that could disrupt our business. The loss of one or more of our executive officers or key employees, or the failure of our senior management team to work together effectively and execute our plans and strategies, could harm our business.\nFailure to adequately expand and optimize our direct sales force and successfully maintain our online sales experience will impede our growth.\nWe will need to continue to optimize our sales infrastructure in order to grow our customer base and business. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we are temporarily requiring nearly all of our employees to work remotely and restricting business travel, which may negatively impact our ability to recruit and train our sales force. Our business may be adversely affected if our efforts to expand and train our direct sales force do not generate a corresponding increase in revenue. If we are unable to hire, develop and retain talented sales personnel or if new direct sales personnel are unable to achieve desired productivity levels in a reasonable period of time, we may not realize the intended benefits of this investment or increase our revenue.\nWe maintain our Box website to efficiently service our high volume, low dollar customer transactions and certain customer inquiries. Our goal is to continue to evolve this online experience so it effectively serves the increasing and changing needs of our growing customer base. If we are unable to maintain the effectiveness of our online solution to meet the future needs of our online customers and to eliminate fraudulent transactions occurring in this channel, we could see reduced online sales volumes as well as a decrease in our sales efficiency, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nAny acquisitions and investments we make could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition and operating results.\nWe have acquired, and may in the future acquire, other companies, employee teams, or technologies to complement or expand our services and grow our business. For example, in February 2021 we acquired SignRequest. The identification of suitable acquisition candidates can be difficult, time-consuming and costly, and we may not be able to successfully complete or integrate identified acquisitions. Moreover, we may not successfully evaluate or utilize the acquired technology or personnel, or accurately forecast the financial impact of an acquisition. The risks we face in connection with acquisitions include:\n\u2022\ndiversion of management time and focus from operating our business to addressing acquisition integration challenges;\n\u2022\ncoordination of research and development and sales and marketing functions;\n\u2022\nretention of key employees from the acquired company;\n\u2022\ncultural challenges associated with integrating employees from the acquired company into our organization;\n\u2022\nintegration of the acquired company\u2019s technology and products into our business, particularly if the acquired company\u2019s software and services are not easily adapted to work with our products;\n\u2022\nintegration of the acquired company\u2019s accounting, management information, human resources and other administrative systems, as well as the acquired operations, and any unanticipated expenses related to such integration;\n\u2022\nthe need to implement or improve controls, procedures, and policies at a business that prior to the acquisition may have lacked effective controls, procedures and policies;\n\u2022\nliability for activities of the acquired company before the acquisition, including intellectual property infringement claims, violations of laws, commercial disputes, tax liabilities and other known and unknown liabilities;\n\u2022\ncompleting the transaction and achieving the anticipated benefits of the acquisition within the expected timeframe or at all;\n\u2022\nunanticipated write-offs, expenses, charges or risks associated with the transaction;\n\u2022\nlitigation or other claims in connection with the acquired company, including claims from terminated employees, customers, former stockholders or other third parties, which may differ from or be more significant than the risks our business faces; and\n\u2022\nacquisitions could result in dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt.\nOur failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with our past or future acquisitions and investments could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions or investments, cause us to incur unanticipated liabilities, and harm our business generally. Future acquisitions could also result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities, amortization expenses, incremental operating expenses or the write-off of goodwill, any of which could harm our financial condition or operating results.\nOur company culture has contributed to our success, and if we cannot maintain this culture as we grow, we could lose the innovation, creativity and teamwork fostered by our culture, and our business may be harmed.\nWe believe that our culture has been and will continue to be a key contributor to our success. We expect to continue to hire additional employees as we expand our business. If we do not continue to develop our company culture or maintain our core values as we grow and evolve both in the United States and abroad, we may be unable to foster the innovation, creativity and teamwork we believe we need to support our growth.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nWe may be sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights.\nThere is considerable patent and other intellectual property development activity in our industry. Our success depends on our not infringing upon the valid intellectual property rights of others. Our competitors, as well as a number of other entities, including non-practicing entities, and individuals, may own or claim to own intellectual property relating to our industry.\nFrom time to time, third parties have claimed and in the future may claim that we are infringing upon their intellectual property rights, and we may be found to be infringing upon such rights. We may be unaware of the intellectual property rights that others may claim cover some or all of our technology or services. Any claims or litigation could cause us to incur significant expenses and, if successfully asserted against us, could require that we pay substantial damages or ongoing royalty payments, prevent us from offering our services, or require that we comply with other unfavorable terms. We may also be obligated to indemnify our customers or business partners or pay substantial settlement costs, including royalty payments, in connection with any such claim or litigation and to obtain licenses, modify services, or refund fees, which could be costly. Even if we were to prevail in such a dispute, any litigation regarding our intellectual property could be costly and time consuming and divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations. During the course of any litigation, we may make announcements regarding the results of hearings and motions, and other interim developments. If securities analysts or investors regard these announcements as negative, the market price of our Class A common stock may decline.\nAny failure to protect our intellectual property rights could impair our ability to protect our proprietary technology and brand.\nOur success and ability to compete depend in part on our intellectual property. We primarily rely on copyright, patent, trade secret and trademark laws, trade secret protection and confidentiality or license agreements with our employees, customers, partners and others to protect our intellectual property rights. However, the steps we take to protect our intellectual property rights may be inadequate. We may not be able to obtain any further patents, and our pending applications may not lead to the issuance of patents. We may also have to expend significant resources to obtain additional patents as we expand our international operations.\nIn order to protect our intellectual property rights, we may spend significant resources to monitor and protect these rights. Litigation brought to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights could be costly, time-consuming and distracting to management and may result in the impairment or loss of portions of our intellectual property. Furthermore, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights may be met with defenses, counterclaims and countersuits attacking the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights. Accordingly, we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property. Our failure to secure, protect and enforce our intellectual property rights could materially adversely affect our brand and adversely impact our business.\nOur services contain open source software, and we license some of our software through open source projects, which may pose particular risks to our proprietary software, products, and services in a manner that could have a negative impact on our business.\nWe use open source software in our services and will use open source software in the future. In addition, we regularly contribute software source code to open source projects under open source licenses or release internal software projects under open source licenses, and anticipate doing so in the future. The terms of many open source licenses to which we are subject have not been interpreted by U.S. or foreign courts, and there is a risk that open source software licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to provide or distribute our services. Additionally, we may from time to time face claims from third parties claiming ownership of, or demanding release of, the open source software or derivative works that we developed using such software, which could include our proprietary source code, or otherwise seeking to enforce the terms of the applicable open source license. These claims could result in litigation and could require us to make our software source code freely available, purchase a costly license or cease offering the implicated services unless and until we can re-engineer them to avoid infringement. This re-engineering process could require significant additional research and development resources, and we may not be able to complete it successfully. In addition to risks related to license requirements, use of certain open source software can lead to greater risks than use of third-party commercial software, as open source code may contain bugs or other defects and open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on the functionality or origin of software. Additionally, because any software source code we contribute to open source projects is publicly available, our ability to protect our intellectual property rights with respect to such software source code may be limited or lost entirely, and we cannot prevent our competitors or others from using such contributed software source code. Any of these risks could be difficult to eliminate or manage and could have a negative effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Position and Need for Additional Capital\nWe may require additional capital to support our operations or the growth of our business, and we cannot be certain that this capital will be available on reasonable terms when required, or at all.\nOn occasion, we may need additional financing for a variety of reasons, including operating or growing our business, responding to business opportunities, undertaking acquisitions, or repaying our convertible senior notes. Our ability to obtain additional financing, if and when required, will depend on investor and lender demand, our operating performance, the condition of the capital markets and other factors. We cannot guarantee that additional financing will be available to us on favorable terms when required, or at all. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity, equity-linked or debt securities, those securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to the rights of our Class A common stock, and our existing stockholders may experience dilution. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when we require it, our ability to continue to support the operation or growth of our business could be significantly impaired and our operating results may be harmed.\nFinancing agreements we are party to or may become party to may contain operating and financial covenants that restrict our business and financing activities.\nOur senior credit facility contains certain operating and financial restrictions and covenants that may restrict our and our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to, among other things, incur indebtedness, grant liens on our assets, make loans or investments, consummate certain merger and consolidation transactions, dispose of assets, incur contractual obligations and commitments and enter into affiliate transactions, subject in each case to customary exceptions. We are also required to comply with a minimum liquidity covenant and a maximum leverage ratio. These restrictions and covenants, as well as those contained in any future financing agreements that we may enter into, may restrict our ability to finance our operations, engage in, expand or otherwise pursue our business activities and strategies. Our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control, and breaches of these covenants could result in a default under the senior credit facility and any future financial agreements that we may enter into and under other arrangements containing cross-default provisions. If not waived, defaults could cause our outstanding indebtedness under our senior credit facility and any future financing agreements that we may enter into to become immediately due and payable, and permit our lenders to terminate their lending commitments and to foreclose upon any collateral securing such indebtedness.\nRisks Related to Financial, Accounting, Tax and Other Legal Matters\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting, our ability to produce timely and accurate financial statements or comply with applicable regulations could be impaired.\nAs a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). We expect that compliance with these rules and regulations will continue to increase our legal, accounting and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time consuming and costly, and place significant strain on our personnel, systems and resources.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures, and internal control over financial reporting. We are continuing to develop and refine our disclosure controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file with the SEC is properly recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms. We are also continuing to improve our internal control over financial reporting. We have expended, and anticipate that we will continue to expend, significant resources in order to maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting.\nOur current controls and any new controls that we develop may become inadequate because of changes in conditions in our business, including increased complexity resulting from our international expansion. Further, weaknesses in our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting may be discovered in the future. Additionally, to the extent that we acquire other businesses, the acquired company may not have a sufficiently robust system of internal controls and we may uncover new deficiencies. Any failure to develop or maintain effective controls, or any difficulties encountered in their implementation or improvement, could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations and may result in a restatement of our financial statements for prior periods. Any failure to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could also adversely affect the results of management reports and independent registered public accounting firm audits of our internal control over financial reporting that we are required to include in our periodic reports that we file with the SEC. Ineffective disclosure controls and procedures, and internal control over financial reporting could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial and other information, which would likely have a negative effect on the market price of our Class A common stock. In addition, if we are unable to continue to meet these requirements, we may not be able to remain listed on the NYSE.\nAny failure to maintain effective disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting could have a material and adverse effect on our business and operating results, and cause a decline in the market price of our Class A common stock.\nOur reported financial results may be adversely affected by changes in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.\nGenerally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) in the United States are subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), the SEC and various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles. A change in these principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported financial results, and could affect the reporting of transactions completed before the announcement of a change. In addition, were we to change our critical accounting estimates, including the timing of recognition of subscription revenue and other revenue sources, our results of operations could be significantly impacted. These or other changes in accounting principles could adversely affect our financial results. Any difficulties in implementing these pronouncements could cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations, which could result in regulatory discipline and harm investors\u2019 confidence in us.\nTax laws or regulations could be enacted or changed and existing tax laws or regulations could be applied to us or to our customers in a manner that could increase the costs of our services and adversely impact our business.\nThe application of federal, state, local and international tax laws to services provided electronically is unclear and continuously evolving. Income, sales, use or other tax laws, statutes, rules, regulations or ordinances could be enacted or amended at any time, such as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in the United States, possibly with retroactive effect, and could be applied solely or disproportionately to services provided over the internet. These enactments or amendments could adversely affect our sales activity due to the inherent cost increase the taxes would represent and ultimately result in a negative impact on our operating results and cash flows.\nIn addition, existing tax laws, statutes, rules, regulations or ordinances could be interpreted or applied adversely to us, possibly with retroactive effect, which could require us or our customers to pay additional tax amounts, as well as require us or our customers to pay fines or penalties, as well as interest for past amounts. If we are unsuccessful in collecting such taxes due from our customers, we could be held liable for such costs, thereby adversely impacting our operating results and cash flows.\nWe may be subject to additional tax liabilities.\nWe are subject to income, sales, use, value added and other taxes in the United States and other countries in which we conduct business, and such laws and rates vary by jurisdiction. Our income tax obligations are based in part on our corporate structure and intercompany arrangements, including the manner in which we acquire, develop, value, and use our intellectual property and the valuations of our intercompany transactions. Certain jurisdictions in which we do not collect sales, use, value added or other taxes on our sales may assert that such taxes are applicable, which could result in tax assessments, penalties and interest, and we may be required to collect such taxes in the future. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. These determinations are highly complex and require detailed analysis of the available information and applicable statutes and regulatory materials. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical tax practices, provisions and accruals. If we receive an adverse ruling as a result of an audit, or we unilaterally determine that we have misinterpreted provisions of the tax regulations to which we are subject, there could be a material effect on our tax provision, net loss or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made. In addition, liabilities associated with taxes are often subject to an extended or indefinite statute of limitations period. Therefore, we may be subject to additional tax liability (including penalties and interest) for a particular year for extended periods of time.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nAs of January 31, 2021, we had U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $697.1 million, state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $561.7 million, and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $318.4 million. Under Sections 382 and 383 of Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change,\u201d the corporation\u2019s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes, such as research tax credits, to offset its post-\nchange income and taxes may be limited. In general, an \u201cownership change\u201d occurs if there is a cumulative change in our ownership by \u201c5% shareholders\u201d that exceeds 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period. Similar rules may apply under state tax laws. If we experience ownership changes as a result of future transactions in our stock, then we may be further limited in our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and other tax assets to reduce taxes owed on the net taxable income that we earn. Any such limitations on the ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and other tax assets could adversely impact our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe are subject to governmental export controls that could impair our ability to compete in international markets due to licensing requirements and economic sanctions programs that subject us to liability if we are not in full compliance with applicable laws.\nCertain of our services are subject to export controls, including the U.S. Department of Commerce\u2019s Export Administration Regulations and various economic and trade sanction regulations administered by the U.S. Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Controls. The provision of our products and services must comply with these laws. The U.S. export control laws and U.S. economic sanctions laws include prohibitions on the sale or supply of certain products and services to U.S. embargoed or sanctioned countries, governments, persons and entities and also require authorization for the export of encryption items. In addition, various countries regulate the import of certain encryption technology, including through import permitting and licensing requirements, and have enacted laws that could limit our ability to distribute our services or could limit our customers\u2019 ability to implement our services in those countries.\nAlthough we take precautions to prevent our services from being provided in violation of such laws, our solutions may have been in the past, and could in the future be, provided inadvertently in violation of such laws, despite the precautions we take. If we fail to comply with these laws, we and our employees could be subject to civil or criminal penalties, including the possible loss of export privileges, monetary penalties, and, in extreme cases, imprisonment of responsible employees for knowing and willful violations of these laws. We may also be adversely affected through penalties, reputational harm, loss of access to certain markets, or otherwise.\nChanges in tariffs, sanctions, international treaties, export/import laws and other trade restrictions or trade disputes may delay the introduction and sale of our services in international markets, prevent our customers with international operations from deploying our services or, in some cases, prevent the export or import of our services to certain countries, governments, persons or entities altogether. Any change in export or import regulations, economic sanctions or related laws, shift in the enforcement or scope of existing regulations, or change in the countries, governments, persons or technologies targeted by such regulations, could result in decreased use of our services, or in our decreased ability to export or sell our services to existing or potential customers with international operations. Any decrease in the use of our services or limitation on our ability to export or sell our services would likely adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nFailure to comply with anti-bribery, anti-corruption, and anti-money laundering laws could subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences.\nWe are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), the U.K. Bribery Act and other anti-corruption, anti-bribery and anti-money laundering laws in various jurisdictions both domestic and abroad. In addition to our own sales force, we also leverage third parties to sell our products and services and conduct our business abroad. We and our third-party intermediaries may have direct or indirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies or state-owned or affiliated entities and may be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of these third-party business partners and intermediaries, our employees, representatives, contractors, channel partners, and agents, even if we do not explicitly authorize such activities. While we have policies and procedures to address compliance with such laws, we cannot assure you that our employees and agents will not take actions in violation of our policies or applicable law, for which we may be ultimately held responsible. Any violation of the FCPA or other applicable anti-bribery, anti-corruption, and anti-money laundering laws could result in whistleblower complaints, adverse media coverage, investigations, loss of export privileges, severe criminal or civil sanctions, or suspension or debarment from U.S. government contracts, all of which may have an adverse effect on our reputation, business, operating results and prospects.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock\nAnti-takeover provisions contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, could impair a takeover attempt.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation, amended and restated bylaws and Delaware law contain provisions which could have the effect of rendering more difficult, delaying or preventing an acquisition deemed undesirable by our board of directors. Among other things, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws include provisions:\n\u2022\nauthorizing a classified board of directors whose members serve staggered three-year terms;\n\u2022\nauthorizing \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock, which could be issued by our board of directors without stockholder approval and may contain voting, liquidation, dividend and other rights superior to our Class A common stock;\n\u2022\nlimiting the liability of, and providing indemnification to, our directors and officers;\n\u2022\nlimiting the ability of our stockholders to call and bring business before special meetings;\n\u2022\nrequiring advance notice of stockholder proposals for business to be conducted at meetings of our stockholders and for nominations of candidates for election to our board of directors; and\n\u2022\ncontrolling the procedures for the conduct and scheduling of board directors and stockholder meetings.\nThese provisions, alone or together, could delay or prevent hostile takeovers and changes in control or changes in our management.\nAs a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to provisions of Delaware law, including Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prevents certain stockholders holding more than 15% of our outstanding capital stock from engaging in certain business combinations without approval of the holders of at least two-thirds of our outstanding Class A common stock not held by such stockholder.\nAny provision of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, amended and restated bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying, preventing or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our capital stock, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our Class A common stock.\nThe market price of our Class A common stock has been and may continue to be volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nThe market price of our Class A common stock has been and may continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control and may not be related to our operating performance. In addition to the factors discussed in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, factors that could cause fluctuations in the market price of our Class A common stock include the following:\n\u2022\nprice and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to time;\n\u2022\nvolatility in the market prices and trading volumes of technology stocks;\n\u2022\nchanges in operating performance and stock market valuations of other technology companies generally or those in our industry in particular;\n\u2022\nsales of shares of our Class A common stock by us or our stockholders;\n\u2022\nwhether our results of operations meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors and changes in actual or future expectations of investors or securities analysts;\n\u2022\nthe financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in those projections or our failure to meet those projections;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of new products or services;\n\u2022\nthe public\u2019s reaction to our press releases, other public announcements and filings with the SEC;\n\u2022\nrumors and market speculation involving us or other companies in our industry;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated changes in our operating results or fluctuations in our operating results;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated developments in our business, our competitors\u2019 businesses or the competitive landscape generally;\n\u2022\nlitigation involving us, our industry or both, or investigations by regulators into our operations or those of our competitors;\n\u2022\ndevelopments or disputes concerning our intellectual property or other proprietary rights;\n\u2022\nannounced or completed acquisitions of businesses or technologies by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nnew laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business;\n\u2022\nnetwork or service outages, internet disruptions, the availability of our service, security breaches or perceived security breaches and vulnerabilities;\n\u2022\nchanges in accounting standards, policies, guidelines, interpretations or principles;\n\u2022\nactions instituted by activist shareholders or others;\n\u2022\nany significant change in our management; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions and slow or negative growth of our markets.\nIn addition, in the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a particular company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against these companies. Any future securities litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources.\nServicing our future debt may require a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to settle conversions of our convertible senior notes in cash, repay the convertible senior notes at maturity, or repurchase the convertible senior notes as required following a fundamental change.\nIn January 2021, we issued $345.0 million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes (Notes). Prior to October 15, 2025, the Notes are convertible at the option of the holders only under certain conditions or upon occurrence of certain events. We have made an irrevocable election to settle the principal of the Notes in cash. If holders of the Notes elect to convert their Notes, we will be required to make cash payments in respect of the Notes being converted. Holders of the Notes also have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of their Notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change (as defined in the indenture governing the Notes) at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest. If the Notes have not previously been converted or repurchased, we will be required to repay the Notes in cash at maturity.\nOur ability to make required cash payments in connection with conversions of the Notes, repurchase the Notes in the event of a fundamental change, or to repay or refinance the Notes at maturity will depend on market conditions and our past and expected future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive, and other factors beyond our control. We also may not use the cash proceeds we raised through the issuance of the Notes in an optimally productive and profitable manner. Since inception, our business has generated net losses, and we may continue to incur significant losses. As a result, we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing, or financing at acceptable terms, at the time we are required to repurchase or repay the Notes or pay cash with respect to Notes being converted.\nIn addition, our ability to repurchase or pay cash upon conversion or at maturity of the Notes may be limited by law or regulatory authority. Our failure to repurchase Notes following a fundamental change or to pay cash upon conversion or at maturity of the Notes as required by the indenture would constitute a default under such indenture. A default under the indenture or the fundamental change itself could also lead to a default under our senior credit facility, our other outstanding indebtedness, or agreements governing our future indebtedness and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. If the payment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and repurchase the Notes or to pay cash upon conversion or at maturity of the Notes.\nThe accounting method for the Notes could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nUnder current accounting principles, the initial liability of the Notes was calculated using the fair value of a similar debt instrument that does not have a conversion feature, valued using our cost of capital for straight, unconvertible debt. The difference between the carrying value of the Notes and fair value is recognized as a debt discount within equity for accounting purposes, which is amortized into interest expense over the term of the Notes. As a result of this amortization, the interest expense that we expect to recognize for the Notes for accounting purposes will be greater than the cash interest payments we will pay on the Notes, which will result in lower reported income or higher reported losses. The lower reported income or higher reported losses resulting from this accounting treatment could depress the trading price of our Class A common stock and the Notes.\nHowever, in August 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board published an Accounting Standards Update, or ASU 2020-06, eliminating the separate accounting for the debt and equity components as described above. ASU 2020-06 will be effective for SEC-reporting entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021 (or, in the case of smaller reporting companies, December 15, 2023), including interim periods within those fiscal years. However, early adoption is permitted in certain circumstances for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, including interim periods within those fiscal years.\nWe currently plan to early adopt ASU 2020-06 for the fiscal year ending January 31, 2022, and we expect then to eliminate the separate accounting described above to reduce the interest expense that we expect to recognize for the Notes for accounting purposes. In addition, under certain circumstances, ASU 2020-06 eliminates the use of the treasury stock method for convertible instruments that can be settled in whole or in part with equity, and instead require application of the \u201cif-converted\u201d method. Under that method, diluted earnings per share would generally be calculated assuming that all the Notes were converted solely into shares of Class A common stock at the beginning of the reporting period, unless the result would be antidilutive. The application of the if-converted method may reduce our reported diluted earnings per share. However, effective February 5, 2021, we have made an irrevocable election to settle the principal portion of the Notes only in cash. Accordingly, effective from that date forward, the if-converted method will only be impacted by the conversion premium.\nFurthermore, if any of the conditions to the convertibility of the Notes is satisfied, then we may be required under applicable accounting standards to reclassify the liability carrying value of the Notes as a current, rather than a long-term, liability. This reclassification could be required even if no noteholders convert their Notes and could materially reduce our reported working capital.\nThe capped call transactions may affect the value of our Class A common stock.\nIn connection with the issuance of the Notes, we entered into capped call transactions with various counterparties. The capped call transactions cover, subject to customary adjustments, the number of shares of our Class A common stock initially underlying the Notes. The capped call transactions are expected generally to reduce or offset the potential dilution to our Class A common stock upon any conversion of the Notes with such reduction or offset, as the case may be, subject to a cap based on the cap price.\nFrom time to time, the counterparties to the capped call transactions or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to our Class A common stock and/or purchasing or selling our Class A common stock or other securities of ours in secondary market transactions prior to the maturity of the Notes. This activity could also cause or prevent an increase or a decrease in the market price of our Class A common stock or the Notes.\nWe are subject to counterparty risk with respect to the capped call transactions.\nThe counterparties to the capped call transactions that we entered into are financial institutions, and we will be subject to the risk that one or more of the counterparties may default or otherwise fail to perform, or may exercise certain rights to terminate, their obligations under the capped call transactions. Our exposure to the credit risk of the counterparties will not be secured by any collateral.\nGlobal economic conditions have in the past resulted in the actual or perceived failure or financial difficulties of many financial institutions. If a counterparty to one or more capped call transactions becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure at the time under such transaction. Our exposure will depend on many factors but, generally, our exposure will increase if the market price or the volatility of our Class A common stock increases. In addition, upon a default or other failure to perform, or a termination of obligations, by a counterparty, the counterparty may fail to deliver the consideration required to be delivered to us under the capped call transactions and we may experience more dilution than we currently anticipate with respect to our Class A common stock. We can provide no assurances as to the financial stability or viability of the counterparties.\nOur business could be negatively affected by activist shareholders.\nResponding to actions by activist shareholders could be costly and time-consuming, disrupt our operations and divert the attention of management and our employees. Additionally, perceived uncertainties as to our future direction as a result of shareholder activism or changes to the composition of our board of directors may lead to the perception of a change in the direction of our business or other instability, which may be exploited by our competitors, cause concern to our current or potential customers, and make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel. If customers choose to delay, defer or reduce transactions with us or do business with our competitors instead of us, then our business, financial condition and operating results would be adversely affected. In addition, our share price could experience periods of increased volatility as a result of shareholder activism.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish or cease publishing research or reports about us, our business, our market or our competitors, or if they adversely change their recommendations regarding our Class A common stock, the market price of our Class A common stock and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our Class A common stock is influenced, to some extent, by the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us, our business, our market or our competitors. If any of the analysts who cover us adversely change their recommendations regarding our Class A common stock or provide more favorable recommendations about our competitors, the market price of our Class A common stock would likely decline. If any of the analysts who cover us cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause the market price of our Class A common stock or trading volume to decline.\nWe do not expect to declare any dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe do not anticipate declaring any cash dividends to holders of our Class A common stock in the foreseeable future. Consequently, investors may need to rely on sales of our Class A common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investment. Investors seeking cash dividends should not purchase shares of our Class A common stock.",

Prior to that date, there was no public trading market for shares of our Class A common stock.\nHolders of Record\nAs of February 28, 2021, there were 184 holders of record of our Class A common stock. Because many of our shares of Class A common stock are held by brokers and other institutions on behalf of stockholders, we are unable to estimate the total number of beneficial owners of our Class A common stock represented by these record holders.\nDividend Policy\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain all available funds and any future earnings for use in the operation of our business and do not anticipate paying any dividends on our capital stock in the foreseeable future.

    "item_7": "Item 7. MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed in the section titled \u201cRisk Factors\u201d and in other parts of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nBox is the Content Cloud: one secure, cloud-native platform for managing the entire content journey. Content - from blueprints to wireframes, videos to documents, proprietary formats to PDFs - is the source of an organization\u2019s unique value. Our cloud content management platform enables our customers, including 67% of the Fortune 500, to securely manage the entire content lifecycle, from the moment a file is created or ingested to when it\u2019s shared, edited, published, approved, signed, classified, and retained. Box keeps content secure and compliant, while also allowing easy access and sharing of this content from anywhere, on any device - both within the organization and with external partners.\nWith our Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) platform, users can collaborate on content both internally and with external parties, automate content-driven business processes, develop custom applications, and implement data protection, security and compliance features to comply with legal and regulatory requirements, internal policies and industry standards and regulations. The Box Content Cloud accelerates business processes, improves employee productivity, enables secure remote work, and protects an organization\u2019s most valuable data. Our platform enables a broad set of high-value business use cases across enterprises, hundreds of file formats and media types, and user experiences. Our platform integrates with leading enterprise business applications, and is compatible with multiple application environments, operating systems and devices, ensuring that workers can securely access their critical business content whenever and wherever they need it.\nIn addition, we continue to innovate by expanding our core services and our offerings with a focus on frictionless security and compliance, seamless internal and external collaboration and workflow, and integration with best-of-breed applications. For example, we provide Box Shield, our advanced security offering that helps customers reduce the risk of accidental data leakage and protect their business from insider threats and account compromise; Box KeySafe, a solution that builds on top of Box\u2019s strong encryption and security capabilities to give customers greater control over the encryption keys used to secure the file contents that are stored with Box; Box Governance, which gives customers a better way to comply with regulatory policies, satisfy e-discovery requests and effectively manage sensitive business information; Box Relay, which allows our end users to easily build, manage and track their own workflows; Box Platform, which further enables customers and partners to build enterprise apps using our open APIs and developer tools; and Box Zones, which gives global customers the ability to store their data locally in certain regions. With Box Consulting, we also provide in-house professional services such as implementation support, content migration, and change management. The increasing success of our add-on products allows our customers to realize the full set of capabilities of our Content Cloud.\nWe offer our solution to our customers as a subscription-based service, with subscription fees based on the requirements of our customers, including the number of users and functionality deployed. The majority of our customers subscribe to our service through one-year contracts, although we also offer our services for terms ranging from one month to three years or more. We typically invoice our customers at the beginning of the term, in multiyear, annual, quarterly or monthly installments. We recognize revenue as we satisfy a performance obligation. Accordingly, due to our subscription model, we recognize revenue for our subscription and premier services ratably over the term of the contract.\nOur objective is to build an enduring business that creates sustainable revenue and earnings growth over the long term. To best achieve this objective, we focus on growing the number of users and paying organizations through direct field sales, direct inside sales, indirect channel sales and through word-of-mouth by individual users, some of whom use our services at no cost. Individual users and organizations can also simply sign up to use our solution on our website. We believe this approach not only helps us build a critical mass of users but also has a viral effect within organizations as more of their employees use our service and encourage their IT professionals to deploy our services to a broader user base.\nOur user base included 77.7 million registered users as of January 31, 2021. We define a registered user as a Box account that has been provisioned a unique user identification number. As of January 31, 2021, 20% of our registered users were paying users who registered as part of a larger enterprise or business account or by using a paid personal account. As of January 31, 2021, we had over 105,000 paying organizations, and our solution was offered in 25 languages. We define paying organizations as separate and distinct buying entities, such as a company, an educational or government institution, or a distinct business unit of a large corporation, that have entered into a subscription agreement with us to utilize our services.\nOrganizations typically purchase our solution in the following ways: (i) employees in one or more small groups within the organization may individually purchase our service; (ii) organizations may purchase IT-sponsored, enterprise-level agreements with deployments for specific, targeted use cases ranging from tens to thousands of user seats; (iii) organizations may purchase IT- sponsored, enterprise-level agreements where the number of user seats sold is intended to accommodate and enable nearly all information workers within the organization in whatever use cases they desire to adopt over the term of the subscription; and (iv) organizations may purchase our Box Platform service to create custom business applications for their internal use and extended ecosystem of customers, suppliers and partners. Customers can choose between an a la carte approach (i.e., by purchasing specific add-on products to complement their Box subscription) or one of our bundled Enterprise Suites, which include multiple add-on products to help accelerate customer time to value.\nWe intend to continue scaling our organization to meet the increasingly complex needs of our customers. Our sales and customer success teams are organized to efficiently serve organizations ranging from small businesses to the world\u2019s largest global organizations. We have invested in our sales and marketing teams to sell our services around the world, as well as in our development efforts to deliver additional features and capabilities of our cloud services to address our customers\u2019 evolving needs. We also expect to continue to make investments in both our infrastructure to meet the needs of our growing global user base and our professional services organization (Box Consulting) to address the strategic needs of our customers in more complex deployments and to drive broader adoption across a wide array of use cases.\nCurrent Period Highlights\nFor the year ended January 31, 2021, our revenue was $770.8 million, representing year-over-year growth of 11%, and 28% of this revenue came from non-U.S. customers. As of January 31, 2021, our remaining performance obligations were $896.9 million, an increase of 17% from January 31, 2020. For the year ended January 31, 2021, our operating loss was $37.6 million, and our operating margin was negative 5%, representing a 15 percentage point improvement year-over-year. For the year ended January 31, 2021, our free cash flow was positive $120.3 million, an increase of $127.5 million from the year ended January 31, 2020.\nContinuous Innovation\nDespite the pandemic\u2019s impact, we were able to continue delivering product innovation throughout our fiscal year 2021. During the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021, we launched several new products including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nMachine learning-based automated classification of sensitive data and proactive malware detection in Box Shield;\n\u2022\nNew capabilities for end users, including an all-new Box user interface, Collections to help users organize and categorize content, and Annotations, which allows users to add text-based comments or free-form markups to any document format without altering the underlying content;\n\u2022\nNew workflow capabilities with Box Relay, including pre-built and custom workflow templates that allow customers to more easily build and implement process automations;\n\u2022\nSignificant improvements to our integrations with Microsoft Teams, Slack, and Zoom to power better remote work experiences for our customers, as well as a new Box for Google Workspace Essentials integration;\n\u2022\nImprovements to our Box Platform offering including a new metadata query toolkit and improved developer onboarding experience; and\n\u2022\nVarious infrastructure improvements, including in-region uploads and downloads in our Australia Zone, as well as a new point-of-presence in Chicago, IL.\nCOVID-19\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted global economic activity, worldwide financial markets and social practices. We continue to monitor, analyze and respond to evolving developments regarding the COVID-19 pandemic. As part of these efforts, we have taken steps to protect the health and welfare of our employees by temporarily closing most of our offices and suspending almost all business-related travel, while continuing our commitment and efforts to serve customers that rely on us. In addition, we have shifted our customer and marketing events to virtual-only experiences.\nAlthough the COVID-19 pandemic has not had a material adverse impact on our financial results for our fiscal year 2021, COVID-19 has negatively impacted many of our customers and prospects. As a result, we have experienced, and may continue to experience, increased customer churn and delayed sales cycles, including customers and prospective customers delaying contract signing or contract renewals, or reducing budgets related to services that we offer. Despite these adverse impacts, the COVID-19 pandemic has also created additional opportunities for Box by enabling our customers\u2019 and prospects\u2019 employees to engage in secure remote work through our platform.\nThe extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic ultimately impacts our business, results of operations, and financial position will depend on future developments, which are uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time, and include the severity and duration of the pandemic, the availability and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines, actions that may be taken by government authorities to contain the virus and minimize its economic impact, passing of or not passing further stimulus packages by governments, the impact of COVID-19 on our customers, business partners and employees, and other factors identified in Part I, Item 1A \"Risk Factors\" of this Form 10-K. As a result, the extent and magnitude of the impact COVID-19 will have on our business and operating results cannot be predicted at this time.\nOur Business Model\nOur business model focuses on maximizing the lifetime value of a customer relationship. We make significant investments in acquiring new customers and believe that we will be able to achieve a positive return on these investments by retaining customers, cross-selling our add-on products and expanding the size of our deployments within our customer base over time. In connection with the acquisition of new customers, we incur and recognize significant upfront costs. These costs include sales and marketing costs associated with acquiring new customers, such as sales commission expenses, a portion of which are deferred and then amortized over a period of benefit, and marketing costs, which are expensed as incurred. We recognize revenue as we satisfy a performance obligation. Accordingly, due to our subscription model, we recognize revenue for our subscription and premier services ratably over the term of the contract. Although our objective is for each customer to be profitable for us over the duration of our relationship, the costs we incur with respect to any customer relationship, whether a new customer or an expansion within an existing customer, may exceed revenue in earlier periods because we recognize those costs faster than we recognize the associated revenue.\nBecause of these dynamics, we experience a range of profitability with our customers depending in large part upon their current stage. We generally incur higher sales and marketing expenses for new customers and existing customers who are still in an expanding stage. For new customers, our associated sales and marketing expenses typically exceed the first year revenue we recognize from those customers. For customers who are expanding their use of Box, we incur various associated marketing expenses as well as sales commission expenses, though we typically recognize higher revenue than sales and marketing expenses. For typical customers who are renewing their Box subscriptions, our associated sales and marketing expenses are significantly less than the revenue we recognize from those customers. These differences are primarily driven by the higher compensation we provide to our sales force for new customers and customer subscription expansions compared to the compensation we provide to our sales force for routine subscription renewals by customers. In addition, our sales and marketing expenses, even after considering deferred incremental compensation we provide to our sales force, are generally higher for acquiring new customers versus expansions or renewals of existing customer subscriptions. We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, lower sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue as our existing customer base grows over time and a relatively higher percentage of our revenue is attributable to renewals versus new or expanding Box deployments.\nKey Business Metrics\nWe use the key metrics below for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe that these key metrics provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these key metrics in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods. These key metrics also facilitate management's internal comparisons to our historical performance as well as comparisons to certain competitors' operating results. We believe these key metrics are useful to investors both because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making and (2) they are used by institutional investors and the analyst community to help analyze the health of our business. The below data is presented in millions, except for percentage rate data.\nYear Ended January 31,\nRemaining performance obligations (period end)\n$\n896.9\n$\n767.8\n$\n686.3\nRemaining performance obligations growth rate\n%\n%\n-\n*\nBillings\n$\n812.5\n$\n745.1\n$\n672.9\nBillings growth rate\n%\n%\n%\nFree cash flow\n$\n120,324\n$\n(7,238\n)\n$\n13,822\nNet retention rate (period end)\n%\n%\n%\n*\nBox began disclosing remaining performance obligations upon the adoption of ASC Topic 606 on February 1, 2018. Year-over-year comparisons against prior periods before February 1, 2018 are not applicable.\nRemaining Performance Obligations\nRemaining performance obligations (RPO) represent, at a point in time, contracted revenue that has not yet been recognized. RPO consists of deferred revenue and backlog, offset by contract assets. Backlog is defined as non-cancellable contracts deemed certain to be invoiced and recognized as revenue in future periods. Future invoicing is determined to be certain when we have an executed non-cancellable contract or a significant penalty is due upon cancellation, and invoicing is not dependent on a future event such as the delivery of a specific new product or feature, or the achievement of contractual contingencies. While Box believes RPO is a leading indicator of revenue as it represents sales activity not yet recognized in revenue, it is not necessarily indicative of future revenue growth as it is influenced by several factors, including seasonality, contract renewal timing, average contract terms and foreign currency exchange rates. Box monitors RPO to manage the business and evaluate performance. We do not consider RPO to be a non-GAAP financial measure given that it is calculated in accordance with GAAP.\nRPO increased 17% in the year ended January 31, 2021 over the year ended January 31, 2020. The increase in RPO was primarily driven by expansion within existing customers as they broadened their deployment of our product offerings, longer customer contract durations, the addition of new customers, and the timing of customer-driven renewals.\nBillings\nBillings represent our revenue plus the changes in deferred revenue and contract assets in the period. Billings we record in any particular period primarily reflect subscription renewals and expansion within existing customers plus sales to new customers, and represent amounts invoiced for all of our products and professional services. We typically invoice our customers at the beginning of the term, in multiyear, annual, quarterly or monthly installments. If the customer negotiates to pay the full subscription amount at the beginning of the period, the total subscription amount for the entire term will be reflected in billings. If the customer negotiates to be invoiced annually or more frequently, only the amount billed for such period will be included in billings.\nBillings help investors better understand our sales activity for a particular period, which is not necessarily reflected in our revenue given that we recognize subscription revenue ratably over the contract term. We consider billings a significant performance measure. We monitor billings to manage our business, make planning decisions, evaluate our performance and allocate resources. We believe that billings offer valuable supplemental information regarding the performance of our business and will help investors better understand the sales volumes and performance of our business. We do not consider billings to be a non-GAAP financial measure given that it is calculated using exclusively revenue, deferred revenue, and contract assets, all of which are financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.\nBillings increased 9% in the year ended January 31, 2021 over the year ended January 31, 2020. The increase in billings was primarily driven by expansion within existing customers as they broadened their deployment of our product offerings, longer customer contract durations, the addition of new customers, and the timing of customer-driven renewals.\nOur use of billings has certain limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for revenue or an analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Billings are recognized when invoiced, while the related subscription and premier services revenue is recognized ratably over the contract term as we satisfy a performance obligation. Also, other companies, including companies in our industry, may not use billings, may calculate billings differently, may have different billing frequencies, or may use other financial measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of billings as a comparative measure.\nOver time, we expect to continue to normalize payment durations. In addition, as we have gained and expect to continue to gain more traction with large enterprise customers, we also anticipate our quarterly billings to increasingly concentrate in the back half of our fiscal year, especially in the fourth quarter.\nA calculation of billings starting with revenue, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, is presented below (in thousands):\nYear Ended January 31,\nGAAP revenue\n$\n770,770\n$\n696,264\n$\n608,386\nDeferred revenue, end of period\n465,613\n423,849\n375,041\nLess: deferred revenue, beginning of period\n(423,849\n)\n(375,041\n)\n(311,109\n)\n*\nContract assets, beginning of period\n-\nLess: contract assets, end of period\n(25\n)\n-\n(3\n)\nBillings\n$\n812,509\n$\n745,075\n$\n672,897\n*\nBalance as of February 1, 2018 upon the adoption of ASC Topic 606\nFree Cash Flow\nWe define free cash flow as cash flows from operating activities less purchases of property and equipment, principal payments of finance lease liabilities, capitalized internal-use software costs, and other items that did not or are not expected to require cash settlement and that management considers to be outside of our core business. We specifically identify adjusting items in our reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures. We consider free cash flow to be a profitability and liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business that can possibly be used for investing in our business and strengthening the balance sheet, but it is not intended to represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. A reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash provided by operating activities, its nearest GAAP equivalent, is presented in the non-GAAP Financial Measures section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The presentation of free cash flow is also not meant to be considered in isolation or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity.\nFree cash flow increased $127.6 million in the year ended January 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended January 31, 2020. The increase in free cash flow was primarily driven by an increase in cash provided by operating activities of $152.1 million and a decrease in capitalized internal-use software costs of $0.5 million, partially offset by an increase in principal payments of finance lease liabilities of $21.5 million and an increase in capital expenditures of $3.6 million. The primary factors affecting the increase in cash flows provided by operating activities included a decrease of our net loss of $100.9 million, an increase in non-cash charges of $35.7 million primarily driven by an increase in depreciation and amortization of $26.2 million, and favorable changes in our operating assets and liabilities of $15.5 million.\nNet Retention Rate\nNet retention rate is defined as the net percentage of Total Account Value (TAV) retained from existing customers, including expansion. We calculate our net retention rate as of a period end by starting with the TAV from customers as of 12 months prior to such period end (Prior Period TAV) and a subscription customer of Box for at least 12 months. We then calculate TAV from these same customers as of the current period end (Current Period TAV). Finally, we divide the Current Period TAV by the Prior Period TAV and report the average of this calculation over the prior 12 months to arrive at our net retention rate. Prior to fiscal year 2021, we included only TAV from customers with a contract value of $5,000 or more in our net retention rate calculation. As a result of our focus on driving an efficient land and expand go-to-market strategy, large enterprise customers may begin their deployments with contract values below $5,000 and expand significantly over time. Given this strategy, we now include TAV from customers with a contract value of less than $5,000 in our net retention rate calculation. This new methodology, adopted retrospectively in fiscal year 2021, provides a more comprehensive view of how existing customers contribute to our overall revenue growth. We believe our net retention rate is an important metric that provides insight into the long-term value of our subscription agreements and our ability to retain and grow revenue from our customer base. Net retention rate is an operational metric and there is no comparable GAAP financial measure to which we can reconcile this particular key metric.\nOur net retention rates were 102%, 104% and 108% as of January 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our net retention rates were primarily attributable to seat growth in existing customers and strong attach rates of add-on products. As our customers purchase add-on products, we tend to realize significantly higher average contract values and stronger net retention rates as compared to customers who only purchase our core product. We believe our go-to-market efforts to deliver a solution selling strategy and our investments in product, customer success, and Box Consulting have been a significant factor in our customer retention results. As we penetrate customer accounts, we expect our net retention rate to remain above 100% for the foreseeable future.\nComponents of Results of Operations\nRevenue\nWe derive our revenue primarily from three sources: (1) subscription revenue, which is comprised of subscription fees from customers who have access to our cloud content management platform, and other subscription-based services, which all include routine customer support; (2) revenue from customers purchasing our premier services package; and (3) revenue from professional services such as implementing best practice use cases, project management and implementation consulting services.\nTo date, practically all of our revenue has been derived from subscription and premier services. Subscription and premier services revenue are driven primarily by the number of customers, the number of seats sold to each customer and the price of our services.\nWe recognize revenue as we satisfy a performance obligation. Accordingly, due to our subscription model, we recognize revenue for our subscription and premier services ratably over the contract term. We typically invoice our customers at the beginning of the term, in multiyear, annual, quarterly or monthly installments. Our subscription and premier services contracts are typically non-cancellable and do not contain refund-type provisions. The majority of our customers subscribe to our service through one-year contracts, although we also offer our services for terms ranging between one month to three years or more.\nProfessional services are generally billed on a fixed price basis, for which revenue is recognized over time based on the proportion performed. Professional services revenue was not material as a percentage of total revenue for all periods presented.\nRevenue is presented net of sales and other taxes we collect on behalf of governmental authorities.\nCost of Revenue\nOur cost of revenue consists primarily of costs related to providing our subscription services to our paying customers, including employee compensation and related expenses for data center operations, customer support and professional services personnel, payments to outside technology service providers, depreciation of servers and equipment, security services and other tools, as well as amortization expense associated with acquired technology and capitalized internally developed software. We allocate overhead such as rent, information technology costs and employee benefit costs to all departments based on headcount. As such, general overhead expenses are reflected in cost of revenue and each of the operating expense categories set forth below.\nOperating Expenses\nOur operating expenses consist of research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses. Personnel costs are the most significant component of each category of operating expenses. Operating expenses also include allocated overhead costs for facilities, information technology costs and employee benefit costs.\nResearch and Development. Research and development expense consists primarily of employee compensation and related expenses, as well as allocated overhead. Our research and development efforts are focused on scaling our platform, building an ecosystem of best-of-breed applications and platforms, infrastructure, adding enterprise grade features, functionality and enhancements such as workflow automation, intelligent content management capabilities, and advanced security to enhance the ease of use of our cloud content management services. We capitalize certain qualifying costs to develop software for internal use incurred during the application development stage.\nSales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expense consists primarily of employee compensation and related expenses, sales commissions, marketing programs, travel-related expenses, as well as allocated overhead. Marketing programs include but are not limited to advertising, events, corporate communications, brand building, and product marketing. Sales and marketing expense also consists of data center and customer support costs related to providing our cloud-based services to our free users. We market and sell our cloud content management services worldwide through our direct sales organization and through indirect distribution channels such as strategic resellers.\nGeneral and Administrative. General and administrative expense consists primarily of employee compensation and related expenses for administrative functions including finance, legal, human resources, recruiting, information systems, security, compliance, fees for external professional services and cloud based enterprise systems, as well as allocated overhead. External professional services fees are primarily comprised of outside legal, accounting, audit and outsourcing services.\nInterest Expense, Net\nInterest expense, net consists of interest expense and interest income. Interest expense consists primarily of interest charges for our line of credit and interest rate swap agreement, interest expense related to finance leases, unused commitment fees on our line of credit, the amortization of capitalized debt issuance costs, fees on our letters of credit, and the amortization of debt discount and issuance costs of our convertible senior notes. Interest income consists primarily of interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents. We have historically invested our cash and cash equivalents in overnight deposits, certificates of deposit, money market funds, and short term, investment-grade corporate debt, marketable securities and asset backed securities.\nOther Income (Loss), Net\nOther income (loss), net consists primarily of gains and losses from foreign currency transactions and other income and expense.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nProvision for income taxes consists primarily of income taxes in certain foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct business and state income taxes in the United States and, as applicable, changes in our deferred taxes and related valuation allowance positions and uncertain tax positions.\nResults of Operations\nThe following tables set forth our results of operations for the periods presented in thousands, except per share amounts:\nYear Ended January 31,\nConsolidated Statements of Operations Data:\nRevenue\n$\n770,770\n$\n696,264\n$\n608,386\nCost of revenue (1)\n224,738\n215,577\n173,594\nGross profit\n546,032\n480,687\n434,792\nOperating expenses:\nResearch and development (1)\n201,262\n199,750\n163,750\nSales and marketing (1)\n275,742\n317,615\n312,210\nGeneral and administrative (1)\n106,670\n102,794\n93,069\nTotal operating expenses\n583,674\n620,159\n569,029\nLoss from operations\n(37,642\n)\n(139,472\n)\n(134,237\n)\nInterest expense, net\n(7,010\n)\n(2,338\n)\n(316\n)\nOther income (loss), net\n2,426\n(1,128\n)\n1,339\nLoss before provision for income taxes\n(42,226\n)\n(142,938\n)\n(133,214\n)\nProvision for income taxes\n1,207\n1,410\n1,398\nNet loss\n$\n(43,433\n)\n$\n(144,348\n)\n$\n(134,612\n)\n(1)\nIncludes stock-based compensation expense as follows:\nYear Ended January 31,\nCost of revenue\n$\n18,936\n$\n16,769\n$\n14,065\nResearch and development\n61,145\n62,565\n45,189\nSales and marketing\n42,015\n38,030\n36,864\nGeneral and administrative\n32,196\n28,624\n23,178\nTotal stock-based compensation\n$\n154,292\n$\n145,988\n$\n119,296\nThe following tables set forth our results of operations for the periods presented as a percentage of our revenue:\nYear Ended January 31,\nPercentage of Revenue:\nRevenue\n%\n%\n%\nCost of revenue (1)\nGross profit\nOperating expenses:\nResearch and development (1)\nSales and marketing (1)\nGeneral and administrative (1)\nTotal operating expenses\nLoss from operations\n(5\n)\n(20\n)\n(22\n)\nInterest expense, net\n(1\n)\n(1\n)\n-\nOther income (loss), net\n-\n-\n-\nLoss before provision for income taxes\n(6\n)\n(21\n)\n(22\n)\nProvision for income taxes\n-\n-\n-\nNet loss\n(6\n)\n%\n(21\n)\n%\n(22\n)\n%\n(1)\nIncludes stock-based compensation expense as follows:\nYear Ended January 31,\nCost of revenue\n%\n%\n%\nResearch and development\nSales and marketing\nGeneral and administrative\nTotal stock-based compensation\n%\n%\n%\nA discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for the year ended January 31, 2021 compared to the year ended January 31, 2020 is presented below. A discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for the year ended January 31, 2020 compared to the year ended January 31, 2019 can be found under Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020, filed with the SEC on March 19, 2020, which is available on the SEC\u2019s website at www.sec.gov.\nComparison of the Years Ended January 31, 2021 and 2020\nRevenue\nYear Ended January 31,\n$ Change\n% Change\n(dollars in thousands)\nRevenue\n$\n770,770\n$\n696,264\n$\n74,506\n%\nThe increase in revenue was primarily driven by expansion within our existing customers as they broadened their deployment of our product offerings with strong attach rates of add-on products at higher price per seat. Additionally, the increase in subscription services is also driven by the addition of new customers, as the number of paying organizations increased by 8% from January 31, 2020 to January 31, 2021. In the year ended January 31, 2021, we experienced strong growth in the Japan market, driving an increase in revenue from non-U.S. customers to 28%, compared to 25% in the year ended January 31, 2020. This increase is partially offset by customers partially churning their deployment with Box.\nCost of Revenue\nYear Ended January 31,\n$ Change\n% Change\n(dollars in thousands)\nCost of revenue\n$\n224,738\n$\n215,577\n$\n9,161\n%\nPercentage of revenue\n%\n%\nThe increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to an increase of $9.3 million in depreciation primarily related to additional data center equipment, an increase of $8.6 million in software and maintenance expense primarily driven by increases in amortization of internally developed software and on-premises contracts, an increase of $3.3 million in rent for our data centers, and an increase of $2.2 million in stock-based compensation expense primarily driven by equity grants to existing and new employees. The increase in cost of revenue expenses was partially offset by a decrease of $14.8 million in hosted data service costs. Cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue decreased 2 percentage points year-over-year. We expect our cost of revenue to increase in dollars but decrease slightly as a percentage of revenue over time as we continue to optimize infrastructure efficiency.\nResearch and Development\nYear Ended January 31,\n$ Change\n% Change\n(dollars in thousands)\nResearch and development\n$\n201,262\n$\n199,750\n$\n1,512\n%\nPercentage of revenue\n%\n%\nThe increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to a decrease of $4.9 million in capitalized internally developed software costs and an increase of $3.0 million in employee and related costs. The increase in research and development expenses was partially offset by a decrease of $3.3 million in stock-based compensation expense, a decrease of $1.8 million in allocated overhead costs, a decrease of $0.7 million in outside agency and consulting services, and a decrease of $0.6 million in travel-related costs. Research and development expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased 3 percentage points year-over-year. We continue to invest in enhancements of our products and services, developing new products, and further differentiating our offerings. We expect our research and development expenses to increase in dollars but remain relatively stable as a percentage of revenue over time, as we continue to make significant improvements to our cloud content management product offerings and services, including expanding our advanced security, compliance, collaboration, workflow automation, and integration capabilities.\nSales and Marketing\nYear Ended January 31,\n$ Change\n% Change\n(dollars in thousands)\nSales and marketing\n$\n275,742\n$\n317,615\n$\n(41,873\n)\n(13\n)%\nPercentage of revenue\n%\n%\nThe decrease in absolute dollars was primarily due to decreases of $19.9 million and $7.4 million in employee and related costs and allocated overhead costs, respectively, primarily driven by a decrease in headcount from 880 as of January 31, 2020 to 773 as of January 31, 2021. In addition, there were decreases of $13.0 million and $2.4 million in travel-related costs and company events, respectively, primarily due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, a decrease of $6.2 million in marketing expenses, driven by a $5.0 million decrease in expenses related to BoxWorks, which transitioned into a virtual experience in the third quarter of fiscal year 2021, a decrease of $2.7 million in data center and customer support costs to support our free users, and a decrease of $2.2 million in outside agency and consulting services. The decrease in sales and marketing expenses was partially offset by an $11.1 million increase in commission expenses primarily driven by increased sales and increased amortization of deferred commissions and a $4.0 million increase in stock-based compensation expense driven by equity grants to existing and new employees. Sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased 9 percentage points year-over-year due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and our focus on driving greater efficiency from our solution selling strategy and simplifying our product offerings, as well our focus on higher performing geographies and segments producing a greater return on investment.\nOur sales and marketing expenses are generally higher for acquiring new, or expanding existing, customers than for renewals of existing customer subscriptions. We expect to continue to invest in capturing our large market opportunity globally and capitalize on our competitive position with continued focus on our long-term margin objectives. We expect our sales and marketing expenses will continue to decrease as a percentage of revenue over time, as our existing customer base grows and a relatively higher percentage of our revenue is attributable to renewals versus new or expanding Box deployments and as we continue to focus on improving sales productivity and simplifying our product offerings. While we expect certain expenses that were reduced due to COVID-19 to partially return over time, we do not expect to return to pre-COVID-19 levels, even after we return to an office-based environment.\nGeneral and Administrative\nYear Ended January 31,\n$ Change\n% Change\n(dollars in thousands)\nGeneral and administrative\n$\n106,670\n$\n102,794\n$\n3,876\n%\nPercentage of revenue\n%\n%\nThe increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to an increase of $3.8 million in stock-based compensation expense driven by equity grants to existing and new employees and an increase of $0.9 million in employee and related costs. The increase in general and administrative expenses was partially offset by a decrease of $1.0 million in outside agency costs and consulting services. General and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue decreased 1 percentage point year-over-year. We expect our general and administrative expense to slowly increase in dollars but to decrease as a percentage of revenue over time as we benefit from greater operational efficiency.\nInterest Expense, Net and Other Income (Loss), Net\nYear Ended January 31,\n$ Change\n% Change\n(dollars in thousands)\nInterest expense, net\n$\n(7,010\n)\n$\n(2,338\n)\n$\n(4,672\n)\n*\nOther income (loss), net\n$\n2,426\n(1,128\n)\n3,554\n*\n*\nPercentage change not meaningful\nThe increase in interest expense, net is primarily due to a decrease of $3.0 million in interest income from our certificates of deposit and money market funds due to a lower interest rate environment, an increase of $1.3 million in interest expense related to finance leases provisioned for our data center facilities, and an increase of $0.6 million in interest expense related to the amortization of the debt discount and issuance costs of our convertible senior notes.\nThe increase in other income (loss), net is primarily due to higher foreign currency gains.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nYear Ended January 31,\n$ Change\n% Change\n(dollars in thousands)\nProvision for income taxes\n$\n1,207\n$\n1,410\n$\n(203\n)\n(14\n)%\nThe decrease in provision expense was primarily due to lower foreign tax expense in the period.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nYear Ended January 31,\n*\n(in thousands)\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$\n196,834\n$\n44,713\n$\n55,321\nNet cash used in investing activities\n(16,383\n)\n(13,296\n)\n(16,151\n)\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities\n218,677\n(53,416\n)\n(29,567\n)\n*\nAs reported and disclosed under ASC Topic 840\nAs of January 31, 2021, we had cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash of $595.5 million. Our cash and cash equivalents are comprised primarily of overnight cash deposits and money market funds. We generated positive cash flows from operations as reflected in our consolidated statements of cash flows for the twelve-month period ended January 31, 2021. While we may continue to incur operating losses, we expect to continuously improve overall cash flows from operations through improvements to our working capital management processes to provide capital resources for strategic initiatives to grow our business.\nSince our inception, we have financed our operations primarily through equity, cash generated from sales and debt financing. We believe our existing cash and cash equivalents, together with our finance leases and credit facilities, will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for at least the next 12 months. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including our growth rate, subscription renewal activity, billing frequency, data center expansions, the timing and extent of spending to support development efforts, the expansion of sales and marketing and international operation activities, the introduction of new and enhanced service offerings, and the continuing market acceptance of our services. We may in the future enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, services and technologies, including intellectual property rights. We may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. In the event that additional financing is required from outside sources, we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired, our business, operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected.\nIn January 2021, we issued $345.0 million aggregate principal amount of 0.00% convertible senior notes due January 15, 2026. The Notes are senior unsecured obligations and do not bear regular interest. Each $1,000 principal amount of the Notes will initially be convertible into 38.7665 shares of our Class A common stock, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $25.80 per share, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events.\nThe Notes are convertible at the option of the holders of the Notes at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding October 15, 2025, only under the following circumstances: (1) during any fiscal quarter commencing after the fiscal quarter ending on April 30, 2021 (and only during such fiscal quarter), if the last reported sale price of our Class A common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not\nconsecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on and including, the last trading day of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price on each applicable trading day; (2) during the five-business day period after any five consecutive trading day period (the \u201cmeasurement period\u201d) in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of Notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of our Class A common stock and the conversion rate for the Notes on each such trading day; (3) if we call the Notes for redemption, at any time prior to the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the redemption date; or (4) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events.\nOn or after October 15, 2025, holders of the Notes may convert all or any portion of their Notes at any time prior to the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date regardless of the foregoing conditions. Effective February 5, 2021, we have made an irrevocable election to settle the principal portion of the Notes only in cash. Accordingly, upon conversion, we will pay the principal portion in cash and we will pay or deliver, as the case may be, the conversion premium in cash, shares of common stock or a combination of cash and shares of common stock, at the Company\u2019s election.\nWe may not redeem the Notes prior to January 20, 2024. We may redeem for cash all or any portion of the Notes, at our option, on or after January 20, 2024, if the last reported sale price of our common stock has been at least 130% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any 30 consecutive trading day period (including the last trading day of such period) ending on and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which we provide notice of redemption at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, plus any accrued and unpaid special interest to, but excluding the redemption date. No sinking fund is provided for the Notes, which means we are not required to redeem or retire the Notes periodically.\nUpon the occurrence of a fundamental change (as defined in the indenture governing the Notes) prior to the maturity date, subject to certain conditions, holders of the Notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of the Notes for cash at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased, plus any accrued and unpaid special interest to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date.\nAs of January 31, 2021, the conditions allowing holders of the Notes to convert were not met.\nOn November 27, 2017, we entered into a secured credit agreement (as amended or otherwise modified from time to time, the \u201cNovember 2017 Facility\u201d) and on July 12, 2019, we entered into Amendment No. 1 to the November 2017 Facility. Pursuant to the terms of the amendment, among other changes, (i) the maturity date of borrowings under the November 2017 Facility was extended from November 27, 2020 to July 12, 2022; (ii) the revolving commitments were increased from $85.0 million to $100.0 million; (iii) the sublimit for the issuance of letters of credit was increased from $30.0 million to $45.0 million; (iv) the covenant in the November 2017 Facility that limits the amount of finance leases and debt that we can incur to finance the acquisition, construction or improvement of any equipment or capital assets was increased from $100.0 million to $200.0 million; and (v) a clause for the issuance of debt constituting convertible debt securities was added, limiting the debt to an aggregate principal amount not to exceed the greater of (a) $350.0 million and (b) immediately after giving pro forma effect to the incurrence of such debt, an amount that would not cause the total leverage ratio to exceed 6.00 to 1.00. The total leverage ratio is defined in Amendment No. 1 as the ratio of (a) all outstanding funded debt to (b) earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), as of the end of the twelve-month period most recently ended for which financial statements are available. The proceeds of the revolving loans may be used for general corporate purposes. The revolving loans accrue interest at a prime rate plus a margin of 0.25% or, at our option, a LIBOR rate (based on one, three or six-month interest periods) plus a margin of 1.00%. Interest on the revolving loans is payable quarterly in arrears with respect to loans based on the prime rate and at the end of an interest period in the case of loans based on the LIBOR rate (or at each three-month interval if the interest period is longer than three months). Borrowings under the November 2017 Facility are collateralized by substantially all of our assets. The November 2017 Facility requires us to comply with a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum liquidity requirement. Additionally, the November 2017 Facility contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, including covenants limiting our, and our subsidiaries\u2019, ability to, among other things, grant liens, incur debt, pay dividends or distributions on the capital stock, effect certain mergers, make investments, dispose of assets and enter into transactions with affiliates, in each case subject to customary exceptions for a credit facility of the size and type of the November 2017 Facility.\nAs of January 31, 2021, debt outstanding under the November 2017 Facility was $30.0 million.\nOperating Activities\nFor the year ended January 31, 2021, cash provided by operating activities was $196.8 million. The primary factors affecting our operating cash flows during this period were our net loss of $43.4 million, offset by non-cash charges of $154.3 million for stock-based compensation, $75.5 million for depreciation and amortization of our property and equipment and capitalized software, $36.1 million for amortization of deferred commissions, and net cash outflows of $26.6 million provided by changes in our operating assets and liabilities. The primary drivers for the changes in operating assets and liabilities include a $48.0 million increase in deferred commissions primarily due to new and expanded deployments with paying customers during the period, a $45.7 million decrease in operating lease liabilities, an $18.9 million increase in accounts receivable that was primarily due to higher sales and relative timing of our cash collections, and a $12.3 million decrease in accounts payable, partially offset by a $41.8 million increase in deferred revenue that was primarily due to seasonality in our sales cycle which is concentrated in the back half of our fiscal year, predominantly in the last quarter, a $40.7 million decrease in operating right-of-use assets, a $9.4 million increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities, and a $6.3 million decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets.\nFor the year ended January 31, 2020, cash provided by operating activities was $44.7 million. The primary factors affecting our operating cash flows during this period were our net loss of $144.3 million, offset by non-cash charges of $146.0 million for stock-based compensation, $59.4 million for depreciation and amortization of our property and equipment and capitalized software, $25.9 million for amortization of deferred commissions, and net cash outflows of $42.1 million provided by changes in our operating assets and liabilities. The primary drivers for the changes in operating assets and liabilities include a $44.0 million increase in deferred commissions primarily due to new and expanded deployments with paying customers during the period, a $35.1 million decrease in operating lease liabilities, a $34.3 million increase in accounts receivable that was primarily due to higher sales and relative timing of our cash collections, a $7.1 million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets, and a $5.9 million decrease in accrued expenses and other liabilities, partially offset by a $48.8 million increase in deferred revenue that was primarily due to seasonality in our sales cycle which is concentrated in the back half of our fiscal year, predominantly in the last quarter, and a $35.4 million decrease in operating right-of-use assets.\nInvesting Activities\nCash used in investing activities of $16.4 million for the year ended January 31, 2021 was primarily due to $9.1 million of fixed asset purchases to support our offices and employees and $7.4 million of capitalized internally developed software costs associated with the development of additional significant features and functionality to our products.\nCash used in investing activities of $13.3 million for the year ended January 31, 2020 was primarily due to $8.0 million of capitalized internally developed software costs associated with the development of additional significant features and functionality to our products. In addition, included in cash used in investing activities was $5.5 million of fixed asset purchases to support our increased headcount.\nFinancing Activities\nCash provided by financing activities of $218.7 million for the year ended January 31, 2021 was primarily due to $308.6 million of net proceeds from the issuance of the Notes, $30.0 million of additional borrowings on our November 2017 Facility, $18.6 million from issuances of common stock under the 2015 ESPP, and $10.3 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options, partially offset by $60.0 million of principal payments of finance lease liabilities, $48.8 million of employee payroll taxes paid related to net share settlement of restricted stock, and $40.0 million of payment towards our November 2017 Facility.\nCash used in financing activities of $53.4 million for the year ended January 31, 2020 was primarily due to $43.3 million of employee payroll taxes paid related to net share settlement of restricted stock, $38.5 million of principal payments of finance lease liabilities, and $0.9 million of contingent consideration payments in connection with business combinations in fiscal year 2019, partially offset by $23.4 million of proceeds from issuances of common stock under the 2015 ESPP and $6.0 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nThe following summarizes our contractual obligations and commitments as of January 31, 2021 (in thousands):\nPayments Due by Period\nLess Than 1\nMore Than\nTotal\nYear\n1-3 Years\n3-5 Years\n5 Years\nNovember 2017 Facility (1)\n$\n31,263\n$\n$\n30,327\n$\n-\n$\n-\nConvertible senior notes (2)\n345,000\n-\n-\n345,000\n-\nOperating lease liabilities, net of sublease income amounts (3)\n281,016\n59,002\n97,669\n60,783\n63,562\nFinance leases (4)\n116,470\n53,788\n61,127\n1,555\n-\nPurchase obligations (5)\n265,640\n11,540\n42,432\n211,668\n-\nTotal\n$\n1,039,389\n$\n125,266\n$\n231,555\n$\n619,006\n$\n63,562\n(1)\nIncludes principal, interest, and unused commitment fees on our line of credit under the November 2017 Facility.\n(2)\nConsists of principal on our 0.00% convertible senior notes due January 15, 2026.\n(3)\nIncludes operating lease liabilities for certain of our offices and data centers. As of January 31, 2021, we expected to receive sublease income of $22.5 million over the next four years from tenants in certain of our leased facilities. The amounts set forth in the table above do not include any sublease income amounts nor does the table include payments for short-term leases or variable lease payments.\n(4)\nIncludes obligations related to our servers and related equipment for our data center operations.\n(5)\nIncludes purchase obligations which were not recognized on the consolidated balance sheet as of January 31, 2021, related primarily to infrastructure services and IT software and support services costs. Our contracts for infrastructure services and IT software, which have terms ranging from 2 to 8 years, support our long-term goals of improving gross margin. In addition to the purchase obligations included in the table above, as of January 31, 2021, we had recognized a total of $14.9 million related to non-cancellable contractual purchases, which were included in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities, and other long-term liabilities on the balance sheet. $9.2 million, $3.8 million, and $1.9 million is due to be paid in the years ending January 31, 2022, 2023, and 2024, respectively.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThrough January 31, 2021, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a material effect on our financial statements.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nWe believe that of our significant accounting policies, which are described in Note 2 of the Notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of our operations.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe derive our revenue from three sources: (1) subscription revenue, which is comprised of subscription fees from customers who have access to our cloud content management platform, and other subscription-based services, which all include routine customer support; (2) revenue from customers purchasing our premier services package; and (3) revenue from professional services such as implementing best practice use cases, project management and implementation consulting services.\nRevenue is recognized when control of these services is transferred to a customer. The amount of revenue recognized reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those services.\nWe determine revenue recognition through the following steps:\n\u2022\nIdentification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer\n\u2022\nIdentification of the performance obligations in the contract\n\u2022\nDetermination of the transaction price\n\u2022\nAllocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract\n\u2022\nRecognition of revenue as we satisfy a performance obligation\nSubscription and Premier Services Revenues\nWe recognize revenue as we satisfy a performance obligation. Accordingly, due to our subscription model, we recognize revenue for our subscription and premier services ratably over the contract term.\nWe typically invoice our customers at the beginning of the term, in multiyear, annual, quarterly or monthly installments. Our subscription and premier services contracts generally range from one to three years in length, are typically non-cancellable and do not contain refund-type provisions. Revenue is presented net of sales and other taxes we collect on behalf of governmental authorities.\nProfessional Services\nProfessional services are generally billed on a fixed price basis, for which revenue is recognized over time based on the proportion performed.\nContracts with Multiple Performance Obligations\nOur contracts can include multiple performance obligations which may consist of some or all of subscription services, premier services, and professional services. For these contracts, we account for individual performance obligations separately if they are distinct. The transaction price is allocated to the separate performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price basis. We determine the standalone selling prices based on our overall pricing objectives, taking into consideration discounting practices, the size and volume of our transactions, the customer demographic, the geographic area where services are sold, price lists, our go-to-market strategy, historical standalone sales and contract prices.\nDeferred Revenue\nDeferred revenue consists of billings in advance of revenue recognition generated by our subscription services, premier services, and professional services described above.\nDeferred Commissions\nSales commissions earned by our sales force are considered incremental and recoverable costs of obtaining a contract with a customer. Sales commissions for new contracts are deferred and then amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of benefit that we have estimated to be five years. We determined the period of benefit by taking into consideration our customer contracts, our technology and other factors. Sales commissions for renewal contracts are deferred and then amortized on a straight-line basis over the related contractual renewal period. Amortization expense is included in sales and marketing expenses on the consolidated statements of operations.\nInternal-Use Software Costs\nWe capitalize costs to develop software for internal use incurred during the application development stage. Costs related to preliminary project activities and post implementation activities are expensed as incurred. Once an application has reached the development stage, qualifying internal and external costs are capitalized until the application is substantially complete and ready for its intended use. Capitalized qualifying costs are amortized on a straight-line basis when the software is ready for its intended use over an estimated useful life, which is generally three years. Internal-use software costs also include on-premises software, which is amortized over the lesser of five years or the license term. We evaluate the useful lives of these assets on an annual basis and test for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets.\nLeases\nWe determine whether an arrangement contains a lease at inception. A contract is or contains a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. To determine whether a contract is or contains a lease, we consider all relevant facts and circumstances to assess whether the customer has both of the following:\n\u2022\nthe right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from use of the identified asset\n\u2022\nthe right to direct the use of the identified asset\nWe recognize lease liabilities and right-of-use assets at lease commencement. We measure lease liabilities based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term discounted using the rate implicit in the lease when that rate is readily determinable or our incremental borrowing rate. We estimate our incremental borrowing rate based on an analysis of publicly traded debt securities of companies with credit and financial profiles similar to our own and adjust our incremental borrowing rate to reflect the corresponding lease term. We do not include in the lease term options to extend or terminate the lease unless it is reasonably certain that we will exercise any such options. We account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component for all our leases.\nWe measure right-of-use assets based on the corresponding lease liabilities adjusted for (i) prepayments made to the lessor at or before the commencement date, (ii) initial direct costs we incur, and (iii) tenant incentives under the lease. We evaluate the recoverability of our right-of-use assets for possible impairment in accordance with our long-lived assets policy. We do not recognize right-of-use assets or lease liabilities for short-term leases, which have a lease term of twelve months or less, and recognize the associated lease payments in the consolidated statements of operations on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nOperating leases are reflected in operating lease right-of-use assets, operating lease liabilities, and operating lease liabilities, non-current on our consolidated balance sheets. Finance leases are included in property and equipment, net, finance lease liabilities, and finance lease liabilities, non-current on our consolidated balance sheets.\nWe begin recognizing rent expense when the lessor makes the underlying asset available to us. We recognize rent expense under our operating leases on a straight-line basis. For finance leases, we record interest expense on the lease liability in addition to amortizing the right-of-use asset (generally straight-line) over the shorter of the lease term or the useful life of the right-of-use asset. Variable lease payments are expensed as incurred and are not included within the lease liabilities and right-of-use assets calculation. We generally recognize sublease income on a straight-line basis over the sublease term.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe measure and recognize compensation expense for all stock-based awards granted to our employees and other service providers, including stock options, restricted stock units, restricted stock and purchase rights granted under our 2015 Equity Incentive Plan (2015 Plan) and 2015 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (2015 ESPP), based on the estimated fair value of the award on the grant date. We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock option awards and purchase rights granted under our 2015 Plan and 2015 ESPP. We use the market closing price of our Class A common stock as reported on the New York Stock Exchange for the fair value of restricted stock units and restricted stock granted after our initial public offering. We recognize the fair value of stock options, restricted stock units and restricted stock as an expense, net of estimated forfeitures, on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. We recognize the fair value of purchase rights granted under our 2015 ESPP as an expense on a straight-line basis over the offering period.\nOur Black-Scholes option pricing model requires the input of certain assumptions, including the fair value of the underlying common stock, the expected term of the option, the expected volatility of the price of our common stock, risk-free interest rates, and the expected dividend yield of our common stock. The assumptions used in our option pricing model represent management\u2019s best estimates. These estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management\u2019s judgment. If factors change and different assumptions are used, our stock-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future.\nThese assumptions are estimated as follows:\n\u2022\nFair Value of Common Stock. We use the market closing price for our Class A common stock as reported on the New York Stock Exchange to determine the fair value of our common stock at each grant date.\n\u2022\nExpected Term. The expected term represents the period that our share-based awards are expected to be outstanding. The expected term assumptions were determined based on the vesting terms, exercise terms and contractual lives of the options and 2015 ESPP purchase rights.\n\u2022\nExpected Volatility. Beginning in fiscal year 2019, we have estimated the expected volatility of the stock option grants and 2015 ESPP purchase rights based on the historical volatility of our Class A common stock over a period equivalent to the expected term of the stock option grants and 2015 ESPP purchase rights, respectively. In previous years, we derived the expected volatility from the historical stock volatilities of several unrelated public companies within the same industry that we considered to be comparable to our business over a period equivalent to the expected term of the stock option grants and 2015 ESPP purchase rights as we did not have sufficient trading history of our Class A common stock.\n\u2022\nRisk-free Interest Rate. The risk-free rate that we use is based on the implied yield available on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with remaining terms similar to the expected term on the options and 2015 ESPP purchase rights.\n\u2022\nDividend Yield. We have never declared or paid any cash dividends and do not plan to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future, and, therefore, use an expected dividend yield of zero.\nRefer to Note 10 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a summary of the assumptions used to estimate the fair value of stock option and ESPP purchase rights.\nFor performance-based restricted stock units that vest based upon continued service and achievement of certain performance conditions established by the board of directors for a predetermined period, the fair value is determined based upon the market closing price of our Class A common stock on the date of the grant; compensation expense is recognized over the requisite service period if it is probable that the performance condition will be satisfied based on the accelerated attribution method.\nIn addition, we have issued performance-based stock options that vest based upon continued service through the vesting term and achievement of certain market conditions established by the board of directors for a predetermined period. We measure stock-based compensation expense for performance-based stock options containing market conditions based on the estimated grant date fair value determined using the Monte Carlo valuation model; we recognize compensation expense for such awards over the requisite service period using the accelerated attribution method.\nWe estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those shares that are expected to vest. We estimate the expected forfeiture rate at the date of grant based on historical experience and our expectations regarding future pre-vesting termination behavior of employees and other service providers and revise the estimates, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. To the extent our actual forfeiture rate is different from our estimate, stock-based compensation expense is adjusted accordingly.\nWe will continue to use judgment in evaluating the assumptions related to our stock-based compensation on a prospective basis. As we continue to accumulate additional data related to our common stock, we may have refinements to our estimates, which could materially impact our future stock-based compensation expense.\nLong-Lived Assets, Including Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangible Assets\nWe evaluate the recoverability of property and equipment and operating lease right-of-use assets for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate. If such review indicates that the carrying amount of property and equipment is not recoverable, the carrying amount of such assets is reduced to fair value. We have not recorded any significant impairment charges during the years presented.\nWe review goodwill for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable. We have elected to first assess the qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of our single reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test. If we determine that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount, then the quantitative goodwill impairment test will be performed. The quantitative goodwill impairment test identifies goodwill impairment and measures the amount of goodwill impairment loss to be recognized by comparing the fair value of our single reporting unit with its carrying amount. If the fair value exceeds its carrying amount, no further analysis is required; otherwise, any excess of the goodwill carrying amount over the implied fair value is recognized as an impairment loss, and the carrying value of goodwill is written down to fair value. No impairment of goodwill has been identified during the years presented.\nAcquired finite-lived intangible assets are typically amortized over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which is generally two to seven years. We evaluate the recoverability of our intangible assets for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate. If such review indicates that the carrying amount of intangible assets is not recoverable, the carrying amount of such assets is reduced to fair value. We have not recorded any such impairment charges during the years presented.\nRecently Adopted and Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nRefer to Note 2 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K regarding the effect of recently adopted and issued accounting pronouncements on our financial statements.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nRegulation S-K Item 10(e), \u201cUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures in Commission Filings,\u201d defines and prescribes the conditions for use of non-GAAP financial information. Our measures of non-GAAP operating income (loss), non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net income (loss), non-GAAP net income (loss) per share, and free cash flow (collectively, the non-GAAP financial measures) each meet the definition of a non-GAAP financial measure.\nWe use these non-GAAP financial measures and our key metrics for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures and key metrics provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance by excluding certain expenses that may not be indicative of our recurring core business operating results. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures and key metrics in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures and key metrics also facilitate management\u2019s internal comparisons to our historical performance as well as comparisons to our competitors\u2019 operating results. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures and key metrics are useful to investors both because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making and (2) they are used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the health of our business.\nNon-GAAP operating income (loss) and non-GAAP operating margin\nWe define non-GAAP operating income (loss) as operating income (loss) excluding expenses related to stock-based compensation (SBC), acquired intangible assets amortization, and as applicable, other special items. Non-GAAP operating margin is defined as non-GAAP operating income (loss) divided by revenue. Although SBC is an important aspect of the compensation of our employees and executives, determining the fair value of certain of the stock-based instruments we utilize involves a high degree of judgment and estimation and the expense recorded may bear little resemblance to the actual value realized upon the vesting or future exercise of the related stock-based awards. Furthermore, unlike cash compensation, the value of stock options, which is an element of our ongoing stock-based compensation expense, is determined using a complex formula that incorporates factors, such as market volatility, that are beyond our control. For restricted stock unit awards, the amount of stock-based compensation expenses is not reflective of the value ultimately received by the grant recipients. Management believes it is useful to exclude SBC in order to better understand the long-term performance of our core business and to facilitate comparison of our results to those of peer companies. Management also views amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, such as the amortization of the cost associated with an acquired company\u2019s developed technology and trade names, as items arising from pre-acquisition activities determined at the time of an acquisition. While these intangible assets are continually evaluated for impairment, amortization of the cost of purchased intangibles is a static expense, one that is not typically affected by operations during any particular period. Furthermore, Box excludes the following expenses as they are considered by management to be special items outside of Box\u2019s core operating results: (1) fees related to shareholder activism, which include directly applicable third-party advisory and professional service fees, (2) expenses related to certain litigation, (3) expenses associated with restructuring activities, consisting primarily of severance and other personnel-related costs, and (4) expenses related to announced acquisitions, including transaction and discrete tax costs. There are no expenses related to litigation excluded from non-GAAP operating income (loss) in any of the periods presented.\nNon-GAAP net income (loss) and net income (loss) per share\nWe define non-GAAP net income (loss) as net loss excluding expenses related to stock-based compensation, acquired intangible assets amortization and as applicable, other special items. We specifically identify other adjusting items in our reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP net income (loss). These items include expenses related to certain litigation and the amortization of the debt discount and issuance costs associated with our Notes, which are amortized as interest expense, because they are considered by management to be special items outside our core operating results. We define non-GAAP net income (loss) per share as non-GAAP net income (loss) divided by the weighted-average outstanding shares. Similarly, the same adjusting items specified in our reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP net income (loss) are also excluded from the calculation of non-GAAP net income (loss) per share.\nFree Cash Flow\nWe define free cash flow as cash flows from operating activities less purchases of property and equipment, principal payments of finance lease liabilities, capitalized internally developed software costs, and other items that did not or are not expected to require cash settlement and that management considers to be outside of our core business. We specifically identify other adjusting items in our reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures. We consider free cash flow to be a profitability and liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business that can possibly be used for investing in our business and strengthening the balance sheet; but it is not intended to represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. A reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash provided by operating activities, its nearest GAAP equivalent, is presented below. The presentation of free cash flow is also not meant to be considered in isolation or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity.\nLimitations on the use of non-GAAP financial measures\nA limitation of our non-GAAP financial measures is that they do not have uniform definitions. Our definitions will likely differ from the definitions used by other companies, including peer companies, and therefore comparability may be limited. Thus, our non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or in isolation from, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Additionally, in the case of stock-based compensation expense, if we did not pay a portion of compensation in the form of stock-based compensation expense, the cash salary expense included in costs of revenue and operating expenses would be higher which would affect our cash position.\nWe compensate for these limitations by reconciling non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures. We encourage investors and others to review our financial information in its entirety, not to rely on any single financial measure and to view our non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with the most comparable GAAP financial measures.\nThe following table sets forth our reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures for years ended January 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 (in thousands, except per share data and percentages). We adopted ASC Topic 842, effective February 1, 2019, utilizing the modified retrospective method. The reported results for fiscal year 2020 onwards reflect the application of ASC 842, while the reported results for fiscal years presented prior to adoption are not adjusted and continue to be reported under ASC Topic 840.\nYear Ended January 31,\nGAAP operating loss\n$\n(37,642\n)\n$\n(139,472\n)\n$\n(134,237\n)\nStock-based compensation\n154,292\n145,988\n119,296\nAcquired intangible assets amortization\n-\n-\nAcquisition-related expenses\n-\n-\nFees related to shareholder activism\n1,402\n1,154\n-\nRestructuring activities\n-\n1,651\n-\nNon-GAAP operating income (loss)\n$\n118,842\n$\n9,321\n$\n(14,917\n)\nGAAP operating margin\n(5\n)\n%\n(20\n)\n%\n(22\n)\n%\nStock-based compensation\nAcquired intangible assets amortization\n-\n-\n-\nAcquisition-related expenses\n-\n-\n-\nFees related to shareholder activism\n-\n-\n-\nRestructuring activities\n-\n-\n-\nNon-GAAP operating margin\n%\n%\n(2\n)\n%\nGAAP net loss\n$\n(43,433\n)\n$\n(144,348\n)\n$\n(134,612\n)\nStock-based compensation\n154,292\n145,988\n119,296\nAcquired intangible assets amortization\n-\n-\nAmortization of debt discount and issuance costs\n-\n-\nAcquisition-related expenses\n-\n-\nFees related to shareholder activism\n1,402\n1,154\n-\nGain on investment in strategic equity securities\n-\n-\n(2,035\n)\nRestructuring activities\n-\n1,651\n-\nNon-GAAP net income (loss)\n$\n113,698\n$\n4,445\n$\n(17,327\n)\nGAAP net loss per share, basic and diluted\n$\n(0.28\n)\n$\n(0.98\n)\n$\n(0.95\n)\nStock-based compensation\n0.99\n0.99\n0.84\nAcquired intangible assets amortization\n-\n-\n-\nAmortization of debt discount and issuance costs\n-\n-\n-\nAcquisition-related expenses\n0.01\n-\n-\nFees related to shareholder activism\n0.01\n0.01\n-\nGain on investment in strategic equity securities\n-\n-\n(0.01\n)\nRestructuring activities\n-\n0.01\n-\nNon-GAAP net income (loss) per share, basic\n$\n0.73\n$\n0.03\n$\n(0.12\n)\nNon-GAAP net income (loss) per share, diluted\n$\n0.70\n$\n0.03\n$\n(0.12\n)\nWeighted-average shares used to compute GAAP net loss per share, basic and diluted\n155,849\n147,762\n141,351\nWeighted-average shares used to compute Non-GAAP net income (loss) per share\nBasic\n155,849\n147,762\n141,351\nDiluted\n162,310\n153,755\n141,351\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$\n196,834\n$\n44,713\n$\n55,321\nPurchases of property and equipment, net of proceeds from sales\n(9,052\n)\n(5,444\n)\n(14,806\n)\nPrincipal payments of finance lease liabilities\n(60,020\n)\n(38,542\n)\n(23,930\n)\nCapitalized internal-use software costs\n(7,438\n)\n(7,957\n)\n(2,761\n)\nFree cash flow\n$\n120,324\n$\n(7,230\n)\n$\n13,824\nNet cash used in investing activities\n$\n(16,383\n)\n$\n(13,296\n)\n$\n(16,151\n)\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities\n$\n218,677\n$\n(53,416\n)\n$\n(29,567\n)",
    "item_7A": "Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe had cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash of $595.5 million as of January 31, 2021. Our cash and cash equivalents primarily consist of overnight deposits and money market funds. We do not expect our operating results or cash flows to be materially affected by a sudden change in market interest rates and we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes.\nInterest rate risk also reflects our exposure to movements in interest rates associated with the November 2017 Facility. As of January 31, 2021, we had total debt outstanding with a carrying amount of $30.0 million which approximates fair value. The revolving loans accrue interest at a prime rate plus a margin of 0.25% or, at our option, a LIBOR rate (based on one, three or six-month interest periods) plus a margin of 1.00%.\nEffective September 5, 2019, we entered into a swap agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (Swap Agreement), in order to minimize our interest rate risk exposure due to the volatility of LIBOR. Under the Swap Agreement, we have hedged a portion of the variable interest payments of our debt by effectively fixing our interest payments over the five year term of the agreement. As of January 31, 2021, our interest rate swap had a notional value of $30.0 million.\nA hypothetical 10% increase or decrease in interest rates after January 31, 2021 under the November 2017 Facility and in connection with our Swap Agreement would not have a material impact on the combined net fair value of our outstanding debt and Swap Agreement.\nIn January 2021, we issued $345.0 million aggregate principal amount of 0.00% convertible senior notes due January 15, 2026. The Notes are senior unsecured obligations and do not bear regular interest. As a result, the interest and market value changes affect the fair value of the Notes but do not impact our financial position, cash flows, or results of operations. Additionally, we carry the Notes at face value less unamortized discount on our balance sheet, and we present the fair value for required disclosure purposes only.\nForeign Currency Risk\nOur sales contracts are denominated predominantly in U.S. dollars. We support sales contracts denominated in 11 foreign currencies and consequently, our customer billings denominated in foreign currencies are subject to foreign currency exchange risk. Five of the 11 currencies are only offered at this time through our online sales experience and are required to be settled by credit cards; accordingly, our foreign currency exposure on these transactions is limited only to ordinary credit card settlement timeframes. A portion of our operating expenses are incurred outside the United States and are denominated in foreign currencies, which are also subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Our international subsidiaries maintain certain asset and liability balances that are denominated in foreign currencies. Additionally, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can result in fluctuations in our total assets, liabilities, and cash flows and may cause us to recognize transaction gains and losses in our statement of operations impacting our revenue and operating expenses. To date we have managed our foreign currency risk by maintaining offsetting assets and liabilities and minimizing non-U.S. dollar cash balances, and have not entered into derivatives or hedging transactions as our exposure to foreign currency exchange rates has not been material to our historical operating results; however, we may do so in the future if our exposure to foreign currency should become more significant. For the years ended January 31, 2021 and 2020, we incurred $2.5 million in foreign exchange gains and $1.1 million in foreign exchange losses, respectively. There were no material foreign exchange gains or losses for the year ended January 31, 2019.",

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nBOX, INC.\nINDEX TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nReports of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\nConsolidated Statements of Operations\nConsolidated Statements of Comprehensive Loss\nConsolidated Statements of Stockholders\u2019 Equity\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Stockholders and Board of Directors of Box, Inc.\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Box, Inc. (the Company) as of January 31, 2021 and 2020, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, stockholders\u2019 equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 31, 2021, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the \u201cconsolidated financial statements\u201d). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at January 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 31, 2021, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated March 19, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nAdoption of ASU No. 2016-02\nAs discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its method of accounting for leases due to the adoption of ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), and the related amendments, effective February 1, 2019.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the account or disclosure to which it relates.\nRevenue recognition - evaluation of contract terms and conditions\nDescription of the Matter\nAs discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company derives its revenues primarily from subscription services, premier services packages and professional services. The Company determines revenue recognition following a five-step framework in line with ASC 606. Management applies significant effort and judgment in identifying and evaluating any non-standard terms and conditions in contracts which may impact revenue recognition.\nAuditing revenue recognition was challenging and complex due to the significant amount of effort and judgment required in the identification and evaluation of terms and conditions in contracts that impact revenue recognition.\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of the Company's controls over the internal review and assessment of terms and conditions within contracts that would impact revenue recognition in accordance with ASC 606.\nOur substantive procedures included, among others, testing the completeness and accuracy of management\u2019s identification and evaluation of terms and conditions within contracts, reading executed contracts for a sample of revenue transactions and evaluating whether the Company appropriately applied its revenue recognition policy to the arrangements based on the terms and conditions therein. We additionally assessed the appropriateness of the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nWe have served as the Company\u2019s auditor since 2012.\nSan Jose, California\nMarch 19, 2021\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Stockholders and Board of Directors of Box, Inc.\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Box, Inc.\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Box, Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2021, based on the COSO criteria.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of January 31, 2021 and 2020, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, stockholders\u2019 equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 31, 2021, and the related notes and our report dated March 19, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company\u2019s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management\u2019s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance

Description of Business and Basis of Presentation\nDescription of Business\nWe were incorporated in the state of Washington in April 2005, and were reincorporated in the state of Delaware in March 2008. We changed our name from Box.Net, Inc. to Box, Inc. in November 2011. Box provides a leading cloud content management platform that enables organizations of all sizes to securely manage cloud content while allowing easy, secure access and sharing of this content from anywhere, on any device.\nBasis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) and include the consolidated accounts of Box, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nCertain prior period amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. Such reclassifications did not affect total revenues, operating income, or net income.\nNote 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make, on an ongoing basis, estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Such estimates include, but are not limited to, the determination of the allowance for accounts receivable, fair value of acquired intangible assets and goodwill, useful lives of acquired intangible assets and property and equipment, the liability and equity allocation of our convertible senior notes, timing and costs associated with our asset retirement obligations, the nature and timing of satisfaction of performance obligations, estimate of standalone selling price allocation included in contracts with multiple performance obligations, the estimated expected benefit period for deferred commissions, the estimated useful life of capitalized internally developed software costs, observable price changes of non-marketable equity securities, the incremental borrowing rate we use to determine our lease liabilities, fair values of stock-based awards, legal contingencies, the valuation of deferred income tax assets, and unrecognized tax benefits, among others. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions which management believes to be reasonable, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.\nIn accordance with our property and equipment policy, we review the estimated useful lives of our fixed assets on an ongoing basis. A review of our fixed assets indicated that the actual lives of certain furniture and fixtures were longer than previously estimated useful lives used for depreciation purposes in our financial statements. As a result, effective September 1, 2018, we changed the estimated useful lives of certain furniture and fixtures to better reflect the estimated periods during which these assets will remain in service. The estimated useful lives of these assets previously depreciated for three years have now been increased to five years. This change was made prospectively for all existing furniture and fixtures as of September 1, 2018 and will continue to apply to all furniture and fixtures purchased thereafter. The effect of this change in estimate to net loss and net loss per share was not material in fiscal year 2019.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe derive our revenue primarily from three sources: (1) subscription revenue, which is comprised of subscription fees from customers who have access to our cloud content management platform, and other subscription-based services, which all include routine customer support; (2) revenue from customers purchasing our premier services package; and (3) revenue from professional services such as implementing best practice use cases, project management and implementation consulting services.\nRevenue is recognized when control of these services is transferred to a customer. The amount of revenue recognized reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those services.\nWe determine revenue recognition through the following steps:\n\u2022\nIdentification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer\n\u2022\nIdentification of the performance obligations in the contract\n\u2022\nDetermination of the transaction price\n\u2022\nAllocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract\n\u2022\nRecognition of revenue as we satisfy a performance obligation\nSubscription and Premier Services Revenues\nWe recognize revenue as we satisfy a performance obligation. Accordingly, due to our subscription model, we recognize revenue for our subscription and premier services ratably over the contract term.\nWe typically invoice our customers at the beginning of the term, in multiyear, annual, quarterly or monthly installments. Our subscription and premier services contracts generally range from one to three years in length, are typically non-cancellable and do not contain refund-type provisions. Revenue is presented net of sales and other taxes we collect on behalf of governmental authorities.\nProfessional Services\nProfessional services are generally billed on a fixed price basis, for which revenue is recognized over time based on the proportion performed.\nContracts with Multiple Performance Obligations\nOur contracts can include multiple performance obligations which may consist of some or all of subscription services, premier services, and professional services. For these contracts, we account for individual performance obligations separately if they are distinct. The transaction price is allocated to the separate performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price basis. We determine the standalone selling prices based on our overall pricing objectives, taking into consideration discounting practices, the size and volume of our transactions, the customer demographic, the geographic area where services are sold, price lists, our go-to-market strategy, historical standalone sales and contract prices.\nDeferred Revenue\nDeferred revenue consists of billings in advance of revenue recognition generated by our subscription services, premier services, and professional services described above.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue consists primarily of costs related to providing our subscription services to our paying customers, including employee compensation and related expenses for data center operations, customer support and professional services personnel, payments to outside technology service providers, depreciation of servers and equipment, security services and other tools, as well as amortization expense associated with capitalized internally developed software and acquired technology. We allocate overhead such as rent, information technology costs and employee benefit costs to all departments based on headcount.\nDeferred Commissions\nSales commissions earned by our sales force are considered incremental and recoverable costs of obtaining a contract with a customer. Sales commissions for new contracts are deferred and then amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of benefit that we have estimated to be five years. We determined the period of benefit by taking into consideration our customer contracts, our technology and other factors. Sales commissions for renewal contracts are deferred and then amortized on a straight-line basis over the related contractual renewal period. Amortization expense is included in sales and marketing expenses on the consolidated statements of operations.\nWe deferred sales commissions costs of $48.0 million, $44.0 million and $37.6 million during the years ended January 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and amortized $36.1 million, $25.9 million and $17.3 million of deferred commissions during the same periods respectively.\nCertain Risks and Concentrations\nOur financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable. Although we deposit our cash with multiple financial institutions, our deposits, at times, may exceed deposit insurance coverage limits.\nWe sell to a broad range of customers. Our revenue is derived substantially from the United States across a multitude of industries. Accounts receivable are derived from the delivery of our services to customers primarily located in the United States. We accept and settle our accounts receivable using credit cards, electronic payments and checks. A majority of our lower dollar value invoices are settled by credit card on or near the date of the invoice. We do not require collateral from customers to secure accounts receivable. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon the expected collectability, which takes into consideration specific customer creditworthiness and current economic trends. We believe collections of our accounts receivable are probable based on the size, industry diversification, financial condition and past transaction history of our customers. As of January 31, 2021 and 2020, one reseller, which is also a customer, accounted for more than 10% of total accounts receivable. One reseller, which is also a customer, represented 10% and 11% of revenue for the years ended January 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. No single customer represented over 10% of revenue in the year ended January 31, 2021.\nWe serve our customers and users from data center facilities operated by third parties. In order to reduce the risk of down time of our subscription services, we have established data centers and third-party cloud computing and hosting providers in various locations in the United States and abroad. We have internal procedures to restore services in the event of disaster at any one of our current data center facilities. Even with these procedures for disaster recovery in place, our cloud services could be significantly interrupted during the implementation of the procedures to restore services.\nGeographic Locations\nFor the years ended January 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, revenue attributable to customers in the United States was 72%, 75% and 77%, respectively. For the years ended January 31, 2021 and 2020, revenue attributable to customers in Japan was 14% and 10%, respectively. No country outside of the United States comprised 10% or greater of our revenue for the year ended January 31, 2019.\nSubstantially all of our net assets are located in the United States. As of January 31, 2021 and 2020, property and equipment located in the United States was approximately 96% and 94%, respectively.\nForeign Currency Translation and Transactions\nThe functional currency of our principal foreign subsidiary is the U.S. dollar; for the other foreign subsidiaries, the functional currency is generally the local currency. Adjustments resulting from translating foreign functional currency financial statements into U.S. dollars for those entities that do not have U.S. dollars as their functional currency are recorded as part of a separate component of the consolidated statements of comprehensive loss. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in the consolidated statements of operations for the period. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Revenue and expenses are translated at the average exchange rate during the period. Equity transactions are translated using historical exchange rates. Translation adjustments at the balance sheet dates were not material. We incurred $2.5 million in foreign currency transaction gains during the year ended January 31, 2021 and $1.1 million in foreign currency transaction losses during the year ended January 31, 2020, respectively. Transaction gains and losses recognized were not material during the year ended January 31, 2019.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nWe consider all highly liquid investments with an initial maturity of 90 days or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. We maintain such funds in overnight cash deposits and money market funds.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nWe measure cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash at fair value at each reporting period using a fair value hierarchy which requires us to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. We define fair value as the exchange price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. A financial instrument\u2019s classification within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Three levels of inputs may be used to measure fair value:\n\u2022\nLevel 1-Observable inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n\u2022\nLevel 2-Observable inputs are quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs other than quoted prices which are observable for the assets or liabilities, either directly or indirectly through market corroboration, for substantially the full term of the financial instruments.\n\u2022\nLevel 3-Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. These inputs are based on our own assumptions used to measure assets and liabilities at fair value and require significant management judgment or estimation.\nNon-marketable equity securities include our privately held strategic equity securities without readily determinable fair values. We recorded these privately held strategic equity securities without readily determinable fair values using a measurement alternative which measures the securities at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from qualifying observable price changes with a same or similar security from the same issuer. Our non-marketable equity securities are recorded at fair value only if an impairment or observable price adjustment is recognized in the current period. If an observable price adjustment or impairment is recognized on our non-marketable equity securities, we classify these assets as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy based on the nature of the fair value inputs. During the year ended January 31, 2019, we recognized a $2.0 million gain on the sale of a strategic equity investment. There were no other adjustments for impairment or observable price changes during the other periods presented. The aggregate carrying value of our privately held strategic equity securities is not material for all periods presented and is included in other long-term assets on the consolidated balance sheets.\nOur other current financial instruments, including accounts receivable, accounts payable and other current liabilities, have fair values which approximate their carrying value due to their short-term maturities.\nDerivative Instruments and Hedging\nWe measure derivative financial instruments at fair value and recognize them as either assets or liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. We record changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments designated as cash flow hedges in other comprehensive income (loss). When the hedged transaction affects earnings, we subsequently reclassify the net derivative gain or loss within other comprehensive income (loss) into the same line as the hedged item on the consolidated statements of operations to offset the changes in the hedged transaction.\nThe cash flow effects related to derivative financial instruments designated as cash flow hedges are included within operating activities on our consolidated statements of cash flows.\nConvertible Senior Notes\nIn January 2021, we issued $345.0 million aggregate principal amount of 0.00% convertible seniors notes due January 15, 2026. In accounting for the issuance of the Notes, we separated the Notes into liability and equity components. The carrying amount of the liability component was calculated by measuring the fair value of similar liabilities that do not have associated convertible features. The carrying amount of the equity component representing the conversion option was determined by deducting the fair value of the liability component from the par value of the Notes. The difference represents the debt discount that is amortized to interest expense over the term of the Notes using the effective interest rate method. The equity component, which is recorded in additional paid-in capital, is not remeasured as long as it continues to meet the conditions for equity classification. In accounting for the issuance costs related to the Notes, we allocated the total amount of issuance costs incurred to the liability and equity components based on their relative values. Issuance costs attributable to the liability component are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the Notes using the effective interest rate method. The issuance costs attributable to the equity component were netted against the equity component in additional paid-in capital.\nAccounts Receivable and Related Allowance\nAccounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amounts and do not bear interest. We maintain an allowance for estimated losses inherent in our accounts receivable portfolio. We assess the collectability of the accounts by taking into consideration the aging of our trade receivables, historical experience, and management judgment. We write off trade receivables against the allowance when management determines a balance is uncollectible and no longer intends to actively pursue collection of the receivable. We record a contract asset when revenue is recognized in advance of invoicing. Contract assets are presented within accounts receivable on the consolidated balance sheets.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets, generally three to five years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the remaining lease term. Depreciation commences once the asset is placed in service. Construction in progress is primarily related to the construction or development of property and equipment which have not yet been placed in service for their intended use.\nLeases\nWe adopted ASC Topic 842, effective February 1, 2019, using the modified retrospective method. The reported results for fiscal year 2020 reflect the application of ASC Topic 842, while the reported results for fiscal years presented prior to adoption are not adjusted and continue to be reported under ASC Topic 840.\nWe determine whether an arrangement contains a lease at inception. A contract is or contains a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. To determine whether a contract is or contains a lease, we consider all relevant facts and circumstances to assess whether the customer has both of the following:\n\u2022\nThe right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from use of the identified asset\n\u2022\nThe right to direct the use of the identified asset\nWe recognize lease liabilities and right-of-use assets at lease commencement. We measure lease liabilities based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term discounted using the rate implicit in the lease when that rate is readily determinable or our incremental borrowing rate. We estimate our incremental borrowing rate based on an analysis of publicly traded debt securities of companies with credit and financial profiles similar to our own and adjust our incremental borrowing rate to reflect the corresponding lease term. We do not include in the lease term options to extend or terminate the lease unless it is reasonably certain that we will exercise any such options. We account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component for all our leases.\nWe measure right-of-use assets based on the corresponding lease liabilities adjusted for (i) prepayments made to the lessor at or before the commencement date, (ii) initial direct costs we incur, and (iii) tenant incentives under the lease. We evaluate the recoverability of our right-of-use assets for possible impairment in accordance with our long-lived assets policy. We do not recognize right-of-use assets or lease liabilities for short-term leases, which have a lease term of twelve months or less, and recognize the associated lease payments in the consolidated statements of operations on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nOperating leases are reflected in operating lease right-of-use assets, operating lease liabilities, and operating lease liabilities, non-current on our consolidated balance sheets. Finance leases are included in property and equipment, net, finance lease liabilities, and finance lease liabilities, non-current on our consolidated balance sheets.\nWe begin recognizing rent expense when the lessor makes the underlying asset available to us. We recognize rent expense under our operating leases on a straight-line basis. For finance leases, we record interest expense on the lease liability in addition to amortizing the right-of-use asset (generally straight-line) over the shorter of the lease term or the useful life of the right-of-use asset. Variable lease payments are expensed as incurred and are not included within the lease liabilities and right-of-use assets calculation. We generally recognize sublease income on a straight-line basis over the sublease term.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. Such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Significant estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows from acquired users, acquired technology, and trade names from a market participant perspective, useful lives and discount rates. Management\u2019s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. During the measurement period, which is one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings.\nLong-Lived Assets, Including Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangible Assets\nWe evaluate the recoverability of property and equipment for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate. If such review indicates that the carrying amount of property and equipment is not recoverable, the carrying amount of such assets is reduced to fair value. We have not recorded any significant impairment charges during the years presented.\nWe review goodwill for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable. We have elected to first assess the qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of our single reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test. If we determine that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount, then the quantitative goodwill impairment test will be performed. The quantitative goodwill impairment test identifies goodwill impairment and measures the amount of goodwill impairment loss to be recognized by comparing the fair value of our single reporting unit with its carrying amount. If the fair value exceeds its carrying amount, no further analysis is required; otherwise, any excess of the goodwill carrying amount over the implied fair value is recognized as an impairment loss, and the carrying value of goodwill is written down to fair value. No impairment of goodwill has been identified during the years presented.\nAcquired finite-lived intangible assets are typically amortized over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which is generally two to seven years. We evaluate the recoverability of our intangible assets for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate. If such review indicates that the carrying amount of intangible assets is not recoverable, the carrying amount of such assets is reduced to fair value. We have not recorded any such impairment charges during the years presented.\nLegal Contingencies\nFrom time to time, we are a party of litigation and subject to claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. We investigate these claims as they arise and accrue estimates for resolution of legal and other contingencies when losses are probable and estimable. Because the results of litigation and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, we base our loss accruals on the best information available at the time. As additional information becomes available, we reassess our potential liability and may revise our estimates. Such revisions could have a material impact on future quarterly or annual results of operations.\nResearch and Development Costs\nResearch and development costs include personnel costs, including stock-based compensation expense, associated with our engineering personnel and consultants responsible for the design, development and testing of the product, depreciation of equipment used in research and development and allocated overhead for facilities, information technology, and employee benefit costs.\nInternal-Use Software Costs\nWe capitalize costs to develop software for internal use incurred during the application development stage. Costs related to preliminary project activities and post implementation activities are expensed as incurred. Once an application has reached the development stage, qualifying internal and external costs are capitalized until the application is substantially complete and ready for its intended use. Capitalized qualifying costs are amortized on a straight-line basis when the software is ready for its intended use over an estimated useful life, which is generally three years. Internal-use software costs also include third-party on-premises software, which is amortized over the lesser of five years or the license term. We evaluate the useful lives of these assets on an annual basis and test for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets.\nWe capitalize qualifying implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract based on the existing guidance for internally developed software, which is presented as part of our prepaid expenses and other current assets and other long-term assets based on the term of the associated hosting arrangement. Qualifying external and internal costs incurred during the application development stage of implementation are capitalized and costs incurred during the preliminary project and post implementation stages are expensed as incurred. We amortize capitalized qualifying implementation costs on a straight-line basis when the module or component of the hosting arrangement is ready for its intended use over the shorter of (i) the contract term plus the renewal period and (ii) three years. The amortization of capitalized qualifying implementation cost is presented in the same line item as fees for the associated hosting arrangement in the consolidated statements of operations. We test for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets.\nAdvertising Costs\nAdvertising costs are expensed as incurred and are included in sales and marketing expense. Advertising costs for the years ended January 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 were $15.0 million, $25.6 million and $30.2 million, respectively.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe determine the fair value of stock options and purchase rights issued to employees under our 2015 Equity Incentive Plan (2015 Plan) and 2015 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (2015 ESPP) on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, which is impacted by the fair value of our common stock as well as changes in assumptions regarding a number of variables, which include, but are not limited to, the expected common stock price volatility over the term of the awards, the expected term of the awards, risk-free interest rates and the expected dividend yield. We use the market closing price of our Class A common stock as reported on the New York Stock Exchange for the fair value of restricted stock units and restricted stock granted after our IPO.\nWe recognize compensation expense for stock options, restricted stock units and restricted stock, net of estimated forfeitures, on a straight-line basis over the period during which an employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award (generally the vesting period of the award). We estimate future forfeitures at the date of grant and revise the estimates, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. We recognize compensation expense of purchase rights granted under our 2015 ESPP on a straight-line basis over the offering period.\nFor performance-based restricted stock units that vest based upon continued service and achievement of certain performance conditions established by the board of directors for a predetermined period, the fair value is determined based upon the market closing price of our Class A common stock on the date of the grant; compensation expense is recognized over the requisite service period if it is probable that the performance condition will be satisfied based on the accelerated attribution method.\nIn addition, we have issued performance-based stock options that vest based upon continued service through the vesting term and achievement of certain market conditions established by the Compensation Committee of our board of directors for a predetermined period. We measure stock-based compensation expense for performance-based stock options containing market conditions based on the estimated grant date fair value determined using the Monte Carlo valuation model; we recognize compensation expense for such awards over the requisite service period using the accelerated attribution method.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes under the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect on deferred taxes of a change in income tax rates is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations in the period that includes the enactment date. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts we believe are more likely than not to be realized.\nWe recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if we believe that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. ASU 2016-13 replaces the incurred loss impairment methodology in current U.S. GAAP with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. For trade receivables, loans, and other financial instruments, we are required to use a forward-looking expected loss model rather than the incurred loss model for recognizing credit losses which reflects losses that are probable. We adopted the new standard, effective February 1, 2020, and the adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, Income Taxes. ASU 2019-12 simplifies the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions to the general principles in Topic 740 and by improving consistent application of other areas of Topic 740. The new standard is effective for us beginning February 1, 2021, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of the provisions of this new standard on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting. Reference rate reform refers to the global transition away from certain reference rates, such as the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), and to the introduction of new reference rates that are based on a larger and more liquid population of observable transactions. ASU 2020-04 provides temporary optional expedients and exceptions for applying U.S. GAAP to contracts and hedging relationships that reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued as a result of reference rate reform. In January 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-01, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848), which refines the scope of Topic 848 and clarifies some of its guidance. The amendments in both updates were effective upon issuance and may be applied prospectively through December 31, 2022. We are currently evaluating the impact of the expedients and exceptions of this new standard on our November 2017 Facility and our hedging relationships that reference LIBOR.\nIn August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Debt - Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entity\u2019s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40). The amendments in this update were implemented by the FASB to reduce the number of accounting models for convertible debt instruments. Under ASU 2020-06, the embedded conversion features are no longer separated from the host contract for convertible instruments with conversion features that are not required to be accounted for as derivatives under Topic 815, or that do not result in substantial premiums accounted for as paid-in capital. Consequently, a convertible debt instrument will be accounted for as a single liability measured at its amortized cost, as long as no other features require bifurcation and recognition as derivatives. There will no longer be a debt discount representing the difference between the carrying value, excluding issuance costs, and the principal of the convertible debt instrument and, as a result, there will no longer be interest expense from the amortization of the debt discount over the term of the convertible debt instrument. The amendments in this update also require the if-converted method to be applied for all convertible instruments when calculating diluted earnings per share. The amendments in this standard are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, including interim periods within that fiscal year, with early adoption permitted. We intend to early adopt this update, effective February 1, 2021, using the modified retrospective method. Adoption of the amendments in this update is expected to result in a decrease of accumulated deficit of approximately $0.6 million, a decrease of additional paid-in capital of approximately $68.7 million, and an increase of debt, net, noncurrent of approximately $68.1 million.\nNote 3. Revenue\nContract Assets\nContract assets, which are presented within accounts receivable, were not material as of January 31, 2021 and 2020.\nDeferred Revenue\nDeferred revenue was $465.6 million and $423.8 million as of January 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. During the fiscal years ended January 31, 2021 and 2020, we recognized $407.5 million and $353.6 million that was included in the deferred revenue balance as of January 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nTransaction Price Allocated to the Remaining Performance Obligations\nAs of January 31, 2021, we had remaining performance obligations for subscription contracts of $896.9 million. We expect to recognize revenue on 61% of these remaining performance obligations over the next 12 months, with the balance recognized thereafter.\nDisaggregation of Revenues\nFor the fiscal years ended January 31, 2021 and 2020, revenue attributable to customers in the United States was 72% and 75%, respectively. For the fiscal years ended January 31, 2021 and 2020, revenue attributable to customers in Japan was 14% and 10%, respectively.\nNote 4. Fair Value Measurements\nInvestments\nFinancial assets subject to the fair value disclosure requirements were as follows (in thousands):\nJanuary 31, 2021\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nTotal\nCash equivalents:\nMoney market funds\n$\n256,861\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n256,861\nTotal cash equivalents\n$\n256,861\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n256,861\nJanuary 31, 2020\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nTotal\nCash equivalents:\nMoney market funds\n$\n43,558\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n43,558\nCertificates of deposit\n-\n20,000\n-\n20,000\nTotal cash equivalents\n$\n43,558\n$\n20,000\n$\n-\n$\n63,558\nDerivative Instruments and Hedging\nIn association with our debt described in Note 8, we are required to make variable rate interest payments based on a contractually specified interest rate index (e.g., LIBOR). The variable rate interest payments create interest rate risk as interest payments will fluctuate based on changes in the contractually specified interest rate index over the life of the loan. To minimize our risk exposure due to the volatility of the interest rate index, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, effective as of September 5, 2019 (Swap Agreement). This agreement, which is designated as a cash flow hedge, has a maturity of five years. Under the Swap Agreement, we have hedged a portion of the variable interest payments by effectively fixing our interest payments over the term of the agreement. As of January 31, 2021, our interest rate swap had a notional value of $30.0 million.\nWe classify the Swap Agreement within Level 2. As of January 31, 2021, the net unrealized loss of the interest rate swap, which is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities and accumulated other comprehensive loss in our consolidated balance sheet, was $1.2 million. As of January 31, 2020, the net unrealized loss of the interest rate swap was not material. During the year ended January 31, 2021, the net derivative loss within accumulated other comprehensive loss reclassified into earnings was not material and we estimate that the amount to be reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss into earnings within the next 12 months will not be material.\nFair Value Measurements of Other Financial Instruments\nIn November 2017, we entered into a secured credit agreement (as amended or otherwise modified from time to time, the November 2017 Facility). As of January 31, 2021, we had total debt outstanding relating to the November 2017 Facility with a carrying amount of $30.0 million. The estimated fair value of the November 2017 Facility, which we have classified as a Level 2 financial instrument, approximates its carrying value.\nOur 0.00% convertible senior notes due 2026 are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets at the net carrying value. As of January 31, 2021, the net carrying value of the Notes was $267.6 million and the principal amount of the Notes was $345.0 million. The difference between the principal amount of the Notes and the net carrying value represents the unamortized debt discount and unamortized debt issuance costs. Refer to Note 8 for additional details. The fair value of the Notes, which we have classified as a Level 2 instrument, was $348.4 million as of January 31, 2021. The fair value of the Notes was determined based on the quoted bid price of the Notes in an over-the-counter market on the last trading day of the reporting period, which was $101.00. As of January 31, 2021, based on the closing price of our Class A common stock of $17.34 on the last trading day of the quarter, the if-converted value of the Notes was less than the principal amount by $113.1 million.\nNote 5. Balance Sheet Components\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nAllowance for doubtful accounts, which is presented within accounts receivable, was $2.7 million and $3.2 million as of January 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nPrepaid Expenses and Other Current Assets\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets consisted of the following (in thousands):\nJanuary 31,\nPrepaid expenses\n$\n11,672\n$\n16,416\nCapitalized qualifying implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract, net of amortization (1)\n1,672\n1,202\nOther current assets\n3,441\n4,247\nTotal prepaid expenses and other current assets\n$\n16,785\n$\n21,865\n(1)\nCapitalized stock-based compensation expense, which is included in these amounts, was not material for the periods presented. The accumulated amortization of the capitalized costs was $1.4 million and $0.6 million as of January 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Amortization expense related to capitalized costs was not material for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2021 and 2020. We have not recorded any related impairment charges during the periods presented.\nProperty and Equipment, Net\nProperty and equipment, net consisted of the following (in thousands):\nJanuary 31,\nServers and related equipment\n$\n352,224\n$\n312,369\nLeasehold improvements\n80,558\n79,979\nComputer hardware\n25,810\n23,086\nFurniture and fixtures\n14,157\n14,192\nConstruction in progress\n11,422\n18,370\nTotal property and equipment\n484,171\n447,996\nLess: accumulated depreciation\n(324,023\n)\n(257,020\n)\nTotal property and equipment, net\n$\n160,148\n$\n190,976\nAs of January 31, 2021, the gross carrying amount of property and equipment included $256.0 million of servers and related equipment and $7.1 million of construction in progress acquired under finance leases, and the accumulated depreciation of property and equipment acquired under these finance leases was $152.5 million. As of January 31, 2020, the gross carrying amount of property and equipment included $216.4 million of servers and related equipment and $16.3 million of construction in progress acquired under finance leases, and the accumulated depreciation of property and equipment acquired under these finance leases was $98.0 million.\nDepreciation expense related to property and equipment was $68.1 million, $58.2 million and $46.3 million for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Included in these amounts were depreciation expense for servers and related equipment acquired under finance leases in the amount of $54.6 million, $43.4 million and $26.3 million, for the same periods respectively. Construction in progress primarily consists of servers and networking equipment and storage infrastructure being provisioned in our data center facilities. Interest capitalized to property and equipment was not material for the periods presented.\nOperating Lease Right-of-Use Assets, Net\nOperating lease right-of-use assets, net consisted of the following (in thousands):\nJanuary 31,\nOperating lease right-of-use assets\n$\n270,428\n$\n233,255\nLess: accumulated amortization\n(76,175\n)\n(35,449\n)\nOperating lease right-of-use assets, net\n$\n194,253\n$\n197,806\nOther Long-term Assets\nOther long-term assets consisted of the following (in thousands):\nJanuary 31,\nDeposits, noncurrent\n$\n2,707\n$\n2,726\nInternally developed software costs, net of amortization (1) (2)\n16,071\n14,521\nOn-premises software, net of amortization (2) (3)\n8,749\n10,594\nOther assets, noncurrent\n5,247\n4,140\nOther long-term assets\n$\n32,774\n$\n31,981\n(1)\nCapitalized stock-based compensation expense, which is included in these amounts, was $5.8 million and $5.0 million as of January 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n(2)\nThe accumulated amortization of capitalized software costs in the aggregate was $11.2 million and $1.7 million as of January 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Amortization expense related to capitalized software was $9.5 million and $1.7 million for the fiscal years ending January 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We have not recorded any material impairment charges during the periods presented.\n(3)\nThe estimated useful lives of on-premises software range from three to four years.\nNote 6. Leases\nWe have entered into various non-cancellable operating lease agreements for certain of our offices and data centers with lease periods expiring primarily between fiscal years 2022 and 2029. Certain of these arrangements have free or escalating rent payment provisions and optional renewal or termination clauses. Our operating leases typically include variable lease payments, which are primarily comprised of common area maintenance and utility charges for our offices and power and network connections for our data centers, that are determined based on actual consumption. Our operating lease agreements do not contain any residual value guarantees, covenants, or other restrictions.\nWe also entered into various finance lease arrangements to obtain servers and related equipment for our data center operations. These agreements are primarily for four years and certain of these arrangements have optional renewal or termination clauses. The leases are secured by the underlying leased servers and related equipment.\nWe sublease certain floors of our Redwood City, San Francisco, and London offices. Our current subleases have total lease terms ranging from 11 to 96 months that will expire at various dates by fiscal year 2025.\nThe components of lease cost, which were included in operating expenses in our consolidated statements of operations, were as follows (in thousands):\nYear End January 31,\nFinance lease cost:\nAmortization of finance lease right-of-use assets\n$\n54,630\n$\n43,448\nInterest on finance lease liabilities\n5,753\n4,483\nOperating lease cost, gross\n54,243\n48,870\nVariable lease cost, gross\n9,288\n11,862\nSublease income\n(10,969\n)\n(11,504\n)\nTotal lease cost (1)\n$\n112,945\n$\n97,159\n(1)\nShort-term lease cost was not material for the periods presented and is not included in the table above.\nSupplemental cash flow information related to leases was as follows (in thousands):\nYear End January 31,\nCash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities\nOperating cash flows for operating leases\n$\n59,478\n$\n48,675\nOperating cash flows for finance leases\n6,358\n4,052\nFinancing cash flows for finance leases\n60,020\n38,542\nRight-of-use assets obtained in exchange of lease obligations (1)\nOperating leases\n$\n39,267\n$\n233,255\nFinance leases\n31,282\n103,420\n(1)\nAmounts disclosed for the year ended January 31, 2020 include the adoption impact of ASC Topic 842 on the opening balance sheet as of February 1, 2019.\nSupplemental information related to the remaining lease term and discount rate was as follows:\nJanuary 31,\nWeighted-average remaining lease term (in years)\nOperating leases\n5.77\n6.67\nFinance leases\n2.35\n2.93\nWeighted-average discount rate\nOperating leases\n5.27\n%\n5.40\n%\nFinance leases\n4.44\n%\n4.56\n%\nAs of January 31, 2021, maturities of our operating and finance lease liabilities, which do not include short-term leases and variable lease payments, are as follows (in thousands):\nFiscal years ending January 31:\nOperating Leases (1)\nFinance Leases\n$\n59,002\n$\n53,788\n49,576\n41,770\n48,093\n19,357\n32,435\n1,555\n28,348\n-\nThereafter\n63,562\n-\nTotal lease payments\n$\n281,016\n$\n116,470\nLess: imputed interest\n(40,714\n)\n(6,231\n)\nPresent value of total lease liabilities\n$\n240,302\n$\n110,239\n(1)\nNon-cancellable sublease proceeds for the fiscal years ending January 31, 2022, 2023, 2024, and 2025 of $9.3 million, $8.8 million, $2.3 million, and $2.1 million, respectively, are not included in the table above.\nWe did not have any operating leases or finance leases that have not yet commenced as of January 31, 2021.\nWe establish assets and liabilities for the present value of estimated future costs to return certain of our leased facilities to their original condition. Such assets are depreciated over the lease period into operating expense, and the recorded liabilities are accreted to the future value of the estimated restoration costs. The present value of our estimated asset retirement obligation for our headquarters facility, which is recorded in other long-term liabilities, was $3.1 million and $2.8 million as of January 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The accretion expense, which was included in operating expenses in our consolidated statements of operations, was not material for all periods presented.\nNote 7. Commitments and Contingencies\nLetters of Credit\nAs of January 31, 2021 and 2020, we had letters of credit in the aggregate amount of $27.0 million and $26.5 million, respectively, in connection with our operating leases and voluntary disability insurance (VDI) program, which were primarily issued under the available sublimit for the issuance of letters of credit in conjunction with a secured credit agreement as disclosed in Note 8.\nPurchase Obligations\nAs of January 31, 2021, future payments under non-cancellable contractual purchases which were not recognized on our consolidated balance sheet relate primarily to infrastructure services and IT software and support services costs, are as follows (in thousands):\nFiscal years ending January 31:\n$\n11,540\n40,092\n2,340\n211,234\nThereafter\n-\n$\n265,640\nIn addition to the purchase obligations included above, as of January 31, 2021, we recognized a total of $14.9 million related to non-cancellable contractual purchases, which were included in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities, and other long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. $9.2 million, $3.8 million, and $1.9 million is due to be paid in the years ending January 31, 2022, 2023 and 2024, respectively.\nLegal Matters\nFrom time to time, we are subject to claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, including matters we initiate to defend ourselves or our users by determining the scope, enforceability, and validity of third-party proprietary rights or to establish our proprietary rights. We investigate these claims as they arise and accrue estimates for resolution of legal and other contingencies when losses are probable and estimable. Although the results of litigation and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe there was not at least a reasonable possibility that we had incurred a material loss with respect to such loss contingencies as of January 31, 2021. Additionally, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources, and other factors, regardless of the outcome of such litigation.\nIndemnification\nWe include service level commitments to our customers warranting certain levels of uptime reliability and performance and permitting those customers to receive credits in the event that we fail to meet those levels. In addition, our customer contracts often include (i) specific obligations that we maintain the availability of the customer\u2019s data through our service and that we secure customer content against unauthorized access or loss, and (ii) indemnity provisions whereby we indemnify our customers for third-party claims asserted against them that result from our failure to maintain the availability of their content or securing the same from unauthorized access or loss. To date, we have not incurred any material costs as a result of such commitments.\nOur arrangements generally include certain provisions for indemnifying customers against liabilities if our products or services infringe a third party\u2019s intellectual property rights. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount under these indemnification obligations due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. To date, we have not incurred any material costs as a result of such obligations and have not accrued any material liabilities related to such obligations in the consolidated financial statements. In addition, we indemnify our officers, directors and certain key employees while they are serving in good faith in their respective capacities. To date, there have been no claims under any indemnification provisions.\nNote 8. Debt\nConvertible Senior Notes\nIn January 2021, we issued $345.0 million aggregate principal amount of 0.00% convertible senior notes due January 15, 2026. The Notes are senior unsecured obligations and do not bear regular interest. Each $1,000 principal amount of the Notes will initially be convertible into 38.7665 shares of our Class A common stock, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $25.80 per share, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events.\nThe Notes are convertible at the option of the holders of the Notes at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding October 15, 2025, only under the following circumstances: (1) during any fiscal quarter commencing after the fiscal quarter ending on April 30, 2021 (and only during such fiscal quarter), if the last reported sale price of our Class A common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on and including, the last trading day of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price on each applicable trading day; (2) during the five-business day period after any five consecutive trading day period (the \u201cmeasurement period\u201d) in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of Notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of our Class A common stock and the conversion rate for the Notes on each such trading day; (3) if we call the Notes for redemption, at any time prior to the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the redemption date; or (4) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events.\nOn or after October 15, 2025, holders of the Notes may convert all or any portion of their Notes at any time prior to the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date regardless of the foregoing conditions. Effective February 5, 2021, we have made an irrevocable election to settle the principal portion of the Notes only in cash. Accordingly, upon conversion, we will pay the principal portion in cash and we will pay or deliver, as the case may be, the conversion premium in cash, shares of common stock or a combination of cash and shares of common stock, at the Company\u2019s election.\nWe may not redeem the Notes prior to January 20, 2024. We may redeem for cash all or any portion of the Notes, at our option, on or after January 20, 2024, if the last reported sale price of our common stock has been at least 130% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any 30 consecutive trading day period (including the last trading day of such period) ending on and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which we provide notice of redemption at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, plus any accrued and unpaid special interest to, but excluding the redemption date. No sinking fund is provided for the Notes, which means we are not required to redeem or retire the Notes periodically.\nUpon the occurrence of a fundamental change (as defined in the indenture governing the Notes) prior to the maturity date, subject to certain conditions, holders of the Notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of the Notes for cash at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased, plus any accrued and unpaid special interest to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date.\nAs of January 31, 2021, the conditions allowing holders of the Notes to convert were not met.\nIn accounting for the issuance of the Notes, we separated the Notes into liability and equity components. The carrying amount of the liability component was calculated by measuring the fair value of similar liabilities that do not have associated convertible features. The carrying amount of the equity component representing the conversion option was determined by deducting the fair value of the liability component from the par value of the Notes. The difference represents the debt discount that is amortized to interest expense over the term of the Notes using the effective interest rate method. The gross carrying amount of the equity component recorded was $70.5 million and was included in additional paid-in capital on the consolidated balance sheets upon issuance. The equity component is not remeasured as long as it continues to meet the conditions for equity classification. The effective interest rate of the liability component was 5.19%.\nIn accounting for the issuance costs related to the Notes, we allocated the total amount of issuance costs incurred to liability and equity components based on their relative values. Issuance costs attributable to the liability component are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the Notes using the effective interest rate method. The issuance costs attributable to the equity component were netted against the equity component in additional paid-in capital. Upon issuance of the Notes, we recorded liability issuance costs of $7.5 million and equity issuance costs of $1.9 million.\nThe net carrying amount of the liability component of the Notes consists of the following (in thousands):\nJanuary 31,\nPrincipal\n345,000\nUnamortized debt discount for conversion option\n(69,916\n)\nUnamortized issuance costs\n(7,470\n)\nNet carrying amount\n267,614\nThe net carrying amount of the equity component of the Notes consists of the following (in thousands):\nJanuary 31,\nDebt discount for conversion option\n70,509\nIssuance costs\n(1,933\n)\nNet carrying amount\n68,576\nFor the year ended January 31, 2021, the interest expense recognized related to the Notes was $0.6 million.\nCapped Calls\nIn connection with the pricing of the Notes, we entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions with certain counterparties (Capped Calls). The Capped Calls each have an initial strike price of approximately $25.80 per share, subject to certain adjustments, which correspond to the initial conversion price of the Notes. The Capped Calls have initial cap prices of $35.58 per share, subject to certain adjustments. The Capped Calls cover, subject to anti-dilution adjustments, approximately 13.4 million shares of our Class A common stock. Conditions that cause adjustments to the initial strike price of the Capped Calls are similar to the conditions that result in corresponding adjustments for the Notes. The Capped Calls are generally intended to reduce or offset the potential dilution to our common stock upon any conversion of the Notes with such reduction or offset, as the case may be, subject to a cap based on the cap price. The Capped Calls are separate transactions, and not part of the terms of the Notes. As these transactions meet certain accounting criteria, the Capped Calls are recorded in stockholders\u2019 equity and are not accounted for as derivatives. The cost of $27.8 million incurred in connection with the Capped Calls was recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital.\nLine of Credit\nOn November 27, 2017, we entered into a secured credit agreement (as amended or otherwise modified from time to time, the November 2017 Facility) and on July12, 2019, we entered into Amendment No.1 to the November 2017 Facility. Pursuant to the terms of the amendment, among other changes, (i) the maturity date of borrowings under the November 2017 Facility was extended from November 27, 2020 to July 12, 2022; (ii) the revolving commitments were increased from $85.0 million to $100.0 million; (iii) the sublimit for the issuance of letters of credit was increased from $30.0 million to $45.0 million; (iv) the covenant in the November 2017 Facility that limits the amount of finance leases and debt that we can incur to finance the acquisition, construction or improvement of any equipment or capital assets was increased from $100.0 million to $200.0 million; and (v) a clause for the issuance of debt constituting convertible debt securities was added, limiting the debt to an aggregate principal amount not to exceed the greater of (a) $350.0 million and (b) immediately after giving pro forma effect to the incurrence of such debt, an amount that would not cause the total leverage ratio to exceed 6.00 to 1.00. The total leverage ratio is defined in Amendment No. 1 as the ratio of (a) all outstanding funded debt to (b) earnings before\ninterest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), as of the end of the twelve-month period most recently ended for which financial statements are available. The proceeds of the revolving loans may be used for general corporate purposes. The revolving loans accrue interest at a prime rate plus a margin of 0.25% or, at our option, a LIBOR rate (based on one, three or six-month interest periods) plus a margin of 1.00%. Interest on the revolving loans is payable quarterly in arrears with respect to loans based on the prime rate and at the end of an interest period in the case of loans based on the LIBOR rate (or at each three-month interval if the interest period is longer than three months). Borrowings under the November 2017 Facility are collateralized by substantially all of our assets. The November 2017 Facility requires us to comply with a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum liquidity requirement. Additionally, the November 2017 Facility contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, including covenants limiting our, and our subsidiaries\u2019, ability to, among other things, grant liens, incur debt, pay dividends or distributions on the capital stock, effect certain mergers, make investments, dispose of assets, incur contractual obligations and commitments and enter into transactions with affiliates, in each case subject to customary exceptions for a credit facility of the size and type of the November 2017 Facility.\nIn April 2020, we drew an additional $30.0 million on the November 2017 Facility. During the year ended January 31, 2021, we paid down $40.0 million, of which $20.0 million was paid down in October 2020 and $20.0 million was paid down in January 2021, on our outstanding principal balance on the November 2017 Facility. As of January 31, 2021, we had total debt outstanding relating to the November 2017 Facility with a carrying amount of $30.0 million.\nAs of January 31, 2021 we were in compliance with all financial covenants.\nIn connection with the November 2017 Facility, for the years ended January 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, we incurred interest expense, net of capitalized interest costs, of $1.1 million, $1.3 million, and $1.3 million, respectively. During the same periods, the amounts of interest capitalized were not material. Interest expense in connection with the November 2017 Facility includes interest charges for our line of credit, amortization of issuance costs, and unused commitment fees on our line of credit.\nNote 9. Stockholders\u2019 Equity\nCommon Stock\nThe holder of each share of Class A common stock is entitled to 1 vote per share. As of January 31, 2021 and 2020, we had authorized 1,000,000,000 shares of Class A common stock, par value of $0.0001 per share. 159,850,663 and 150,611,405 shares of Class A common stock were issued and outstanding as of January 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nPreferred Stock\nAs of January 31, 2021 and 2020, we had authorized 100,000,000 shares of undesignated preferred stock, par value of $0.0001 per share. No shares were issued or outstanding in the periods presented.\nTreasury Stock\nAs of January 31, 2021 and 2020, we held an aggregate of 3,052,953 shares of common stock as treasury stock.\nNote 10. Stock-Based Compensation\nEmployee Equity Plans\nIn January 2015, our board of directors adopted the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan (2015 Plan), which became effective prior to the completion of our initial public offering (IPO). Awards granted under the 2015 Plan may be (i) incentive stock options, (ii) nonstatutory stock options, (iii) restricted stock units, (iv) restricted stock awards or (v) stock appreciation rights, as determined by our board of directors at the time of grant. Generally, our restricted stock units vest over four years and, (a) for employee new hire restricted stock unit grants, twenty-five percent vest one year from the vesting commencement date and continue to vest 1/16th per quarter thereafter; or (b) for employee refresh restricted stock unit grants, 1/16th per quarter vest from the vest commencement date schedule. As of January 31, 2021, 23,778,878 shares were reserved for future issuance under the 2015 Plan.\nIn January 2015, our board of directors adopted the 2015 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (2015 ESPP), which became effective prior to the completion of our IPO. The 2015 ESPP allows eligible employees to purchase shares of our Class A common stock at a discount of up to 15% through payroll deductions of their eligible compensation, subject to any plan limitations. The 2015 ESPP provides for 24-month offering periods beginning March 16 and September 16 of each year, and each offering period consists of four six-month purchase periods.\nOn each purchase date, eligible employees may purchase our stock at a price per share equal to 85% of the lesser of (1) the fair market value of our stock on the offering date or (2) the fair market value of our stock on the purchase date. In the event the price is lower on the last day of any purchase price period, in addition to using that price as the basis for that purchase period, the offering period resets and the new lower price becomes the new offering price for a new 24 month offering period. As of January 31, 2021, 1,288,378 shares were reserved for future issuance under the 2015 ESPP.\nStock Options\nThe following table summarizes the stock option activity under the equity incentive plans and related information:\nShares Subject to Options Outstanding\nWeighted-\nAverage\nWeighted-\nRemaining\nAverage Exercise\nContractual Life\nAggregate\nShares\nPrice\n(Years)\nIntrinsic Value\n(in thousands)\nBalance as of January 31, 2019\n9,096,961\n$\n9.01\n4.97\n$\n108,731\nOptions granted\n577,082\n19.89\nOption exercised\n(659,348\n)\n9.05\nOptions forfeited/cancelled\n(242,110\n)\n17.63\nBalance as of January 31, 2020\n8,772,585\n$\n9.48\n4.27\n$\n60,221\nOptions granted\n31,666\n12.48\nOption exercised\n(1,994,667\n)\n5.14\nOptions forfeited/cancelled\n(192,547\n)\n10.73\nBalance as of January 31, 2021\n6,617,037\n$\n10.77\n3.77\n$\n48,098\nVested and expected to vest as of January 31, 2021\n6,554,892\n$\n10.68\n3.74\n$\n48,092\nExercisable as of January 31, 2021\n5,348,780\n$\n8.59\n2.87\n$\n47,974\nShares Subject to Options Outstanding Weighted-Average Weighted-Remaining Average Exercise Contractual Life Aggregate Shares Price (Years) Intrinsic Value (in thousands) Balance as of January 31, 2019 Options granted Option exercised Options forfeited/cancelled Balance as of January 31, 2020 Options granted Option exercised Options forfeited/cancelled Balance as of January 31, 2021 Vested and expected to vest as of January 31, 2021 Exercisable as of January 31, 2021 9,096,961 $9.01 4.97 $ 108,731 577,082 19.89 (659,34) 9.05 (242,110) 17.63 8,772,585 $ 9.48 4.27 $ 60,221 31,666 12.48 (1,994,667) 5.14 (192,547) 10.73 6,617,037 $ 10.773.77 $ 48,098 6,554,892 $ 10.68 3.74 $ 48,092 5,348,780 $ 8.59 2.87 $ 47,974\nThe aggregate intrinsic value of options vested and expected to vest and exercisable as of January 31, 2021 is calculated based on the difference between the exercise price and the current fair value of our common stock. The aggregate intrinsic value of exercised options for the years ended January 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 was $28.0 million, $5.9 million and $30.5 million, respectively. The aggregate estimated fair value of stock options granted to employees that vested during the years ended January 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 was $2.3 million, $5.3 million and $6.7 million, respectively. The weighted-average grant date fair value of options granted to employees during the years ended January 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 was $5.41, $8.00 and $8.26 per share, respectively.\nAs of January 31, 2021, there was $1.7 million of unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to outstanding stock options granted to employees that is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.46 years.\nStock Options with Market-Based Performance Goals\nTo further align our stockholders\u2019 interests with executive officers\u2019 interests, the Compensation Committee of our board of directors approved and granted performance-based stock options with market-based performance goals under the 2015 Plan to certain executive officers, which are subject to both the achievement of the market-based performance goal established by the Compensation Committee and the continued employment of the participant. These performance-based stock options vest only to the extent that both the market-based performance goal and time-based condition are satisfied. As of January 31, 2021, the total outstanding balance of performance-based stock options was 1,375,000.\nThe grant date fair value of these awards was determined using a Monte Carlo valuation model and the related stock-based compensation expense is recognized based on an accelerated attribution method. Of the total $1.7 million in unrecognized stock-based compensation expense for stock options as of January 31, 2021, $1.0 million related to outstanding performance-based stock options with market-based performance goals, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.87 years.\nRestricted Stock Units\nThe following table summarizes the restricted stock unit activity under the equity incentive plans and related information:\nNumber of\nWeighted-\nRestricted\nAverage\nStock Units\nGrant Date\nOutstanding\nFair Value\nUnvested balance - January 31, 2019\n18,098,707\n$\n19.35\nGranted\n12,436,586\n18.81\nVested, net of shares withheld for employee payroll taxes\n(4,166,907\n)\n19.92\nForfeited/cancelled\n(4,560,279\n)\n19.77\nUnvested balance - January 31, 2020\n21,808,107\n$\n18.85\nGranted\n10,702,574\n15.81\nVested, net of shares withheld for employee payroll taxes\n(5,100,239\n)\n18.27\nForfeited/cancelled\n(13,079,764\n)\n17.87\nUnvested balance - January 31, 2021\n14,330,678\n$\n17.68\ner of Weighted- Restricted Average Stock Units Grant Date Outstanding Fair Value Unvested balance - January 31, 2019 18,098,707 $ 19.35 Granted 12,436,586 18.81 Vested, net of shares withheld for employee payroll taxes (4,166,907 ) 19.92 Forfeited/cancelled (4,560,279 ) 19.77 Unvested balance - January 31, 2020 21,808,107 $ 18.85 Granted 10,702,574 15.82 Vested, net of shares withheld for employee payroll taxes (5,100,239 ) 18.28 Forfeited/cancelled (13,079,764 ) 17.87 Unvested balance - January 31, 2021 14,330,678 $ 17.68\nAs of January 31, 2021, there was $236.2 million of unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to outstanding restricted stock units granted to employees that is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.58 years.\nPerformance-Based Restricted Stock Units\nWe use performance-based incentives for certain employees, including our named executive officers, to achieve our annual financial and operational objectives, while making progress towards our longer-term strategic and growth goals. Typically, near the beginning of each fiscal year, our Compensation Committee adopts the performance criteria and targets for the incentive compensation plan for that fiscal year, which identifies the plan participants, the performance measures and the associated target levels for each measure, and the potential payouts based on actual performance for the fiscal year.\nIn the first quarter of fiscal year 2020, our Compensation Committee adopted and approved the performance criteria and targets for fiscal year 2020 under our omnibus Executive Incentive Plan (the Fiscal 2020 Executive Bonus Plan). Based on a review of our actual achievement of pre-established corporate financial objectives and additional inputs from our Compensation Committee, the Fiscal 2020 Executive Bonus Plan was determined, settled and paid out in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021 in the form of fully vested restricted stock units. During the first quarter of fiscal year 2021, we recognized stock-based compensation expense related to the Fiscal 2020 Executive Bonus Plan in the amount of $1.5 million.\nIn the first quarter of fiscal year 2021, our Compensation Committee adopted and approved the performance criteria and targets for fiscal year 2021 under our omnibus Executive Plan (the Fiscal 2021 Executive Bonus Plan). The Fiscal 2021 Executive Bonus Plan provides opportunities for 100% equity incentive compensation payouts based on our actual achievement of pre-established corporate financial objectives, subject to review and a final approval by our Compensation Committee. During the year ended January 31, 2021, we recognized stock-based compensation expense related to the Fiscal 2021 Executive Bonus Plan in the amount of $8.3 million. The unrecognized compensation expense related to the ungranted and unvested Fiscal 2021 Executive Bonus Plan is $1.5 million, based on the expected performance against the pre-established corporate financial objectives as of January 31, 2021, which is expected to be recognized over a remaining weighted-average period of less than one year. The payouts of the Fiscal 2021 Executive Bonus Plan are expected to be made in the form of fully vested restricted stock units in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022.\n2015 ESPP\nDuring the first quarter of fiscal year 2021, the fair market value of our stock on the purchase date (i.e., March 15, 2020) was lower than the fair market value of our stock on the offering dates of our open offering periods. As a result, all open offering periods reset and the new lower price became the new offering price for a new 24 month offering period. These resets, including subsequent modifications, resulted in incremental fair value totaling $29.4 million during the year ended January 31, 2021, which is expected to be recognized over the remaining requisite service period. As of January 31, 2021, there was $27.2 million of unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to the 2015 ESPP that is expected to be recognized over the remaining term of the respective offering periods.\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe following table summarizes the components of stock-based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statements of operations (in thousands):\nYear Ended January 31,\nCost of revenue\n$\n18,936\n$\n16,769\n$\n14,065\nResearch and development\n61,145\n62,565\n45,189\nSales and marketing\n42,015\n38,030\n36,864\nGeneral and administrative\n32,196\n28,624\n23,178\nTotal stock-based compensation\n$\n154,292\n$\n145,988\n$\n119,296\nYear Ended January 31, 2021 2020 2019 Cost of revenue $ 18,936 $ 16,769 $ 14,065 Research and development 61,145 62,565 45,189 Sales and marketing 42,015 38,030 36,864 General and administrative 32,196 28,624 23,178 Total stock-based compensation $ 154,292 $ 145,988 $ 119,296\nDetermination of Fair Value\nWe estimated the fair value of employee stock options and 2015 ESPP purchase rights using a Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions:\nYear Ended January 31,\nEmployee Stock Options\nExpected term (in years)\n5.8\n5.5\n-\n5.8\n5.5\n-\n5.8\nRisk-free interest rate\n0.6\n%\n1.8\n%\n2.8\n%\n-\n3.1\n%\nVolatility\n%\n%\n%\nDividend yield\n%\n%\n%\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan\nExpected term (in years)\n0.5\n-\n2.0\n0.5\n-\n2.0\n0.5\n-\n2.0\nRisk-free interest rate\n0.1\n%\n-\n0.4\n%\n1.7\n%\n-\n2.5\n%\n2.0\n%\n-\n2.8\n%\nVolatility\n%\n-\n%\n%\n-\n%\n%\n-\n%\nDividend yield\n%\n%\n%\nYear Ended January 31, 2021 2020 2019 Employee Stock Options Expected term (in years) 5.8 5.5 - 5.8 5.5 - 5.8 Risk-free interest rate 0.6% 1.8% 2.8% - 3.1% Volatility 46% 45% 45% Dividend yield 0% 0% 0% Employee Stock Purchase Plan Expected term (in years) 0.5 - 2.0 0.5 - 2.0 0.5 - 2.0 Risk-free interest rate 0.1% - 0.4% 1.7% - 2.5% 2.0% - 2.8% Volatility 44% - 54% 34% - 55% 37% - 50% Dividend yield 0% 0% 0%\nThe assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option pricing model were determined as follows:\nFair Value of Common Stock. We use the market closing price for our Class A common stock as reported on the New York Stock Exchange to determine the fair value of our common stock at each grant date.\nExpected Term. The expected term represents the period that our share-based awards are expected to be outstanding. The expected term assumptions were determined based on the vesting terms, exercise terms and contractual lives of the options and 2015 ESPP purchase rights.\nExpected Volatility. We estimate the expected volatility of the stock option grants and 2015 ESPP purchase rights based on the historical volatility of our Class A common stock over a period equivalent to the expected term of the stock option grants and 2015 ESPP purchase rights, respectively\nRisk-free Interest Rate. The risk-free rate that we use is based on the implied yield available on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with remaining terms similar to the expected term on the options and 2015 ESPP purchase rights.\nDividend Yield. We have never declared or paid any cash dividends and do not plan to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future, and, therefore, use an expected dividend yield of zero.\nNote 11. Net Loss per Share\nMaterial modification of rights of security holders\nOn June 14, 2018, all of our outstanding shares of Class B common stock automatically converted into the same number of shares of Class A common stock pursuant to the terms of our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation. No additional shares of Class B common stock will be issued following such conversion. The conversion occurred pursuant to Article IV of our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, which provided that each share of Class B common stock would convert automatically, without any further action, into one share of Class A common stock on the first trading day falling on or after the date on which the outstanding shares of Class B common stock represent less than 5% of the aggregate number of shares of the then outstanding Class A common stock and Class B common stock. On June 15, 2018, we filed a certificate with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware effecting the retirement and cancellation of our Class B common stock. This certificate of retirement had the additional effect of eliminating the authorized Class B common stock, thereby reducing the total number of our authorized shares of common stock by 200,000,000.\nOur Class A and Class B common stock are referred to as common stock throughout the notes to the financial statements, unless otherwise noted. After June 14, 2018, common stock refers to our Class A common stock.\nFor periods where there were Class B shares outstanding, we calculate our basic and diluted net loss per share in conformity with the two-class method required for companies with participating securities. Under the two-class method, basic net loss per share is calculated by dividing the net loss by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period, less shares subject to repurchase. The diluted net loss per share is computed by giving effect to all potential dilutive common stock equivalents outstanding for the period. For purposes of this calculation, options to purchase common stock, restricted stock units, shares issuable pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan, shares subject to repurchase from early exercised options and unvested restricted stock, and contingently issuable shares are considered common stock equivalents but have been excluded from the calculation of diluted net loss per share as their effect is antidilutive.\nThe rights, including the liquidation and dividend rights, of the holders of our Class A and Class B common stock are identical, except with respect to voting and conversion. As the liquidation and dividend rights are identical, the undistributed earnings are allocated on a proportionate basis and the resulting net loss per share will, therefore, be the same for both Class A and Class B common stock on an individual or combined basis. We did not present dilutive net loss per share on an as-if converted basis because the impact was not dilutive.\nThe following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net loss per share (in thousands, except per share amounts):\nYear Ended January 31,\nClass A\nClass B\nClass A\nClass B\nClass A\nClass B\nNumerator:\nNet loss\n$\n(43,433\n)\n$\n-\n$\n(144,348\n)\n$\n-\n$\n(131,089\n)\n$\n(3,523\n)\nDenominator:\nWeighted-average number of shares outstanding-basic and diluted\n155,849\n-\n147,762\n-\n137,652\n3,699\nNet loss per share-basic and diluted\n$\n(0.28\n)\n$\n-\n$\n(0.98\n)\n$\n-\n$\n(0.95\n)\n$\n(0.95\n)\nThe following weighted-average outstanding shares of common stock equivalents were excluded from the computation of diluted net loss per share for the periods presented because the impact of including them would have been antidilutive (in thousands):\nYear Ended January 31,\nOptions to purchase common stock\n5,225\n7,598\n9,819\nRestricted stock units\n17,029\n16,478\n14,539\nEmployee stock purchase plan\n1,776\n1,820\n1,353\nShares related to the convertible senior notes\n-\n-\nTotal\n24,688\n25,896\n25,711\nNote 12.

As a result, we re-measured our UK deferred tax assets using 19% and recorded a benefit of $6.5 million, which was fully offset by a valuation allowance.\nThe significant components of our deferred tax assets and liabilities were as follows (in thousands):\nJanuary 31,\nDeferred tax assets:\nNet operating loss carryover\n$\n243,820\n$\n253,561\nAccruals and reserves\n7,822\n10,187\nStock-based compensation\n11,465\n15,930\nSection 59(e) capitalized research and development\n19,485\n-\nDepreciation and amortization\n6,618\n6,288\nOperating lease liabilities\n59,455\n62,698\nTax credit carryover\n4,325\n4,325\nDeferred business interest expense\n-\n1,061\nOther\n1,213\n1,904\nTotal deferred tax assets\n354,203\n355,954\nValuation allowance\n(286,659\n)\n(301,757\n)\nTotal deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance\n67,544\n54,197\nDeferred tax liabilities:\nOperating lease right-of-use assets, net\n(47,949\n)\n(49,966\n)\nConvertible debt\n(17,322\n)\n-\nDeferred commissions\n-\n(2,433\n)\nGoodwill with indefinite life amortization\n(525\n)\n(424\n)\nOther\n-\n(28\n)\nTotal deferred tax liabilities\n(65,796\n)\n(52,851\n)\nNet deferred tax assets\n$\n1,748\n$\n1,346\nIn assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. As a result, we have established a full valuation allowance against our U.S. and United Kingdom net deferred tax assets based on our history of losses. The valuation allowance decreased by $15.1 million and increased by $26.5 million, respectively, during the years ended January 31, 2021 and 2020.\nAs of January 31, 2021, we had federal, state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $697.1 million, $561.7 million and $318.4 million, respectively, available to offset future taxable income. The federal net operating loss carryforwards generated prior to fiscal year 2019 will expire at various dates beginning in 2025, if not utilized. We have federal net operating loss carryforwards of $75.3 million, which can be carried forward indefinitely. The state net operating loss carryforwards will expire at various dates beginning in 2022, if not utilized. The foreign net operating loss carryforwards do not expire. In addition, as of January 31, 2021, we had federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of $39.1 million and $41.2 million, respectively. The federal research and development tax credit carryforwards will expire beginning in 2025 if not utilized. The state research and development tax credit carryforwards do not expire.\nUtilization of the federal and state net operating loss may be subject to substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations provided by Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and similar state provisions. The annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses and credits before utilization. In the current year, the Company completed a Section 382 ownership change analysis covering the fiscal year 2015 to fiscal year 2021 tax periods, which concluded that the Company's net operating losses are not permanently limited. Subsequent ownership changes may further affect the limitation in future years.\nWe evaluate tax positions for recognition using a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, and those tax positions eligible for recognition are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon the effective settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. We believe that we have provided adequate reserves for our income tax uncertainties in all open tax years.\nA reconciliation of the gross unrecognized tax benefits is as follows (in thousands):\nYear Ended January 31,\nUnrecognized tax benefits-beginning of period\n$\n63,560\n$\n49,883\n$\n36,194\nReductions for tax positions related to prior year\n(57\n)\n(10\n)\n-\nReductions to unrecognized tax benefits as a result of a lapse of the applicable statute of limitations\n-\n-\n(20\n)\nAdditions for tax positions related to prior year\n-\n2,140\nAdditions for tax positions related to current year\n13,876\n13,687\n11,569\nUnrecognized tax benefits-end of period\n$\n77,427\n$\n63,560\n$\n49,883\nThe gross unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, would not materially affect the effective tax rate as of January 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. We do not expect our gross unrecognized tax benefits to change significantly over the next 12 months.\nOur policy is to classify interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions, if any, as a component of our income tax provision. Interest and penalties were not significant during the years ended January 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.\nWe file tax returns in the U.S. for federal, California, and other states. All tax years remain open to examination for both federal and state purposes as a result of our net operating loss and credit carryforwards. We began to file foreign tax returns in the United Kingdom starting with the year ended January 31, 2013, in France, Germany, and Japan starting with the year ended January 31, 2014, in Canada starting with the year ended January 31, 2015 and in Australia, Sweden, and Netherlands starting with the year ended January 31, 2016. Certain tax years remain open to examination.\nNote 13. Restructuring\nConsistent with our focused efforts to drive more profitable growth, in the quarter ended January 31, 2020, we completed certain restructuring activities primarily in our sales and marketing organization, and to a lesser extent in our (1) research and development and (2) general and administrative organizations. The restructuring included eliminating specific senior roles, centralizing the reporting structures for certain functions and geographies, eliminating select sales overlay roles, and reducing headcount in lower performing geographies. In connection with the restructuring, we recorded a charge in the quarter ended January 31, 2020 in the amount of $1.65 million, which consisted entirely of severance and other personnel-related costs. As of January 31, 2020, all affected personnel had been notified, $0.6 million of the restructuring charge had been paid, and $1.05 million of the charge remained accrued and included in accrued compensation and benefits in our consolidated balance sheet. During fiscal year 2021, all remaining restructuring charges were paid.\nNote 14. Segments\nOur chief operating decision maker reviews financial information presented on a consolidated basis for purposes of allocating resources and evaluating financial performance. As such, we have a single reporting segment and operating unit structure. Since we operate in one operating segment, all required segment information can be found in the consolidated financial statements.\nNote 15. 401(k) Plan\nWe have a 401(k) Savings Plan (the 401(k) Plan) which qualifies as a deferred salary arrangement under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Under the 401(k) Plan, participating employees may elect to contribute up to 100% of their eligible compensation, subject to certain limitations. We have not made any material matching contributions to date.\nNote 16. Subsequent events\nSignRequest B.V.\nIn February 2021, we entered into an agreement to acquire SignRequest B.V. (SignRequest), an e-signature provider, for total aggregate consideration of approximately $55 million comprised of a combination of cash and shares of our Class A common stock. We acquired SignRequest to develop Box Sign, an e-signature capability that will be developed on SignRequest\u2019s technology and natively integrated into Box. We are in the process of finalizing the valuation of the acquired assets and liabilities, which will be reflected in our balance sheet during the fiscal quarter ended April 30, 2021.\nCloud FastPath\nIn February 2021, we entered into an agreement to purchase certain assets and assume certain liabilities of, and hired certain employees from, Cloud FastPath, a cloud-based content migration solution, for total consideration of approximately $15 million paid in cash. We entered into this agreement with Cloud FastPath to supplement and enhance Box Shuttle, our full-service content migration program. We are in the process of finalizing the valuation of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities, which will be reflected in our balance sheet during the fiscal quarter ended April 30, 2021.",

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The term \u201cdisclosure controls and procedures,\u201d as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC\u2019s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company\u2019s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. The design of disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere was no change in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rule 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act that occurred during the quarter ended January 31, 2021 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nManagement\u2019s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Our management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria established in \u201cInternal Control - Integrated Framework\u201d (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on that assessment, our management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of January 31, 2021. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2021 has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears herein.",
