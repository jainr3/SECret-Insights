    "item_1": "Item 1. Business.\nOverview\nBenefitfocus provides industry-leading, cloud-based benefits management technology solutions for employers and health plans. The Benefitfocus enrollment platform simplifies how organizations procure benefits and connect to the necessary benefits products and services that improve the lives of their employees and the American workforce. Our core technology solutions facilitate employee benefits administration and enrollment; our solutions enable working Americans and their families to select and engage in the right benefits products and services for themselves; and our data advantage delivers insights to employers, health, plans and their advisors to help control healthcare spending and reduce unnecessary expenses.\nThe Benefitfocus Platform has a multi-tenant architecture and has a user-friendly interface designed for employees to access all of their benefits in one place. Our comprehensive solutions support medical benefit plans and non-medical benefits, such as, dental, life, disability insurance, income protection, digital health and financial wellness. Our platform includes functionality designed to help consumers identify and evaluate benefit options available to them. As the number of employer benefits plans has increased, with each plan subject to many different business rules and requirements, demand for the Benefitfocus Platform is growing.\nEmployers use our solutions to streamline benefits processes and control costs, keep up with challenging and ever-changing regulatory requirements, and offer a greater variety of benefit options to attract, retain and motivate employees. The Benefitfocus Platform enables our employer customers to simplify the management of complex benefits processes, from sales and enrollment to implementation and ongoing administration. It provides their employees with an engaging, highly intuitive and personalized user interface for selecting and managing all of their benefits via mobile or desktop device.\nHealth Plans, also known as health insurers, health insurance carriers or medical insurance carriers, use our solutions to more effectively market offerings to benefits-eligible employees, simplify billing, and improve the enrollment process. We also provide a large network of benefit provider data exchange connections, which facilitates the otherwise highly fragmented interaction among employees, employers, brokers and health plans.\nBrokers use our platform to manage employer portfolios. This includes delivering strategic insights that improve their employer clients\u2019 benefit experience and demonstrating greater value through access to a larger set of relevant products for employers, which should bring higher broker commissions and profits.\nSince our initial public offering, we have described our target market as comprising two separate but related market segments - employers and health plans. Within the employer market segment, we sell our technology solutions on an annually recurring or multi-year subscription basis to large employers, which we define as those with more than 1,000 employees. Similarly, in our other market segment, we sell our solutions on a subscription basis to health plans, enabling us to expand our overall footprint in the benefits marketplace by aggregating many key constituents, including consumers, employers, and brokers. We believe our presence in both the employer and health plan market segments gives us a strong position at the center of the benefits ecosystem.\nIn 2018, we expanded our economic model to include a transaction-oriented solution, known as Benefit Catalog (formerly BenefitsPlace), designed to align brokers, health plans, carriers and suppliers around the needs of employers and employees. In this model, Benefit Catalog sellers, who are carriers and suppliers, offer their voluntary and specialty benefit products in a \u201cmarketplace\u201d alongside the benefits enrollment platform. This marketplace is designed to increase the economic value of the employee and consumer lives on our platform by aligning the Benefit Catalog products to employee and consumer needs. In exchange for Benefitfocus delivering employee/consumer access, data-driven analysis and operational efficiencies, seller partners pay us a percentage of the purchases completed on our platform. Carrier agreements have terms of two to four years and are typically cancellable upon breach of contract or\ninsolvency. Supplier contracts have terms of one year or less and are generally cancellable upon breach of contract, failure to cure, bankruptcy and termination for convenience.\nOur hybrid software-as-a-service, or SaaS, and repeatable transaction-based model provides us significant visibility into our future operating results, which enhances our ability to manage our business. Our company was founded in 2000, and we currently employ approximately 1,200 associates, or employees.\nIndustry Background\nThe administration and distribution of benefits to employees is a mainstay of the U.S. economy. Providing these benefits is costly and complex and requires the exchange of data and information, application of rules, and transfer of funds among a wide variety of constituents, including consumers, employers, insurance carriers, suppliers, brokers, benefits outsourcers, payroll processors, and financial institutions. The size of the HR benefits administration market and the value of benefits transacted are large. According to IBISWorld calculations, the market for HR benefits administration in the United States was $61.9 billion in 2019. Eastbridge Consulting Group estimates the U.S. in-force premiums were $47.1 billion in 2019 for employee-paid life, health and disability products sold at the worksite with premiums paid through payroll.\nThe variety and complexity of medical and non-medical benefits plans continues to grow. The Benefitfocus annual market research report, The State of Employee Benefits 2018, our most recent edition, indicates that a higher proportion of benefits offerings are shifting to high-deductible health plans coupled with health savings accounts. This added complexity places greater potential cost burden on employees and consumers and creates a greater need for employers to educate their workforces on becoming more informed health-care consumers. To help employees cover added cost burdens, employers are increasingly offering a wider range of non-medical benefits plans, such as critical illness, supplemental income, and financial wellness programs, as well as traditional insurance offerings like dental, life and disability. Current point and legacy systems are inadequate to efficiently manage the complexity, regulation, and involvement of multiple parties. They are also incapable or inadequate in enabling the purchase of non-medical benefits. These factors are driving the need for an enterprise benefits management system and a consumer-focused platform to improve operational efficiency along the entire benefits value chain.\nEmployer Market\nA significant and growing portion of employers\u2019 costs is non-salary benefits, such as health insurance, that they provide to their employees. With healthcare and other premiums increasing, senior executives are prioritizing benefits administration in their organizations and searching for ways to contain costs without sacrificing benefits. In fact, according to the U.S. Department of Labor and Bureau of Labor Statistics, healthcare and other employee benefits accounted for 29.8% of all employee labor costs in September 2020. In addition, the expense burden continues to shift to employees. Employees\u2019 contributions to premiums for health insurance have grown from approximately $318 per employee in 1999 to approximately $1,221 per employee in 2020. Employers recognize the importance of offering a greater variety of non-medical benefits as a means to attract, motivate, and retain employees. They must maintain relationships with multiple insurance carriers and many other benefits providers, placing a substantial administrative burden on their organizations.\nEmployers\u2019 distribution, management, and administration of employee benefits has historically consisted of error-prone, paper-based processes, and a patchwork of customized software tools, which are costly to maintain, often lack necessary functionality, and fail to address the increasing complexity of the benefits marketplace. As benefits offerings become more complex and employees bear more of the cost of those benefits, HR software solutions that streamline information, simplify choices, and engage employees are increasingly in demand. Employees desire tailored, dynamic, and interactive communication of critical benefits information, with easy access to purchase benefits, as they become\naccustomed to receiving personalized content through various consumer applications on a range of devices.\nLegacy HR systems were generally designed as extensions of enterprise resource planning, or ERP, systems, built for back-office responsibilities like finance and accounting. As a result, these systems lack functionality and ease-of-use for employees. Many legacy HR systems were not designed to integrate with the broader benefits ecosystem, including brokers, carriers, and wellness providers, or have the ability to transact non-medical benefits. This results in expensive, error-prone, and incomplete experiences for employers and employees. Benefits outsourcers have attempted to compensate for the shortcomings of legacy HR systems, but they have generally lacked adequate technology solutions necessary to keep up with the rapidly evolving benefits landscape. As a result, employees are often not provided with the appropriate functionality and information required to select and manage their benefits effectively.\nModern technology, changing communication patterns, and a constantly evolving benefits ecosystem have impacted the employee-employer relationship. HR executives continue to search for effective strategies to increase efficiency and contain costs, while increasing employee engagement and being an employer of choice. Employers are increasingly interested in SaaS solutions that can help capture and analyze benefits data and provide more choice for their employees to improve productivity and satisfaction. In order to manage the distribution and administration of benefits effectively, employers need an integrated platform, capable of handling all benefits in one place and providing a highly personalized experience for employees.\nHealth Plan Market\nThe employee benefits market consists of myriad medical insurance carriers and products. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the single largest benefit provided to employees in the United States is healthcare insurance, often encompassing more than 90% of all insurance benefits spending by employers.\nLarge, national health insurance carriers also offer numerous individual health plans of different types, including health maintenance organizations, preferred provider organizations, point-of-service plans, and high deductible health plans, across the 50 states, as well as life and ancillary benefits plans. Each carrier offers a complex variety of medical insurance and non-medical benefits, encompassing life and ancillary plans, with each plan requiring multiple decisions to address the specific needs of employers and their individual employees. Despite widespread carrier consolidation, numerous disparate systems remain in place, with many large health plans operating on multiple IT systems. Health plans often rely on manual processes and siloed software applications to bridge gaps in legacy administration systems. Even as they attempt to modernize and keep up with evolving industry practices and a changing regulatory landscape, health plans have difficulty connecting with the broader healthcare system.\nThe effective delivery and management of employee benefits depends on the timely, continuous exchange of accurate data among health insurance carriers, their employer customers, broker partners and individual members. Legacy benefits management systems often lack important functionality such as web and mobile self-service capabilities and real-time data exchange. Critical health plan processes, including member enrollment, billing and payments, communications, and retail marketing often have been under-optimized or neglected by legacy systems, and health plans have devoted significant internal resources to cover technology gaps. In addition, healthcare reform mandates and the rise of exchanges have increased focus on carriers\u2019 retail distribution capabilities, which require additional investment.\nGovernmental oversight, punctuated with the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or PPACA, has led to an increasingly dynamic regulatory framework under which health benefits are delivered, accessed and maintained. Despite efforts to repeal and/or reform part or all of PPACA, we expect digital transformation of healthcare benefits to continue in the form of public and private exchanges - online marketplaces that allow insurance carriers to compete directly for new members. We\nexpect private exchanges will be less rigid, promoting both health and non-health benefits, with substantially fewer rules around the types of benefits offered. As medical insurance carriers continue to bolster their retail distribution capabilities, we believe they will require consolidation of technology solutions to improve operational efficiency and attract additional members through private exchanges.\nThe Benefitfocus Solutions\nWe provide a multi-tenant cloud-based benefits enrollment and management platform for employees, employers, health plans, suppliers, and brokers. The Benefitfocus Platform simplifies how organizations and individuals transact benefits.\nWe believe our solutions help employers and clients of brokers in the following important ways:\nSimplify benefits enrollment. Our solutions are designed to reduce the complexity of benefits enrollment by integrating all plan information in one place and presenting it to employees in an organized and easy-to-understand manner. Employees shop and enroll using a highly intuitive and engaging consumer-oriented interface.\nReduce cost and increase ROI. Our solutions automate the benefits management process and reduce the cost associated with clerical errors and covering ineligible employees and dependents. Our solutions also include advanced analytics and insights that enable employers and employees to quickly gather, report, and forecast benefit costs.\nAttract, retain, and motivate employees. Our solutions help employers attract, retain, and motivate top talent by delivering benefits information through a highly intuitive and engaging user interface. We believe that when employees understand the value of their benefits and have easy access to benefits, they are more likely to be satisfied with and engaged in their jobs.\nStreamline HR processes. Our solutions eliminate the time-consuming and labor-intensive, often paper-based, processes associated with managing employee benefits plans, making HR professionals more efficient. Employers and HR professionals can efficiently enroll users or update information, and communicate or make changes to plans in real-time.\nIntegrate seamlessly with related systems. Our solutions can be easily and securely integrated with a variety of related systems, including health plan membership and billing, payroll and HR, banking, and other third-party administration. We provide a network of benefit provider data exchange connections through industry standard interfaces that are configurable to accommodate a variety of needs. Our open architecture further extends our functionality by allowing third parties to develop and offer products and services on our platform. Our human capital management application programming interface, or API, replaces traditional file-based systems with an automated, real-time interface.\nPurchase non-medical benefits. Our platform includes a holistic, multidimensional marketplace whereby carriers and suppliers sell non-medical, voluntary and specialty products to employees.\nWe believe our solutions help insurance health plans and suppliers in the following important ways:\nBolster retail distribution capabilities through marketplaces. Our solutions help health insurance carriers and suppliers respond to an evolving marketplace in which retail distribution capabilities are increasingly important to attracting and retaining new members. Our platform offers health plans a lower cost direct sales channel to employer groups and individuals. We offer the ability to sell both healthcare and non-healthcare benefit products in an online shopping environment that serves as an alternative to government-sponsored public exchanges.\nAttract and maintain membership. Our solutions allow carriers to maximize sales capacity and efficiency by communicating directly with their employer customers and individual members.\nReduce administrative costs. The Benefitfocus Platform allows health plans to consolidate IT systems, automate and simplify various aspects of the benefits administration process, such as enrollment, plan changes, eligibility updates, and billing and payments, from one centralized location.\nFacilitate real-time data exchange. Our solutions simplify interactions and data exchange, and foster collaboration among carriers, suppliers, brokers, employers, employees and consumers. This allows health plans to rapidly tailor and offer new benefits packages.\nOur Growth Strategy\nWe intend to strengthen our position as a leading cloud-based benefits enrollment and management platform for employers and health plans, working closely with brokers as partners in the ecosystem. Key elements of our growth strategy include the following:\nExpand our customer base. We believe that our current customer base represents a small fraction of targeted users that could benefit from our subscription solutions. In order to reach new customers in our existing markets, we are aggressively investing in our sales and marketing resources and our channel marketing strategy, including in ways intended to expand existing relationships and foster organic growth opportunities through brokers.\nFurther develop our partner ecosystem. We believe we have a large opportunity to efficiently grow our customer base through our partners. To increase the number of consumers on our platform, we have established strong relationships with key participants in the benefits market, including, among others, SAP and SuccessFactors. We have also eliminated previous friction and improved our outreach to key constituents within the benefits industry, like brokers.\nDeepen our relationships with our existing customer base. We are deepening our employer relationships by continuing to provide a unified platform with a growing list of additional solutions to manage increasingly complex benefits processes and simplify the distribution and administration of employee benefits. We are expanding our carrier relationships through both the upsell of additional software products, increased adoption across our carriers\u2019 member populations and providing access to our multidimensional marketplace.\nExtend our suite of applications and continue our technology leadership. We are extending the number, range, and functionality of our benefits solutions. We have also extended the functionality of our products through mobile solutions. We intend to continue our collaboration with customers and partners so we can respond quickly to evolving market needs with innovative capabilities that support our leadership position.\nFacilitate the purchase of non-medical benefits. We believe we have a significant opportunity to drive higher employer placement of Benefit Catalog products and increase consumer engagement in purchasing Benefit Catalog products throughout an entire calendar year. We also believe that our current Benefit Catalog portfolio of products will grow in number as we continue to advance our multidimensional marketplace.\nTarget new markets. We believe substantial demand for our solutions exists in markets and geographies beyond our current focus. We intend to leverage opportunities we believe will arise from the complexities of changing government regulation and increased enrollment impacting both Medicare and Medicaid.\nSelectively pursue strategic acquisitions and investments. We might pursue acquisitions of, or investments in, complementary businesses and technologies that align with our overall growth strategy. We believe that a selective acquisition and investment strategy could enable us to gain new customers, accelerate our expansion into new markets, and enhance our product capabilities.\nThe Benefitfocus Portfolio of Products\nOur portfolio of products and services serve the entire benefits ecosystem; employers, health plans and brokers rely on Benefitfocus to simplify everything about benefits.\n\u2022\nFor Employers - our products and services are designed to reduce administrative burden, simplify enrollment,\u202fhelp control costs and increase workforce engagement.\n\u2022\nFor Health Plans - we deliver a seamless quote to pay experience that can help increase operational efficiency and improve customer satisfaction.\n\u2022\nFor Brokers - we offer an innovative platform designed to provide their clients with a comprehensive set of technology and services that support every aspect of their benefit programs - from plan design to employee engagement.\nProducts for Employers\nBenefitplace (formerly Benefitfocus MarketPlace) is our solution for employers that helps them optimize the design of benefits plans, reduce healthcare costs, lessen administrative complexity and empower their employees to make better, more confident benefits decisions.\n\u2022\nBenefitplace is a cloud-based benefits management portal that streamlines online enrollment, employee communication, and benefits administration.\no\nBenefitplace provides a single location for employees to manage and review their benefits and related information quickly and easily at any time.

During the year ended December 31, 2018, one customer accounted for 13% of total revenue.\nSales and Marketing\nWe sell our software solutions through our direct sales organization. Our direct sales team comprises employer-focused and health plan-focused field sales professionals who are organized primarily by geography and account size.\nWe generate customer leads, accelerate sales opportunities and build brand awareness through our marketing programs and strategic relationships. Our marketing programs target HR, benefits, and finance executives, technology professionals, key brokers, and senior business leaders. Our principal marketing programs include:\n\u2022\nuse of our website to provide application and company information, as well as learning opportunities for potential customers;\n\u2022\nsales development representatives who respond to incoming leads through digital and advertising programs and convert them into new sales opportunities;\n\u2022\nparticipation in, and sponsorship of, user conferences, executive events, trade shows and industry events, including our annual user and partner conference, One Place, and our invitation-only event for health insurance carrier executives, Health Plan Place;\n\u2022\nintegrated marketing campaigns, including direct email, online web advertising, blogs, webinars and industry reports that include original thought leadership drawn from our unique set of data; and\n\u2022\npublic relations, analyst relations and social media initiatives.\nWe also sell our software solutions through strategic partners such as SAP SE and Equifax.\nTechnology Infrastructure and Operations\nAs an enterprise cloud software vendor, we have always deployed our solutions using a SaaS model. Our customers access our software via application integrations, web browsers, and/or mobile devices, rather than by installing software on their premises. Through our multi-tenant architecture, our customers access a single software instance with multiple possible configurations enabled by our metadata-driven framework. The multi-tenant approach provides significant operating economies through aligned, shared computational services and processes as it helps us to reduce our fixed cost base and minimize unused capacity on our hardware. In addition, our software architecture gives us an advantage over legacy system vendors, who may be using a less flexible architecture that would require significant time and labor expense to address varied capability needs.\nWe host our applications and serve our customers from multiple, co-located, private cloud data centers in separate locations. We rely on third-party vendors to operate these data centers, which are designed to host mission-critical computer systems and have industry-standard measures in place to minimize service interruptions. Our technical operations staff manages the technology stacks supporting the Benefitfocus Platform and uses automated monitoring tools throughout our system to detect unusual events or malfunctions that could interfere with our customers\u2019 or partners\u2019 use of the Benefitfocus Platform. We monitor application health by verifying that all applications, interfaces and supporting middleware are operational. If our monitoring detects anomalous situations, our dedicated network operations staff respond immediately to diagnose the situation, communicate status, and resolve the matter. We take the security of our data, systems and operations very seriously, and minimize risk at every level of technology selection through software architecture, systems administration, and operational controls and procedures.\nCompliance and Certifications\nWe obtain third-party examinations of our controls relating to security. Certain examinations are conducted under Statement on Standards for Attestation Engagements, or SSAE, No. 18 (Reporting on Controls at a Service Organization). In particular, we obtain Service Organization Controls, or SOC, reports known as SOC 1 Type II and SOC 2 Type II audits that test the design and operating effectiveness of controls over a period of time. An independent auditor conducts these examinations annually and addresses, among other areas, our physical and environmental safeguards for production data centers, data availability, confidentiality, privacy, change management, and logical security. On an annual basis, a data security and HIPAA compliance risk assessment are also performed.\nOn an annual basis, we complete an independent assessment by a qualified security assessor (QSA) of compliance against the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards, or PCI-DSS, applicable to Level 1 service providers. These standards focus on application and network security controls for companies that transmit and store credit card data on behalf of clients. Benefitfocus meets PCI compliance requirements as a Level 1 service provider and submits its Report on Compliance and Attestation of Compliance documenting this assessment to the three major credit card brands annually.\nCompetition\nWhile we do not believe any single competitor offers similarly expansive benefits administration solutions, we face competition from various sources, many of which have greater resources than us. We have historically described our competition in our two market segments, employer and health plan. We believe that sources of competition encompass:\n\u2022\nERP software companies offering a cloud-based benefits administration software solution;\n\u2022\nHR outsourcing companies;\n\u2022\npayroll service providers who expanded their core payroll services to include some form of cloud-based benefits administration services;\n\u2022\ninsurance carriers that have invested in internally developed benefit management solutions;\n\u2022\nmember services companies, including those providing web-based subscriber enrollment and claims adjudication services;\n\u2022\nbrokers and consultants who have influence over benefits offerings; and\n\u2022\nvarious niche software vendors.\nWe believe that competition for benefits administration solutions is based primarily on the following factors:\n\u2022\ncapability for customization through configuration, integration, security, scalability, and reliability of applications;\n\u2022\ncompetitive and understandable pricing;\n\u2022\nbreadth and depth of application functionality;\n\u2022\naccess to broad offering of non-medical benefits;\n\u2022\nsize of customer base and level of user adoption;\n\u2022\nextensive data exchange network;\n\u2022\ncloud-based delivery model;\n\u2022\ndynamic communication capabilities with contextual media, animation, and acknowledgement tools;\n\u2022\nability to integrate with legacy enterprise infrastructures and third-party applications;\n\u2022\ndomain expertise in benefits and healthcare consumerism;\n\u2022\nextensive base of rules and event-driven benefit eligibility and enrollment;\n\u2022\naccessible on any browser or mobile device;\n\u2022\nmodern and adaptive technology platform;\n\u2022\nclearly defined implementation timeline;\n\u2022\ncustomer-branding and styling;\n\u2022\ndata exchange standardization; and\n\u2022\nability to innovate and respond to customer and legislative needs rapidly.\nWe believe that we compete effectively based upon all of these criteria, and that we are likely to continue to retain a high percentage of our customers from year to year. Nonetheless, we believe that the increasing acceptance of automated solutions in the healthcare marketplace and the adoption of more sophisticated technology and continuing legislative reform will result in increased competition, including potentially from large software companies with greater resources than ours. Other companies might develop superior or more economical service offerings that our customers could find more attractive than our offerings. Moreover, the regulatory landscape might shift in a direction that is more strategically advantageous to competitors.\nResearch and Development\nOur ability to compete depends, in large part, on our continuous commitment to rapidly introduce new applications, technologies, features, and functionality. We deliver multiple software releases per year, updating the Benefitfocus Platform to leverage advances in cloud computing, mobile applications, and data management. Our research and development team is responsible for the design and development of our applications. We follow state-of-the-art practices in software development using modern programming languages, data storage systems, and other tools. We use both commercial and open source products, following a \u201cbest tool for the job\u201d philosophy in product selection. Our software has a multi-tiered architecture that ensures flexibility to add or modify features quickly in response to changing market dynamics, customer needs, or regulatory requirements.\nOur research and development expenses were $46.2 million, $54.7 million and $47.9 million for the years December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nIntellectual Property\nWe rely on a combination of patent, trade secret, copyright, and trademark laws, license agreements, confidentiality procedures, confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements, and technical measures to protect the intellectual property used in our business. We generally enter into confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements with our associates, consultants, vendors, and customers. We also seek to control access to and distribution of our software, documentation, and other proprietary information.\nWe use numerous trademarks for our products and services, and \u201cBenefitfocus\u201d, \u201cBenefitfocus BenefitPlace\u201d, \u201cOne Place\u201d, \u201cBenefitfocus For Life\u201d, \u201c BenefitPlace\u201d, \u201cAll Your Benefits. One Place.\u201d, and \u201cAll Your Benefits. In Your Pocket.\u201d are registered marks of Benefitfocus in the United States. Through claimed common law trademark protection, we also protect other Benefitfocus marks which identify our services, and we have reserved numerous domain names, including \u201cbenefitfocus.com\u201d. We also have registered trademarks and pending trademark applications in foreign jurisdictions such as Australia, Canada, India, Israel, Ireland, New Zealand, South Africa, and the United Kingdom.\nWe have been granted seven U.S. patents and all our patents are for utility patents. Our patents provide protections up to 2034. We also have three Chinese, two Australian, two Japanese, two Taiwanese R.O.C., five Hong Kong, and one Canadian patents.\nWe also rely on certain intellectual property rights that we license from third parties. Although we believe that alternative technologies are generally available to replace such licenses, these third-party technologies may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms.\nAlthough we rely on intellectual property rights, including trade secrets, patents, copyrights, and trademarks, as well as contractual protections to establish and protect our proprietary rights, we believe that factors such as the technological and creative skills of our personnel, creation of new modules, features and functionality, and frequent enhancements to our applications are more essential to establishing and maintaining our technology leadership position.\nThe steps we have taken to protect our copyrights, trademarks, and other intellectual property may not be adequate, and the potential exists that third parties could infringe, misappropriate, or misuse our intellectual property. If this were to occur, it could harm our reputation and adversely affect our competitive position or operations. In addition, laws of other jurisdictions may not protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights from unauthorized use or disclosure in the same manner as the United States. The risk of unauthorized use of our proprietary and intellectual property rights may increase as our company expands outside of the United States.\nGovernment Regulation\nIntroduction\nThe employee benefits industry is required to comply with extensive and complex U.S. laws and regulations at the federal and state levels. Although many regulatory and governmental requirements do not directly apply to our business, our customers are required to comply with a variety of U.S. laws, and we may be impacted by these laws as a result of our contractual obligations. For many of these laws, there is little history of regulatory or judicial interpretation upon which to rely.\nChanges in Healthcare Regulation and Markets\nOur business could be affected by changes in healthcare spending. PPACA and subsequent laws and regulations regarding the market for healthcare services have changed how healthcare services are covered, delivered, and reimbursed. PPACA, as enacted, expanded coverage of uninsured individuals by requiring states to expand Medicaid coverage significantly and to establish health insurance exchanges to facilitate the purchase of health insurance policies by individuals and small employers. The law also provided subsidies to states to create non-Medicaid plans for certain low-income residents. The requirement for states to expand Medicaid was subsequently repealed, and insurers have experienced mixed results providing services through the exchanges, leading many to exit this market. Increased volatility following the repeal of the individual mandate has led to additional uncertainty in the insurance market.\nA significant goal of PPACA and subsequent reform efforts has been to move away from fee for service payments and toward capitated payments to make providers more accountable for the cost and quality of care provided. While many of the provisions of PPACA will not be directly applicable to us, PPACA, as currently implemented, might affect the business of many of our customers. Carriers and large employers might experience changes in the numbers of individuals they insure as a result of Medicaid expansion and the creation of state and national exchanges, though it is unclear how many states will decline to implement the Medicaid expansion or adopt state-specific exchanges.\nFollowing the creation of the Medicare Shared Savings Program, Medicare and many commercial third party payors began implementing accountable care models in which groups of providers known as Accountable Care Organizations (\"ACO\") assume some amount of risk for the cost of care provided to groups of individuals. Also, CMS continues to test demonstration programs to bundle acute care and post-acute care reimbursement to hold providers accountable for costs across a broader continuum of care. These reimbursement methodologies and similar programs are likely to continue and expand, both in public and commercial health plans, and will likely impact the business of our customers.\nAs has been the case since 2010, the long-term viability of PPACA remains in doubt, and we expect that the current Congress and White House will continue to seek ways to modify, repeal, or otherwise invalidate all, or certain provisions of PPACA. For instance, on January 20, 2017, President Trump issued an executive order stating that the U.S. federal government\u2019s policy is to seek the prompt repeal of PPACA, and directing the heads of all executive departments and agencies to minimize the economic and regulatory burdens of PPACA to the maximum extent permitted by law. Also, the December 2017 revisions to the tax code eliminated PPACA\u2019s individual mandate, which could serve as a basis for continued challenges to the constitutionality of the law and cause further disruption to the insurance markets. Should Congress or the courts modify, repeal, or otherwise invalidate PPACA or any parts of its provisions, the business of our customers could be substantially affected.\nRequirements Regarding the Confidentiality, Privacy and Security of Personal Information\nHIPAA and Other Privacy and Security Requirements. Numerous U.S. federal and state laws and regulations apply to the privacy and security of personal health information. In particular, regulations promulgated pursuant to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, establish privacy and security standards that limit the use and disclosure of protected health information and require the implementation of administrative, physical and technical safeguards to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, availability, and privacy of protected health information. Health plans, healthcare clearinghouses and most healthcare providers are considered \"Covered Entities\" subject to HIPAA.\nWith respect to our operations as a healthcare clearinghouse, we are directly subject to the Privacy Rule, the Security Rule and the Breach Notification Rule. In addition, our carrier customers, or payors, are considered to be Covered Entities and are required to enter into written agreements with us, known as Business Associate Agreements, under which we are considered to be a Business Associate and that require us to safeguard protected health information and restrict how we may use and disclose such information. The Privacy Rule extensively regulates the use and disclosure of protected health information by Covered Entities and their Business Associates. For example, the Privacy Rule permits Covered Entities and their Business Associates to use and disclose protected health information for treatment and to process claims for payment, but other uses and disclosures, such as marketing communications, require written authorization from the individual or must meet an exception specified under the Privacy Rule. The Privacy Rule also provides patients with rights related to understanding and controlling how their health information is used and disclosed. To the extent permitted by the Privacy Rule and our contracts with our customers, we may use and disclose protected health information to perform our services and for other limited purposes, such as creating de-identified information. Determining whether data has been sufficiently de-identified to comply with the Privacy Rule and our contractual obligations may require complex factual and statistical analyses and may be subject to interpretation. The Security Rule requires Covered Entities and their Business Associates to implement and maintain administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect the security of protected health information that is electronically transmitted or electronically stored.\nIf we are unable to properly protect the privacy and security of health information entrusted to us, we could be found to have breached our contracts with our customers. Further, if we fail to comply with the Privacy Rule, Security Rule, or Breach Notification Rule while acting as a Covered Entity or Business Associate, we could face civil penalties of up to $59,522 per violation and a maximum civil penalty of $1,785,651 in a calendar year for violations of the same requirement, in addition to criminal penalties. Recently, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office for Civil Rights, which enforces HIPAA, appears to have increased its enforcement activities. Additionally, state attorneys general may bring civil actions seeking either injunctions or damages in response to violations of HIPAA that threaten the privacy of state residents.\nThere are additional privacy and data security legal regimes at the federal and state level. For example, the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, regularly brings privacy and data enforcement actions under Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, alleging that certain activities constitute unfair or deceptive trade practices. The states have similar laws that prohibit unfair or deceptive trade practices. There are also state data security laws and state laws that regulate the use and disclosure of health information, among others. Further, by regulation, the FTC\u2019s Red Flags Rule requires some financial institutions and creditors, which may include some of our customers, to implement identity theft prevention programs to detect, prevent and mitigate identity theft in connection with customer accounts. We may be required to apply additional resources to our existing processes to assist our affected customers in complying with this rule.\nWe have implemented and maintain physical, technical and administrative safeguards, including written policies and procedures, intended to protect all personal data, including protected health information, and have processes in place to assist us in complying with all applicable laws and regulations regarding the protection of this data and properly responding to any data breaches or incidents.\nData Breach Notification Laws. There are numerous federal and state laws that generally require notice to affected individuals, regulators, and sometimes the media or credit reporting agencies in the event of a data breach impacting personal information. For example, at the federal level, the HIPAA Breach Notification Rule mandates notification of breaches affecting protected health information to affected individuals and regulators under conditions set forth in the Rule. Covered Entities must report breaches of unsecured protected health information to affected individuals without unreasonable delay, but not to exceed 60 days of discovery of the breach by a Covered Entity or its agents. Notification must also be made to HHS and, in certain circumstances involving large breaches, to the media. Business Associates must report breaches of unsecured protected health information to Covered Entities within 60 days of discovery of the breach by the Business Associate or its agents. All states, the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands have enacted data breach notification laws. While some of these breach notification laws contain an exception for entities subject to HIPAA, other laws do not, and may impose notification obligations in addition to, or inconsistent with, the HIPAA Breach Notification Rule when a data breach implicates protected health information.\nHIPAA Administrative Simplification\nHIPAA also mandated a package of interlocking administrative simplification rules to establish standards and requirements for the electronic transmission of certain healthcare claims and payment transactions. These regulations are intended to encourage electronic commerce in the healthcare industry and apply directly to Covered Entities. Some of our businesses, including our healthcare clearinghouse operations, are considered Covered Entities under HIPAA and its implementing regulations.\nTransaction Standards. The standard transaction regulations established under HIPAA, or Transaction Standards, mandate certain format and data content standards for the most common electronic healthcare transactions, using technical standards promulgated by recognized standards publishing organizations. These transactions include healthcare claims, enrollment, payment and eligibility. The Transaction Standards are applicable to that portion of our business involving the processing of healthcare transactions among payors, providers, patients and other healthcare industry constituents. Failure to comply with the Transaction Standards may subject us to civil and potentially criminal penalties and breach of contract claims. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, is responsible for enforcing the Transaction Standards.\nPayors who are unable to exchange data in the required standard formats can achieve Transaction Standards compliance by contracting with a clearinghouse to translate between standard and non-standard formats. As a result, use of a clearinghouse has allowed numerous payors to establish compliance with the Transaction Standards independently and at different times, reducing transition costs and risks. In addition, the standardization of formats and data standards envisioned by the Transaction Standards has only partially occurred. However, PPACA requires HHS to establish operating rules to promote uniformity in the implementation of each standardized electronic transaction. We cannot provide assurance regarding how the CMS will enforce the Transaction Standards. We have modified our systems and processes to implement the Transaction Standards and we continue to work with payors, healthcare information system vendors and other healthcare constituents to maintain our implementation of the Transaction Standards.\nHealth Plan and Other Entity Identifiers. HHS has promulgated regulations implementing the establishment of a unique health plan identifier, or HPID. Similar to a provider\u2019s national provider identifier, the HPID provides an identification system for health plans to use for electronic transactions. HHS has also promulgated regulations implementing another entity identifier, or OEID, that serves as an identifier for entities that are not health plans, healthcare providers or individuals. These other entities, which include third-party administrators, transaction vendors, and clearinghouses, are not required to obtain an OEID, but they could obtain and use one if they needed to be identified in standardized transactions. The implementation of the enforcement of the HPID and OEID process has been indefinitely delayed by HHS, and if implemented its impact on our business is unclear at this time.\nFinancial Services Related Laws and Rules\nFinancial services and electronic payment processing services are subject to numerous laws, regulations and industry standards, some of which might impact our operations and subject us, our vendors and our customers to liability as a result of the payment distribution and processing solutions we offer. Although we do not act as a bank, we offer solutions that involve banks, or vendors who contract with banks and other regulated providers of financial services. As a result, we might be impacted by banking and financial services industry laws, regulations and industry standards, such as licensing requirements, solvency standards, requirements to maintain the privacy and security of nonpublic personal financial information and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation deposit insurance limits. In addition, our patient billing and payment distribution and processing solutions might be impacted by payment card association operating rules, certification requirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers. If we fail to comply with applicable payment processing rules or requirements, we might be subject to fines and changes in transaction fees and may lose our ability to process credit and debit card transactions or facilitate other types of billing and payment solutions. Moreover, payment transactions processed using the Automated Clearing House Network, or ACH, are subject to network operating rules promulgated by the National Automated Clearing House Association and to various federal laws regarding such operations, including laws pertaining to electronic funds transfers, and these rules and laws might impact our billing and payment solutions. Further, our solutions might impact the ability of our payor customers to comply with state prompt payment laws. These laws require payors to pay healthcare claims meeting the statutory or regulatory definition of a \u201cclean claim\u201d within a specified time frame.\nHuman Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2020, we employed approximately 1,200 employees, who we refer to as associates. None of our associates are represented by a labor union or are covered by collective bargaining agreements. We are not involved in any material disputes with any of our associates, and we consider our current relations with our associates to be good. All of our associates are located in the United States.\nWe believe our associates are our greatest asset. We are committed to designing a culture and environment that empowers our associates to thrive in their professional and personal lives. We believe our corporate culture provides an advantage in recruiting new employees and retaining our best talent, as well as driving behaviors across our entire organization that help us succeed.\nOur mission is to improve lives with benefits. Our mission starts with our associates. We support the total wellbeing of our associates through targeted programs, products and community initiatives. Our associates have access to an innovative total rewards package, to help them to flourish, thrive and prosper.\nWe offer a package of benefits to our associates so they can engage with benefits designed to protect and improve their total wellbeing, such as:\n\u2022\nEssential core benefit offering in medical, dental and vision, with an annual contribution to the associate\u2019s health savings account and the opportunity to personalize their benefit options to meet a diverse set of needs;\n\u2022\nCompany-sponsored health and wellness programs; and\n\u2022\nA wide variety of curated voluntary benefits that help foster peace of mind.\nAssociates can develop resiliency and find support that fosters work-life balance through programs, adaptive skill-building and positive experiences, including:\nCompany-sponsored emotional health programs with caregiving support, employee assistance program and health advocacy services;\n\u2022\nA paid leave program;\n\u2022\nCompany-sponsored disability benefits; and\n\u2022\nA culture and programs designed to help associates find connection and belonging.\nAssociates can build future financial security while being equipped for growth and success, including through our 401(k) Retirement Savings Plan with Company match, an Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP), and grants of equity awards to every full-time associate.\nIn 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on our workforce. Most of our associates have worked remotely since March 2020. We responded by establishing a team charged with considering and implementing strategies and policies to support our associates in this new environment. We also communicate frequently with associates to share and reinforce governmental recommendations and guidelines for safely navigating the pandemic.\nWe have a number of resources to support associates to thrive both professionally and personally including training and development programs, leadership programs, performance management, and regular engagement surveys that encourage open-ended feedback.\nBenefitfocus is committed to providing a diverse and inclusive workplace in which equality, representation and respect create a culture of belonging. We believe our collective experiences make us stronger. We strive to be a place where everyone respects one another, regardless of national origin, race, color, gender, gender identity or expression, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, age or disability. As part of this commitment, we have established a Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging Council with a charter and executive sponsorship. We are committed to our mission to improve lives with benefits, and we are equally committed to embrace the diversity and uniqueness of everyone to move this mission forward.\nCorporate Information\nWe were incorporated in June 2000 as Benefitfocus.com, Inc., a South Carolina corporation.

    "item_1A": "Item 1A. RISK FACTORS.\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the consolidated financial statements and the related notes, before deciding to invest in shares of our common stock. If any of the following risks were to materialize, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and future growth prospects could be materially and adversely affected. In that event, the market price of our common stock could decline and you could lose part or all of your investment in our common stock.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe have had a history of losses, and we might not be able to achieve or sustain profitability.\nWe have had a history of net losses, including of $24.3 million, $45.5 million, and $52.6 million, for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. We cannot predict if we will achieve sustained profitability in the near future or at all. We expect to make significant future expenditures to develop and expand our business. In addition, as a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting, and other expenses that we would not incur as a private company. These expenditures make it harder for us to achieve and maintain future profitability. We might not achieve sufficient revenue to achieve or maintain profitability. We could incur significant losses in the future for a number of reasons, including the other risks described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and we may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications and delays and other unknown events. Accordingly, we might not be able to achieve or maintain profitability and we may incur significant losses for the foreseeable future.\nOur quarterly operating results have fluctuated in the past and might continue to fluctuate, causing the value of our common stock to decline substantially.\nOur quarterly operating results might fluctuate due to a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control. As a result, comparing our operating results on a period-to-period basis might not be meaningful. You should not rely on our past results as indicative of our future performance. Moreover, our stock price might be based on expectations of future performance that are unrealistic or that we might not meet and, if our revenue or operating results fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts, the price of our common stock could decline substantially. For example, on August 4, 2017, the first trading day after we publicly announced our operating results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2017, our stock price dropped $7.10 per share, or approximately 20.5%, to $27.50. Additionally, our stock traded at a multi-year low in March 2020 of $6.09 per share.\nOur operating results have varied in the past. In addition to other risk factors listed in this section, some of the important factors that may cause fluctuations in our quarterly operating results include:\n\u2022\nthe potential economic impact of COVID-19 on our products and services;\n\u2022\nthe extent to which our products and services achieve or maintain market acceptance, including through brokers;\n\u2022\nour ability to hire and retain qualified personnel, including the rate of expansion of our sales force;\n\u2022\nchanges in the regulatory environment related to benefits and healthcare, including in light of the Democratic party winning the U.S. presidency and control of the U.S. Senate, in addition to the House of Representatives;\n\u2022\nour ability to introduce new products and services and enhancements to our existing products and services on a timely basis;\n\u2022\nnew competitors and the introduction of enhanced products and services from competitors;\n\u2022\nthe financial condition of our current and potential customers;\n\u2022\nchanges in customer budgets and procurement policies;\n\u2022\nthe amount and timing of our investment in research and development activities;\n\u2022\ntechnical difficulties with our products or interruptions in our services;\n\u2022\nregulatory compliance costs;\n\u2022\nthe timing, size, and integration success of potential future acquisitions; and\n\u2022\nunforeseen expenses, including stockholder activist, litigation, and settlement costs.\nIn addition, a significant portion of our operating expense is relatively fixed in nature, and planned expenditures are based in part on expectations regarding future revenue. Accordingly, unexpected revenue shortfalls might decrease our gross margins and could cause significant changes in our operating results from quarter to quarter. If this occurs, the trading price of our common stock could fall substantially, either suddenly or over time.\nBecause we recognize revenue and expense relating to monthly subscriptions and professional services over varying periods, downturns or upturns in sales are not immediately reflected in full in our operating results.\nAs a SaaS company, under ASC 606, we recognize our subscription revenue monthly for the term of our contracts and therefore a shortfall in demand for our software solutions and professional services or a decline in new or renewed contracts in any one quarter might not significantly reduce our revenue for that quarter, but could negatively affect our revenue in future quarters. Accordingly, the effect of significant downturns in new or renewed sales of our products and services might not be reflected in full in our results of operations until future periods.\nOur revenue recognition model also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue through additional sales in any period, because revenue from new customers has to be recognized over the applicable term of the contracts.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic could have an adverse impact on our business and the duration and extent to which the pandemic will impact our future financial performance remains uncertain.\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization classified the COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic, which resulted in authorities implementing numerous measures to contain the virus, including travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders, and business limitations and shutdowns. Since then, the COVID-19 pandemic has rapidly spread across the globe, and more importantly for our business across the United States, resulting in significant financial volatility, uncertainty, and economic disruption.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic could have a continued adverse impact on our business and future financial performance. In response, in 2020, we took several measures to contain costs and preserve our liquidity profile, including, among other things, implementing our previously reported restructuring plan and executive compensation and Board of Director compensation reductions. We also took precautionary measures to help ensure the safety and well-being of our employees and customers, including implementing a mandatory work-from-home policy, and establishing a COVID-19 Resource Center for our customers and funds to help support our own at-risk employees and their families. We expect our workforce to continue to remotely for a significant portion of 2021.\nThe ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and financial results remains uncertain and depends on future developments, including, among other things, the duration and spread of the outbreak, its severity, the actions taken by governments and authorities to contain the virus or treat its impact, how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume, the impact of the pandemic on our employees, including key personnel, the impact of business disruptions on our customers and the resulting impact on their demand for our products and services, layoffs by our employer customers, our customers\u2019 ability to pay for our products and services, and our ability to provide services to individuals. Even after the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided, we may continue to experience\nmaterially adverse impacts to our business as a result of its global economic impact, including as a result of any recession that might occur. If we are unable to successfully respond to and manage the ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the resulting responses to it, our business, financial condition, and results of operation could continue to be adversely impacted.\nOur business could be negatively affected as a result of the actions of activist stockholders.\nProxy contests and other actions by activist stockholders have been waged against many companies in our industry over the last several years. Activist stockholders might agitate, either publicly or privately, for changes to a company\u2019s board of directors, management, structure, spend or strategic direction, among other things. Such actions might cause significant disruption to a company\u2019s operations and cause a company to expend a significant amount of time and resources in responding to their requests.\nRecently, we have engaged in extensive dialogue with an activist stockholder. These discussions resulted in the expenditure of significant time and energy by management and our Board of Directors and required dedication by the Company of significant resources. We have undertaken, and will continue to implement, several initiatives in order to enhance our corporate governance, improve our financial flexibility, bolster our balance sheet and strengthen our leadership team, but there is no assurance that we will achieve these goals, or that doing so will decrease the likelihood of activist stockholder engagement in the future.\nIf faced with a proxy contest or other activist stockholder request or action in the future, we might not be able or willing to respond successfully to the contest, action, or request, which could be significantly disruptive to our business. Even if we are successful, our business could be adversely affected by any proxy contest or activist stockholder request or action involving us because:\n\u2022\nresponding to proxy contests and other actions by activist stockholders can be costly and time-consuming, disrupting operations and diverting the attention of management and employees, and can lead to uncertainty\u037e\n\u2022\nperceived uncertainties as to the future direction of the Company or its business might result in the loss of potential acquisitions, collaborations or in-licensing opportunities, and might make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners\u037e and\n\u2022\nif individuals are elected to our Board of Directors with a specific agenda, it might adversely affect our ability to effectively implement our strategic plan in a timely manner and create additional value for our stockholders.\nAny such activist stockholder contests, actions or requests, or the mere public presence of activist stockholders among our stockholder base, could cause the market price for our ordinary shares to experience periods of significant volatility.\nWe depend on our senior management team, and the loss of one or more key associates or an inability to attract and retain highly skilled associates could adversely affect our business.\nOur success depends largely upon the continued services of our key executive officers and other associates. We also rely on our leadership team in the areas of research and development, marketing, services, finance, and general and administrative functions, and on mission-critical individual contributors in sales and research and development. From time to time, there may be changes in our executive management team resulting from the hiring or departure of executives, which could disrupt our business. For example: in 2020, Ray August stepped down as president and chief executive officer and was replaced by Stephen Swad, our then-current chief financial officer, and Alpana Wegner, our then-current vice president, corporate controller, was appointed as our chief financial officer. Additionally in 2020, our former Chief Technology Officer resigned for personal reasons. In 2021, the Company announced that Mason Holland would step down from his position as Executive Chairman and a member of the Board, to\nbe effective at the Company\u2019s 2021 annual stockholders meeting. The loss of one or more of our executive officers or key associates could have a serious adverse effect on our business.\nTo continue to execute our growth strategy, we also must attract and retain highly skilled personnel. Competition is intense for salespeople and for engineers with high levels of experience in designing and developing software and Internet-related services. We might not be successful in maintaining our unique culture and continuing to attract and retain qualified personnel. We have from time to time in the past experienced, and we expect to continue to experience in the future, difficulty in hiring and retaining highly skilled personnel with appropriate qualifications. The pool of qualified personnel with SaaS experience and/or experience working with the benefits market is limited overall and specifically in Charleston, South Carolina, where our principal office is located. In addition, many of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater resources than we have and are located in geographic areas, like Silicon Valley, that may attract more qualified technology workers.\nIn addition, in making employment decisions, particularly in the Internet and high-technology industries, job candidates often consider the value of the equity awards they are to receive in connection with their employment. Volatility in the price of our stock might, therefore, adversely affect our ability to attract or retain highly skilled personnel. Furthermore, the requirement to expense certain stock awards might discourage us from granting the size or type of stock awards that job candidates require to join our company. If we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel, our business and future growth prospects could be severely harmed.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry, and if we are not able to compete effectively, our business and operating results will be harmed.\nThe benefits management software market is highly competitive and is likely to attract increased competition, which could make it hard for us to succeed. Small, specialized providers continue to become more sophisticated and effective. In addition, large, well-financed, and technologically sophisticated software companies might focus more on our market. The size and financial strength of these entities is increasing as a result of continued consolidation in both the IT and healthcare industries. We expect large integrated software companies to become more active in our market, both through acquisitions and internal investment. In addition, insurance carriers may seek to bring certain of their benefits software solutions in-house, whether through acquisitions or internal investment. For example, Aetna, a customer of ours, owns bswift, a provider of insurance exchange technology solutions and benefits administration technology solutions and services. If Aetna were to decide to use bswift\u2019s solution in place of any portion of the solutions we currently provide to them, then our business and operating results could be materially and adversely affected. As costs fall and technology improves, increased market saturation might change the competitive landscape in favor of our competitors.\nSome of our current large competitors have greater name recognition, longer operating histories, and significantly greater resources than we do. As a result, our competitors might be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards, or customer requirements. In addition, current and potential competitors have established, and might in the future establish, cooperative relationships with vendors of complementary products, technologies, or services to increase the availability of their products in the marketplace. Accordingly, new competitors or alliances might emerge that have greater market share, a larger customer base, more widely adopted proprietary technologies, greater marketing expertise, greater financial resources, and larger sales forces than we have, which could put us at a competitive disadvantage. Further, in light of these advantages, even if our products and services are more effective than those of our competitors, current or potential customers might accept competitive offerings in lieu of purchasing our offerings. Increased competition is likely to result in pricing pressures, which could negatively impact our sales, profitability, or market share. In addition to new niche vendors, who offer standalone products and services, we face competition from existing enterprise vendors, including those currently focused on software solutions that have information systems in place with potential customers in our target market. These existing enterprise vendors might promise products or services that offer ease of integration with existing systems and which leverage\nexisting vendor relationships. In addition, large insurance carriers often have internal technology staffs and proprietary software for benefits management, making them less likely to buy our solutions.\nThe market for our products and services is immature and volatile, and if it does not develop or if it develops more slowly than we expect, the growth of our business will be harmed.\nThe cloud-based benefits management software market is relatively new and unproven, and it is uncertain whether it will achieve and sustain high levels of demand and market acceptance. Our success will depend to a substantial extent on the willingness of employers, carriers, consumers and brokers to increase their use of benefits management software. Many employers and carriers have invested substantial personnel and financial resources to integrate internally developed solutions or traditional enterprise software into their businesses for benefits management, and therefore might be reluctant or unwilling to migrate to our cloud-based solutions, including Benefit Catalog (formerly BenefitsPlace). Furthermore, some businesses might be reluctant to use cloud-based solutions because they have concerns about the security of their data and the reliability of the technology delivery model associated with these solutions. If employers, carriers, consumers and brokers do not perceive the benefits of our solutions, then our market might not develop at all, or it might develop more slowly than we expect, either of which could significantly adversely affect our operating results. In addition, we might make errors in predicting and reacting to relevant business trends, which could harm our business. If any of these risks occur, it could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe SaaS pricing model is evolving and our failure to manage its evolution and demand could lead to lower than expected revenue and profit.\nWe derive most of our revenue growth from subscription offerings and, specifically, SaaS offerings. This business model depends heavily on achieving economies of scale because the initial upfront investment is costly and the associated revenue is recognized on a ratable basis. If we fail to achieve appropriate economies of scale or if we fail to manage or anticipate the evolution and demand of the SaaS pricing model, then our business and operating results could be adversely affected.\nIf we do not continue to innovate and provide products and services that are useful to consumers, employers, insurance carriers, and brokers and provide high quality support services, we might not remain competitive, and our revenue and operating results could suffer.\nOur success depends in part on providing products and services that consumers, employers, insurance carriers, and brokers will use to manage benefits. We have refocused on customer-driven innovation and must continue to invest significant resources in research and development in order to enhance our existing products and services and introduce new high-quality products and services that customers will want. If we are unable to predict user preferences or industry changes, or if we are unable to modify our products and services on a timely basis, we might lose customers. Our operating results would also suffer if our innovations are not responsive to the needs of our customers, are not appropriately timed with market opportunity, or are not effectively brought to market. As technology continues to develop, our competitors might be able to offer results that are, or that are perceived to be, substantially similar to or better than those generated by us. This would force us to compete on additional product and service attributes and to expend significant resources in order to remain competitive.\nIn addition, we may experience difficulties with software development, industry standards, design, or marketing that could delay or prevent our development, introduction, or implementation of new solutions and enhancements. The introduction of new solutions by competitors, the emergence of new industry standards, or the development of entirely new technologies to replace existing offerings could render our existing or future solutions obsolete.\nOur success also depends on providing high quality support services to resolve any issues related to our products and services. High quality education and customer support is important for the successful marketing and sale of our products and services and for the renewal of existing customers. If we do not\nhelp our customers quickly resolve issues and provide effective ongoing support, our ability to sell additional products and services to existing customers would suffer and our reputation with existing or potential customers would be harmed.\nIf we are unable to retain our existing customers, our revenue and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nWe sell our products and services pursuant to agreements that are generally one to three years for employers and three to five years for carriers. While our employer contracts generally automatically renew, our carrier customers have no obligation to renew their contracts after their contract period expires, and these contracts might not be renewed on the same or on more profitable terms if at all. Additionally, some of our carrier customers are able to terminate their respective contracts without cause or for convenience, although generally our carrier contracts are only cancellable by the carrier in an instance of our uncured breach. As a result, our ability to grow depends in part on the continuance and renewal of our carrier contracts. We have experienced increased customer non-renewal over the past year or so. We cannot accurately predict future trends in customer renewals, and our customers\u2019 renewal rates may decline or fluctuate because of several factors, including their level of satisfaction or dissatisfaction with our services, the cost of our services, the cost of services offered by our competitors, consolidations or reductions in our customers\u2019 spending levels. If our carrier customers terminate or do not renew their contracts for our services, renew on less favorable terms, or do not purchase additional functionality or products, our revenue may grow more slowly than expected or decline, and our profitability and gross margins may be harmed.\nA significant amount of our revenue is derived from our largest customers, and any reduction in revenue from any of these customers would reduce our revenue and net income.\nOur ten largest customers by revenue accounted for approximately 34%, 37% and 42% of our consolidated revenue in each of 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. No customer accounted for more than 10% of our revenue in 2019 or 2020. One customer accounted for approximately 13% of our revenue in 2018. If any of our large customers or strategic partners decides not to renew its contracts with us, or to renew on less favorable terms, our business, revenue, reputation, and our ability to obtain new customers could be materially and adversely affected.\nEconomic or geopolitical uncertainties or downturns in the general economy or the industries in which our customers operate could disproportionately affect the demand for our solutions and negatively impact our results of operations.\nGeneral worldwide economic and geopolitical conditions have experienced significant downturns in the past, and market volatility and uncertainty remain widespread, including as a result of the coronavirus and the 2020 presidential election. All of this makes it extremely difficult for our customers and us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities. In addition, these conditions could cause our customers or prospective customers to decrease headcount, benefits, or HR budgets, which could decrease corporate spending on our products and services, resulting in delayed and lengthened sales cycles, a decrease in new customer acquisition, and/or loss of customers. Furthermore, during challenging economic times, our customers may have difficulty gaining timely access to sufficient credit or obtaining credit on reasonable terms, which could impair their ability to make timely payments to us and adversely affect our revenue. If that were to occur, our financial results could be harmed. Further, challenging economic conditions might impair the ability of our customers to pay for the products and services they already have purchased from us and, as a result, our write-offs of accounts receivable could increase. For example, during 2020 we experienced an increase in early termination and credit requests from our customers. We cannot predict the timing, strength, or duration of any economic slowdown or recovery. If the condition of the general economy or markets in which we operate worsens, our business could be harmed.\nFailure to adequately and effectively expand our direct sales force will impede our growth.\nWe believe that our future growth will in part depend on the development of our direct sales force and its ability to obtain new customers and to expand and further develop our existing customer base. Identifying and recruiting qualified personnel and training them in the use of our software requires significant time, expense, and attention. It can take six months or longer before a new sales representative is fully trained and productive. Our business may be adversely affected if our efforts to expand, train and retrain our direct sales force do not generate a corresponding increase in revenue. For example, reductions of our salesforce in 2016, 2018 and 2020, among other factors, negatively impacted sales, and as a result, revenue going forward. In particular, if we are unable to hire, develop and retrain sufficient numbers of productive direct sales personnel or if new direct sales personnel are unable to achieve desired productivity levels in a reasonable period of time, sales of our products and services will suffer and our growth will be impeded.\nOur growth depends in part on the success of our strategic relationships with third parties, including brokers.\nIn order to grow our business, we anticipate that we will continue to depend on our relationships with third parties including resellers such as SAP SE, and other referral sources such as brokers, consultants, specialty benefits providers, insurance carriers, technology and content providers, administrative service providers and third-party system integrators. Identifying partners, negotiating and documenting relationships with them, and developing referral sources requires significant time and resources. In the first quarter of 2019, Mercer sold all of its Benefitfocus stock and we amended our commercial relationship with Mercer to better align with our strategic priorities and current trends in the marketplace. Our revised commercial agreement with them led to a reduction in our revenue from the relationship in 2019 and 2020, and we believe this trend will continue in 2021. Our competitors might be effective in providing incentives to third parties to favor their products or services or to prevent or reduce subscriptions to our products and services. Acquisitions of our partners by our competitors could result in a decrease in the number of our current and potential customers, as our partners may no longer facilitate the adoption of our applications by potential customers. If we are unsuccessful in establishing or maintaining our relationships with third parties, our ability to compete in the marketplace or to grow our revenue could be impaired and our operating results may suffer. Even if we are successful, we cannot assure you that these relationships will result in increased customer use of our applications or increased revenue.\nIf the number of individuals covered by our employer and carrier customers decreases or the number of products or services to which our employer and carrier customers subscribe or their employees purchase decreases, our revenue will decrease.\nUnder most of our customer contracts, we base our fees on the number of individuals to whom our customers provide benefits and the number of products or services subscribed to by our customers or purchased by their employees. Many factors may lead to a decrease in the number of individuals covered by our customers and the number of products or services subscribed to by our customers, including:\n\u2022\nlayoffs by our customers or affecting our customers, in response to the COVID pandemic or otherwise;\n\u2022\nfailure of our customers to adopt or maintain effective business practices;\n\u2022\nchanges in the nature or operations of our customers;\n\u2022\ngovernment regulations; and\n\u2022\nincreased competition or other changes in the benefits marketplace.\nIf the number of individuals covered by our customers or the number of products or services subscribed to by our customers decreases for any reason, our revenue will likely decrease and could affect the contractual minimums for renewals in future periods. For example, during 2020, we\nexperienced an increase in early termination and credit requests. Additionally, in 2020 revenue from some health plan customers was protected from decreases in the number of covered employees because it was based on contractual minimums, which might be renewed at lower levels in future periods.\nFailure to manage our continued growth effectively could increase our expenses, decrease our revenue, and prevent us from implementing our business strategy.\nWe have experienced growth in the past and anticipate future growth, which could put a strain on our business. To manage our anticipated future growth effectively, we must continue to maintain and enhance our IT infrastructure, financial and accounting systems, and controls. We also must attract, train, and retain a significant number of qualified sales and marketing personnel, customer support personnel, professional services personnel, software engineers, technical personnel, and management personnel. Failure to effectively manage our anticipated future growth could lead us to over-invest or under-invest in development and operations, result in weaknesses in our infrastructure, systems, or controls, give rise to operational mistakes, losses, loss of productivity or business opportunities, and result in loss of employees and reduced productivity of remaining employees. Our anticipated future growth could require significant capital expenditures and might divert financial resources from other projects such as the development of new products and services. If our management is unable to effectively manage our anticipated future growth, our expenses might increase more than expected, our revenue could decline or might grow more slowly than expected, and we might be unable to implement our business strategy. The quality of our products and services might suffer, which could negatively affect our reputation and harm our ability to retain and attract customers.\nIf we fail to maintain awareness of our brand cost-effectively, our business might suffer.\nWe believe that maintaining awareness of our brand in a cost-effective manner is critical to continuing the widespread acceptance of our existing solutions and is an important element in attracting new customers. Furthermore, we believe that the importance of brand recognition will increase as competition in our market increases. Successful promotion of our brand will depend largely on the effectiveness of our marketing efforts and on our ability to provide reliable and useful services at competitive prices. Our efforts to build, maintain and market changes to our brand nationally have involved significant expenses. Brand promotion activities may not yield increased revenue, and even if they do, any increased revenue may not offset the expenses we incur in maintaining our brand. If we fail to successfully maintain our brand, or incur substantial expenses in an unsuccessful attempt to maintain our brand, we may fail to attract enough new customers or retain our existing customers to the extent necessary to realize a sufficient return on our brand-building efforts, and our business could suffer.\nWe might not be able to utilize a significant portion of our net operating loss or other tax credit carryforwards, which could adversely affect our profitability.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards due to prior period losses, which began expiring unutilized in 2020 and will continue expiring through 2039 if not utilized. We also have South Carolina jobs tax credit and headquarters tax credit carryforwards, some of which have expired unutilized. The tax credit carryforwards that expire unused are unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities, which could adversely affect our profitability.\nIn addition, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, our ability to utilize net operating loss carryforwards or other tax attributes in any taxable year may be limited if we experience an \u201cownership change\u201d. A Section 382 \u201cownership change\u201d generally occurs if one or more stockholders or groups of stockholders who own at least 5% of our stock increase their ownership by more than 50 percentage points over their lowest ownership percentage within a rolling three-year period. Similar rules might apply under state tax laws. Future issuances of our stock could cause an \u201cownership change\u201d. It is possible that an ownership change, or any future ownership change, could have a material effect on the use of our net operating loss carryforwards or other tax attributes, which could adversely affect our profitability.\nWe might be unable to adequately protect, and we might incur significant costs in enforcing, our intellectual property and other proprietary rights.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to enforce our intellectual property and other proprietary rights. We rely on a combination of trademark, trade secret, copyright, patent, and unfair competition laws, as well as license and access agreements and other contractual provisions, to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights. In addition, we attempt to protect our intellectual property and proprietary information by requiring employees and consultants to enter into confidentiality, noncompetition, and assignment of inventions agreements. Our attempts to protect our intellectual property might be challenged by others or invalidated through administrative process or litigation. While we have a number of patents granted in the United States and other jurisdictions including China, Japan, Australia, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Canada, we might not be able to obtain meaningful patent protection for our software. In addition, if any patents are issued in the future, they might not provide us with any competitive advantages, or might be successfully challenged by third parties. Agreement terms that address non-competition are difficult to enforce in many jurisdictions and might not be enforceable in certain cases. To the extent that our intellectual property and other proprietary rights are not adequately protected, third parties might gain access to our proprietary information, develop and market products or services similar to ours, or use trademarks similar to ours, each of which could materially harm our business. Existing U.S. federal and state intellectual property laws offer only limited protection. Moreover, the laws of other countries in which we might in the future conduct operations or contract for services might afford little or no effective protection of our intellectual property. The failure to adequately protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights could materially harm our business.\nIn addition, if we resort to legal proceedings to enforce our intellectual property rights or to determine the validity and scope of the intellectual property or other proprietary rights of others, the proceedings could be burdensome and expensive, even if we were to prevail. Any litigation that is necessary in the future could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition.\nWe might be sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights.\nThe software and Internet industries are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents, trademarks, and copyrights and by frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. We have received in the past, and might receive in the future, communications from third parties claiming that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of others. Our technologies might not be able to withstand any third-party claims or rights against their use. Any intellectual property claims, with or without merit, could be time-consuming and expensive to resolve, divert management attention from executing our business plan, and require us to pay monetary damages or enter into royalty or licensing agreements. In addition, many of our contracts contain warranties with respect to intellectual property rights, and most require us to indemnify our clients for third-party intellectual property infringement claims, which would increase the cost to us of an adverse ruling on such a claim.\nMoreover, any settlement or adverse judgment resulting from such a claim could require us to pay substantial amounts of money or obtain a license to continue to use the software or information that is the subject of the claim, or otherwise restrict or prohibit our use of it. We might not be able to obtain a license on commercially reasonable terms, if at all, from third parties asserting an infringement claim; we might not be able to develop alternative technology on a timely basis, if at all; and we might not be able to obtain a license to use a suitable alternative technology to permit us to continue offering, and our clients to continue using, our affected services. Accordingly, an adverse determination could prevent us from offering our services to others.\nAny future litigation against us could be costly and time-consuming to defend.\nWe may become subject, from time to time, to legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business such as claims brought by our clients in connection with commercial disputes, employment claims made by our current or former associates, or purported securities class actions. Litigation might result in substantial costs and may divert management\u2019s attention and resources, which might seriously harm our business, overall financial condition, and operating results. Insurance might not cover such claims, might not provide sufficient payments to cover all the costs to resolve one or more such claims, and might not continue to be available on terms acceptable to us. A claim brought against us that is uninsured or underinsured could result in unanticipated costs, thereby reducing our operating results and leading analysts or potential investors to reduce their expectations of our performance, which could reduce the trading price of our stock.\nAcquisitions could prove difficult to integrate, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value, and adversely affect our operating results and the value of our common stock.\nAs part of our business strategy, we might acquire, enter into joint ventures with, or make investments in complementary companies, services, and technologies in the future. For example, in February 2019, we acquired certain assets of Connecture, Inc. We spent considerable time, effort, and money pursuing this acquisition, our first in years, and need now to continue to successfully integrate it into our business. Acquisitions and investments involve numerous risks, including:\n\u2022\ndifficulties in identifying and acquiring products, technologies or businesses that will help our business;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in integrating operations, technologies, services and personnel;\n\u2022\ndiversion of financial and managerial resources from existing operations;\n\u2022\nrisk of entering new markets in which we have little to no experience; and\n\u2022\ndelays in customer purchases due to uncertainty and the inability to maintain relationships with customers of the acquired businesses.\nIf we fail to properly evaluate acquisitions or investments, we might not achieve the anticipated benefits of any such acquisitions, we might incur costs in excess of what we anticipate, and management resources and attention might be diverted from other necessary or valuable activities.\nFuture sales to customers outside the United States or with international operations might expose us to risks inherent in international sales which, if realized, could adversely affect our business.\nAn element of our growth strategy is to expand internationally. Operating in international markets requires significant resources and management attention and will subject us to regulatory, economic, and political risks that are different from those in the United States. Because of our limited experience with international operations, our international expansion efforts might not be successful in creating demand for our products and services outside of the United States or in effectively selling our solutions in the international markets we enter. In addition, we will face risks in doing business internationally that could adversely affect our business, including:\n\u2022\nunstable regional political and economic conditions, such as those caused by statements and actions by the current U.S. presidential administration and the U.K. exit from the European Union;\n\u2022\nthe need to localize and adapt our solutions for specific countries, including translation into foreign languages and associated expenses;\n\u2022\ndata privacy and security laws, such as the European General Data Protection Regulation and data localization laws that require data to be stored and processed in a designated territory;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations;\n\u2022\ndifferent pricing environments, longer sales cycles and longer accounts receivable payment cycles and collections issues;\n\u2022\nnew and different sources of competition;\n\u2022\nweaker protection for intellectual property and other legal rights than in the United States and practical difficulties in enforcing intellectual property and other rights outside of the United States;\n\u2022\nlaws and business practices favoring local competitors;\n\u2022\ncompliance challenges related to the complexity of multiple, conflicting and changing governmental laws and regulations, including employment, tax, privacy, and data protection laws and regulations;\n\u2022\nincreased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on the transfer of funds; and\n\u2022\nadverse tax consequences.\nIf we denominate our international contracts in local currencies, fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies might impact our operating results when translated into U.S. dollars.\nChanges in and interpretations of accounting principles and their implementation could have an adverse impact on our reported financial results.\nWe prepare our financial statements in accordance with GAAP. These rules are subject to interpretation by the SEC and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting principles. Changes in these rules or their interpretation could have a negative impact on our reported financial results and may retroactively affect previously reported transactions. For example, we incurred considerable cost and effort to implement the new revenue and lease standards in 2018 and 2019.\nImplementation of these new standards, and any future accounting pronouncements, implementation guidelines, or interpretations, could have an adverse impact on our reported financial results, require that we make significant changes to our systems, processes and controls, or the way we conduct our business. In addition, we have expended and might in the future expend considerable effort and resources implementing accounting updates, which in and of itself could have negative impact on our results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Products and Services Offerings\nThe breach or failure of our security measures, unauthorized access to or disclosure of customers\u2019 or consumers\u2019 data, or disruption of our products or services caused by security breaches or other incidents may result in our products and services being perceived as unsecure, cause customers and consumers to curtail or stop using our products and services, and cause us to incur significant liabilities.\nOur products and services involve the storage and transmission of customers\u2019 and consumers\u2019 confidential information, which may include sensitive individually identifiable information that is subject to stringent legal, regulatory, or contractual obligations. Because of the sensitivity of this information, our privacy and security measures related to our products and service offerings, including the security features of our software, are very important. Although we have privacy and security measures in place designed to protect customers\u2019 and consumers\u2019 data and our systems, techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems and data change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target. It is also possible that, due to the surreptitious nature of certain data breaches and other incidents, they may remain undetected for an extended period, which may exacerbate harm to the company. We cannot ensure that our measures will not be breached or otherwise\nfail to protect confidential information or prevent disruption of our products and services, including as a result of inadvertent disclosures through technological or human error (including employee or service provider error), malfeasance, hacking, ransomware, social engineering (including phishing schemes), computer viruses, malware, or otherwise. Unauthorized individuals may acquire or obtain unauthorized access to our customers\u2019 or consumers\u2019 confidential information (including medical, financial or other personal information). Data breaches, failures of our privacy or security measures, inadvertent disclosures, disruptions of our products and services, and other incidents could result in serious harm to our reputation, our business could suffer, and we could incur serious liability and other expenses related to litigation (including damages associated with breach-of-contract claims and consumer litigation), penalties for violation of applicable laws or regulations, costly litigation or government investigations, and remediation efforts to prevent future occurrences.\nWe rely on various parties (including as users of our products, services, and systems), such as employers\u2019 HR departments, carriers, service providers, and consumers themselves for key services and activities that impact the security of our products, services, and systems and the privacy and security of data and information accessible within them, such as data hosting and administration of enrollment, consumer status changes, claims, and billing. These individuals and organizations may, for example, experience data breaches or cause unauthorized access to or disclosure of information. Our customers may authorize or enable third parties to access their information and data that is stored on our systems. Because we do not determine such access, we cannot ensure the complete security, confidentiality, integrity, or availability of such data in our systems.\nPrivacy and security incidents are not uncommon in our industry due to the nature of our industry\u2019s services, the high volume of sensitive information involved, and the desirability of that information to bad actors. Incidents involving phishing, hacking, and misdirected communications containing sensitive information can and do occur. Customers and end-users of our industry\u2019s products and services are also the source of privacy and security incidents, sometimes due to failures to adhere to appropriate privacy and data security practices. For example, employers sometimes fail to terminate the account credentials of former employees or permit current employees to share account credentials.\nLike others in our industry, we experience cyber-attacks and other attempts to disrupt or gain unauthorized access to our systems on a regular basis. When we become aware of privacy or security incidents, we work diligently to address them, including by working to terminate unauthorized or inappropriate access and implementing additional measures, training, and providing guidance to customers and end users in order to avoid the reoccurrence and future incidents. Although to date privacy and security incidents have not been material, they could expose us to significant expense, legal liability, and harm to our reputation, which might result in loss of business.\nOur failure or failure by our customers to obtain proper permissions and waivers might result in claims against us or may limit or prevent our use of data, which could harm our business.\nWe require our customers to provide necessary notices and to obtain necessary permissions and waivers for use and disclosure of information on the Benefitfocus Platform, and we require contractual assurances from them that they have done so and will do so. If, however, despite these requirements and contractual obligations, our customers or consumers do not obtain necessary permissions and waivers, then our use and disclosure of information that we receive from them or on their behalf might be limited or prohibited by state or federal privacy laws or other laws. This could impair our functions, processes and databases that reflect, contain, or are based upon such data and might prevent use of such data. In addition, this could interfere with, or prevent creation or use of, rules, analyses, or other data-driven activities that benefit us and our business. Moreover, we might be subject to claims or liability for use or disclosure of information by reason of lack of valid notices, agreements, permissions or waivers. These claims or liabilities could subject us to unexpected costs and adversely affect our operating results.\nOur proprietary software might not operate properly, which could damage our reputation, give rise to claims against us, or divert application of our resources from other purposes, any of which could harm our business and operating results.\nProprietary software development is time-consuming, expensive, and complex. Unforeseen difficulties can arise. We might encounter technical obstacles, and it is possible that we discover problems that prevent our proprietary applications from operating properly. If they do not function reliably or fail to achieve customer expectations in terms of performance, customers could assert liability claims against us and/or attempt to cancel their contracts with us. This could damage our reputation and impair our ability to attract or maintain customers.\nMoreover, benefits management software as complex as ours has in the past contained, and may in the future contain, or develop, undetected defects or errors. Material performance problems or defects in our products and services might arise in the future. Errors might result from the interface of our services with legacy systems and data, which we did not develop and the function of which is outside of our control. Defects or errors might arise in our existing or new software or service processes. Because changes in employer, carrier, and legal requirements and practices relating to benefits are frequent, we are continuously discovering defects and errors in our software and service processes compared against these requirements and practices. Undiscovered vulnerabilities could expose our software to unscrupulous third parties who develop and deploy software programs that could attack our software or result in unauthorized access to, acquisition of, or disclosure of customer data. Defects and errors and any failure by us to identify and address them could result in loss of revenue or market share, liability to customers or others, failure to achieve market acceptance or expansion, diversion of development and other resources, injury to our reputation, and increased service and maintenance costs. Defects or errors in our product or service processes might discourage existing or potential customers from purchasing services from us. Correction of defects or errors could prove to be impossible or impracticable. The costs incurred in correcting any defects or errors or in responding to resulting claims or liability might be substantial and could adversely affect our operating results.\nIn addition, customers that rely on our products and services to collect, manage, and report benefits data might have a greater sensitivity to service errors and security vulnerabilities than customers of software products in general. We market and sell services that, among other things, provide information to assist care providers in tracking and treating ill patients. Any operational delay in or failure of our software service processes might result in the disruption of patient care and could cause harm to our business and operating results.\nOur customers might assert claims against us in the future alleging that they suffered damages due to a defect, error, or other failure of our product or service processes. A product liability claim or errors or omissions claim could subject us to significant legal defense costs and adverse publicity regardless of the merits or eventual outcome of such a claim.\nVarious events could interrupt customers\u2019 access to the Benefitfocus Platform, exposing us to significant costs.\nThe ability to access the Benefitfocus Platform is critical to our customers. Our operations and facilities are vulnerable to interruption and/or damage from a number of sources, many of which are beyond our control, including, without limitation: (i) power loss and telecommunications failures, (ii) fire, flood, hurricane, and other natural disasters, (iii) software and hardware errors, failures or crashes in our own systems or in other systems, (iv) computer viruses, denial-of-service attacks, hacking and similar disruptive problems in our own systems and in other systems, and (v) civil unrest, war, and/or terrorism. We have implemented various measures to protect against interruptions of customers\u2019 access to our platform. If customers\u2019 access is interrupted because of problems in the operation of our facilities, we could be exposed to significant claims by customers, particularly if the access interruption is associated with problems in the timely delivery of funds due to customers or medical information relevant to patient care. Our plans for disaster recovery and business continuity rely on third-party providers of related services. If those vendors fail us at a time when our systems are not operating correctly, we could incur a loss of revenue and liability for failure to fulfill our obligations. Any significant instances of system downtime could negatively affect our reputation and ability to retain customers and sell our services, which would adversely impact our revenue.\nIn addition, retention and availability of patient care and physician reimbursement data are subject to federal and state laws governing record retention, accuracy, and access. Some laws impose obligations on our customers and on us to produce information for third parties and to amend or expunge data at their direction. Our failure to meet these obligations might result in liability, which could increase our costs and reduce our operating results.\nWe rely on data center providers, Internet infrastructure, bandwidth providers, third-party computer hardware and software, other third parties, and our own systems for providing services to our customers, and any failure or interruption in the services provided by these third parties or our own systems could expose us to litigation and negatively impact our relationships with customers, adversely affecting our brand and our business.\nWe serve our customers primarily from three data centers, located in Raleigh, North Carolina, Charlotte, North Carolina, and Ashburn, Virginia. While we control and have access to our servers, we do not control the operation of these facilities. The owners of our data center facilities have no obligation to renew their agreements with us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. If we are unable to renew these agreements on commercially reasonable terms, or if one of our data center operators is acquired, we may be required to transfer our servers and other infrastructure to new data center facilities, and we may incur significant costs and possible service interruption in connection with doing so. Problems faced by our third-party data center locations, with the telecommunications network providers with whom we or they contract, or with the systems by which our telecommunications providers allocate capacity among their customers, including us, could adversely affect the experience of our customers. Our third-party data centers operators could decide to close their facilities without adequate notice. In addition, any financial difficulties, such as bankruptcy faced by our third-party data centers operators or any of the service providers with whom we or they contract may have negative effects on our business, the nature and extent of which are difficult to predict.\nIn addition, our ability to deliver our web-based services depends on the development and maintenance of the infrastructure of the Internet by third parties. This includes maintenance of a reliable network backbone with the necessary speed, data capacity, bandwidth capacity, and security. Our services are designed to operate without interruption in accordance with our service level commitments. However, we have experienced and expect that we will experience future interruptions and delays in services and availability from time to time. In the event of a catastrophic event with respect to one or more of our systems, we may experience an extended period of system unavailability, which could negatively impact our relationship with customers. To operate without interruption, both we and our service providers must guard against:\n\u2022\ndamage from fire, power loss, natural disasters and other force majeure events outside our control;\n\u2022\ncommunications failures;\n\u2022\nsoftware and hardware errors, failures, and crashes;\n\u2022\nsecurity breaches, computer viruses, hacking, denial-of-service attacks, and similar disruptive problems; and\n\u2022\nother potential interruptions.\nWe also rely on computer hardware purchased or leased and software licensed from third parties in order to offer our services, including software from Oracle Corporation and Microsoft Corporation, and routers and network equipment from Cisco, Dell and Hewlett-Packard Company. This hardware and software is generally commercially available on varying terms. However, it is possible that this hardware and software might not continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Any loss of the right to use any of this hardware or software could result in delays in the provisioning of our services until equivalent technology is either developed by us, or, if available, is identified, obtained and integrated.\nWe exercise limited control over third-party vendors, which increases our vulnerability to problems with technology and information services they provide. Interruptions in our network access and services might in connection with third-party technology and information services reduce our revenue, cause us to issue refunds to customers for prepaid and unused subscription services, subject us to potential liability, or adversely affect our renewal rates. Although we maintain insurance for our business, the coverage under our policies might not be adequate to compensate us for all losses that may occur. In addition, we might not be able to continue to obtain adequate insurance coverage at an acceptable cost, if at all.\nThe use of open source software in our products and solutions may expose us to additional risks and harm our intellectual property rights.\nSome of our products and solutions use or incorporate software that is subject to one or more open source licenses. Open source software is typically freely accessible, usable, and modifiable. Certain open source software licenses require a user who intends to distribute the open source software as a component of the user\u2019s software to disclose publicly part or all of the source code to the user\u2019s software. In addition, certain open source software licenses require the user of such software to make any derivative works of the open source code available to others on potentially unfavorable terms or at no cost.\nThe terms of many open source licenses to which we are subject have not been interpreted by U.S. or foreign courts. Accordingly, there is a risk that those licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our solutions. In that event, we could be required to seek licenses from third parties in order to continue offering our products or solutions, to re-develop our products or solutions, to discontinue sales of our products or solutions, or to release our proprietary software code under the terms of an open source license, any of which could harm our business. Further, given the nature of open source software, it may be more likely that third parties might assert copyright and other intellectual property infringement claims against us based on our use of these open source software programs.\nWhile we monitor the use of all open source software in our products, solutions, processes, and technology and try to ensure that no open source software is used in such a way as to require us to disclose the source code to the related product or solution when we do not wish to do so, it is possible that such use may have inadvertently occurred in deploying our proprietary solutions. In addition, if a third-party software provider has incorporated certain types of open source software into software we license from such third party for our products and solutions without our knowledge, we could, under certain circumstances, be required to disclose the source code to our products and solutions. This could harm our intellectual property position and our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Regulation\nGovernment regulation of the areas in which we operate creates risks and challenges with respect to our compliance efforts and our business strategies.\nThe healthcare and wellness industries are highly-regulated and subject to changing political, legislative, regulatory, and other influences. Changes in the laws and regulations may impact the operating environment and healthcare market and, by extension, the employee benefits industry. Among other impacts, existing and new laws and regulations affecting the employee benefits industry could create legal liabilities for us, cause us to incur additional costs and/or restrict our operations. These laws and regulations are complex and their application to specific services and relationships are not always clear. In particular, many existing laws and regulations affecting employee benefits, when enacted, did not anticipate the services that we provide, and these laws and regulations might be applied to our services in ways that we do not anticipate. Our failure to accurately anticipate the application of these laws and regulations, or our failure to comply, could create liability for us, result in adverse publicity, and negatively affect our business. Some of the risks we face from the regulation of employee benefits are as follows:\n\u2022\nHealthcare Market Reforms. Healthcare services and benefits are delivered and reimbursed under an increasingly intricate, and frequently uncertain, statutory and regulatory framework. Ongoing efforts to repeal and/or reform part or all of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (\u201cPPACA\u201d), new payment models for certain federal healthcare programs, and efforts to slow the growth in healthcare spending and to alter the regulatory landscape have created uncertainty in the healthcare industry broadly. Although many of these laws and regulations do not directly apply to us, they may affect the business of many of our customers. For instance, carriers and large employers might experience changes in the numbers of individuals they insure as a result of the elimination of the penalty associated with PPACA\u2019s individual mandate, possible repeal of guaranteed issue, and flux in the state and national exchanges under PPACA. Although we are unable to predict with any reasonable certainty or otherwise quantify the likely impact of PPACA repeal efforts and other deregulatory initiatives on our business model, financial condition, and operations, as well as changes in the business of our customers and the number of individuals they insure, may negatively impact our business.\n\u2022The Federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the federal False Claims Act, the Stark Law, and related laws. Providers and suppliers that accept reimbursement from federal and state healthcare programs, and those that contract with them, are required to comply with various laws and regulations intended to minimize the risk of fraud and abuse. These laws include the federal anti-kickback statute, which attaches criminal liability to unlawful inducements for the referral of business reimbursable under federally-funded healthcare programs; the Stark Law, which attach repayment and monetary damages where a healthcare service provider seeks reimbursement for providing certain services to a patient who was referred by a physician that has certain types of direct or indirect financial relationships with such service provider; the federal False Claims Act, which attaches per-claim liability and potentially treble damages to the filing of false claims for federal payment; the federal prohibition on beneficiary inducements. Many states have also adopted similar laws that apply to any third-party payor including commercial plans.\nThe False Claims Act prohibits intentionally submitting, conspiring to submit, or causing to be submitted, false or otherwise improper claims, records or statements to the federal government, or intentionally failing to return overpayments, in connection with reimbursement by federal government programs. In addition, violations of the Stark law and the federal Anti-Kickback Statute can also lead to liability under the federal False Claims Act. Most states have enacted false claims laws analogous to the federal False Claims Act. In addition, the federal False Claims Act and some state false claims laws permit private individuals to file whistleblower lawsuits known as \u201cqui tam\u201d actions on behalf of the federal or state government. Many states have passed laws similar to the federal False Claims Act that pertain to all payors, not just items or services paid for by the federal government.\nAlthough our business operations are not generally directly subject to these laws and regulations, any contract we have with a government entity requires us to comply with these laws and regulations. Further, our customers and clients are often subject to these complex laws, and any failure by us or our clients to comply with these laws and regulations could result in substantial liability, including but not limited to criminal liability, could adversely affect demand for our or our client\u2019s services, and could force us to expend significant capital and other resources to address the failure. Any determination by a court or regulatory agency that our services with government clients violate these laws and regulations could subject us to civil or criminal penalties, invalidate all or portions of some of our government client contracts, require us to change or terminate some portions of our business, require us to refund portions of our services fees, cause us to be disqualified from serving not only government clients but also all clients doing business with government payers, and have an adverse effect on our business. In addition, failure to accurately anticipate the application of these laws and regulations to our or our client\u2019s business or any other failure to comply with regulatory requirements could create liability and negatively affect our business. These risks are exacerbated by the fact that many of these laws have not been fully interpreted by regulatory authorities or the courts, and their provisions are sometimes complex and open to a variety of interpretations.\n\u2022\nHIPAA and Other Privacy and Security Requirements. Numerous federal and state laws and regulations govern the privacy and security of personal health information. In particular, regulations govern the privacy and security of personal health information. In particular, regulations promulgated pursuant to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, as amended, established privacy and security standards that limit the use and disclosure of protected health information, and require the implementation of administrative, physical, and technological safeguards to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, availability, and privacy of protected health information. Health plans, healthcare clearinghouses, and most providers are \u201cCovered Entities\u201d subject to HIPAA. With respect to our operations as a healthcare clearinghouse, we are directly subject to the privacy regulations established under HIPAA, or the Privacy Rule, and the security regulations established under HIPAA, or the Security Rule, and the data security breach notification regulations established under HIPAA, or the Breach Notification Rule. In addition, our carrier customers, or payors, are considered Covered Entities and are required to enter into written agreements with us, known as Business Associate Agreements, under which we are considered to be a \u201cBusiness Associate\u201d and that require us to safeguard protected health information and restrict how we may use and disclose such information. Both Covered Entities and Business Associates are subject to direct oversight and audit by the Department of Health and Human Services.\nViolations of HIPAA could result in civil fines of up to $59,522 per violation and a maximum civil penalty of $1,785,651 in a calendar year for violations of the same requirement, as well as criminal penalties. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 Office for Civil Rights (\u201cOCR\u201d), which enforces HIPAA, continues to increase its enforcement activities. OCR also operates a formal HIPAA audit program. The audits are intended to assess compliance with HIPAA by both Covered Entities and Business Associates and are conducted by OCR with assistance from third-party vendors. Issues identified during the audits may result in agency-\nimposed corrective action plans or civil monetary penalties. Additionally, state attorneys general may bring civil actions seeking either injunctions or damages in response to violations of HIPAA that threaten the privacy of state residents.\nWe may not be able to adequately address the business risks created by HIPAA implementation and enforcement. Furthermore, we are unable to predict what changes to HIPAA or other laws or regulations might be made in the future or how those changes could affect our business or the costs associated with compliance. Noncompliance may result in litigation, civil penalties, fines and/or settlements.\nSome payors and clearinghouses interpret HIPAA transaction requirements differently than we do. Where payors or clearinghouses require conformity with their interpretations as a condition of a successful transaction, we seek to comply with their interpretations.\nIn addition to the Privacy Rule and Security Rule, most states have enacted patient confidentiality laws that protect against the disclosure of confidential medical and/or health information, and many states have adopted or are considering further legislation in this area, including privacy safeguards, security standards, and data security breach notification requirements. Such state laws, if more stringent than HIPAA requirements, are not preempted by the federal requirements, and we are required to comply with them. Failure by us to comply with any state standards regarding patient privacy may subject us to penalties, including civil monetary penalties and, in some circumstances, criminal penalties. Such failure may injure our reputation and adversely affect our ability to retain customers and attract new customers.\n\u2022\nPersonal Privacy and Consumer Protection. Numerous federal and state laws and regulations govern the collection, retention, use, and disclosure of personal information. In addition to HIPAA, we are subject to various laws, rules and regulations related to privacy and information security, including those promulgated under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and various state laws regulating the use and security of personal information. Those laws, rules, and regulations include requirements such as reasonable and appropriate safeguards to protect personal information or providing appropriate notice to consumers about how their personal information will be used or disclosed. State legislatures have been actively considering and enacting new laws addressing data security, security breach notification, and privacy, including updates to the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 that were passed in 2020. Additionally, the California Privacy Rights Act was recently approved by California voters through a ballot initiative. These areas may present implementation challenges, could be an enforcement priority for the state regulators, and could generate increased lawsuits by consumers and other individuals. Our management believes that we are currently operating in compliance with these regulations. However, continued compliance with these evolving laws, rules and regulations regarding the privacy, security and protection of our customers\u2019 data, or the implementation of any additional privacy rules and regulations, could result in higher compliance and technology costs for us.\n\u2022\nMedicare and Medicaid Regulatory Requirements. We have contracts with insurance carriers who offer Medicare Managed Care (also known as Medicare Advantage or Medicare Part C) and Medicaid Managed Care benefits plans. We also have contracts with insurance carriers who offer Medicare prescription drug benefits (also known as Medicare Part D) plans. The activities of the Medicare plans are regulated by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, the federal agency that provides oversight of the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The Medicaid Managed Care plans are regulated by both CMS and the individual states where the plans are offered. Some of the activities that we might perform, such as the enrollment of beneficiaries, may be subject to CMS and/or state regulation, and such regulations may force us to change the way we do business or otherwise restrict our ability to provide services to such plans. Moreover, the regulatory environment with respect to these programs is increasingly complex.\n\u2022\nFinancial Services-Related Laws and Rules. Financial services and electronic payment processing services are subject to numerous laws, regulations and industry standards, some of which might impact our operations and subject us, our vendors, and our customers to liability as a result of the payment distribution and processing solutions we offer. Although we do not act as a bank, we offer solutions that involve banks, or vendors who contract with banks and other regulated providers of financial services. As a result, we might be impacted by banking and financial services industry laws, regulations, and industry standards, such as licensing requirements, solvency standards, requirements to maintain the privacy and security of nonpublic personal financial information, and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation deposit insurance limits. In addition, our patient billing and payment distribution and processing solutions might be impacted by payment card association operating rules, certification requirements, and rules governing electronic funds transfers. If we fail to comply with applicable payment processing rules or requirements, we might be subject to fines and changes in transaction fees and may lose our ability to process credit and debit card transactions or facilitate other types of billing and payment solutions. Moreover, payment transactions processed using the Automated Clearing House are subject to network operating rules promulgated by the National Automated Clearing House Association and to various federal laws regarding such operations, including laws pertaining to electronic funds transfers, and these rules and laws might impact our billing and payment solutions. Further, our solutions might impact the ability of our payor customers to comply with state prompt payment laws. These laws require payors to pay healthcare claims meeting the statutory or regulatory definition of a \u201cclean claim\u201d within a specified time frame.\n\u2022\nInsurance Broker Laws. Insurance laws in the United States are often complex, and states have broad authority to adopt regulations regarding brokerage activities. Our business's regulatory oversight generally also includes activity governing the selection and payment of insurance products and the licensing of insurance brokers and our wholly owned subsidiary, BenefitStore, Inc., is an insurance agency. Our continuing ability to provide insurance brokerage related services in the jurisdictions in which we operate depends on our compliance with the rules and regulations promulgated from time to time by the regulatory authorities in each of these jurisdictions.\n\u2022\nERISA. The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, or ERISA, regulates how employee benefits are provided to or through certain types of employer-sponsored health benefits plans. ERISA is a set of laws and regulations that is subject to periodic interpretation by the U.S. Department of Labor as well as the federal courts. In some circumstances, and under certain customer contracts, we might be deemed to have assumed duties that make us an ERISA fiduciary, and thus be required to carry out our operations in a manner that complies with ERISA in all material respects. We believe that our current operations do not render us subject to ERISA fiduciary obligations, and therefore that we are in material compliance with ERISA and that any such compliance does not currently have a material adverse effect on our operations. However, there can be no assurance that continuing ERISA compliance efforts or any future changes to ERISA will not have a material adverse effect on us.\n\u2022\nThird-Party Administrator Laws. Numerous states in which we do business have adopted regulations governing entities engaged in third-party administrator, or TPA, activities. TPA regulations typically impose requirements regarding enrollment into benefits plans, claims processing and payments, and the handling of customer funds. Although we do not believe we are currently acting as a TPA, changes in state regulations could result in us being obligated to comply with such regulations, which might require us to obtain licenses to provide TPA services in such states.\nPotential regulatory requirements placed on our software, services, and content could impose increased costs on us, delay or prevent our introduction of new service types, and impair the function or value of our existing service types.\nOur products and services are and are likely to continue to be subject to increasing regulatory requirements in a number of ways. As these requirements proliferate, we must change or adapt our products and services to comply. Changing regulatory requirements might render our services obsolete or might block us from accomplishing our work or from developing new services. This might in turn impose additional costs upon us to comply or to further develop our products and services. It might also make introduction of new product or service types more costly or more time-consuming than we currently anticipate. It might even prevent introduction by us of new products or services or cause the continuation of our existing products or services to become unprofitable or impossible.\nPotential government subsidy of services similar to ours, or creation of a single payor system, might reduce customer demand.\nRecently, entities including brokers and U.S. federal and state governments have offered to subsidize adoption of online benefits platforms or clearinghouses. In addition, federal regulations have been changed to permit such subsidy from additional sources subject to certain limitations. To the extent that we do not qualify or participate in such subsidy programs, demand for our services might be reduced, which may decrease our revenue. In addition, prior proposals regarding healthcare reform have included the concept of creation of a single payor for healthcare insurance. This kind of consolidation of critical benefits activity could negatively impact the demand for our services.\nOur services present the potential for embezzlement, identity theft, or other similar illegal behavior by our associates with respect to third parties.\nAmong other things, certain services offered by us involve collecting payment information from individuals, and this frequently includes check and credit card information. Even though we do not handle direct payments, our services also involve the use and disclosure of personal and business information that could be used to impersonate third parties, commit identity theft, or otherwise gain access to their data or funds. If any of our associates take, convert, or misuse such funds, documents, or data, we could be liable for damages, and our business reputation could be damaged or destroyed. Moreover, if we fail to adequately prevent third parties from accessing personal and/or business information and using that information to commit identity theft, we might face legal liabilities and other losses than can have a negative impact on our business.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness\nWe have incurred substantial indebtedness that may decrease our business flexibility, access to capital and/or increase our borrowing costs, and we may still incur substantially more debt, which may adversely affect our operations and financial results.\nIn December 2018, we issued $240.0 million aggregate principal of 1.25% convertible senior notes (the \u201cNotes\u201d) due December 15, 2023, unless earlier repurchased by us or converted by the holder pursuant to their terms. The Notes may limit our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general business purposes; limit our ability to use our cash flow or obtain additional financing for future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general business purposes; require us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make debt service payments; limit our flexibility to plan for or react to, changes in our business and industry; place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our less leveraged competitors; and increase our vulnerability to the impact of adverse economic and industry conditions. Further, the indenture governing the Notes does not restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness and we and our subsidiaries may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, subject to the restrictions contained in any future debt instruments existing at the time, some of which may be secured indebtedness.\nServicing our debt and preferred dividends requires a significant amount of cash, and we might not have or be able to obtain sufficient cash to pay our substantial debt or required dividends.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had $221 million aggregate principal of Notes outstanding. We also had the ability to borrow an aggregate of $50 million under our current credit facility, all of which would be secured debt. Further, holders of our redeemable preferred stock are entitled to dividends of 8% per year, payable quarterly, which is approximately $6.4 million per year as of December 31, 2020, if paid in cash rather than in kind. Our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness, depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our business might not continue to generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service our debt timely. In addition, our ability to repurchase or to pay cash upon conversion of the Notes may be limited by law, regulatory authority or agreements governing our future indebtedness. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash to service our debt, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. In addition, our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. We might not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default and acceleration of our debt obligations.\nThe conditional conversion feature of the Notes, if triggered, and any required repurchase of the Notes may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nIn the event any conditional conversion feature of the Notes is triggered, holders of the Notes will be entitled to convert the Notes at any time during specified periods at their option. In addition, holders of the Notes have the right to require us to repurchase their Notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change. If one or more holders elect to convert their Notes (and unless we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering solely shares of our common stock, other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), or if we are required to repurchase the Notes due to a fundamental change, we would be required to settle a portion or all of our conversion obligation through the payment of cash or repurchase the Notes with cash, both of which could adversely affect our liquidity. In addition, even if holders do not elect to convert their Notes upon a conditional conversion feature being triggered, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the Notes as a current rather than long-term liability, which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital.\nThe Notes are effectively subordinated to our secured debt and any liabilities of our subsidiaries.\nThe Notes rank senior in right of payment to any of our indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes; equal in right of payment to any of our liabilities that are not so subordinated; effectively junior in right of payment to any of our senior, secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and structurally junior to all indebtedness and other liabilities (including trade payables) of our subsidiaries. In the event of our bankruptcy, liquidation, reorganization or other winding up, our assets that secure debt ranking senior or equal in right of payment to the Notes will be available to pay obligations on the Notes only after the senior, secured debt has been repaid in full from these assets. There might not be sufficient assets remaining to pay amounts due on any or all of the Notes then outstanding. The indenture governing the Notes does not prohibit us from incurring additional senior debt or secured debt, nor does it prohibit any of our subsidiaries from incurring additional liabilities. All our indebtedness, including the Notes, must be repaid before our stockholders would receive anything in a liquidation.\nIf we fail to meet our current credit facility\u2019s financial covenants, our business and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nOur current credit facility contains financial covenants. If at any point we fail to comply with the financial covenants, the lenders can demand immediate repayment of our outstanding balance and deny future borrowings under the credit facility. This could have a negative impact on our liquidity, thereby reducing the availability of cash flow for other purposes and adversely affecting our business.\nWe may still incur substantially more debt or take other actions that would diminish our ability to make payments on the Notes when due.\nWe and our subsidiaries may incur substantial additional debt in the future, some of which may be secured debt. We are not restricted under the terms of the indenture governing the Notes from incurring additional debt, securing existing or future debt, recapitalizing our debt or taking a number of other actions that could have the effect of diminishing our ability to make payments on the Notes when due. Furthermore, the indenture prohibits us from engaging in certain mergers or acquisitions unless, among other things, the surviving entity assumes our obligations under the Notes and the indenture. These and other provisions in the indenture could deter or prevent a third party from acquiring us even when the acquisition may be favorable to holders of the Notes.\nThe conversion of the Notes will dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders, including holders who had previously converted their Notes, or may otherwise depress the price of our common stock.\nThe conversion of some or all of the Notes will dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders to the extent we deliver shares of our common stock upon conversion of the Notes. The Notes may in the future become convertible at the option of the holders of the Notes prior to December 15, 2023 under certain circumstances as provided in the indenture governing the Notes. Any sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock. In addition, the existence of the Notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of the Notes could be used to satisfy short positions, or anticipated conversion of the Notes into shares of our common stock could depress the price of our common stock.\nThe capped call transactions we entered into in connection with the issuance of the Notes might not turn out to be effective in reducing dilution, and might adversely affect the value of our common stock.\nIn connection with the Notes, we paid approximately $33.0 million to enter into capped call transactions with certain purchasers or their affiliates (the \u201cOption Counterparties\u201d). The capped call\ntransactions are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution upon conversion of the Notes and/or offset any cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted Notes, as the case may be, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap. If our stock price is less than $53.17 upon conversion of the Notes, the capped calls will have no effect and we will get no benefit from the cash we paid to enter into the capped calls. Furthermore, if our stock is above $89.98 per share upon conversion of the Notes, the capped calls will not completely eliminate the dilution from Note conversion.\nIn connection with establishing their initial hedges of the capped call transactions, the Option Counterparties entered into various derivative transactions with respect to our common stock. This activity could have increased (or reduced the size of any decrease in) the market price of our common stock or the Notes at that time.\nIn addition, the Option Counterparties may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding derivatives with respect to our common stock and/or purchasing or selling our common stock or other securities of ours in secondary market transactions prior to the maturity of the Notes (and are likely to do so during any observation period related to a conversion of Notes or following any repurchase of Notes by us on any fundamental change repurchase date or otherwise). This activity could also cause or avoid an increase or decrease in the price of our common stock or the Notes.\nThe potential effect, if any, of these transactions and activities on the price of our common stock or the Notes will depend in part on the market conditions and cannot be ascertained at this time. Any of these activities could adversely affect the value of our common stock.\nThe accounting method for convertible debt securities that may be settled in cash, such as the Notes, could have a material effect on our reported financial results.\nIn May 2008, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) issued Staff Position No. APB 14-1, Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash Upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement), which has subsequently been codified as ASC 470-20, Debt with Conversion and Other Options. Under ASC 470-20, an entity must separately account for the liability and equity components of the convertible debt instruments (such as the Notes) that may be settled entirely or partially in cash upon conversion in a manner that reflects the issuer\u2019s economic interest cost. The effect of ASC 470-20 on the accounting for the Notes is that the equity component is required to be included in the additional paid-in capital section of stockholders\u2019 equity on our consolidated balance sheets, and the value of the equity component would be treated as original issue discount for purposes of accounting for the debt component of the Notes. As a result, we will be required to record a greater amount of non-cash interest expense in current periods presented as a result of the amortization of the discounted carrying value of the Notes to their face amount over the term of the Notes. We will report lower net income in our financial results because ASC 470-20 will require interest to include both the current period\u2019s amortization of the debt discount and the instrument\u2019s coupon interest, which could adversely affect our reported or future financial results, the trading price of our common stock and the trading price of the Notes.\nIn addition, under certain circumstances, convertible debt instruments (such as the Notes) that may be settled entirely or partly in cash are currently accounted for utilizing the treasury stock method, the effect of which is that the shares issuable upon conversion of the Notes are not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share except to the extent that the conversion value of the Notes exceeds their principal amount. Under the treasury stock method, for diluted earnings per share purposes, the transaction is accounted for as if the number of shares of common stock that would be necessary to settle such excess, if we elected to settle such excess in shares, are issued. We cannot be sure that the accounting standards in the future will continue to permit the use of the treasury stock method. If we are unable to use the treasury stock method in accounting for the shares issuable upon conversion of the Notes, then our diluted earnings per share would be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nOur stock price may be volatile or may decline regardless of our operating performance, and you may not be able to resell your shares at or above the price at which you purchase it.\nThe stock market historically has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. As a result of this volatility, you might not be able to sell your common stock at or above the price at which you purchase it. From our IPO in September 2013 through March 8, 2021, the per share trading price of our common stock has been as high as $77.00 and as low as $6.09. It might continue to fluctuate significantly in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. These factors include:\n\u2022\nour operating performance and the operating performance of similar companies;\n\u2022\nthe overall performance of the equity markets;\n\u2022\nany major change in our management;\n\u2022\nchanges in laws or regulations relating to the sale of health insurance;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of acquisitions, business plans, or commercial relationships;\n\u2022\nthreatened or actual litigation;\n\u2022\npublication of research reports or news stories about us, our competitors, or our industry, or positive or negative recommendations or withdrawal of research coverage by securities analysts;\n\u2022\nlarge volumes of sales of our shares of common stock by existing stockholders; and\n\u2022\ngeneral political and economic conditions.\nIn addition, the stock market in general, and the market for Internet-related companies in particular, has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. Additionally, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the overall market and in the market price of a company\u2019s securities. This litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs, divert our management\u2019s attention and resources, and harm our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nOur stock price could decline due to the large number of outstanding shares of our common stock and those underlying the Notes eligible for future sale.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market or the market perception that such sales and issuances may occur could reduce the market price of our common stock and impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional common stock or equity-linked securities at a time and price that we deem appropriate.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had an aggregate of 32,327,439 shares of common stock outstanding. As of December 31, 2020, there also were outstanding options and restricted stock units to purchase 2,712,805 shares of our common stock that, if exercised or vested, as applicable, will result in these additional shares becoming available for sale, subject in some cases to Rule 144. We have also registered an aggregate of 12,584,766 shares of our common stock that we may issue or sell under our stock plans. These shares can be freely sold in the public market upon issuance, unless they are held by \u201caffiliates\u201d, as that term is defined in Rule 144 of the Securities Act. In addition, a substantial number of shares of our common stock is reserved for issuance upon conversion of the Notes. There are also shares of Series A Preferred Stock (the \u201cPreferred Stock\u201d) that are convertible into an aggregate of 5,333,334 shares of our common stock. If a large number of these shares are sold in the public market, the sales could reduce the trading price of our common stock.\nWe might require additional capital to support business growth.\nWe intend to continue to make investments to support our business growth and might require additional funds to respond to business challenges or opportunities, including the need to develop new products and services or enhance our existing services, enhance our operating infrastructure, and acquire complementary businesses and technologies. Accordingly, we might need to engage in equity or additional debt financings to secure additional funds. If we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges superior to those of holders of our common stock. Any additional debt financing secured by us could involve restrictive covenants relating to our capital-raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which might make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions. In addition, we might not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us, if at all. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when we require it, our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges could be significantly limited.\nThe issuance of shares of our common stock upon conversion of our Series A Preferred Stock may dilute the ownership interest of our existing common stockholders, adversely impact the market price of our common stock and make it more difficult for us to raise funds through future equity offerings.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the outstanding shares of our Preferred Stock were convertible into an aggregate of 5,333,334 shares of our common stock. Additional shares of our common stock may also be issued to the holders of our Preferred Stock in the event we make payment of the regular quarterly dividend on the Preferred Stock in kind, instead of in cash. The issuance of shares of common stock upon conversion of the Preferred Stock would dilute the percentage ownership interest of all holders of our common stock and any positive book value per share of our common stock, and would increase the number of publicly traded shares, which could depress the market price of our common stock. The fact that our stockholders can sell a substantial amount of our common stock in the public market, whether or not sales have occurred or are occurring, could make it more difficult for us to raise additional funds though the sale of equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem reasonable or appropriate, or at all.\nOur preferred stockholders have significant rights and preferences over the holders of our common stock that could limit us from taking certain corporate actions, and as a result affect our business, operating results, and the market price of our common stock.\nOur preferred stockholders are entitled to a quarterly dividend equal to 8.0% per annum, payable in cash or in kind, before any dividends are paid on our common stock. Our preferred stockholders are also entitled to participate in and receive any dividends declared or paid on our common stock on an as-converted basis. No dividends may be paid on our common stock unless full participating dividends are concurrently paid to our preferred stockholders. Our preferred stockholders also have a claim against our assets senior to the claim of the holders of our common stock in the event of our liquidation, dissolution, or winding-up.\nOur preferred stockholders are generally entitled to vote with our common stockholders on all matters submitted for a vote of the common stockholders (voting together with the common stockholders as one class) on an as-converted basis. In addition, the following matters require the approval of a majority of the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, voting as a separate class: (1) the authorization, creation, or issuance of any securities of the Company having rights, preferences, or privileges senior to or on a parity with any of the rights, preferences, or privileges of the Preferred Stock; (2) effecting any alteration, repeal, change, or amendment of the rights, privileges, or preferences of the Preferred Stock; (3) amendments, modifications or repeal of any provision of the Company\u2019s charter or bylaws in a manner adverse to the Preferred Stock; (4) changes in the authorized number of directors of the Company to a number greater than 10 individuals; (5) effecting any transaction between the Company and any of its\naffiliates (except for certain circumstances); (6) declaration or payment of any dividend or distribution with respect to any Company capital stock at any time the Company has any indebtedness outstanding; (7) incurring any indebtedness in excess of $500 million (including existing indebtedness and excluding lease obligations), or encumbering or granting a security interest in all or substantially all of the Company\u2019s assets in connection with any such indebtedness (except existing security interests); or (8) agreeing or consenting to any of the foregoing actions.\nAs long as not less than 60% of the shares of the Series A Preferred Stock originally issued remain outstanding, the holders of a majority of the then-outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock, voting together as a single class, will have the right at any election of directors to elect (A) two directors if the board consists of nine or fewer directors; or (B) three directors if the board consists of 10 directors. At any time, such director may be removed with or without cause only by the affirmative vote or written consent of a majority of the holders of the Preferred Stock entitled to elect such director. In addition, while they have these rights to appoint directors, we may not expand the size of our board to greater than 10 directors without the consent of the holders of a majority of the then-outstanding shares of Preferred Stock.\nThe foregoing rights of our preferred stockholders could, while the Preferred Stock is outstanding, limit us from obtaining future financings or to otherwise conduct necessary corporate activities, and as a result may adversely affect our business, operating results, and the market price of our common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the sole and exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders. These choice of forum provisions could limit the ability of stockholders to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees.\nUnless we consent to the selection of an alternative forum, our amended and restated bylaws provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, or the Court of Chancery, will be, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the sole and exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf; any action asserting a claim of breach of fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or other employees to the Company or our stockholders; any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation Law, or DGCL, or our certificate of incorporation or bylaws; or any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. Since the choice of forum provisions are only applicable to \u201cthe fullest extent permitted by applicable law\u201d, as provided in our bylaws, the provisions do not designate the Court of Chancery as the exclusive forum for any derivative action or other claim for which the applicable statute creates exclusive jurisdiction in another forum. As such, the choice of forum provisions do not apply to any actions arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended or the Exchange Act.\nThese choice of forum provisions may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and other employees. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provisions contained in our bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe do not currently intend to pay dividends on our common stock and, consequently, your ability to achieve a return on your investment will depend on appreciation in the price of our common stock.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock and do not currently intend to do so for the foreseeable future. We currently intend to invest our future earnings, if any, to fund\nour growth. Therefore, you are not likely to receive any dividends on your common stock for the foreseeable future, and the success of an investment in shares of our common stock will depend upon future appreciation in its value, if any. There is no guarantee that shares of our common stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which our stockholders purchased their shares.\nProvisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws and Delaware law might discourage, delay, or prevent a change in control of our company or changes in our management and, therefore, depress the trading price of our common stock.\nProvisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law might discourage, delay, or prevent a merger, acquisition, or other change in control that stockholders consider favorable, including transactions in which you might otherwise receive a premium for your shares of our common stock. These provisions might also prevent or frustrate attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our management. These provisions include:\n\u2022\nlimitations on the removal of directors;\n\u2022\nadvance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations;\n\u2022\nlimitations on the ability of stockholders to call special meetings;\n\u2022\nthe inability of stockholders to act by written consent;\n\u2022\nthe inability of stockholders to cumulate votes at any election of directors;\n\u2022\nthe classification of our board of directors into three classes with only one class, representing approximately one-third of our directors, standing for election at each annual meeting (although we intend to bring a proposal to declassify our board to the stockholders for consideration at our 2021 annual stockholders meeting); and\n\u2022\nthe ability of our board of directors to make, alter or repeal our bylaws.\nOur Board of Directors has the ability to designate the terms of and issue new series of preferred stock without stockholder approval. In addition, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law prohibits a publicly held Delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder, generally a person which together with its affiliates owns, or within the last three years has owned, 15% of our voting stock, for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner.\nThe existence of the foregoing provisions and anti-takeover measures could limit the price that investors are willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. They could also deter potential acquirers of our company, thereby reducing the likelihood that you could receive a premium for your common stock in an acquisition.",

Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nMANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nOF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this report including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should review the \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section of this report beginning on page 24 for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.\nOverview\nBenefitfocus provides industry-leading, cloud-based benefits management technology solutions for employers and health plans. The Benefitfocus enrollment platform simplifies how organizations procure benefits and connect to the necessary benefits products and services that improve the lives of their employees and the American workforce. Our core technology solutions facilitate employee benefits administration and enrollment; our solutions enable working Americans and their families to select and engage in the right benefits products and services for themselves; and our data advantage deliver insights to employers, health plans and their advisors to help control healthcare spending and reduce unnecessary expenses.\nThe Benefitfocus Platform has a multi-tenant architecture and a user-friendly interface designed for employees to access all of their benefits in one place. Our comprehensive solutions support medical benefit plans and non-medical benefits, such as, dental, life, disability insurance, income protection, digital health and financial wellness. Our platform includes functionality designed to help consumers identify and evaluate benefit options available to them. As the number of employer benefits plans has increased, with each plan subject to many different business rules and requirements, demand for the Benefitfocus Platform is growing.\nOur economic model includes a transaction-oriented solution, now known as our Benefit Catalog, that aligns brokers, carriers and suppliers around the needs of employers and employees. In this model, Benefit Catalog sellers, who are carriers and suppliers, offer their voluntary and specialty benefit products in a \u201cmarketplace\u201d alongside the benefits enrollment platform. This marketplace is designed to increase the economic value of the employee and consumer lives on our platform by aligning Benefit Catalog products to consumer needs. In exchange for Benefitfocus delivering employee/consumer access, data-driven analysis and operational efficiencies, seller partners pay us a percentage of the purchases completed on our platform. Carrier agreements have terms of two to four years and are typically cancellable upon breach of contract or insolvency. Supplier contracts have terms of one year or less and are generally cancellable upon breach of contract, failure to cure, bankruptcy and termination for convenience.\nWe classify our revenue into three streams - subscription, platform, and professional services revenue. Subscription and platform revenue are combined and reported as software services revenue.\nSubscription revenue primarily consists of monthly subscription fees paid to us by our employer and insurance carrier customers for access to, and usage of, cloud-based benefits software solutions for a specified contract term. Subscription fees are generally charged based on the number of employees or subscribers with access to the solution. Subscription revenue accounted for approximately 67%, 66%, and 69% of our total revenue during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nPlatform revenue includes Benefit Catalog transactional revenue, which is generated from the value of the policies or products enrolled in through our marketplace. Benefit Catalog revenue from insured products is generally recognized over the policy period of the enrolled products. In arrangements where we sell policies to employees of our customers as the broker, we earn insurance broker commissions. Revenue from insurance broker commissions and Benefit Catalog supplier transactions is generally recognized at the time when open enrollment is complete and the orders for policies are transferred to the supplier. Platform revenue accounted for approximately 13%, 11%, and 9% of our total revenue during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nOur professional services revenue stream is largely derived from the implementation of our customers onto our platform, which typically includes discovery, configuration and deployment, integration, testing, and training. We also provide customer support services and customized media content that supports our customers\u2019 effort to educate and communicate with consumers. Professional services revenue accounted for approximately 20%, 23%, and 22% of our total revenue during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nExpanding our customer base is a key element of our growth strategy. We believe that our continued innovation and new solutions, such as Benefit Catalog, which extend to the functionality of our mobile offerings, provide more robust data analytics capabilities and enhance our ability to quickly respond to evolving market needs, we believe these innovative capabilities will help us attract additional lives to our platform through new employer customers, partners and brokers and increase our revenue from existing customers and relationships.\nWe believe that there is a substantial market for our services, and we have been investing in growth over the past several years. In particular, we have continued to invest in technology and services to better serve our larger employer customers, which we believe are an important source of growth for our business. As we have invested in growth, we have had operating losses in each of the last ten years. Although our operating results have improved, we could incur operating losses in future periods. Due to the nature of our customer relationships, which have been stable in spite of some customer losses over the past years, and our hybrid subscription and transaction-based financial model, we believe that our current investment in growth should lead to increased revenue in the long-term, which may allow us to achieve profitability in the relatively near future. Of course, our ability to achieve profitability will continue to be subject to many factors beyond our control.\nOn March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization classified the COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic. We continue to actively monitor COVID-19 and its potential impact on our operations and financial results. In response to the pandemic, we implemented cost management actions in the second quarter of 2020 to maintain our financial health and liquidity through these economic uncertain times. These include actions to reduce our workforce by approximately 17%, renegotiating vendor service contracts and reducing discretionary expenditures such as travel and professional services. These actions also include investing in accelerating automation efforts to gain efficiencies.\nDuring the initial peak of the COVID-19 pandemic during the second quarter of 2020, we experienced delays in completing selling as HR professionals shifted their focus away procuring technology solutions. We believe the financial impacts from COVID-19 are temporary in nature and do not significantly affect our business model and growth strategy. Therefore, we did not consider the COVID-19 pandemic to have been a triggering event to accelerate our annual impairments tests.\nWe evaluated our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets and determined there were no interim triggering events as it was not more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting units would be less than their respective carrying amounts. Additionally, we evaluated our long-lived assets, including our property, plant and equipment, lease right-of-use assets and other intangible assets, noting no indicators of impairment.\nThe impact that COVID-19 will have on our consolidated financial statements beyond 2020 remains uncertain and ultimately will be dictated by the length and severity of the pandemic, as well as the economic recovery and federal, state and local government actions taken in response. We will continue to evaluate the nature and extent of these potential impacts to our business and consolidated financial statements.\nWhile the ultimate impact of the pandemic on our business and financial results remains uncertain, our business has been impacted by the following:\n\u2022\nNew sales. We have experienced longer sales cycles and a slowdown in new sales activity which negatively impact professional services revenue and platform revenue from new business.\n\u2022\nUnemployment. The increase in unemployment caused by the pandemic has negatively impacted platform revenue by decreasing the rate at which our Benefits Catalog voluntary benefits offerings are purchased. Our subscription revenue has been impacted to a lesser extent in 2020 depending on the level of contractual minimums in our contracts and a delay\nin when unemployed workers leave our platform. In addition, unemployment has caused a decrease in net benefit eligible lives on our platform in the near term.\n\u2022\nParticipation in Voluntary Benefits. Participation of lives on our platform in purchasing voluntary benefits did not grow compared to the previous year as a result of the economic impacts of the pandemic on income levels across the country.\nAs a result of the nature of our customer relationships, the stability of our subscription revenue, the cost restructuring actions taken in the second quarter of 2020 and our ongoing investments in automation, we believe we will be able to increase cash flows from operations and achieve profitability in the relatively near future. Of course, our ability to achieve profitability will continue to be subject to many risks and factors beyond our control, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.\nKey Financial and Operating Performance Metrics\nWe regularly monitor a number of financial and operating metrics in order to measure our current performance and project our future performance. These metrics help us develop and refine our growth strategies and make strategic decisions. We discuss revenue, gross margin, and the components of operating loss in \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Components of Operating Results\u201d. In addition, we utilize other key metrics as described below.\nNet Benefit Eligible Lives\nPart of our growth strategy is to expand our customer base. This includes driving revenue growth from adding lives to our platform and driving incremental transaction revenue. We believe the number of net benefit eligible lives is a key indicator of our market penetration, growth and future revenue opportunity. We believe net benefit eligible lives is the foundation of our platform revenue opportunity. We define a net benefit eligible life as a person with access to a benefits enrollment subscription under standard contracting or a freelancer with access to benefits enrollment, plus their estimated dependents, as of the measurement date. This definition excludes lives from other subscription-related contracts.\nWe expect the number net benefit eligible lives will decrease during 2021. We expect that some health plan customers will renew their agreements in 2021 at lower minimum counts as the result of higher unemployment rates decreasing the number covered employees. Additionally, we expect the number of net benefit eligible lives to be negatively impacted by the termination of a contract with an entity with a substantial number of freelancers.\nAs of December 31,\n(in millions)\nNet benefit eligible lives\n18.3\n17.3\n13.3\nIn February 2019, we acquired certain operating assets and liabilities, intellectual property and intangible assets of Connecture, Inc. This transaction added 2.0 million net benefit eligible lives to our platform. The details of this transaction are described in more detail in Note 3 of our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nSoftware Services Revenue Retention Rate\nWe believe that our ability to retain our customers and expand the revenue they generate for us over time is an important component of our growth strategy and reflects the long-term value of our customer relationships. We measure our performance on this basis using a metric we refer to as our software services revenue retention rate. We calculate this metric for a particular period by establishing the group of our customers that had active contracts for a given period. We then calculate our software services revenue retention rate by taking the amount of software services revenue we recognized for this group in the subsequent comparable period (for which we are reporting the rate) and dividing it by the software services revenue we recognized for the group in the prior period.\nOur software services revenue retention rate was greater than 90% for year ended December 31, 2020 compared to being greater than 95% for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. The reduction in the rate was primarily the result of the impact on 2020 revenue from the renegotiation of a customer contract. Excluding this customer, our software revenue retention rate exceeded 95% for all periods. We expect our software revenue retention rate will continue to be negatively impacted for the remainder of 2021 by the effects of this customer contract negotiation along with the potential impacts of unemployment as a result of COVID-19 pandemic.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA represents our earnings before net interest and other expense, taxes, and depreciation and amortization expense, adjusted to eliminate stock-based compensation, restructuring costs, impairment of goodwill, intangible assets, and long-lived assets, gain or loss on extinguishment of debt, transaction and acquisition-related costs expensed, and costs not core to our business. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure calculated in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP.\nDuring 2020, we revised our definition of adjusted EBITDA to also exclude restructuring costs, impairment of long-lived assets, and gain or loss of extinguishment of debt. The revisions to these definitions had no impact on our reported adjusted EBITDA for periods prior to 2020. Please note that other companies might define their non-GAAP financial measures differently than we do.\nWe have included adjusted EBITDA in this Annual Report on Form 10-K because it is a key measure used by our management and board of directors to understand and evaluate our core operating performance and trends, to prepare and approve our annual budget, and to develop short- and long-term operational plans. In particular, we believe that the exclusion of the expenses eliminated in calculating adjusted EBITDA can provide a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our core business. Accordingly, we believe that adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results.\nOur use of adjusted EBITDA as an analytical tool has limitations, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our financial results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are:\n\u2022\nalthough depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized might have to be replaced in the future, and adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements;\n\u2022\nadjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;\n\u2022\nadjusted EBITDA does not reflect the potentially dilutive impact of stock-based compensation;\n\u2022\nadjusted EBITDA does not reflect interest, tax or dividend payments that would reduce the cash available to us; and\n\u2022\nother companies, including companies in our industry, might calculate adjusted EBITDA or similarly titled measures differently, which reduces their usefulness as comparative measures.\nBecause of these and other limitations, you should consider adjusted EBITDA alongside other GAAP-based financial performance measures, including various cash flow metrics, gross profit, net loss and our other GAAP financial results. The following table presents a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to net loss for each of the periods indicated:\nYear Ended December 31,\n(in thousands)\nReconciliation from Net Income (Loss) to Adjusted EBITDA:\nNet income (loss)\n$\n(24,297\n)\n$\n(45,515\n)\n$\n(52,627\n)\nDepreciation\n15,285\n15,288\n11,721\nAmortization of software development costs\n7,455\n5,130\n3,944\nAmortization of acquired intangible assets\n2,274\n1,933\nInterest income\n(632\n)\n(2,613\n)\n(250\n)\nInterest expense\n23,071\n23,524\n13,156\nIncome tax expense\nStock-based compensation expense\n14,537\n19,572\n28,868\nTransaction and acquisition-related costs expensed\n1,035\nRestructuring costs\n5,616\n-\n-\nImpairment of long-lived assets\n-\n-\nGain on repurchase of convertible senior notes\n(1,138\n)\n-\n-\nCosts not core to our business\n4,843\nTotal net adjustments\n$\n68,313\n$\n64,545\n$\n62,967\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n44,016\n$\n19,030\n$\n10,340\nComponents of Operating Results\nRevenue\nWe derive the majority of our revenue from monthly subscription fees paid to us by our employer and health plan customers for access to, and usage of, our cloud-based benefits software solutions for a specified contract term. We derive platform revenue from both insurance broker commissions from the sale of voluntary and ancillary benefits policies to employees of our customers and from transaction revenue from life and ancillary insurance carriers and specialty providers. We also derive revenue from professional services fees, which primarily include fees related to the implementation of our customers onto our platform. Our professional services typically include discovery, configuration and deployment, integration, testing, and training.\nThe following table sets forth a breakdown of our revenue by stream for the periods indicated (in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31,\nSubscription\n$\n179,743\n$\n195,091\n$\n179,410\nPlatform\n35,101\n33,654\n22,938\nTotal software services\n$\n214,844\n$\n228,745\n$\n202,348\nProfessional services\n53,297\n66,941\n56,373\nTotal revenue\n$\n268,141\n$\n295,686\n$\n258,721\nWe recognize revenue when control of these services is transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those services. Taxes collected from customers relating to services and remitted to governmental authorities are excluded from revenues.\nWe determine revenue recognition through the following steps:\n\u2022\nIdentification of each contract with a customer;\n\u2022\nIdentification of the performance obligations in the contract;\n\u2022\nDetermination of the transaction price;\n\u2022\nAllocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and\n\u2022\nRecognition of revenue when, or as, performance obligations are satisfied.\nSoftware Services Revenue\nSoftware services revenue consists of subscription and platform revenue.\nSubscription Revenue\nSubscription revenue primarily consists of monthly subscription fees paid to us by our customers for access to, and usage of, cloud-based benefits software solutions for a specified contract term. Fees are generally charged based on the number of employees or subscribers with access to the solution.\nSubscription revenue is generally recognized on a ratable basis over the contract term beginning on the date the subscription services are made available to the customer. Our subscription service contracts are generally three years.\nSubscription revenue also includes fees paid for other services, such as event sponsorships and certain data services.\nPlatform Revenue\nPlatform revenue is generated from the value of the policies or products enrolled in through our marketplace. Platform revenue from carriers is generally recognized over the policy period of the enrolled products. In arrangements where we sell policies to employees of our customers as the broker, we earn insurance broker commissions. Revenue from insurance broker commissions and Benefit Catalog supplier transactions is recognized at the point when the orders for the policies are received and transferred to the insurance carrier or supplier, and is reduced by constraints for variable consideration associated with collectability, policy cancellation and termination risks.\nProfessional Services Revenue\nProfessional services revenue primarily consists of fees related to the implementation of software products purchased by customers. Professional services typically include discovery, configuration and deployment, integration, testing, and training. Fees from consulting services, support services and training are also included in professional services revenue.\nWe determined that implementation services for certain of our insurance carrier customers significantly modify or customize the software solution and, as such, do not represent a distinct performance obligation. Accordingly, revenue from such implementation services with these insurance carrier customers are generally recognized over the contract term of the associated software services contract, including any extension periods representing a material right. We utilize estimates of hours as a measure of progress to determine revenue for certain types of arrangements.\nRevenue from implementation services with employer customers is generally recognized as those services are performed.\nRevenue from support and training fees is recognized over the service contract period.\nContracts with Multiple Performance Obligations\nCertain of our contracts with customers contain multiple performance obligations. For these contracts, the individual performance obligations are accounted for separately if they are distinct. The transaction price is allocated to the separate performance obligations based on their relative standalone selling prices. We determine the standalone selling prices based on their overall pricing objectives, taking into consideration market conditions and other factors, including the value of their contracts, the software services sold, customer size and complexity, and the number and types of users within the contracts.\nOverhead Allocation\nExpenses associated with our facilities, security, information technology, and depreciation and amortization, are allocated between cost of revenue and operating expenses based on employee headcount determined by the nature of work performed.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue primarily consists of salaries and other personnel-related costs, including benefits, bonuses, and stock-based compensation, for employees, whom we refer to as associates, providing\nservices to our customers and supporting our SaaS platform infrastructure. Additional expenses in cost of revenue include co-location facility costs for our data centers, depreciation expense for computer equipment directly associated with generating revenue, infrastructure maintenance costs, professional fees, amortization expenses associated with acquired intangibles and capitalized software development costs, allocated overhead, and other direct costs.\nWe expense cost of revenue associated with fulfilling performance obligations as we incur the costs. Costs that relate directly to a customer contract that are not related to satisfying a performance obligation are capitalized and amortized to cost of revenue over the estimated period of benefit of the contract asset, which is generally five years.\nSubscription and platform revenue are both generated from our platform and result from the same set of assets and activities. As such, we are not able to meaningfully separate and assign costs of revenue to subscription and platform revenue separately.\nWe expect cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue to decline and gross margins to increase as we realize the full impact of our restructuring activities and increased automation. However, this trend may vary on a quarterly basis.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses consist of sales and marketing, research and development, and general and administrative expenses. Salaries and personnel-related costs are the most significant component of each of these expense categories. We expect to decrease our operating expenses, as a percentage of revenue, if and as we achieve economies of scale and as a result of restructuring actions taken in April 2020.\nSales and marketing expense. Sales and marketing expense consists primarily of salaries and other personnel-related costs, including benefits, bonuses, stock-based compensation, and commissions for our sales and marketing associates. Costs to obtain a contract that are incremental, such as sales commissions, are capitalized and amortized to expense over the estimated period of benefit of the asset, which is generally four to five years. Additional expenses include advertising, lead generation, promotional event programs, corporate communications, travel, and allocated overhead. For instance, our most significant promotional event is One Place, which we hold annually. We expect our sales and marketing expense to remain flat, in absolute dollars, in the near term as we achieve the savings expected from the restructuring actions taken in April 2020.\nResearch and development expense. Research and development expense consists primarily of salaries and other personnel-related costs, including benefits, bonuses, and stock-based compensation for our research and development associates. Additional expenses include costs related to the development, quality assurance, and testing of new technology, and enhancement of our existing platform technology, consulting, travel, and allocated overhead. We believe continuing to invest in research and development efforts is essential to maintaining our competitive position.\nGeneral and administrative expense. General and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries and other personnel-related costs, including benefits, bonuses, and stock-based compensation for administrative, finance and accounting, information systems, legal, and human resource associates. Additional expenses include consulting and professional fees, insurance and other corporate expenses, and travel. We expect our general and administrative expenses to decrease in absolute terms as a result of the restructuring actions taken in April 2020, which included reducing headcount, renegotiating vendor service contracts, restricting travel, and reducing discretionary expenditures such as for consultants.\nRestructuring costs. Restructuring costs are comprised of one-time severance charges, continuation of health benefits and outplacement services. As discussed above in \u201cOverview\u201d, in the quarter ended June 30, 2020, we reduced our work force by approximately 17%.\nOther Income and Expense\nOther income and expense consists primarily of interest income and expense, gain on repurchase of senior convertible notes and gain (loss) on disposal of property and equipment. Interest income\nrepresents interest received on our cash and cash equivalents. Interest expense consists primarily of the interest incurred on outstanding convertible debt and borrowings under our lease arrangements and credit facility. During the third quarter of 2020, we repurchased outstanding senior convertible notes which resulted in a gain.\nIncome Tax Expense\nIncome tax expense consists of U.S. federal and state income taxes. We incurred minimal income tax expense for 2020, 2019, and 2018. Net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes were approximately $326.9 million at December 31, 2020. State net operating loss carryforwards were approximately $294.4 million at December 31, 2020. Federal and state net operating loss carryforwards will expire at various dates beginning in 2021, if not utilized. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized.\nOn March 27, 2020, the \u201cCoronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act\u201d was signed into law. The CARES Act, among other things, includes provisions relating to refundable payroll tax credits, deferment of employer side social security payments, net operating loss carryback periods, alternative minimum tax credit refunds, modifications to the net interest deduction limitations and technical corrections to tax depreciation methods for qualified improvement property. Except for utilizing the deferment of employer social security payments, we do not expect the CARES Act to have a material impact on our financial results. We continue to examine the impacts the CARES Act may have on our business.\nAdoption of Leases Accounting Standard\nWe adopted the new accounting standard for Leases, Topic 842, on January 1, 2019. We applied the modified transition method at the beginning of adoption. Accordingly, we did not adjust prior period financial statements, and recognized a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of accumulated deficit in 2019.\nThe adoption of Topic 842 requires lessees, among other things, to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet for those leases classified as operating leases under previous authoritative guidance. We describe the effects of adoption of Topic 842 in more detail in Note 2 of our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nResults of Operations\nConsolidated Statements of Operations Data\nThe following table sets forth our consolidated statements of operations data for each of the periods indicated (in thousands).\nYear Ended December 31,\nRevenue\n$\n268,141\n$\n295,686\n$\n258,721\nCost of revenue(1)\n129,388\n144,090\n129,277\nGross profit\n138,753\n151,596\n129,444\nOperating expenses:\nSales and marketing(1)\n52,210\n76,049\n78,179\nResearch and development(1)\n46,175\n54,724\n47,902\nGeneral and administrative(1)\n37,720\n45,329\n43,062\nRestructuring costs(1)\n5,616\n-\n-\nTotal operating expenses\n141,721\n176,102\n169,143\nLoss from operations\n(2,968\n)\n(24,506\n)\n(39,699\n)\nOther income (expense):\nInterest income\n2,613\nInterest expense\n(23,071\n)\n(23,524\n)\n(13,156\n)\nGain on repurchase of convertible senior notes\n1,138\n-\n-\nOther expense\n(6\n)\n(71\n)\nTotal other expense, net\n(21,307\n)\n(20,982\n)\n(12,900\n)\nLoss before income taxes\n(24,275\n)\n(45,488\n)\n(52,599\n)\nIncome tax expense\nNet loss\n$\n(24,297\n)\n$\n(45,515\n)\n$\n(52,627\n)\n(1)\nCost of revenue and operating expenses include stock-based compensation expense as follows (in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31,\nCost of revenue\n$\n3,703\n$\n3,569\n$\n5,164\nSales and marketing\n3,081\n3,799\n6,764\nResearch and development\n2,555\n3,265\n5,510\nGeneral and administrative\n5,198\n8,939\n11,430\nRestructuring costs\n-\n-\n-\nThe following table sets forth our consolidated statements of operations data as a percentage of revenue for each of the periods indicated (as a percentage of revenue).\nYear Ended December 31,\nRevenue\n100.0\n%\n100.0\n%\n100.0\n%\nCost of revenue\n48.3\n48.7\n50.0\nGross profit\n51.7\n51.3\n50.0\nOperating expenses:\nSales and marketing\n19.5\n25.7\n30.2\nResearch and development\n17.2\n18.5\n18.5\nGeneral and administrative\n14.1\n15.3\n16.6\nRestructuring costs\n2.1\n-\n-\nTotal operating expenses\n52.9\n59.6\n65.4\nLoss from operations\n(1.1\n)\n(8.3\n)\n(15.3\n)\nOther income (expense):\nInterest income\n0.2\n0.9\n0.1\nInterest expense\n(8.6\n)\n(8.0\n)\n(5.1\n)\nGain on repurchase of convertible senior notes\n0.4\n-\n-\nOther expense\n-\n-\n-\nTotal other expense, net\n(7.9\n)\n(7.1\n)\n(5.0\n)\nLoss before income taxes\n(9.1\n)\n(15.4\n)\n(20.3\n)\nIncome tax expense\n-\n-\n-\nNet loss\n(9.1\n)\n%\n(15.4\n)\n%\n(20.3\n)\n%\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019\nRevenue\nYear Ended December 31,\nPercentage of\nPercentage of\nPeriod-to-Period Change\nAmount\nRevenue\nAmount\nRevenue\nAmount\nPercentage\n(in thousands)\nSubscription\n$\n179,743\n67.0\n%\n$\n195,091\n66.0\n%\n$\n(15,348\n)\n(7.9\n)\n%\nPlatform\n35,101\n13.1\n33,654\n11.4\n1,447\n4.3\nTotal software services\n$\n214,844\n80.1\n%\n$\n228,745\n77.4\n%\n$\n(13,901\n)\n(6.1\n)\n%\nProfessional services\n53,297\n19.9\n66,941\n22.6\n(13,644\n)\n(20.4\n)\nTotal revenue\n$\n268,141\n100.0\n%\n$\n295,686\n100.0\n%\n$\n(27,545\n)\n(9.3\n)\n%\nSubscription revenue decreased primarily due to a $14.5 million negative impact from the renegotiation of a customer contract and a $13.6 million negative impact from customers that terminated products and services. These decreases were partially offset by $13.5 million increases in revenue from the addition of new customers, contractual price increases and volume increases. An increase in specific reserves contributed to an additional decrease in subscription revenue of $1.9 million.\nPlatform revenue increased from growth in premiums and new products from Benefit Catalog, primarily from insurance carriers. As discussed above in \u201cComponents of Operating Results - Revenue\u201d, we recognize platform revenue from carriers over the policy period and we recognize commissions revenue at a point in time.\nThe decrease in professional services revenue was primarily attributable to a decrease in implementation revenue, customer-specific development, and the result of terminated services. The decreases were partially offset by increases from new and existing customers.\nWe expect total revenue to continue to be less in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, including a slowed sales cycle in 2020 and the effects of higher unemployment. As previously discussed, we experienced longer sales cycles in 2020 and a slowdown in new sales activity which will negatively impact subscription and platform revenue in future periods. Additionally, we expect revenue from health plan customers to decline in 2021 as some customers might renew their agreements with a lower minimum number of covered employees because of an increase in\nunemployment. We also expect professional services revenue to decrease as we focus on profitability by managing away from unprofitable work.\nCost of Revenue\nYear Ended December 31,\nPercentage of\nPercentage of\nPeriod-to-Period Change\nAmount\nRevenue\nAmount\nRevenue\nAmount\nPercentage\n(in thousands)\nCost of revenue\n$\n129,388\n48.3\n%\n$\n144,090\n48.7\n%\n$\n(14,702\n)\n(10.2\n)\n%\nThe decrease in cost of revenue was attributable to decreases in salaries and other personnel-related costs of $6.6 million, costs related to external development, engineering consulting, and customer support of $7.3 million, and travel-related expenses of $1.3 million. These decreases result from our actions taken during the year in response to the COVID-19 pandemic to maintain financial health and liquidity discussed above in \u201cOverview\u201d. These decreases were partially offset by increased depreciation expense of $2.7 million attributable to an increase in capitalized software development costs. Cost of revenue included $3.7 million and $3.6 million of stock-based compensation expense for years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and $18.8 million and $16.0 million of depreciation and amortization for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nGross Profit\nYear Ended December 31,\nPercentage of\nPercentage of\nPeriod-to-Period Change\nAmount\nRevenue\nAmount\nRevenue\nAmount\nPercentage\n(in thousands)\nSoftware services\n$\n138,393\n64.4\n%\n$\n157,221\n68.7\n%\n$\n(18,828\n)\n(12.0\n)\n%\nProfessional services\n0.7\n(5,625\n)\n(8.4\n)\n5,985\n(106.4\n)\nGross profit\n$\n138,753\n51.7\n%\n$\n151,596\n51.3\n%\n$\n(12,843\n)\n(8.5\n)\n%\nThe decrease in software services gross profit was driven by a $13.9 million, or 6%, decrease in software services revenue and an increase in software services cost of revenue of $4.9 million from increases in salary and personnel-related costs and depreciation expense. The increase in software services costs of revenue was primarily attributable to increased investment to support our ongoing customers and primarily driven by increases in salary and personnel-related costs and external development and engineering consulting of $5.1 million and depreciation and amortization expense of $2.3 million related to capitalized software development costs. The increase in software services cost of revenue included $2.1 million of stock-based compensation expense for each of the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and $15.5 million and $12.8 million of depreciation and amortization for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nProfessional services gross profit increased $6.0 million as professional services revenue decreased by $13.6 million and cost of revenue decreased by $19.6 million. The decrease in professional services cost of revenue is primarily attributable to decreases in salary and personnel-related costs due to headcount reductions that took place during the year, as well as decreased utilization of contract labor. Additionally, salaries and personnel-related costs were impacted by an increase in the deferral of fulfillment costs from carrier implementation projects and a decrease in amortization of capitalized fulfillment costs as older projects became fully amortized. Professional services cost of revenue included $1.6 million and $1.5 million of stock-based compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. In addition, professional services cost of revenue included $3.3 million and $3.2 million of depreciation and amortization for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nWe expect the trend of positive professional services margin to continue on an annual basis as a result of investing in accelerating automation and shifting to higher margin professional services work.\nOperating Expenses\nYear Ended December 31,\nPercentage of\nPercentage of\nPeriod-to-Period Change\nAmount\nRevenue\nAmount\nRevenue\nAmount\nPercentage\n(in thousands)\nSales and marketing\n$\n52,210\n19.5\n%\n$\n76,049\n25.7\n%\n$\n(23,839\n)\n(31.3\n)\n%\nResearch and development\n46,175\n17.2\n54,724\n18.5\n(8,549\n)\n(15.6\n)\nGeneral and administrative\n37,720\n14.1\n45,329\n15.3\n(7,609\n)\n(16.8\n)\nRestructuring costs\n5,616\n2.1\n-\n0.0\n5,616\n100.0\nThe decrease in sales and marketing expense was primarily attributable to a $16.8 million decrease in salaries and personnel-related costs, a $3.4 million decrease in travel-related costs, and a $3.2 million decrease in the cost of marketing events. These decreases result from our actions taken during the second quarter of 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic to maintain financial health and liquidity as discussed above in \u201cOverview\u201d. The decrease in salaries and personnel-related costs was driven by decreased headcount as well as lower commissions and bonuses earned caused by delays and longer sales cycle time for new sales activity as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The decrease in travel-related costs was driven by travel restrictions imposed in response to the pandemic. The cost of marketing events decreased in part as a result of moving our events, including our user conference, OnePlace, to a digital platform in response to the COVID-19 pandemic which resulted in lower costs in the current period compared to the prior period.\nThe decrease in research and development expense is primarily attributable to a decrease in personnel-related costs and external development and engineering consulting of $8.3 million. Additionally, a decrease of $0.5 million in travel-related costs was primarily attributable to travel restrictions imposed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe decrease in general and administrative expense was primarily attributable to a $5.2 million decrease in salaries and personnel-related costs as well as a decrease of $2.7 million in professional fees, travel-related costs and contract labor. These decreases result from our actions taken during the second quarter of 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic to maintain financial health and liquidity discussed as above in \u201cOverview\u201d.\nAs discussed above in \u201cOverview\u201d, in the quarter ended June 30, 2020, we reduced our work force by approximately 17%. Restructuring costs recognized as a result of this action was $5.6 million and consisted of $5.3 million of salaries and personnel-related expense related to severance payments. The remaining amount is attributable to professional fees for outplacement services and legal fees.\nStock-based Compensation\nCost of revenue and operating expenses include an aggregate of $14.5 million and $19.6 million of stock-based compensation for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, representing a decrease of $5.0 million. The decrease is primarily attributable to the benefit from cancellations of RSUs during 2020 from associates that left the Company and a decrease in the aggregate fair value of RSUs granted during the year.\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2019 and 2018\nRevenue\nYear Ended December 31,\nPercentage of\nPercentage of\nPeriod-to-Period Change\nAmount\nRevenue\nAmount\nRevenue\nAmount\nPercentage\n(in thousands)\nSubscription\n$\n195,091\n66.0\n%\n$\n179,410\n69.3\n%\n$\n15,681\n8.7\n%\nPlatform\n33,654\n11.4\n22,938\n8.9\n10,716\n46.7\nTotal software services\n$\n228,745\n77.4\n%\n$\n202,348\n78.2\n%\n$\n26,397\n13.0\n%\nProfessional services\n66,941\n22.6\n56,373\n21.8\n10,568\n18.7\nTotal revenue\n$\n295,686\n100.0\n%\n$\n258,721\n100.0\n%\n$\n36,965\n14.3\n%\nSubscription revenue includes $11.1 million of revenue associated with assets acquired from Connecture in February 2019. Additionally, subscription revenue increased $9.5 million from the net addition of new customers, contractual price increases, and volume increases. These increases were offset by a $6.0 million decrease in subscription revenue from the renegotiation of a customer contract and decreases from customers that terminated products and services. Additionally, sales allowance decreased resulting in an increase in subscription revenue of $1.0 million.\nPlatform revenue increased from growth in premiums and new products from Benefit Catalog which resulted in an increase of $7.3 million in Benefit Catalog carrier revenue and an increase of $3.4 million in revenue from broker and supplier commissions. As discussed above in \u201cComponents of Operating Results - Revenue\u201d, platform revenue from carriers is recognized over the policy period and commissions revenue is recognized at a point in time.\nThe increase in professional services revenue was primarily attributable to an increase of $12.5 million from work performed related to the customer contracts acquired from Connecture in February 2019 and a $1.3 million increase in customer support from new and existing customers. These increases were offset by a net decrease of $3.7 million from professional services work for customers in 2018 that did not recur in 2019. Professional services revenue increased as a percentage of total revenue in the current year compared to the prior year primarily as result of revenue from the Connecture acquisition. We expect this trend to end after the first quarter of 2020 when comparable periods will include the results of the Connecture operations for the full period.\nCost of Revenue\nYear Ended December 31,\nPercentage of\nPercentage of\nPeriod-to-Period Change\nAmount\nRevenue\nAmount\nRevenue\nAmount\nPercentage\n(in thousands)\nCost of revenue\n$\n144,090\n48.7\n%\n$\n129,277\n50.0\n%\n$\n14,813\n11.5\n%\nThe increase in cost of revenue in absolute terms was primarily attributable to an increase in salaries and other personnel-related costs of $8.0 million and increased depreciation expense of $4.1 million. The increase in salaries and personnel-related costs is primarily attributable to the workforce acquired from Connecture in February 2019 partially offset by decreases related to our cost structure in place prior to the acquisition. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense is attributable to the amortization of acquired intangibles from the Connecture acquisition as well as higher depreciation expense related to an increase in capitalized software development costs and the impact of the adoption of the new lease accounting standard at the beginning of 2019. Cost of revenue decreased as a percentage of revenue as we continued to achieve economies of scale. Cost of revenue included $3.6 million and $5.2 million of stock-based compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and $16.0 million and $11.9 million of depreciation and amortization for the years ended December 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nGross Profit\nYear Ended December 31,\nPercentage of\nPercentage of\nPeriod-to-Period Change\nAmount\nRevenue\nAmount\nRevenue\nAmount\nPercentage\n(in thousands)\nSoftware services\n$\n157,221\n68.7\n%\n$\n136,344\n67.4\n%\n$\n20,877\n15.3\n%\nProfessional services\n(5,625\n)\n(8.4\n)\n(6,900\n)\n(12.2\n)\n1,275\n(18.5\n)\nGross profit\n$\n151,596\n51.3\n%\n$\n129,444\n50.0\n%\n$\n22,152\n17.1\n%\nThe increase in software services gross profit was driven by a $26.4 million, or 13.0%, increase in revenue partially offset by a $5.5 million, or 8.4%, increase in software services cost of revenue. Software services cost of revenue included $2.1 million and $3.0 million of stock-based compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and $12.8 million and $10.0 million of depreciation and amortization for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. As discussed above, we are not able to meaningfully separate and assign costs of revenues to subscription and platform revenue separately.\nThe improvement in professional services gross loss was driven by a $10.6 million, or 18.7%, increase in professional services revenue. This increase was partially offset by an increase in professional services cost of revenue of $9.3 million. Professional services cost of revenue included $1.5 million and $2.2 million of stock-based compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. In addition, professional services cost of revenue included $3.2 million and $1.9 million in depreciation and amortization for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nOperating Expenses\nYear Ended December 31,\nPercentage of\nPercentage of\nPeriod-to-Period Change\nAmount\nRevenue\nAmount\nRevenue\nAmount\nPercentage\n(in thousands)\nSales and marketing\n$\n76,049\n25.7\n%\n$\n78,179\n30.2\n%\n$\n(2,130\n)\n(2.7\n)\n%\nResearch and development\n54,724\n18.5\n47,902\n18.5\n6,822\n14.2\nGeneral and administrative\n45,329\n15.3\n43,062\n16.6\n2,267\n5.3\nRestructuring costs\n-\n0.0\n-\n0.0\n-\n0.0\nThe decrease in sales and marketing expense in absolute terms was primarily attributable to a decrease of $3.9 million in salaries and personnel-related costs and a decrease in travel-related costs of $0.3 million, partially offset by an increase of $1.4 million increase in the cost of marketing events that occurred during 2019 and IT-related costs. Salaries and personnel-related costs decreased primarily due to a decrease in number of sales associates that occurred starting in the second half of 2018. As a result we experienced lower salary expense and sales bonuses, as well as lower stock-based compensation. Stock-based compensation decreased primarily as a result of the forfeiture of stock awards related to the departure of employees who separated from the Company during the year. These decreases in salaries were partially offset by a decrease in the amount of commission expense capitalized in 2019 compared to 2018. As discussed above in \u201cComponents of Operating Results-Operating Expenses\u201d, certain sales commissions are capitalized and amortized over a period generally equal to four to five years.\nThe increase in research and development expense is primarily attributable to costs related to the workforce acquired from Connecture in February 2019. Additionally, depreciation and amortization and IT-related costs increased by $2.0 million. These increases were partially offset by an increase of $2.4 million in the amount of personnel-related costs capitalized for software development.\nThe increase in general and administrative expense was primarily attributable to a net increase of $2.6 million in salary and personnel-related costs primarily as increases from investing in our business operations function were partly offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation of $2.5 million. Additionally, depreciation and amortization, IT-related expense, contract labor, travel-related and other operating expenses increased $2.3 million and insurance expense increased $0.2 million in connection with the acquisition of assets from Connecture. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in professional and consulting costs of $2.8 million as implementation costs of the new lease accounting\nstandard incurred in 2019 were more than offset by a decrease in professional fees associated with the adoption of the leasing and revenue accounting standards and internal control testing incurred during 2018.\nStock-based Compensation\nCost of revenue and operating expenses include an aggregate of $19.6 million and $28.9 million of stock-based compensation for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, representing a decrease of $9.3 million, or a 32.2% decrease. The decrease is primarily attributable to expense from performance-based awards as the achievement of performance measures was lower for awards granted in 2019 compared to 2018. Additionally, expense decreased from the forfeitures of awards from employees who separated from the Company.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nOur management\u2019s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses. In accordance with GAAP, we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results might differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nWhile our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe the following accounting policies are critical to the process of making significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition - Estimation of Platform Revenue from Insurance Broker Commissions\nOur platform revenue from insurance broker commissions and Benefit Catalog supplier transactions is recognized at the point when the orders for the policies are received and transferred to the insurance carrier or supplier. The transaction price is reduced by constraints for variable consideration associated with collectability, policy cancellation and termination risks. We estimate variable consideration primarily using the expected value method based on both historical and current estimates. We then use judgment to develop constraints on the estimated variable consideration included in the transaction price to account for risks in collectability, policy cancellation and termination. Changes in those estimates can have a material effect on the amount of revenue recognized in a period. During 2020, the constraint rate decreased by approximately 1%, or less than 0.2 percentage points, during the year. An increase in the constraint rate of one percentage point, would negatively impact revenue recognized in 2020 by approximately $0.1 million.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSources of Liquidity\nAs of December 31, 2020, our primary sources of liquidity were our cash and cash equivalents totaling $90.7 million, $95.1 million in marketable securities, $22.2 million in accounts receivables, net of allowance, and unused availability under our revolving line of credit of $50.0 million.\nWe entered into a new revolving line of credit agreement with Silicon Valley Bank on March 3, 2020. This agreement replaces our previous agreement with Silicon Valley Bank, which expired on February 20, 2020. The new three-year agreement has a borrowing limit of $50 million, with the ability for us to increase it up to $100 million. We are bound by customary representations and warranties and restrictive covenants in connection with the revolving line of credit, including financial covenants related to quick ratio and EBITDA. In the event of a default, the lenders may declare all obligations immediately due and stop advancing money or extending credit under the line of credit. The line of credit is collateralized by substantially all of our personal property assets, including intellectual property and the equity of our\nsubsidiaries. The terms of our revolving line of credit are described in Note 11 of the unaudited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIn June 2020, we issued 1,777,778 shares of Series A Preferred Stock (the \u201cPreferred Stock\u201d) at a purchase price of $45 per share, resulting in total gross proceeds of approximately $80 million. The Preferred Stock ranks senior to our common stock with respect to dividends and distributions on liquidation, winding-up and dissolution. Each share of the Preferred Stock has an initial stated value of $45 per share. Holders of shares of the Preferred Stock are entitled a dividend equal to 8.00% per annum (the \u201cRegular Dividends\u201d), payable quarterly, beginning on June 30, 2020. The Regular Dividends are payable in cash or in kind, at our option. In the event a Regular Dividend is paid in kind, the stated value of each share of the Preferred Stock will be increased by an amount equal to the accrued Regular Dividend not paid in cash. As of December 31, 2020, we had paid all of the Preferred Stock dividends in cash. Holders of the Preferred Stock are also entitled to participate in and receive any dividends declared or paid on the common stock on an as-converted basis, and no dividends may be paid to holders of the common stock unless full participating dividends are concurrently paid to the holders of the Preferred Stock. Each holder of the Preferred Stock has the right, at its option, to convert its shares of the Preferred Stock, in whole or in part, into fully paid and non-assessable shares of the common stock, at any time and from time to time. The number of shares of the common stock into which a share of the Preferred Stock will convert at any time is equal to the quotient obtained by dividing its stated value then in effect plus any accumulated and unpaid Regular Dividends by its conversion price of $15.00. The conversion price is subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, including in the event of any stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization or similar events. At closing, before payment of any dividends in kind, the 1,777,778 shares of the Preferred Stock were convertible into 5,333,334 shares of common stock. We may, at our option, redeem the outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock following the fourth anniversary of issuance. Redemption by us is subject to certain liquidity conditions, as well conditions connected with the trading price of its common stock. The terms of the Preferred Stock are described in Note 13 of our unaudited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIn December 2018, we issued $240 million aggregate principal amount of 1.25% convertible senior notes (the \u201cNotes\u201d) due December 15, 2023, unless earlier purchased by us or converted by the holder pursuant to their terms. Interest is payable semiannually in arrears on June 15 and December 15 of each year. Upon conversion, we will pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of our common stock or a combination, at our election. The Notes have an initial conversion rate of 18.8076 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount. This represents an initial effective conversion price of approximately $53.17 per share of common stock.\nIn connection with the issuance of the Notes, we entered into capped call transactions with certain counterparties affiliated with the initial purchasers and others. The capped call transactions are expected to reduce potential dilution of earnings per share upon conversion of the Notes. Under the capped call transactions, we purchased capped call options that in the aggregate relate to the total number of shares of our common stock underlying the Notes, with an initial strike price of approximately $53.17 per share, which corresponds to the initial conversion price of the Notes and is subject to anti-dilution adjustments substantially similar to those applicable to the conversion rate of the Notes, and have a cap price of approximately $89.98. The terms of the Notes are described further in Note 10 of our unaudited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nDuring the third quarter of 2020, we repurchased Notes with an aggregate principal amount of $18.8 million for an aggregate of $14.6 million in cash. As of the end of the third quarter of 2020, the remaining outstanding Notes were convertible into 4,161,182 shares of common stock. In connection with the purchase of the Notes, we terminated a portion of the capped call transactions which resulted in an immaterial amount of payments to us in cash and shares of our common stock.\nOur cash flows from operations has improved in recent years and turned positive for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2018. However, for the year ended December 31, 2019, cash flows from operations were negative due to timing in changes in working capital, a decrease in the balance of deferred revenue and the impact of acquired deferred revenue which yields revenue with no cash inflows. We expect the trend of positive cash flows from operations in at least the near term as we continue to manage our costs.\nBased on our current level of operations and anticipated growth, we believe our future cash flows from operating activities and existing cash balances will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements for at least the next 12 months.\nGoing forward, we may access capital markets to raise additional equity or debt financing for various business reasons, including required debt payments and acquisitions. The timing, term, size, and pricing of any such financing will depend on investor interest and market conditions, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any such financing on favorable terms or at all.\nOperating and Capital Expenditure Requirements and Contractual Obligations\nWe believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities balances and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements through at least the next 12 months.\nOur short-term material cash requirements as of December 31, 2020 are primarily comprised of lease obligations, dividends on our Preferred Stock, interest on our convertible senior notes, and payments to vendors related to our technology infrastructure. These obligations will be funded from cash from operations and our balances of current assets.\nOur long-term material cash requirements as of December 31, 2020 include lease obligations, repayment of our convertible senior notes, if not converted, and dividends on our Preferred Stock, if not converted or paid in kind. Our long-term obligations will be funded from cash from operations, balances of current assets, and if necessary, borrowing under our revolving line of credit or future credit arrangements, the sale of debt securities, or sale of equity.\nIn addition, we are reassessing our need for office space and have listed certain of our facilities for sublease, including our headquarters campus in Charleston, South Carolina and our office in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Since March 2020, most of our associates have worked remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic. While our facilities have remained open and accessible, they have been underutilized since March 2020. Many associates have expressed interest in a remote or flexible work situation after the risk of infection from COVID-19 diminishes. The timing, amount of space to ultimately be sublet, expected amount of sublease income, and amount of impairment loss we might recognize in connection with a sublease, if any, is uncertain. Any amounts received under subleases would offset our lease payments and reduce our cash requirements associated with our lease obligations.\nThe details of the arrangements that give rise to these short- and long-term cash requirements are described in more detail in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our customer growth rate, subscription renewal activity, the timing and extent of development efforts, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, the introduction of new and enhanced services offerings, and the continuing market acceptance of our services. We might require additional capital beyond our currently anticipated amounts. If our available cash and cash equivalents balances are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements, we may seek to sell equity or convertible debt securities or enter into an additional credit facility. The sale of equity and convertible debt securities may result in dilution to our stockholders and those securities may have rights senior to those of our common shares. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of convertible debt securities, these securities could contain covenants that would restrict our operations. Additional capital might not be available on reasonable terms, or at all.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn August 2020, the FASB issued No. ASU 2020-06, \u201cDebt - Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entity\u2019s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40)\u201d. The update simplifies the accounting for convertible debt instruments and convertible preferred stock by reducing the number of accounting models and the number of embedded conversion features that could be recognized separately from the primary contract. This ASU also enhances transparency and improves disclosures for convertible instruments and earnings per share guidance. It is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning January 1, 2022. Early adoption is permitted after January 1, 2021. This update permits the use of either the modified retrospective or fully retrospective method of\ntransition. We are currently evaluating the timing and impact of the adoption of ASU 2020-06 on our consolidated financial statements, but we anticipate that it will result in a reduction in non-cash interest expense related to the Notes.\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-12 \u201cIncome Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes\u201d. This ASU is intended to simplify various aspects related to accounting for income taxes, eliminates certain exceptions to the general principles in ASC Topic 740 related to intra-period tax allocation, simplifies when companies recognize deferred taxes in an interim period, and clarifies certain aspects of the current guidance to promote consistent application. This ASU is effective for interim and annual reporting periods starting January 1, 2021. We are currently evaluating the potential effects of this guidance on our consolidated financial statements.\nWe are evaluating other accounting standards and exposure drafts that have been issued or proposed by the FASB or other standards setting bodies that do not require adoption until a future date to determine whether adoption will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.",
    "item_7A": "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Risk.\nMarket risk is the risk of loss to future earnings, values or future cash flows that may result from changes in the price of a financial instrument. The value of a financial instrument might change as a result of changes in interest rates, exchange rates, commodity prices, equity prices and other market changes. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative, hedging or trading purposes, although in the future we might enter into exchange rate hedging arrangements to manage the risks described below.\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates. On March 3, 2020, we entered into a new revolving line of credit agreement. Borrowings under the new agreement bear interest at rates that are variable. Increases in the Prime Rate or federal funds rate will increase the interest rate on borrowings under the new agreement.\nChanges in interest rates may also impact gains or losses from the conversion of our outstanding convertible senior notes. In December 2018, we issued $240.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our 1.25% convertible senior notes due 2023, or the Notes. Upon certain events and/or if certain conditions are met, the Notes can be redeemed into cash, or converted into cash, shares or combination of cash and shares. Upon conversion or redemption, we are required to record a gain or loss for the difference between the fair value of the debt to be extinguished and its corresponding net carrying value. The fair value of the debt to be extinguished depends on our then-current incremental borrowing rate. If our incremental borrowing rate at the time of conversion is higher or lower than the implied interest rate of the Notes, we will record a gain or loss in our consolidated statements of operations during the period in which the Notes are converted. The implicit interest rate for the notes is 7.30%. An incremental borrowing rate that is a hypothetical 100 basis points lower than the implicit interest rate upon conversion of $240.0 million aggregate principal amount of the Notes would result in a loss of approximately $2.4 million.\nInterest Rate Sensitivity\nWe are subject to interest rate risk in connection with borrowings under the revolving line of credit agreement, which are subject to a variable interest rate. As of December 31, 2020, there were no amounts due under the agreement. Any debt we incur in the future may also bear interest at variable rates.\nInflation Risk\nWe do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. We continue to monitor the impact of inflation in order to minimize its effects through pricing strategies, productivity improvements and cost reductions. If our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases. Our inability or failure to do so could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.",

(the Company) as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, changes in stockholders' equity (deficit) and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the \u201cconsolidated financial statements\u201d). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated March 9, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nAdoption of ASU No. 2016-13\nAs discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its method of accounting for leases in 2019 due to the adoption of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), and the related amendments.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the account or disclosure to which it relates.\nRevenue Recognition - Estimation of Platform Revenue from Insurance Broker Commissions\nDescription of the Matter\nAs described in Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements, platform revenue from insurance broker commissions are recognized at a point in time when the orders for the policies are received and transferred to the insurance carrier. The amount of revenue recognized is based on the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for transferring services to the insurance carrier. The Company\u2019s broker commission arrangements contain a component of variable consideration. Management estimates variable consideration primarily using the expected value method, based on both historical and current estimates of collectability, policy cancellation and termination information. The Company then utilizes judgment to develop constraints on the estimated variable consideration included in the transaction price to account for risks in collectability, policy cancellation and termination. Changes in those estimates can have a material effect on the amount of revenue recognized.\nAuditing the Company\u2019s assessment of the estimated constraint requires a high degree of auditor judgment due to the subjectivity in the assumptions utilized in the estimation. Specifically, there is uncertainty in the transaction price given the policy may be cancelled or terminated. Further, there is collections risk given the commissions revenues are receivable over the term of policy period, which occurs after the performance obligation has been satisfied.\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company's process to estimate variable consideration and establish constraints, including determining the underlying assumptions. For example, we tested controls over management's review of the significant inputs and assumptions including collectability, policy cancellation and termination risk.\nOur audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the methodology used, analyzing the significant assumptions discussed above, and testing the accuracy and completeness of the underlying data used in management's calculation. This included testing inputs to the calculation by evaluating historical information by comparing to source documents and performing sensitivity analyses to evaluate the changes in variable consideration that could result from changes in the Company\u2019s significant assumptions, including whether alternative assumptions could be more appropriate. We assessed the historical accuracy of management's estimates for variable consideration and the related assumptions by performing a retrospective review on the accuracy of prior period estimates.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nWe have served as the Company\u2019s auditor since 2008.\nCharlotte, North Carolina\nMarch 9, 2021\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Benefitfocus, Inc.\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Benefitfocus, Inc.\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 Framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Benefitfocus, Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on the COSO criteria.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of Benefitfocus, Inc. as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, changes in stockholders' equity (deficit) and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes and our report dated March 9, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company\u2019s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management\u2019s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance

Organization and Description of Business\nBenefitfocus, Inc. (the \u201cCompany\u201d) provides a leading cloud-based benefits management platform for consumers, employers, health plans (also known as insurance carriers) and brokers that is designed to simplify how organizations and individuals transact benefits. The financial statements of the Company include the financial position and operations of its wholly owned subsidiaries, Benefitfocus.com, Inc. and BenefitStore, Inc.\n2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThese consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d). The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The Company is not the primary beneficiary of, nor does it have a controlling financial interest in, any variable interest entity. Accordingly, the Company has not consolidated any variable interest entity.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Such estimates include allowances for doubtful accounts and returns, valuations of deferred income taxes, long-lived assets, capitalizable software development costs and the related amortization, incremental borrowing rate used in lease accounting, the determination of the useful lives of assets, and the impairment assessment of acquired intangibles and goodwill. Additionally as described in revenue and deferred revenue below, estimates are utilized in association with revenue recognition, in particular the estimation of variable consideration using the expected value method from insurance broker commissions reported in Platform revenue. Determination of these transactions and account balances are based on, among other things, the Company\u2019s estimates and judgments. These estimates are based on the Company\u2019s knowledge of current events and actions it may undertake in the future as well as on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates.\nRestructuring Costs\nOn April 28, 2020, the Company announced a restructuring plan to contain costs and further strengthen its liquidity profile in response to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. This plan resulted in a reduction in the Company\u2019s U.S. workforce of approximately 17%. The Company recorded restructuring costs of $5,616 in the second quarter of 2020 from one-time severance charges, continuation of health benefits and outplacement services. Restructuring costs are presented separately in operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. The plan was implemented and completed in the second quarter of 2020.\nRevenue and Deferred Revenue\nThe Company derives its revenue primarily from fees for subscription services and professional services sold to employers and insurance carriers as well as platform revenue derived from the value of products sold on our platform. Revenue is recognized when control of these services is transferred to customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those services. Taxes collected from customers relating to services and remitted to governmental authorities are excluded from revenue.\nThe Company determines revenue recognition through the following steps:\n\u2022\nIdentification of each contract with a customer;\n\u2022\nIdentification of the performance obligations in the contract;\n\u2022\nDetermination of the transaction price;\n\u2022\nAllocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and\n\u2022\nRecognition of revenue when, or as, performance obligations are satisfied.\nSoftware Services Revenue\nSoftware services revenue consists of subscription revenue and platform revenue.\nSubscription Revenue\nSubscription revenue primarily consists of monthly subscription fees paid to the Company by its employer and insurance carrier customers for access to, and usage of, cloud-based benefits software solutions for a specified contract term. Fees are generally charged based on the number of employees or subscribers with access to the solution.\nSubscription services revenue is generally recognized on a ratable basis over the contract term beginning on the date the subscription services are made available to the customer. The Company\u2019s subscription service contracts are generally three years.\nSubscription revenue also includes fees paid for other services, such as event sponsorships and certain data services.\nPlatform Revenue\nPlatform revenue is generated from the value of policies or products enrolled in through the Company\u2019s marketplace. Platform revenue from carriers is generally recognized over the policy period of the enrolled products. In arrangements where the Company sells policies to employees of its customers as the broker, it earns broker commissions. Revenue from insurance broker commissions and supplier transactions is recognized at a point in time when the orders for the policies are received and transferred to the insurance carrier or supplier, and is reduced by constraints for variable consideration associated with collectability, policy cancellation and termination risks.\nProfessional Services Revenue\nProfessional services revenue primarily consists of fees related to the implementation of software products purchased by customers. Professional services typically include discovery, configuration and deployment, integration, testing, and training. Fees from consulting services and support services are also included in professional services revenue.\nThe Company determined that implementation services for certain of its insurance carrier customers significantly modify or customize the software solution and, as such, do not represent a distinct performance obligation. Accordingly, revenue from such implementation services with these insurance carrier customers are generally recognized over the contract term of the associated subscription services contract, including any extension periods representing a material right. In certain arrangements, the Company utilizes estimates of hours as a measure of progress to determine revenue.\nRevenue from implementation services with employer customers is generally recognized as those services are performed.\nRevenue from support and training fees is recognized over the service period.\nContracts with Multiple Performance Obligations\nCertain of the Company\u2019s contracts with customers contain multiple performance obligations. For these contracts, the individual performance obligations are accounted for separately if they are distinct. The Company allocates the transaction price to the separate performance obligations based on their relative standalone selling prices. The Company determines the standalone selling prices based on its overall pricing objectives, taking into consideration market conditions and other factors, including the value of its contracts, the subscription services sold, customer size and complexity, and the number and types of users under the contracts.\nContract Costs\nThe Company capitalizes costs to obtain contracts that are considered incremental and recoverable, such as sales commissions. Payments of sales commissions generally include multiple payments. The Company capitalizes only those payments made within an insignificant time from the contract inception, typically three months or less. Subsequent payments are expensed as incurred. The capitalized costs are amortized to sales and marketing expense over the estimated period of benefit of the asset, which is generally four to five years. The Company expenses the costs to obtain a contract when the amortization period is less than one year. Deferred costs related to obtaining contracts are included in deferred contract costs and other non-current assets.\nThe Company capitalizes contract fulfillment costs directly associated with customer contracts that are not related to satisfying performance obligations. The costs are amortized to cost of revenue over the estimated period of benefit, which is generally five years. Deferred fulfillment costs are included in deferred contract costs and other non-current assets.\nThe following tables present information about deferred contract costs:\nAs of December 31,\nBalance of deferred contract costs\nCosts to obtain contracts\n$\n5,624\n$\n6,676\nCosts to fulfill contracts\n$\n3,639\n$\n3,112\nYear ended December 31,\nAmortization of deferred contract costs\nCosts to obtain contracts included in sales and marketing expense\n$\n3,275\n$\n3,662\n$\n4,217\nCosts to fulfill contracts included in cost of revenue\n$\n1,285\n$\n2,790\n$\n3,480\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue primarily consists of employee compensation, professional services, data center co-location costs, networking expenses, depreciation expense for computer equipment directly associated with generating revenue, amortization expense for capitalized software development costs, and infrastructure maintenance costs. In addition, the Company allocates a portion of overhead, such as facilities and security costs, additional depreciation and amortization expense, and employee benefit costs, to cost of revenue based on headcount.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents consist of bank checking accounts and money market accounts. The Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents.\nMarketable Securities\nMarketable securities consist of short-term investments in corporate bonds, commercial paper, and U.S. Treasury and agency bonds. To reflect its intention, the Company classifies its marketable securities as held-to-maturity at the time of purchase. As a result, the marketable securities are recorded at amortized cost and any gains or losses realized upon maturity are reported in other expense, net in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\nDebt securities classified as held-to-maturity are subject to the expected credit loss model prescribed under Accounting Standards Update (\u201cASU\u201d) No. 2016-13, \u201cFinancial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses of Financial Instruments\u201d. The Company utilizes a lifetime expected credit loss measurement objective for the recognition of credit losses for held-to-maturity securities at the time the financial asset is originated or acquired. The Company measures expected credit losses on its held-to-maturity portfolio on a collective basis by major security type. The expected\ncredit losses are adjusted each period for changes in expected lifetime credit losses. The Company\u2019s credit loss calculations for held-to-maturity securities are based upon historical default and recovery rates of bonds rated with the same rating as its portfolio. An adjustment factor is applied to these credit loss calculations based upon the Company\u2019s assessment of the expected impact from current economic conditions on its investments. The Company monitors the credit quality of debt securities classified as held-to-maturity through the use of their respective credit rating and updates them on a quarterly basis. The allowance for credit losses is discussed in Note 6.\nConcentrations of Credit Risk\nThe Company\u2019s financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents, marketable securities, and accounts receivable. All of the Company\u2019s cash and cash equivalents are held at financial institutions that management believes to be of high credit quality. The bank deposits of the Company might, at times, exceed federally insured limits and are generally uninsured and uncollateralized. The Company has not experienced any losses on cash and cash equivalents to date.\nTo manage credit risk related to marketable securities, the Company invests in various types of highly rated corporate bonds, commercial paper, and various U.S. backed securities with maturities of less than two years. The weighted average maturity of the portfolio of investments must not exceed nine months, per the Company\u2019s investment policy\nTo manage accounts receivable risk, the Company evaluates the creditworthiness of its customers and maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts. Accounts receivable are unsecured and derived from revenue earned from customers located in the United States. No customer exceeded 10% of total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. One customer represented approximately 13% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018. No customer exceeded 10% of accounts receivable as of December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2019, one customer represented approximately 11% of total accounts receivable.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nHistorically, the Company used an incurred loss model to calculate its allowance for doubtful accounts. Upon the adoption of ASU No. 2016-13, \u201cFinancial Instruments - Credit Losses\u201d (Topic 326) on January 1, 2020, the Company shifted to a current expected credit loss model. Accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts are discussed in Note 7.\nProperty and Equipment and Capitalized Software Development Costs\nProperty and equipment, including capitalized software development costs, are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Expenditures for major additions and improvements are capitalized. Depreciation and amortization are recognized over the estimated useful lives of the related assets using the straight-line method.\nThe estimated useful lives for significant property and equipment categories are generally as follows:\nBuildings, leased (prior to adoption of ASC 842)\n30 years\nDeveloped software\n3 years\nComputers and related equipment\n3-5 years\nPurchased software and licenses\n1-7 years\nLeasehold improvements\nLesser of estimated useful life of asset or lease term\nFurniture and fixtures\n7 years\nOther equipment\n5-12 years\nVehicles\n5 years\nUseful lives of significant assets are periodically reviewed and adjusted prospectively to reflect the Company\u2019s current estimates of the respective assets\u2019 expected utility. Costs associated with maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred.\nThe Company capitalizes certain costs related to its software developed or obtained for internal use. Costs related to preliminary project activities and post-implementation activities are expensed as incurred. Internal and external costs incurred during the application development stage, including upgrades and enhancements representing modifications that will result in significant additional functionality, are capitalized. Software maintenance and training costs are expensed as incurred. Capitalized costs are recorded as part of property and equipment and are amortized on a straight-line basis to cost of revenue over the software\u2019s estimated useful life, which is three years. The Company evaluates these assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets.\nIdentifiable Intangible Assets\nIdentifiable intangible assets with finite lives are recorded at their fair values at the date of acquisition and are amortized on a straight-line basis over their respective estimated useful lives, which is the period over which the asset is expected to contribute directly or indirectly to future cash flows.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nThe Company reviews long-lived assets and definite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset might not be recoverable. Recoverability of the long-lived asset is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the asset or asset group to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated. If such assets are not recoverable, the impairment to be recognized, if any, is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the estimated fair value (discounted cash flow) of the assets or asset group. Assets held for sale are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value, less costs to sell. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, management believes that the carrying amount of all long-lived assets are recoverable and has not identified any assets as being for sale.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the aggregate of the fair value of consideration transferred in a business combination over the fair value of assets acquired, net of liabilities assumed. The Company recorded goodwill in connection with its business combinations. Goodwill is not amortized, but is subject to an annual impairment test, as described below.\nThe Company performs a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value before testing goodwill for impairment for each reporting unit. The reporting units are determined by the components of the Company\u2019s operating segments that constitute a business for which both (1) discrete financial information is available and (2) segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component. If it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, the Company performs the impairment test by applying a fair-value-based test. The Company compares the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value. If the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of our reporting unit, an impairment loss is recorded equal to the difference.\nThe Company has one reporting unit. To determine the fair value of the Company\u2019s reporting unit, the Company has used its market capitalization. The Company may also determine fair value using discounted cash flow analysis, which requires significant assumptions and estimates about future operations. Significant judgments inherent in this analysis include the determination of an appropriate discount rate, estimated terminal value and the amount and timing of expected future cash flows.\nThe Company performs its annual goodwill impairment analysis as of October 31 of each year, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value.\nDebt Issuance Costs\nDebt issuance costs related to the convertible senior note financing have been recorded as a reduction of the carrying amount of the debt and are amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method.\nDebt issuance costs related to the revolving line of credit have been recorded in other non-current assets and are amortized to interest expense over the remaining life of the agreement.\nLeases (after adoption of ASC 842)\nThe Company periodically enters into finance leases for property and equipment. The leasing arrangements for the Company\u2019s office space at its headquarters campus are classified as finance leases. The Company also leases office space under operating leases.\nThe Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Right of use, or ROU, assets represent the Company\u2019s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term. Lease liabilities represent an obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Leases with a term of 12 months or less are not included in the recognized ROU assets and lease liabilities for all classes of assets.\nROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. Because the Company\u2019s operating leases do not provide an implicit interest rate, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on information available at commencement date to determine the present value of lease payments. The ROU asset also consists of any prepaid lease payments, lease incentives, or initial direct costs. The lease terms used to calculate the ROU asset and related lease liability include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option.\nLease expense for operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term as an operating expense while the expense for finance leases is recognized as depreciation expense and interest expense. The Company has lease agreements which require payments for lease and non-lease components (e.g. common area maintenance and equipment maintenance) that are accounted for as a single lease component. Variable lease payment amounts that cannot be determined at the commencement of the lease, such as maintenance costs based on future obligations, are not included in the ROU assets or liabilities. These are expensed as incurred and recorded as variable lease expense.\nFinancing Obligations\nFinancing obligations include liabilities for the purchase of software licenses and support.\nPrior to the adoption of ASC 842 on January 1, 2019, in its build-to-suit lease arrangements where the Company is involved in the construction of its buildings, the Company is deemed the owner for accounting purposes during the construction period. The Company records an asset for the amount of the total project costs in property and equipment, net and the related financing obligation in Lease Liabilities and Financing obligations on the consolidated balance sheets. Once construction is complete, the Company determines if the asset qualifies for sale-leaseback accounting treatment. If the arrangement does not qualify for sale-lease back treatment, the Company continues to reduce the obligation over the lease term as payments are made and depreciates the asset over its useful life. The Company does not report rent expense for the portion of the rent payment determined to be related to the assets that it owns for accounting purposes. Rather, this portion of the rent payment under the lease is recognized as a reduction of the financing obligation and as interest expense.\nAdvertising\nThe Company expenses advertising costs as they are incurred. Direct advertising costs for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 were $308, $332 and $391, respectively.\nComprehensive Loss\nThe Company\u2019s net loss equals comprehensive loss for all periods presented.\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe Company accounts for stock-based compensation awards, which include stock options and RSUs, based on the fair value of the award as of the grant date. The Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense over the period during which the award holder is required to perform services in exchange for the award, which is the vesting period. Compensation expense related to RSUs and stock options is recognized over the vesting period of the applicable award using the straight-line method. Compensation expense related to performance-based restricted stock units, which are accounted for as equity awards, is recognized on an accelerated attribution basis (graded vesting) when it is probable that the performance measure will be met.\nCompensation costs related to RSUs is based on the market price on the grant date. The Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model for estimating the fair value of stock options. The use of the option valuation model requires the input of subjective assumptions, including the expected life of the option and the expected stock price volatility. The Company recognizes the effect of forfeitures as they occur. The recognition of stock-based compensation expense associated with performance-based restricted stock units requires the estimation of the probability of achieving performance measures.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company uses the asset and liability method for income tax accounting. This method requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities, as well as for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount the Company believes is more likely than not to be realized. The tax benefits of uncertain tax positions are recognized only when the Company believes it is more likely than not that the tax position will be upheld on examination by the taxing authorities based on the merits of the position. The Company recognizes interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized income tax benefits in income tax expense. Income tax effects related to settlements of share-based payment awards are reported in earnings as an increase or decrease to income tax expense (benefit), net. Additionally, income tax-related cash flows resulting from share-based payments are reported as operating activities in the statement of cash flows.\nBasic and Diluted Net Loss per Common Share\nBasic net loss per share attributable to common stockholders is computed by dividing the net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted net loss per share is computed by giving effect to all potential shares of common stock, including outstanding stock options, outstanding warrants, common stock related to unvested restricted stock units and convertible senior notes to the extent dilutive, common stock related to the conversion of preferred stock to the extent dilutive, and common stock issuable pursuant to the ESPP. Basic and diluted net loss per share was the same for each period presented, as the inclusion of all potential common shares outstanding would have been anti-dilutive.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Standards\nFinancial instruments\nOn January 1, 2020, the Company adopted ASU No. 2016-13. The purpose of this ASU is to require a financial asset measured at amortized cost basis to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected. On adoption, the Company recorded an immaterial cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings in connection with expected credit losses on its trade receivables.\nFair Value Measurement\nOn January 1, 2020, the Company adopted ASU No. 2018-13, \u201cFair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement\u201d. The ASU modifies the disclosure requirements required for fair value measurements. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements.\nLeases\nOn January 1, 2019, the Company adopted ASU No. 2016-02, \u201cLeases (Topic 842)\u201d, codified as ASC 842. The amendments in this update require lessees, among other things, to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet for those leases classified as operating leases under previous authoritative guidance. ASC 842 introduces new disclosure requirements for leasing arrangements. The Company adopted this update using the modified retrospective transition method at the beginning of the period of adoption. Accordingly, the Company did not adjust prior period financial statements, and recognized a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of accumulated deficit in 2019 in the amount of $7,686. The Company utilized the following additional significant policy elections:\n\u2022\nElected the package of three transition practical expedients to not reassess:\no\nwhether any expired or existing contracts are or contain a lease;\no\nthe classification of any expired or existing leases; and\no\nthe treatment of initial direct costs.\n\u2022\nAdopted a policy to not separate lease and associated nonlease components for all classes of assets. The Company applied this policy to all existing leases on transition as well as new leases going forward.\n\u2022\nAdopted a policy to not include leases with a term of 12 months or less in the recognized ROU assets and lease liabilities for all classes of assets.\nThe adoption of this standard had a significant impact on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements as follows:\n\u2022\nNet assets of $21,019 and related financing obligations and other noncurrent liabilities of $34,909 for existing build-to-suit lease arrangements were derecognized. These leases were transitioned to the new standard based on an analysis of the lease balances as of the transition date as if they had been leases under ASC 840. Based on this analysis, the land component of these leases was combined with the remainder of the lease obligations. Historically, these obligations were accounted for separately and recognized as part of facilities expense and allocated to cost of revenue and operating expenses. Amounts recognized included $56,422 of net ROU assets, $2,848 of net leasehold improvements, and $63,952 of total finance lease liabilities. The net cumulative adjustment to accumulated deficit to derecognize and transition these leases was $7,686.\n\u2022\nFinance lease liabilities and ROU assets of $3,589 were recorded related to payment obligations for nonlease components (e.g. common area maintenance and equipment maintenance) associated with existing capital leases.\n\u2022\nOperating lease liabilities and ROU assets of $1,169 were recorded related to existing operating lease obligations.\nAccounting Standards Not Yet Adopted\nIn August 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-06, \u201cDebt - Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entity\u2019s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40)\u201d. The update simplifies the accounting for convertible debt instruments and convertible preferred stock by reducing the number of accounting models and the number of embedded conversion features that could be recognized separately from the primary contract. This ASU also enhances transparency and improves disclosures for convertible instruments and earnings per share guidance. It is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2021, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, but no earlier than fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020. This update permits the use of either the modified retrospective or fully retrospective method of transition. The Company is currently evaluating the timing and impact of the adoption of ASU 2020-06 on the Company's consolidated financial statements, but anticipates that it will result in a reduction in non-cash interest expense related to the Convertible Senior Notes.\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-12, \u201cIncome Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes\u201d. ASU No. 2019-12 is intended to simplify various aspects related to\naccounting for income taxes, eliminates certain exceptions to the general principles in ASC Topic 740 related to intra-period tax allocation, simplifies when companies recognize deferred taxes in an interim period, and clarifies certain aspects of the current guidance to promote consistent application. This ASU is effective for the Company for the interim and annual reporting periods starting January 1, 2021. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the potential effects of this guidance on its consolidated financial statements.\n3. Business Combination\nOn February 25, 2019, the Company purchased certain operating assets and liabilities, intellectual property and intangible assets, including the workforce in place, of the commercial business of Connecture, Inc., for $20,914 ($24,000 before working capital adjustments). This acquisition added technology to potentially strengthen the Company\u2019s platform, expand its customer reach, and enhance the value the Company delivers to its carrier customers.\nThe following table summarizes the fair value of the consideration paid and the amounts of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed recognized at the acquisition date:\nConsideration Transferred\nCash\n$\n19,914\nContingent consideration arrangement\n1,000\nFair value of total consideration transferred\n$\n20,914\nRecognized Amounts of Identifiable Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed\nAccounts receivable, net\n$\nContract, prepaid and other current assets\nProperty and equipment, net\nOperating lease right-of-use assets\n1,107\nIntangible assets, net\n14,600\nDeferred contract costs and other non-current assets\nAccrued expenses\n(2\n)\nAccrued compensation and benefits\n(186\n)\nDeferred revenue, current portion\n(6,692\n)\nOperating lease ROU liabilities, current portion\n(84\n)\nOperating lease ROU liabilities, net of current portion\n(1,023\n)\nTotal identifiable net assets\n9,691\nGoodwill\n11,223\nTotal identifiable net assets and goodwill\n$\n20,914\nThe goodwill of $11,223 arising from the acquisition consists largely of the value of the acquired organized workforce as well as economies of scale. The Company expects all of the goodwill recognized to be deductible for income tax purposes after satisfying performance obligations for certain customers.\nThe identifiable intangible assets acquired have a weighted average amortization period of 6.5 years and include developed technology, customer relationships, and trade name. The Company did not acquire any contingent liabilities as part of the transaction.\nThe cash transferred included $1,000 in contingent consideration placed into a third-party escrow to be released to Connecture as required contractual consents to the assignment of service arrangements are obtained from specified customers. As of December 31, 2019, all of these escrow funds had been released to Connecture.\nThe Company incurred $450 in costs related to completing the acquisition, all of which were recognized in general and administrative expense during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nRevenue recognized by the Company related to the operations of the acquired business were $23,855 for the year ended December 31, 2019. During the third quarter of 2019, the Company had integrated the acquired assets and workforce into its operations, which decreased the Company\u2019s ability to identify incremental costs associated with the acquired business. Identifiable expenses associated with the acquired business were $20,219 for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nCoincident with the acquisition, the Company entered into two additional agreements with Connecture each of which are accounted for separately at contracted prices as described below:\n\u2022\nTransition Services Agreement where each party provides certain transition services to the other for a 12-month period to facilitate an orderly transition of the acquired business. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company recognized operating expense of $0 and $559, respectively, related to this agreement.\n\u2022\nAn agreement for the Company to provide interim services to Connecture as a subcontractor under a master services agreement maintained by Connecture that includes service commitments related to both the acquired business and Connecture\u2019s retained business while the parties work together with the customer to legally separate the contract. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company recognized revenue of $1,155 and $979, respectively, related to this agreement.\nSupplemental pro forma revenue and earnings information are not presented because historical records for the acquired business are not available. Therefore, determining the amount of revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the business combination had occurred as of the beginning of the comparable periods would require significant estimates of amounts that the Company cannot independently substantiate. The Company estimates that the difference between pro forma information compared to reported results would not be significant.\n4. Net Loss Per Common Share\nDiluted loss per common share is the same as basic loss per common share for all periods presented because the effects of potentially dilutive items were anti-dilutive given the Company\u2019s net loss. The following common share equivalent securities have been excluded from the calculation of weighted-average common shares outstanding because the effect is anti-dilutive for the periods presented:\nYear Ended December 31,\nAnti-Dilutive Common Share Equivalents\nRestricted stock units\n2,590,877\n1,970,555\n2,174,250\nStock options\n121,928\n206,447\n233,247\nConvertible senior notes\n4,161,182\n4,513,824\n4,513,824\nConversion of preferred stock\n5,333,334\n-\n-\nTotal anti-dilutive common share equivalents\n12,207,321\n6,690,826\n6,921,321\nBasic and diluted net loss per common share is calculated as follows:\nYear Ended December 31,\nNumerator:\nNet loss\n$\n(24,297\n)\n$\n(45,515\n)\n$\n(52,627\n)\nPreferred dividends\n(3,662\n)\n-\n-\nNet loss attributable to common stockholders\n$\n(27,959\n)\n$\n(45,515\n)\n$\n(52,627\n)\nDenominator:\nWeighted-average common shares outstanding, basic and diluted\n32,318,201\n32,539,748\n31,756,415\nNet loss per common share, basic and diluted\n$\n(0.87\n)\n$\n(1.40\n)\n$\n(1.66\n)\n5. Fair Value Measurement\nThe carrying amounts of certain of the Company\u2019s financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, net accounts receivable, accounts payable and other accrued liabilities, and accrued\ncompensation and benefits, approximate fair value due to their short-term nature. The carrying value of the Company\u2019s financing obligations and revolving line of credit approximates fair value, considering the borrowing rates currently available to the Company for financing obligations with similar terms and credit risks.\nThe Company uses a three-tier fair value hierarchy to classify and disclose all assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis, as well as assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis, in periods subsequent to their initial measurement. The hierarchy requires the Company to use observable inputs when available, and to minimize the use of unobservable inputs when determining fair value. The three tiers are defined as follows:\nLevel 1. Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\nLevel 2. Other inputs that are directly or indirectly observable in the marketplace.\nLevel 3. Unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data, which require the Company to develop its own assumptions.\nAssets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis\nThe Company evaluates its financial assets and liabilities subject to fair value measurements on a recurring basis to determine the appropriate level to classify them for each reporting period. This determination requires significant judgments to be made.\nThe following tables present information about the Company\u2019s assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis using the above categories, as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nDecember 31, 2020\nDescription\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nTotal\nCash Equivalents:\nMoney market mutual funds (1)\n$\n87,224\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n87,224\nTotal assets\n$\n87,224\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n87,224\nDecember 31, 2019\nDescription\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nTotal\nCash Equivalents:\nMoney market mutual funds (1)\n$\n124,503\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n124,503\nTotal assets\n$\n124,503\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n124,503\n(1)\nMoney market mutual funds are classified as cash equivalents in the Company\u2019s consolidated balance sheets. As short-term, highly liquid investments readily convertible to known amounts of cash, with remaining maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase, the Company\u2019s cash equivalent money market funds have carrying values that approximate fair value.\n6. Marketable Securities\nMarketable securities consist of corporate bonds, commercial paper and U.S. Treasury and agency bonds, and are classified as held-to-maturity. All marketable securities had contractual maturities of less than one year as of December 31, 2020. The following presents information about the Company\u2019s marketable securities by major security type as of December 31, 2020. There were no marketable securities as of December 31, 2019.\nAs of December 31, 2020\nSector\nAmortized cost\nAllowance for credit losses\nNet carrying amount\nGross unrealized gains\nGross unrealized losses\nFair value\nIndustrial\n$\n8,993\n$\n8,993\n$\n8,993\nFinancial\n55,943\n55,943\n(5\n)\n55,938\nGovernment\n30,149\n30,149\n30,155\nTotal\n$\n95,085\n$\n-\n$\n95,085\n$\n$\n(5\n)\n$\n95,086\nThe fair value of marketable securities in the Government major security type is classified as a Level 1 in the Company\u2019s fair value hierarchy described in Note 5. The fair values of the remaining major security types are classified as Level 2.\nThe Company invests in highly rated securities with maturities of two years or less at the time of purchase. Given the credit quality of the financial assets and the historical loss experience associated their respective credit ratings as well as the duration of these financial assets and the short time horizon over which to consider expectations of future economic conditions, the Company has assessed that non-collection of the cost basis of these financial assets is remote.\n7. Accounts Receivable, net\nAccounts receivable, net include:\nAs of December 31,\nAccounts receivable, net\nAccounts receivable\n$\n26,791\n$\n36,669\nLess: Allowance for doubtful accounts\n(200\n)\n(155\n)\nLess: Allowance for returns\n(4,351\n)\n(2,760\n)\nTotal accounts receivable, net\n$\n22,240\n$\n33,754\nAccounts receivable are stated at their amortized cost adjusted for any write-offs and net allowances for returns. The Company estimates expected credit losses related to accounts receivable balances based on a review of available and relevant information including current economic conditions, projected economic conditions, historical loss experience, account aging, and other factors that could affect collectability. Expected credit losses are determined individually or collectively depending on whether the accounts receivable balances share similar risk characteristics. The allowance for doubtful accounts is the best estimate of the amount of expected credit losses related to existing accounts receivable. The Company does not have any off-balance sheet credit exposure related to its customers.\nYear ended December 31,\nAllowance for doubtful accounts\nBeginning of period\n$\n$\n$\nProvision for credit losses (including effect of adoption)\nWrite-offs and recoveries\n(167\n)\n(348\n)\n(400\n)\nEnd of period\n$\n$\n$\nThe allowances for returns are accounted for as reductions of revenue and are estimated based on the Company\u2019s periodic assessment of historical experience and trends.

Accordingly, the Company recorded impairment expense $620 in cost of revenue in its consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020.\n9. Goodwill and Intangible Assets\nThe following tables present the changes in goodwill and the gross carrying amounts of the components of goodwill as of December 31:\nChanges in goodwill\nGoodwill on January 1\n$\n12,857\n$\n1,634\nAdditions from business combination\n-\n11,223\nImpairment\n-\n-\nGoodwill on December 31\n$\n12,857\n$\n12,857\nGross carrying amounts\nGoodwill\n$\n14,527\n$\n14,527\nAccumulated impairment loss\n(1,670\n)\n(1,670\n)\nInformation regarding the Company\u2019s acquisition-related intangible assets is as follows:\nAs of December 31, 2020\nGross\nCarrying\nAmount\nAccumulated\nAmortization\nNet Carrying\nAmount\nWeighted-\nAverage\nRemaining\nUseful Life\n(in years)\nTrademarks\n$\n$\n(399\n)\n$\n5.2\nDeveloped technology\n7,900\n(2,436\n)\n5,464\n4.2\nCustomer agreements\n8,160\n(3,672\n)\n4,488\n5.2\nNon-compete agreements\n(126\n)\n-\n-\nTotal\n$\n17,026\n$\n(6,633\n)\n$\n10,393\n4.8\nAs of December 31, 2019\nGross\nCarrying\nAmount\nAccumulated\nAmortization\nNet Carrying\nAmount\nWeighted-\nAverage\nRemaining\nUseful Life\n(in years)\nTrademarks\n$\n$\n(313\n)\n$\n6.2\nDeveloped technology\n7,900\n(1,119\n)\n6,781\n5.2\nCustomer agreements\n8,160\n(2,801\n)\n5,359\n6.2\nNon-compete agreements\n(126\n)\n-\n-\nTotal\n$\n17,026\n$\n(4,359\n)\n$\n12,667\n5.8\nAs of December 31, 2020, expected amortization expense for the intangible assets for each of the next five years and thereafter was as follows:\nAmortization expense\nYear Ending December 31,\n$\n2,274\n2,274\n2,274\n2,274\n1,155\nThereafter\nTotal\n$\n10,393\nAmortization and impairment of acquisition-related intangible assets is as follows:\nYear ended December 31,\nAmortization of acquisition-related intangible assets\nAmortization expense\n$\n2,274\n$\n1,933\n$\nImpairment\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n-\n10. Convertible Senior Notes\nIn December 2018, the Company issued $240,000 aggregate principal amount of 1.25% convertible senior notes (\u201cNotes\u201d) due December 15, 2023, unless earlier repurchased by the Company or converted by the holder pursuant to their terms. Interest is payable semiannually in arrears on June 15 and December 15 of each year, commencing on June 15, 2019.\nThe Notes are governed by an Indenture between the Company, as issuer, and U.S. Bank, National Association, as trustee. The Notes are unsecured and rank: senior in right of payment to the Company\u2019s future indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes; equal in right of payment to the Company\u2019s unsecured indebtedness that is not so subordinated; effectively junior in right of payment to any of the Company\u2019s senior, secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and structurally junior to all indebtedness and other liabilities incurred by the Company\u2019s subsidiaries.\nUpon conversion, the Company will pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of the Company\u2019s common stock or a combination of cash and shares of common stock, at the Company\u2019s election.\nThe Notes have an initial conversion rate of 18.8076 shares of common stock per $1 principal amount of Notes. This represents an initial effective conversion price of approximately $53.17 per share of common stock and 4,513,824 shares issuable upon conversion. Throughout the term of the Notes, the conversion rate may be adjusted upon the occurrence of certain events. Holders of the Notes will not receive any cash payment representing accrued and unpaid interest, if any, upon conversion of a Note, except in limited circumstances. Accrued but unpaid interest will be deemed to be paid by cash, shares of the Company\u2019s common stock or a combination of cash and shares of the Company\u2019s common stock paid or delivered, as the case may be, to the holder upon conversion of Notes.\nPrior to the close of business on September 14, 2023, the Notes will be convertible at the option of holders during certain periods, only upon satisfaction of certain conditions set forth below. On or after September 15, 2023, until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders may convert all or any portion of their Notes at the conversion price at any time regardless of whether the conditions set forth below have been met.\nHolders may convert all or a portion of their Notes prior to the close of business on September 14, 2023, in multiples of $1 principal amount, only under the following circumstances:\n\u2022\nduring any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending on March 31, 2019 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sales price of the common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price on each applicable trading day;\n\u2022\nduring the five business day period after any five consecutive trading day period, or the Notes measurement period, in which the \u201ctrading price\u201d (as defined in the Indenture) per $1 principal amount of notes for each trading day of the Notes measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of the Company\u2019s common stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day;\n\u2022\nif the Company calls any or all of the Notes for redemption, at any time prior to the close of business on September 14, 2023; or\n\u2022\nupon the occurrence of specified corporate events.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Notes are not yet convertible.\nBased on market data available for publicly traded, senior, unsecured corporate bonds issued by companies in the same industry and with similar maturity, the Company estimated the implied market interest rate of its Notes to be approximately 7.30%, assuming no conversion option. Assumptions used in the estimate represent what market participants would use in pricing the liability component of the Notes, including market interest rates, credit standing, and yield curves, all of which are defined as Level 2 observable inputs. The estimated implied interest rate was applied to the Notes, which resulted in a fair value of the liability component of $181,500 upon issuance, calculated as the present value of future contractual payments based on the $240,000 aggregate principal amount. The excess of the principal amount of the liability component over its carrying amount, or the debt discount, is amortized to interest\nexpense over the term of the Notes. The $58,500 difference between the gross proceeds received from issuance of the Notes of $240,000 and the estimated fair value of the liability component represents the equity component of the Notes and was recorded in additional paid-in capital. The equity component is not remeasured as long as it continues to meet the conditions for equity classification.\nIn accounting for the transaction costs related to the issuance of the Notes, the Company allocated the total amount incurred to the liability and equity components in proportion to the allocation of proceeds. Transaction costs attributable to the liability component, totaling $4,808, are being amortized to expense over the term of the Notes, and transaction costs attributable to the equity component, totaling $1,550, and were included with the equity component in shareholders\u2019 equity.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company repurchased Notes with an aggregate principal amount of $18,750 and carrying value of $15,346. The Company paid $14,619 in cash of which $14,207 was allocated to the liability component of the Notes and $412 was allocated to the equity component and recorded as an adjustment to additional paid-in capital. The Company recognized a gain on the extinguishment of the liability in the amount of $1,138 and is presented separately in other income (expense) in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\nThe following table sets forth information about the balances of the Notes as of December 31:\nLiability Component:\nPrincipal\n$\n221,250\n$\n240,000\nLess: debt discount, net of amortization\n(36,942\n)\n(52,051\n)\nNet carrying amount\n$\n184,308\n$\n187,949\nEquity component (a)\n56,539\n56,950\nRemaining discount amortization period (in years)\n2.96\n(a)\nRecorded in the consolidated balance sheets within additional paid-in capital, net of $1,550 transaction costs in equity.\nThe following table sets forth total interest expense recognized related to the Notes:\nYear Ended December 31,\n1.25% coupon\n$\n2,921\n$\n3,000\nAmortization of debt discount and transaction costs\n11,656\n11,256\nTotal interest expense\n$\n14,577\n$\n14,256\nEffective interest rate on liability component\n7.83\n%\n7.59\n%\nAs of December 31, 2020, the fair value of the Notes, which was determined based on inputs that are observable in the market or that could be derived from, or corroborated with, observable market data, quoted price of the Notes in an over-the-counter market (Level 2), and carrying value of debt instruments (carrying value excludes the equity component of the Company\u2019s convertible notes classified in equity) were as follows:\nDecember 31, 2020\nDecember 31, 2019\nFair Value\nCarrying Value\nFair Value\nCarrying Value\nConvertible senior notes\n$\n192,587\n$\n184,308\n$\n207,600\n$\n187,949\nIn connection with the issuance of the Notes, the Company entered into capped call transactions with certain counterparties affiliated with the initial purchasers and others. The capped call transactions are expected to reduce potential dilution of earnings per share upon conversion of the Notes. Under the capped call transactions, the Company purchased capped call options that in the aggregate relate to the total number of shares of the Company\u2019s common stock underlying the Notes, with an initial strike price of approximately $53.17 per share, which corresponds to the initial conversion price of the Notes and is subject to anti-dilution adjustments substantially similar to those applicable to the conversion rate of the Notes, and have a cap price of approximately $89.98. The cost of the purchased capped calls of $33,024 was recorded to stockholders\u2019 deficit and will not be re-measured. The capped call will not be re-measured provided it continues to meet the conditions for equity classification.\nBased on the closing price of our common stock of $14.48 on December 31, 2020, the if-converted value of the Notes was less than their respective principal amounts.\n11. Revolving Line of Credit\nThe Company entered into a new credit facility with Silicon Valley Bank providing for a revolving line of credit agreement on March 3, 2020 (\u201cSenior Revolver\u201d). This agreement replaced the Company\u2019s previous agreement with Silicon Valley Bank, which expired on February 20, 2020 (\u201cPrior Revolver\u201d). The three-year agreement has a borrowing limit of $50,000, with the ability for the Company to increase it to up to $100,000. Interest is payable monthly. Advances under the agreement bear interest at (a) the higher of (i) the prime rate as published in the Wall Street Journal or (ii) the federal funds effective rate plus 0.50%, plus (b) an applicable margin ranging from (0.50%) to 0.50% based on the Company\u2019s Average Daily Usage (\u201cADU\u201d) of the credit facility in the preceding month. The Company also is charged for amounts unused under this arrangement at a rate ranging from 0.00% to 0.40% based on the Company\u2019s ADU in the preceding month. Any outstanding principal is due at the end of the term.\nThe obligations of the Company under the Senior Revolver are secured by a first priority lien (subject to certain permitted liens) in substantially all of the personal property assets of the Company and its subsidiaries pursuant to the terms of a Guarantee and Collateral Agreement, dated March 3, 2020 and the other security documents.\nThe Senior Revolver requires the Company to maintain a Consolidated Adjusted Quick Ratio (\u201cAQR\u201d) of (i) Consolidated Quick Assets to (ii) Consolidated Current Liabilities minus the current portion of Deferred Revenue of at least 1.25 to 1.00 as of the last day of any fiscal quarter, and, if the AQR is less than 2.00 to 1.00, a Minimum Consolidated EBITDA of at least $1.00 for any such fiscal quarter calculated on a trailing 12 month basis. The Company has also agreed to fiscal year dollar limits on its capital expenditures. If an event of default occurs, the lender would be entitled to take various actions, including the acceleration of amounts due under the credit facility and all actions permitted to be taken by a secured creditor.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company borrowed an aggregate of $10,000 under the Senior Revolver for general operating purposes and repaid an aggregate of $10,000. As of December 31, 2020 there were no amounts outstanding under the Company\u2019s Senior Revolver. The amount available to borrow was $50,000 and the interest rate was 2.75% as of December 31, 2020.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company borrowed an aggregate of $115,000 under the Prior Revolver for general operating purposes and repaid an aggregate of $171,246. No amounts were borrowed or repaid under the Prior Revolver during the year ended December 31, 2019.\n12. Commitments and Contingencies\nTotal net cash flows were not impacted by adoption of ASC 842; however, classification of some transactions moved between operating and financing activities. Supplemental cash flow information related to the Company\u2019s operating and finance leases was as follows:\nYear Ended December 31,\nCash Paid for Amounts Included in the Measurement of Lease Liabilities\nFinancing cash flows from finance leases\n$\n10,200\n$\n5,884\nOperating cash flows from finance leases\n$\n8,090\n$\n8,527\nOperating cash flows from operating leases\n$\n$\nROU Assets Obtained in Exchange for New Lease Obligations\nFinance lease liabilities\n$\n3,593\n$\n4,248\nOperating lease liabilities\n$\n-\n$\n1,107\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company had no additional significant operating or finance leases that had not yet commenced.\nOperating Leases\nThe Company leases office facilities under various non-cancelable operating lease agreements with original lease periods expiring between 2023 and 2027. Some of the leases provide for renewal terms at the Company\u2019s option. Certain future minimum lease payments due under these operating lease agreements contain free rent periods or escalating rent payment provisions. These leases generally do\nnot contain purchase options. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term as an operating expense.\nThe components of operating lease expense were as follows:\nYear Ended December 31,\nOperating lease expense\nFixed operating lease expense\n$\n$\nShort-term lease expense\nVariable operating lease expense\nTotal operating lease expense\nSublease income\n-\n(28\n)\nTotal operating lease cost\n$\n$\nThe following table presents the lease balances within the consolidated balance sheets, weighted average remaining lease term, and weighted average discount rates related to the Company\u2019s operating leases:\nLease Assets and Liabilities\nClassification\nAs of December 31, 2020\nAs of December 31, 2019\nAssets\nOperating lease ROU asset - Buildings\nOperating lease right-of-use assets\n$\n1,107\n$\n1,715\nLiabilities\nOperating lease ROU liabilities, current portion\nLease liabilities, current\n$\n$\nOperating lease ROU liabilities, net of current portion\nLease liabilities, non-current\n1,268\n1,568\nTotal operating lease liabilities\n$\n1,568\n$\n1,911\nWeighted average remaining lease term (in years)\n5.21\n5.86\nWeighted average discount rate\n6.04\n%\n5.96\n%\nOn December 31, 2020, the Company entered into a sublease agreement for all of the space under one its facility operating leases. The rental income from this sublease agreement was less than the Company\u2019s remaining lease commitment for this space. Accordingly, the Company recorded an impairment loss of its ROU operating assets of $296 based on the present value of the payments to be received under the sublease. This impairment expense was included in cost of revenue and operating expenses in the Company\u2019s consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nThe following table presents the maturity of the Company\u2019s operating lease liabilities as of December 31, 2020:\nOperating\nLeases\nYear Ending December 31,\n$\nThereafter\nTotal minimum lease payments\n1,834\nLess: imputed interest\n(266\n)\nTotal operating lease liabilities\n$\n1,568\nFinance Leases\nThe Company leases three buildings on its Charleston, South Carolina campus. Under ASC 840, one leasing arrangement was accounted for as a capital lease while the remaining two lease agreements\nwere accounted for as build-to-suit, failed sale-leaseback arrangements. Accordingly, the Company recognized liabilities for the lease payments related to these two buildings, which were recorded as financing obligations. Upon adoption of ASC 842 on January 1, 2019, the assets and related financing obligations for the existing build-to-suit lease arrangements were derecognized with a cumulative adjustment of $7,686 to accumulated deficit. These leases were transitioned to the new standard based on an analysis of the lease balances as of the transition date as if they had been a lease under ASC 840. Based on this analysis, the land components of these leases were combined with the remainder of the lease obligation whereas this obligation was previously accounted for separately and recognized as part of facility expense. To calculate the present value of lease payments, the Company used an incremental borrowing rate based on third-party valuation results as of December 2016. All three leasing arrangements are classified as finance leases under ASC 842.\nAs a result of the adoption of ASC 842, operating expenses increased as depreciation expense related to the buildings increased due to shortening the period of depreciation from the estimated life of the asset to the expected term of the lease. Additionally, interest expense decreased as a result of a discount rate that is lower than the rate required for build-to-suit accounting. Additional information regarding these three leases is incorporated in the following disclosures.\nOn March 13, 2020, the Company executed an amendment to its three leases for office space on its headquarters campus. Pursuant to this amendment, the Company paid the lessor, a related party, $3,993 for future rent due in the first half of 2021, representing an approximately 17% discount on rent due for those periods. The ROU assets and financing lease liabilities were adjusted to reflect the effect of the amendment and associated payments.\nIn February 2020, the Company entered into a financing lease arrangement for servers and networking equipment used in operations. Total payments under the agreement are $3,723, including the first annual payment of $784 and two annual payments of $1,470, each. In connection with this lease, the Company recorded financing ROU assets and financing lease liabilities of $3,593.\nThe Company has entered into various purchase agreements to obtain property and equipment for operations that are accounted for as finance leases. These arrangements have original terms ranging from 3 to 5 years with interest rates ranging from 2.99% to 7.61%. The leases are secured by the underlying leased property and equipment.\nThe components of finance lease expense were as follows:\nYear Ended December 31,\nFinance lease expense\nAmortization of ROU assets\n$\n9,224\n$\n8,599\nInterest on lease liabilities\n8,051\n8,535\nVariable finance lease expense\nTotal finance lease expense\n$\n17,321\n$\n17,187\nThe following table presents the lease balances within the consolidated balance sheets, weighted average remaining lease term, and weighted average discount rates related to the Company\u2019s finance leases:\nLease Assets and Liabilities\nClassification\nAs of December 31, 2020\nAs of December 31, 2019\nAssets\nFinance lease ROU asset\nFinance lease right-of-use assets, net\n$\n85,040\n$\n87,067\nFinance lease ROU accumulated amortization\nFinance lease right-of-use assets, net\n(16,370\n)\n(8,547\n)\nFinance lease ROU assets, net\n$\n68,670\n$\n78,520\nLiabilities\nFinance lease ROU liabilities, current portion\nLease liabilities, current\n$\n5,034\n$\n5,315\nFinance lease ROU liabilities, net of current portion\nLease liabilities, non-current\n77,916\n86,284\nTotal finance lease liabilities\n$\n82,950\n$\n91,599\nWeighted average remaining lease term (in years)\n10.31\n11.34\nWeighted average discount rate\n9.53\n%\n9.26\n%\nThe following table presents the maturity of the Company\u2019s finance lease liabilities as of December 31, 2020:\nFinance\nLeases\nYear Ending December 31,\n$\n9,634\n13,653\n11,553\n11,696\n12,002\nThereafter\n79,962\nTotal minimum lease payments\n138,500\nLess: imputed interest\n(55,550\n)\nTotal finance lease liabilities\n$\n82,950\nFinancing Obligations\nFinancing obligations were $722 and $1,933, as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and consist primarily of obligations for software licensing and support.\nContractual Commitments\nThe Company has $6,835 of non-cancellable contractual commitments as of December 31, 2020 related to the purchase of software and maintenance. These commitments are not accrued in the consolidated balance sheets of the Company.\nLegal Contingencies\nThe Company may become a party to a variety of legal proceedings that arise in the normal course of business. While the results of such normal course legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, management believes, based on current knowledge, that the final outcome of any matters will not have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\n13. Redeemable Preferred Stock\nOn June 4, 2020, the Company issued and sold 1,777,778 shares of its newly created series of preferred stock, par value of $0.001 per share, designated as \u201cSeries A Convertible Preferred Stock\u201d (the \u201cPreferred Stock\u201d) to BuildGroup LLC (the \u201cBuyer\u201d) at purchase price of $45 per share, resulting in total gross proceeds for the Company of approximately $80,000. A member of the Company\u2019s Board of Directors is the Chief Executive Officer of the Buyer. The Buyer also has a second representative on the Board.\nThe Preferred Stock ranks senior to the Company\u2019s common stock with respect to dividends and distributions on liquidation, winding-up and dissolution. Each share of the Preferred Stock has an initial stated value of $45 per share. Holders of shares of the Preferred Stock are entitled to a dividend equal to 8.00% per annum (the \u201cRegular Dividends\u201d), payable quarterly, beginning on June 30, 2020. The Regular Dividends are payable in cash or in kind, at the Company\u2019s option. In the event a Regular Dividend is paid in kind, the stated value of each share of the Preferred Stock will be increased by an amount equal to the accrued Regular Dividend not paid in cash. As of December 31, 2020, the Company paid all dividends on the Preferred Stock in cash. Holders of the Preferred Stock are also entitled to participate in and receive any dividends declared or paid on the common stock on an as-converted basis, and no dividends may be paid to holders of the common stock unless full participating dividends are concurrently paid to the holders of the Preferred Stock.\nEach holder of the Preferred Stock has the right, at its option, to convert its shares of the Preferred Stock, in whole or in part, into fully paid and non-assessable shares of the common stock, at any time and from time to time. The number of shares of the common stock into which a share of the Preferred Stock will convert at any time is equal to the quotient obtained by dividing its stated value then in effect plus any accumulated and unpaid Regular Dividends by its conversion price of $15.00. The conversion price is subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, including in the event of any stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization or similar events. At closing, before payment of any dividends in kind, the 1,777,778 shares of the Preferred Stock were convertible into 5,333,334 shares of common stock.\nThe Company may, at its option, redeem the outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock following the fourth anniversary of its issuance. Redemption by the Company is subject to certain liquidity conditions as well conditions connected with the trading price of its common stock. Upon redemption by the Company, the Company will pay the holder of the Preferred Stock 105% of the initial stated value of such share plus any increase in the stated value from the initial stated value plus accumulated and unpaid Regular Dividends. If the Company undergoes a change of control as defined in the purchase agreement, the Company must redeem all of the then-outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock for cash consideration equal to the greater of the amount due for redemption as described above and the amount such holder of shares of the Preferred Stock would have received in respect of the number of shares of the Common Stock that would be issuable upon conversion of such share of the Series A Preferred Stock.\nUnless and until approval of the Company\u2019s stockholders is obtained as contemplated by the NASDAQ listing rules, no holder of the Preferred Stock may convert shares of the Preferred Stock into shares of common stock if and to the extent that such conversion would result in the holder beneficially owning in excess of 19.9% of the then-outstanding shares of the common stock.\nAs long as not less than 60% of the shares of the Preferred Stock originally issued remain outstanding, the holders of a majority of the then-outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock, voting together as a single class, have the right at any election of directors to elect two directors if the Board consists of nine or fewer directors or three directors if the Board consists of 10. At any time, such elected director(s) may be removed with or without cause only by the affirmative vote or written consent of a majority of the holders of the Preferred Stock entitled to elect such director.\nHolders of the Preferred Stock generally are entitled to vote with the holders of the shares of the common stock on all matters submitted for a vote of holders of shares of the common stock (voting together with the holders of shares of the common stock as one class) on an as-converted basis, subject to a limitation of ownership of 19.9% of common stock. Additionally, certain matters require the approval of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock, voting as a separate class.\nThe Buyer is subject to limitations while it holds at least 10% of the Preferred Stock originally purchased. Furthermore, until the earliest of May 30, 2024 and receipt of a notice of redemption, the Buyer cannot sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of the shares of the Preferred Stock or the underlying\nshares of the common stock, subject to limited exceptions that include exceptions in the case of transfers to certain permitted transferees.\nFor so long as the Buyer and its affiliates collectively hold at least 60% of the shares of the Preferred Stock originally purchased by it or the common stock issuable upon conversion thereof, the Company will pay the Buyer a fee of $400 for the first year following closing and $200 per year thereafter. These management and oversight fees are expensed over the period incurred.\nThe Company incurred $807 in issuance costs related to the sale of the Preferred Stock, including $150 of reimbursement to the Buyer for reasonable fees and out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Buyer in connection with the transaction. The issuance costs were netted against the proceeds from this transaction.\n14. Stock-Based Compensation\nEmployee Stock-based Compensation Plan\nThe Company maintains the Second Amended and Restated 2012 Stock Plan, as amended, (the \u201c2012 Plan\u201d) and previously had in place the Amended and Restated 2000 Stock Option Plan (the \u201c2000 Plan\u201d), which expired in 2020. Pursuant to the 2012 Plan, the Company has reserved 6,231,609 shares of its common stock for issuance to its employees, directors and non-employee third parties. The 2012 Plan, effective on January 31, 2012, serves as the successor to the 2000 Plan and permits the granting of incentive stock options, non-statutory stock options, stock bonuses, stock purchase rights, stock appreciation rights, and restricted stock units and awards. Shares available for grant under the 2000 Plan, which were reserved but not issued or subject to outstanding awards under the 2000 Plan as of the effective date of the 2012 Plan, were added to the reserves of the 2012 Plan. As of December 31, 2020, no awards were outstanding under the 2000 Plan. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had 3,518,804 shares allocated to the 2012 Plan, but not yet issued.\nThe Company has issued two types of awards under these plans: stock options and restricted stock units (\u201cRSUs\u201d). The following table sets forth the number of awards outstanding for each award type is as follows:\nAs of December 31,\nAward type outstanding\nRestricted stock units\n2,590,877\n1,970,555\n2,174,250\nStock options\n121,928\n206,447\n233,247\nThe grant date value of RSUs is equal to the closing price of the Company\u2019s stock on the date of grant, or, if not a trading day, the closing price of the previous trading day. Stock options are granted at exercise prices not less than the estimated fair market value of the Company\u2019s common stock at the date of grant. Generally, the Company issues previously unissued shares for the exercise of stock options or exchange of RSUs; however, previously acquired shares may be reissued to satisfy future issuances. The standard vesting period for RSU and option awards is over four years; however, vesting periods range from one to four years. The options expire 10 years from the grant date. Compensation expense for the fair value of the stock-based awards at their grant date is recognized ratably over the vesting period.\nCompensation expense related to stock-based awards is included in the following line items in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss for the years ended December 31:\nStock-based compensation expense\nCost of revenue\n$\n3,703\n$\n3,569\n$\n5,164\nSales and marketing\n3,081\n3,799\n6,764\nResearch and development\n2,555\n3,265\n5,510\nGeneral and administrative\n5,198\n8,939\n11,430\n$\n14,537\n$\n19,572\n$\n28,868\nThe total compensation cost related to non-vested awards not yet recognized as of December 31, 2020 was $21,286 and will be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 2.32 years.\nRestricted Stock Units\nDuring 2020, the Company granted RSUs under the 2012 Plan. Restricted stock units granted to employees vest in equal annual installments over terms that range from one to four years. The fair value of the stock at the time of grant is amortized based on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.\nThe summary of unvested restricted stock units is as follows:\nRestricted\nstock units\nWeighted\naverage\ngrant date\nfair value\nUnvested at December 31, 2019\n1,970,555\n$\n34.82\nGranted\n2,361,447\n9.47\nForfeited\n(572,629\n)\n29.00\nVested\n(1,168,496\n)\n27.41\nUnvested at December 31, 2020\n2,590,877\n$\n14.40\nAs of December 31, 2020, the number and intrinsic value of restricted stock units expected to vest was 2,506,574 and $36,295, respectively. The aggregate fair value of restricted stock units vested during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $6,132, $32,065 and $18,623, respectively.\nIncluded in the grants of 2020 restricted stock units are performance restricted stock units for which vesting is contingent upon meeting various financial targets to support growth initiatives. The Company granted 801,453 performance restricted stock units to officers and certain employees with an aggregate grant-date fair value of $6,713. The actual number of shares issued upon vesting could range from 0% to 100%.
