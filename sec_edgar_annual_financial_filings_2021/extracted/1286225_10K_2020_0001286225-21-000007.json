    "item_1": "Item 1. Business.\nCompany Overview\nRealPage, Inc., a Delaware corporation (together with its subsidiaries, the \u201cCompany\u201d or \u201cwe\u201d or \u201cus\u201d), is a leading global provider of software and data analytics to the real estate industry. Our platform of data analytics and software solutions enables the rental real estate industry to manage property operations (such as marketing, pricing, screening, leasing, and accounting), identify opportunities through market intelligence, and obtain data-driven insight for better operational and financial decision-making. Our integrated, on demand platform provides a single point of access and a massive repository of real-time lease transaction data, including prospect, renter, and property data. By leveraging data as well as integrating and streamlining a wide range of complex processes and interactions among the rental real estate ecosystem (owners, managers, prospects, renters, service providers, and investors), our platform helps our clients improve financial and operational performance and prudently place and harvest capital.\nWe sell our solutions through our direct sales organization. Our total revenues were approximately $1,158.5 million, $988.1 million, and $869.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. In the same periods, we had operating income of approximately $102.8 million, $92.4 million, and $66.1 million, respectively, and net income of approximately $46.3 million, $58.2 million, and $34.7 million, respectively.\nOur company was formed in 1998 to acquire Rent Roll, Inc., which marketed and sold on premise property management systems for the conventional and affordable multifamily rental housing markets. In June 2001, we released OneSite, our first on demand property management system. Since 2002, we have expanded our platform of solutions to include property management, leasing and marketing, resident services, and asset optimization capabilities. In addition to the multifamily markets, we now serve the single family, senior living, student living, military housing, commercial, hospitality, homeowner association, short-term rental and vacation rental markets. Since July 2002, we have completed over 50 acquisitions of complementary technologies to supplement our internal product development and sales and marketing efforts and expand the scope of our solutions, the types of rental housing and vacation rental properties served by our solutions, and our client base. In connection with this expansion and these acquisitions, we have committed greater resources to developing and increasing sales of our platform of data analytics and on demand solutions. As part of our strategy, we plan to continue to pursue acquisitions of complementary businesses, products, and technologies.\nMerger Agreement\nOn December 20, 2020, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the \u201cMerger Agreement\u201d) with Mirasol Parent, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (\u201cParent\u201d), and Mirasol Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (\u201cMerger Sub\u201d), pursuant to which Merger Sub will merge with and into RealPage (the \u201cMerger\u201d), with RealPage surviving the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. Parent and Merger Sub are affiliates of funds advised by Thoma Bravo, L.P. (\u201cThoma Bravo\u201d).\nOur Board of Directors has unanimously approved the Merger Agreement and, subject to certain exceptions set forth in the Merger Agreement, resolved to recommend that our stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement. As a result of the Merger, each share of our common stock outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger (the \u201cEffective Time\u201d) (subject to certain exceptions, including for shares of common stock owned by stockholders of RealPage who have not voted in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and have properly exercised appraisal rights in accordance with Section 262 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware) will, at the Effective Time, automatically be converted into the right to receive $88.75 in cash, subject to applicable withholding taxes (the \u201cMerger Consideration\u201d). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, as of the Effective Time, each option to purchase shares of common stock will vest at closing and be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of Merger Consideration (less the applicable exercise price) and the number of shares of common stock covered by such option (less any applicable withholding taxes). At the Effective Time, each award of restricted common stock granted prior to the date of the Merger Agreement (subject to certain exceptions) will be exchanged for an amount in cash, less any applicable withholding taxes, equal to the product obtained by multiplying (A) the Merger Consideration by (B) the number of shares of common stock covered by such award immediately prior to the Effective Time (which shall be the maximum number of shares covered by the award in the case of any such award subject to performance based vesting conditions). If the Merger is consummated, our common stock will be delisted from the NASDAQ Global Select Market and deregistered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d).\nCompletion of the Merger is subject to certain closing conditions, including (1) the adoption of the Merger Agreement by the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock, (2) the expiration or early termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the \u201cHSR Act\u201d), and the approval of the Merger under other applicable antitrust approvals, (3) the absence of an order, injunction or law prohibiting the Merger, (4) receipt of governmental consents (or, in certain circumstances, implementation of alternative arrangements) with respect to a change of control of certain money transmitter licenses held by a subsidiary of RealPage, (5) the accuracy of the\nother party\u2019s representations and warranties, subject to certain materiality standards set forth in the Merger Agreement, (6) compliance in all material respects with the other party\u2019s obligations under the Merger Agreement and (7) no Company Material Adverse Effect (as defined in the Merger Agreement) having occurred since the date of the Merger Agreement. The parties expect the transaction to close in the second quarter of 2021. RealPage and Parent made the filings required under the HSR Act on January 5, 2021, and the applicable waiting period under the HSR Act expired on February 4, 2021. A special meeting of our shareholders to consider and vote on the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement is scheduled to be held on March 8, 2021.\nUntil February 3, 2021 (the \u201cGo Shop Period\u201d), we had the right to, among other things, (1) solicit alternative acquisition proposals and (2) provide information (including nonpublic information) to third parties in connection therewith pursuant to an acceptable confidentiality agreement. During the Go Shop Period, representatives of BofA Securities, at the direction of our Board of Directors, communicated with additional parties to gauge their interest in making an alternative acquisition proposal. No party made an alternative acquisition proposal during the Go Shop Period. From and after February 4, 2021, we must comply with customary non-solicitation restrictions. Subject to certain customary \u201cfiduciary out\u201d exceptions, our Board is required to recommend that our Company\u2019s stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement.\nWe have made customary representations, warranties and covenants in the Merger Agreement, including, among others, covenants to use commercially reasonable efforts to conduct our business in all material respects in the ordinary course during the period between the date of the Merger Agreement and the completion of the Merger. The parties have agreed to use reasonable best efforts to take all actions necessary to consummate the merger, including cooperating to obtain the regulatory approvals necessary to complete the Merger. Either we or Parent may terminate the Merger Agreement upon certain circumstances, as described in the Merger Agreement. In addition, the Merger Agreement provides for a termination fee of $288 million payable by us to Parent, or a reverse termination fee of $528 million payable by Parent to us, in each case under certain circumstances described in the Merger Agreement.\nFor additional information related to the Merger Agreement, please refer to our filings previously made with the SEC in connection with the transaction including our definitive proxy statement filed on February 5, 2021 (the \u201cProxy Statement\u201d) and the full text of the Merger Agreement, a copy of which was filed on December 21, 2020 as Exhibit 2.1 to our Current Report on Form 8-K.\nBecause the Merger is not yet complete, and except as otherwise specifically stated, the descriptions and disclosures presented elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including those that present forward-looking information as that term is defined elsewhere herein, assume the continuation of RealPage, Inc. as a public company. If the Merger is consummated, our actions and results may be different than those anticipated by such forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and such differences may be material.\nIndustry Overview\nThe real estate market is large, growing, and complex.\nThe real estate market is large and characterized by challenging and location-specific operating requirements, diverse industry participants, significant mobility among renters, and a variety of property types, including single family, a wide range of multifamily property types, including conventional, affordable, privatized military, student, and senior housing, associations, and vacation rental markets. We estimate that the total addressable market for our current portfolio of data analytics and on demand software solutions is approximately $18.9 billion across approximately 64.6 million units.\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau American Housing Survey for the United States, there were 44.6 million rental real estate units in the United States in 2017. Based on U.S. Census Bureau data and our own estimates, we believe that the overall size of the U.S. rental real estate market, including rent, utilities, and insurance, exceeds $580.0 billion annually. We estimate that the total addressable market for our current data analytics and on demand software solutions is approximately $16.1 billion per year. This estimate assumes that each of the 44.6 million rental units in the United States has the potential to generate annually a range of approximately $310 in revenue per unit for single family units to approximately $500 in revenue per unit for conventional multifamily units. In addition, we estimate that the student and senior markets have the potential to generate annually approximately $510 in revenue per unit, and affordable housing markets will generate annually approximately $300 in revenue per unit. We base this potential revenue assumption on our review of the purchasing patterns of our existing clients with respect to our data analytics and on demand software solutions, the solutions currently utilized by our existing clients, the number of units our clients manage with these solutions, and our current pricing for data analytics and on demand software solutions.\nThe associations market, including the homeowner\u2019s associations (\u201cHOA\u201d) and condominium markets, is estimated to contain over 18.0 million units and we estimate that the total addressable market for our solutions is approximately $1.8 billion per year. This estimate assumes that each of the 18.0 million units managed has the potential to generate annual revenue per unit of $100. We estimate the potential revenue assumptions based on our review of market industry research and realistic solution penetration rates, as well as related trends affecting the associations market.\nThe global vacation rental market is large and generally segmented by the type of property and seasonality. Based on our industry research, we estimate the total global vacation rental market to be approximately $130.0 billion annually. Professional vacation managers, representing roughly 2.0 million units, are responsible for approximately half of the total vacation rental transactions in the market and the other half of the total transactions relate to properties that are individually managed by the property owners. We estimate that the total addressable market for our vacation rental solutions is approximately $1.0 billion per year. This estimate assumes that each of the 2.0 million units managed has the potential to generate annual revenue per unit of $500. We estimate the potential revenue assumptions based on our review of market industry research and realistic solution penetration rates, as well as related trends affecting the vacation rental market, including the analysis of vacancy rates and the average number of nights booked.\nWe believe there is increasing demand for solutions that bring efficiency and precision to the rental real estate industry, which has historically lacked the tools available to many other investment classes. We leverage our massive pool of lease transaction data to provide our clients with analytical tools and actionable intelligence to inform the prudent allocation of capital. We believe that the use of precision data analytics and price optimization solutions represent a significant opportunity to increase yield from the approximately $3.7 trillion of apartment stock in the U.S., turning over at a rate of approximately $180.0 billion per year.\nRental real estate management spans both the renter life cycle and the operations of a property.\nThe renter life cycle can be separated into four key stages: prospect, applicant, residency or stay, and post-residency or post-stay. Each stage has unique requirements, and a property owner\u2019s or manager\u2019s ability to effectively address these requirements can significantly impact revenue and profitability.\nIn addition to managing the renter life cycle, property owners and managers must also manage the operations of their properties. Critical components of property operations include materials and service provider procurement; insurance and risk mitigation; utility and energy management; yield management; information technology and telecommunications management; accounting; expense tracking and management; document management; security; staff hiring and training; staff performance measurement and management; and marketing.\nManaging the renter life cycle and the operations of a property involves several different constituents, including property owners and managers, prospects, renters, service providers, and investors. Property owners can include single-property owners, multi-property owners, national residential apartment syndicates that may own thousands of units through a variety of investment funds, and real estate investment trusts (\u201cREITs\u201d). Property managers often are responsible for a large number of properties that can range from single family units to multifamily apartment communities. Property owners and managers also need to manage a variety of service providers, including utilities, insurance providers, video, voice and data providers, and maintenance and capital goods suppliers. Managing these diverse relationships, combined with renter turnover, property turnover, as well as regulatory and compliance requirements, can make the operations of even a small portfolio of rental properties complex. Challenges are compounded for real estate portfolio managers responsible for a large number of geographically dispersed properties, which require overseeing potentially hundreds of thousands of individual rental processes.\nLegacy information technology solutions designed to manage the rental real estate management process are inadequate.\nDuring the 1970\u2019s and 1980\u2019s, the rental real estate industry was highly fragmented and regionally organized. During this period, the first property management systems and software solutions emerged to help property owners and managers with basic accounting and record keeping functions. These solutions provided limited functionality and scalability and often were not tailored to the specific needs of the rental real estate industry.\nBeginning in the mid 1990\u2019s, the rental real estate market began to consolidate and large, nationally focused and publicly financed companies emerged, which aggregated significant numbers of units. The rise of national real estate portfolio managers, many of them accountable to public shareholders, created a need for more sophisticated and scalable property management systems that included a centralized database and were designed to optimize and automate multiple business processes within the renter life cycle and property operations. Despite increasing market demands, the available solutions continued to be insufficient to fully address the complex requirements of the rental real estate industry, which moved beyond basic accounting and record keeping functions to also include value-added services, such as Internet marketing, applicant screening, billing solutions and analytics for pricing, and yield optimization. Additionally, the rise of national syndicates and REITs fueled the need for tools that provide increased visibility into the operational performance of portfolio properties and market analysis resources to maximize return on investment.\nTo address its complex and evolving requirements, the rental real estate industry has historically implemented a myriad of single point solutions; general purpose applications, such as Microsoft Excel; and/or internally developed solutions to manage their properties. These solutions can be expensive to implement and maintain; often lack integrated functionality to help rental real estate owners, managers, and investors maximize operational yields; and do not have dynamic reporting and analysis tools necessary to optimize investment returns or support capital allocation decisions. In addition, many professionals\nin the rental real estate industry still rely on paper or spreadsheet-based approaches, which are typically time-intensive and prone to human error or internal mismanagement.\nThe rental real estate industry has relied upon print and Internet listing firms to attract leads required to fill available vacancies.\nWe believe these historical solutions are inadequate because they:\n\u2022require significant customization to implement, which frequently inhibits upgrading to new versions or platforms in a timely manner;\n\u2022require information technology (\u201cIT\u201d) resources to support integration points between property management systems and disparate value-added services;\n\u2022require IT resources to implement and maintain data security, data integrity, performance, and business continuity solutions;\n\u2022lack scalability and flexibility to account for the expansion or contraction of a property portfolio;\n\u2022lack material organic lease generation capability and do not track the cost of leads generated by each source;\n\u2022lack effective spend management capabilities for controlling property management costs;\n\u2022lack comprehensive analytics for pricing and yield optimization;\n\u2022lack workflow level integration;\n\u2022do not provide owners, managers, and investors with visibility into overall property performance; and\n\u2022cannot be easily updated to meet new regulations and compliance requirements.\nOn demand software solutions are well suited to meet the rental real estate market\u2019s needs.\nThe ubiquitous nature of the Internet, widespread broadband adoption, and improved network reliability and security have enabled the deployment and delivery of business-critical applications online. The on demand delivery model is substantially more economical than traditional on premise software solutions that generally have higher deployment and support costs and require the client to purchase and maintain the associated servers, storage, networks, security, and disaster recovery solutions.\nThe RealPage Solution\nWe provide a technology platform of data analytics and on demand software solutions that integrates and streamlines rental real estate management and property operations. Our platform provides the analytical and software solutions necessary to optimize operational yields and returns on investment, and contributes to a more efficient property management process and an improved experience for all of the constituents involved in the rental real estate ecosystem.\nBenefits to our Clients\nWe believe the benefits of our solutions for our clients include the following:\nIncreased revenues: Our data analytics and on demand software solutions enable our clients to increase their revenues and optimize operational yields by improving their sales and marketing effectiveness; pricing and occupancy; and collection of rental payments, utility expenses, late fees, and other charges. Additionally, our solutions enable our clients to realize new sources of revenue from complementary solutions and services.\nReduced operating costs: Our data analytics and on demand software solutions help our clients reduce costs and optimize operational yields by streamlining and automating many ongoing property management functions; centralizing and controlling purchasing by on-site personnel; and transferring costs from the site to more efficient, centrally managed operations. Our on demand delivery model also reduces a rental property\u2019s operating costs by eliminating the need to own and support the applications or associated hardware infrastructure. In addition, our integrated solutions consolidate the initial implementation and training costs and ongoing support associated with multiple applications. This is particularly important for rental real estate professionals who want to reduce enterprise-class IT infrastructure, support, and staff training.\nImproved quality of service for renters and prospects: Our solutions improve the level of service that rental real estate properties provide to renters and prospects by enabling certain types of transactions to be completed online; expediting the processing of rental applications, maintenance service requests, and payments; and increasing the frequency and quality of communication with their renters and prospects. This provides higher renter satisfaction and increased differentiation from competing properties that do not use our solutions while optimizing operational yields.\nStreamlined and simplified property management business processes: Our platform provides integrated solutions for managing a wide variety of property management processes that have traditionally been managed by separate manual or\ndisaggregated applications. Our on demand software solutions utilize common authentication that enables data sharing and workflow automation of certain business processes, thereby eliminating redundant data entry and simplifying many recurring tasks. The efficiency of our solutions allows for optimization of operational yields.\nGreater visibility into real estate investment portfolio: Our portfolio management solutions are designed specifically for general partners, limited partners, property management professionals, and other real estate investment firms. These solutions allow stakeholders to quickly combine financial and operating metrics based upon portfolio attributes to evaluate performance, trends, and operations across a portfolio, as well as facilitate the assessment of potential asset management strategies. These solutions provide an unprecedented level of visibility into a real estate portfolio, including information down to the property level, and are designed to work with any property management system. Our portfolio management solutions provide stakeholders the critical information necessary to maximize investment returns and prudently allocate and harvest capital investment.\nAbility to integrate third-party products and services: Our open architecture and application framework facilitate the integration of third-party applications and services into our solutions. This enables our clients to conduct these business functions through the same system that they already use for many of their other tasks and to leverage the same repository of lease transaction data, including prospect, renter, and property data, which supports our solutions.\nIncreased visibility into property performance: Our platform of data analytics and on demand software solutions enable rental real estate owners, managers, and investors to gain a comprehensive view of the operational and financial performance of each of their properties. Our solutions provide a library of standard reports, dashboards, scorecards, and alerts, and we also provide interfaces to several widely used report writers and business intelligence tools. We maintain a massive repository of real-time lease transaction data, subsets of which can be utilized to factor rental payment history into applicant screening processes and to create more accurate supply and demand models and statistically-based price elasticity models to improve price optimization. This enables our clients to optimize both operational yields and investment returns.\nSimple implementation and support: Our platform of solutions includes pre-configured extensions that meet the specific needs of a variety of property types and can be easily tailored by our clients to meet more specific requirements of their properties and business processes. We strive to minimize the need for professional consulting services to implement our solutions and train personnel.\nImproved scalability: We host our solutions for our clients, thereby reducing or eliminating our clients\u2019 costs associated with expanding or contracting IT infrastructure as their property portfolios evolve. We also bear the risk of technological obsolescence because we own and manage our data center infrastructure and are continually upgrading it to newer generations of technology without incremental cost to our clients.\nCompetitive Strengths of our Solutions\nThe competitive strengths of our solutions are as follows:\nIntegrated on demand software platform based on a repository of real-time lease transaction data: Our solutions are delivered through an integrated on demand software platform that provides a single point of access via the Internet with a common repository of lease transaction data, including prospect, renter, and property data, which permits our solutions to access requested data through offline data transfer or in real-time.\nLarge and growing apartment real estate ecosystem: At December 31, 2020, our client base of over 31,700 clients used one or more of our integrated data analytics or on demand software solutions to help manage the operations of approximately 19.7 million rental real estate units. Our solutions automate and streamline many of the recurring transactions and interactions among this large and expanding apartment real estate ecosystem, including prospect inquiries, applications, monthly rent payments, and service requests. As the number of constituents of the apartment real estate ecosystem increases, the volume of lease transaction data in our repository and its value to the constituents of the ecosystem grows.\nComprehensive platform of data analytics and on demand software solutions and services for the rental real estate industry: Our platform of solutions and services provides a broad range of analytical and on demand capabilities for managing the renter life cycle and core operational processes for property management. This integrated, on demand platform enables our clients to optimize operational yields and investment returns.\nPrecision data analytics and price optimization tools based on in-depth lease transaction data: The combination of our massive pool of lease transaction data, our expertise in apartment marketing dynamics, our data science team that can extract actionable insights, and our forecasting abilities creates a unique competitive advantage. Our statistical-based modeling and forecasting solutions provide our clients with granular, market-specific intelligence which facilitates the optimization of operational yields and returns on investment.\nOpen cloud computing architecture: Our cloud computing architecture enables our solutions to interface with our clients\u2019 existing systems and allows our clients to outsource the management of third-party business applications. This open\narchitecture enables our clients to buy our solutions incrementally while continuing to use existing third-party solutions, allowing us to shorten sales cycles and increase adoption of our solutions within our target markets.\nDeep rental real estate industry expertise: We have been serving the rental real estate industry exclusively for over 20 years, and the members of our senior management team have extensive experience in the rental real estate industry. We design our solutions based on our extensive expertise, insight into industry trends and developments, and property management best practices that help our clients simplify the challenges of owning and managing rental properties.\nExperienced management team with strong integrating and operating track record: We have a highly seasoned and effective management team with extensive expertise in the rental real estate industry. By leveraging this expertise and knowledge, we have developed, and continue to improve, data analytics and on demand software solutions which help our clients simplify the challenges of owning and managing rental properties, increase operational yields, and make better capital placement and harvesting decisions. Our management team has a proven ability to acquire and integrate complementary businesses and technologies, as demonstrated by the over 50 acquisitions we have completed since July 2002. We continue to attract and retain experienced management talent to support our growth.\nOur Strategy\nWe plan to continue to leverage our platform of solutions and industry presence to maintain our position as a leading provider of technology solutions to the real estate industry. The key elements of our strategy to accomplish this objective are as follows:\nAcquire new clients: We intend to actively pursue new client relationships with property management professionals and investors that do not currently use our solutions. In addition to marketing our property management solutions, we will seek to sell our software-enabled, value-added services to clients of other third-party property management systems by utilizing our open architecture to facilitate integration of our solutions with those systems.\nIncrease the adoption of the RealPage platform: Many of our clients rely on our platform to manage their daily operations and track all of their critical prospect, renter, and property information. Additionally, some of our clients utilize our software-enabled, value-added services to complement third-party Enterprise Resource Planning (\u201cERP\u201d) systems. We have continually introduced new software-enabled, value-added services to complement our platform of solutions and marketed our on demand solutions to our clients who are utilizing third-party ERP systems. We believe that the penetration of our on demand software solutions to date has been modest, and significant potential exists for additional on demand revenue from sales of these solutions to our client base. We have significant opportunities to further leverage the critical role that our solutions play in our clients\u2019 operations by increasing the adoption of our platform of solutions and value-added services within our existing client base, and we intend to actively focus on up-selling and cross-selling our solutions to our clients.\nAdd new features and functionality to our real estate industry platform: We believe that we offer the most comprehensive platform of data analytics and on demand software solutions for the rental real estate industry. Our platform enables our clients to control many aspects of the residential rental property management process. We are able to add new capabilities that further enhance our platform, and we intend to continue developing and introducing new solutions to sell to both new and existing clients. These solutions may include localized solutions to support our clients as they grow their international operations. We also intend to develop new relationships with third-party application providers that can use our open architecture to offer additional product and service capabilities to their clients through our platform.\nPursue acquisitions of complementary businesses, products, and technologies: Since July 2002, we have completed over 50 acquisitions that have enabled us to expand our platform, enter into new rental property markets, and expand our client base. We intend to continue to pursue acquisitions of complementary businesses, products, and technologies. We continue to selectively evaluate our capital allocation strategy to focus on the most efficient sources of capital available to us for the acquisition of businesses and technologies that may help us accomplish these and other strategic objectives.\nSolutions and Services\nOur platform is designed to serve as a single system of record for all of the constituents of the rental real estate ecosystem; to support the entire renter life cycle, from prospect to applicant to residency or guest to post-residency or post-stay; and to optimize operational yields and returns on investment. Common authentication, workflow, and user experience across solution categories enables each of these constituents to access different applications as appropriate for their roles.\nOur platform consists of four primary categories of solutions: Property Management, Resident Services, Leasing and Marketing, and Asset Optimization. These solutions provide complementary asset performance and investment decision support; risk mitigation, billing and utility management; resident engagement, spend management, operations and facilities management; and lead generation and lease management capabilities that collectively enable our clients to manage all the stages of the renter life cycle. Each of our solution categories includes multiple product centers that provide distinct capabilities that can be bundled as a package or licensed separately. Each product center integrates with a central repository of lease transaction\ndata including prospect, renter, and property data. In addition, our open architecture allows third-party applications to access our solutions using our RealPage Exchange platform.\nWe offer different versions of our platform for different types of properties in different real estate markets. For example, our platform supports the specific and distinct requirements of:\n\u2022conventional single family properties\n\u2022conventional multifamily properties\n\u2022affordable Housing and Urban Development (\u201cHUD\u201d) properties\n\u2022affordable tax credit properties\n\u2022rural housing properties\n\u2022privatized military housing\n\u2022commercial properties\n\u2022student housing\n\u2022senior living\n\u2022homeowner association properties\n\u2022short-term rentals\n\u2022vacation rentals\nProperty Management\nOur property management solutions are referred to as ERP systems. These solutions manage core property management business processes, including leasing, accounting, budgeting, purchasing, facilities management, document management, and support and advisory services. The solutions include a central database of prospect, applicant, renter, and property information that is accessible in real time by our other solutions. Our property management solutions also interface with most popular general ledger accounting systems through our RealPage Exchange platform. This makes it possible for clients to deploy our solutions using our accounting system or a third-party accounting system. Our property management solution category consists of the following primary solutions: OneSite, Propertyware, Buildium, CommunityConnect, RealPage Financial Services, Kigo, Spend Management Solutions, SmartSource IT, and EasyLMS.\nOneSite\nOneSite is our flagship on demand property management solution for multifamily properties and is tailored to the specific needs of different property types (conventional multifamily, affordable properties, rural housing, privatized military housing, senior living, student living, and commercial).

These solutions facilitate core renter management business processes including utility billing, renter payment processing, service requests, lease renewal, renter\u2019s insurance, and consulting and advisory\nservices. Our resident services solution category primarily consists of the following solutions: Resident Utility Management, SimpleBills, Resident Payments, ActiveBuilding, Contact Center Maintenance, and Renter\u2019s Insurance.\nResident Utility Management\nResident Utility Management is our on demand billing and utility management platform. In 2016, we augmented our utility management solutions with the acquisition of NWP Services Corporation (\u201cNWP\u201d), and we further expanded the service through our acquisition of American Utility Management (\u201cAUM\u201d) in 2017. In 2018, we acquired BluTrend, LLC (\u201cBluTrend\u201d) to expand our utility management platform with automation technology that speeds up invoice processing by extracting invoice data directly from utility companies, thereby eliminating the time to mail invoices. Combining the complementary functionalities of these solutions with our existing platform offers our clients automated convergent billing, utility invoice processing, utility cost management, automated energy recovery, infrastructure services (e.g., accounting, community energy, media, data, and telecom), the ability to benchmark energy consumption, and cost, and sub-metering services.\nSimpleBills\nSimpleBills is our on demand utility management solution dedicated to the student housing market. We acquired SimpleBills in 2019 to expand our Resident Utility Management family of products. SimpleBills\u2019 solution bills and collects from residents directly, allowing students to split water, electric, gas, cable bills and other shared utilities among roommates, as well as manage their utilities easily without paying deposits, utility provider setup fees, or contacting providers. Because of SimpleBills\u2019 direct relationship with students, (i) properties can experience significant time savings, as site staff can avoid tedious billing tasks, and (ii) RealPage can deploy it independently of any student solutions companies already use, saving the time and expense of integration. Companies can then fully outsource their utility needs to RealPage.\nResident Payments\nPayments is our on demand payment-processing platform that enables electronic collection of rent and other payments. Provided through our RealPage Payments subsidiaries with both operator and renter processing options for fee reduction, the platform accommodates the processing of multiple payment types including check, money order, automated clearing house (\u201cACH\u201d), debit cards, and credit cards. Acceptance of check payments is facilitated by the Lockbox solution, launched in 2020. Our acquisition of ClickPay Services, Inc. (\u201cClickPay\u201d) in 2018 significantly expands our footprint into the HOA owner-occupied segment of real estate, broadens our presence in the New York metropolitan market and solidifies the integration of our front-end leasing platform into third-party property management systems.\nActiveBuilding\nActiveBuilding is our on demand resident portal solution for facilitating renter transactions, social engagement, and community management. The solution features an industry-specific eCommerce platform that allows residents to pay for amenities, spaces and events directly, enabling multifamily property managers to generate revenue from their existing assets and through third-party service providers. Transactions are facilitated by a mobile app, custom-branded to the property, that enables residents to make purchases and manage apartment-related needs easily and conveniently.\nContact Center Maintenance\nContact Center Maintenance is our on demand platform for service request management.

The platform offers liability and content protection renter\u2019s insurance under the consumer-facing brand name \u201ceRenterPlan.\u201d Liability policies protect property owners and managers against financial loss due to renter-caused damage, while content protection provides additional coverage for a renter\u2019s personal belongings in the event of loss. We also offer insurance and security deposit alternative products that satisfy lease obligations through DepositIQ, obtained in the On-Site Manager acquisition in 2017, and LeaseTerm Solutions which we acquired in 2019.\nLeasing and Marketing\nLeasing and marketing solutions aim to optimize marketing spend and the leasing process.

Syndication tools ensure consistency across multiple marketing channels and include classified directory campaign services, renter social referrals, reputation management, surveys, real-time reporting, and enhanced lead management.\nIntelligent Lease Management (\u201cILM\u201d)\nILM is a leading product in the multifamily industry that scores every inbound and outbound interaction with prospective renters to enhance leasing performance. The solution also provides near-real-time metrics to deliver insight into the effectiveness of a community's marketing and advertising sources in attracting qualified prospects.\nLeaseLabs\nLeaseLabs provides digital marketing services and software.

RealPage AI Screening, the first AI-based screening algorithm built specifically for the multifamily industry, enables property management companies to identify high-risk renters with greater accuracy and speed that exceeds the performance of traditional scoring models in the industry. The AI Screening algorithm combines data-derived renter insights, machine learning techniques, RealPage\u2019s massive, proprietary database of renter outcomes and consumer financial data to more precisely predict a renter\u2019s financial performance over the course of a lease. The model delivers proven reduction of bad debt and financial loss to owners and operators without negative impact to occupancy or revenue.\nMyNewPlace\nMyNewPlace is a paid lead generation site that helps renters find rental housing options utilizing functionality that includes enhanced photography, 3D floor plans, SEO-enhanced descriptions, and neighborhood information.

These solutions facilitate core asset management, business\nintelligence, performance benchmarking and investment analysis including real-time yield management, revenue growth forecasting, key variable sensitivity forecasting, internal operating metric benchmarking and external market benchmarking.

The data coverage and forecasting capabilities of this platform were expanded through our 2017 acquisitions of Axiometrics and Lease Rent Options. Augmenting our data science talent and modeling tools through these acquisitions allows our customers to achieve better harvesting and placement of capital in the rental housing industry.\nBusiness Intelligence\nBusiness Intelligence is our on demand business intelligence platform designed to enable property owners and managers to outperform their peers. In 2018, we acquired Rentlytics, Inc. (\u201cRentlytics\u201d) to expand our business intelligence and performance analytics platform to provide owners and operators with normalized data across multiple third-party systems in order to resolve system incompatibility, data accuracy issues and time-to-analysis delays. Business Intelligence functionality includes easy-to-use, customized internal reporting at any aggregation level and during any time horizon, simultaneously leveraging operational, financial and marketing data. In addition, the platform includes a robust peer-benchmarking component that leverages a massive repository of lease transaction data for assessing both internal and external market performance metrics, economic tools for revenue forecasting, and key operating variable forecasting.\nInvestment Management\nInvestment Management (\u201cIM\u201d) is an integrated analytics and visualization platform providing stakeholders in the private and public capital markets with increased transparency into their investment portfolios. IM is the integrated platform stemming from the acquisitions of AssetEye in 2016, Hipercept and Investor Management Services (\u201cIMS\u201d) in 2019, as well as internal RealPage development efforts. The platform is comprised of five key capabilities, including Asset Investment Management (\u201cAIM\u201d), Asset Management, Asset Modeling, Business Intelligence, and Investor Reporting. These five capabilities are anchored by a common global data warehouse that leverages a unified data structure to align stakeholders in the investment ecosystem to collect, share, analyze, and report on performance of the investment, portfolio, and asset.\nProfessional Services\nWe have developed repeatable, cost-effective consulting and implementation services to assist our clients in taking advantage of our capabilities and solutions. Our consulting and implementation methodology leverages the nature of our on demand software architecture, the industry-specific expertise of our professional services employees, and the design of our platform to simplify and expedite the implementation process. Our consulting and implementation services include project and application management procedures, business process evaluation, business model development and data conversion. Our consulting teams work closely with customers to facilitate the smooth transition and operation of our solutions.\nWe offer training programs for training administrators and onsite property managers on the use of our solutions. Training options include regularly hosted classroom and online instruction (through our online learning courseware), as well as online webinars. Our clients can integrate their own training content with our content to deliver an integrated and customized training program for their on-site property managers.\nOn Demand Delivery Infrastructure\nOur IT infrastructure operates four redundant 40 GBPS dedicated fiber links connecting data centers containing hundreds of servers and multiple storage area networks. This architecture makes it possible to expand the data center incrementally with little or no disruption as more users or additional applications are added. With approximately 8,500 virtual servers, 835 physical servers and 16.8 petabytes of data storage, we leverage this infrastructure and massive repository of lease transaction data to power our platform of solutions.\nOur infrastructure is based on an open architecture that enables end users and third-party applications to access our suite of property management-based software-as-a-service (\u201cSAAS\u201d) hosted applications through our public and private web services, web applications and application program interfaces (\u201cAPIs\u201d). Billions of web transactions are processed per business day through our SAAS offering hosted on this expandable and open architecture based interface.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we employed approximately 290 employees who were responsible for maintaining data security, integrity, availability, performance and business continuity in our cloud computing facilities. We annually obtain a Service Organization Controls audit performed under Statements on Standards for Attestation Engagements No. 18 on a specified set of internal controls. Certain clients conduct separate business continuity audits of their own.\nIn addition to our production data centers, we manage a separate development and quality assurance testing facility used to control the pre-production testing required before each new release of our on demand software. We typically deploy new releases of the software underlying our on demand software solutions on a monthly or quarterly schedule depending on the solution.\nRealPage Support\nOur clients can access our support professionals by phone, web, chat or email for assistance in resolving issues and general questions about our solutions. We offer two product support options: Standard and Platinum Support. Standard Support includes product support during business hours Monday through Friday. Platinum Support includes the features of Standard Support, with customized engagement that includes a designated senior product support liaison. We also sponsor the RealPage User Group to facilitate communications between us and our community of users. Our support group had a total of 615 employees at December 31, 2020.

We typically deploy new releases of the software underlying our on demand software solutions on a monthly or quarterly schedule depending on the solution. As of December 31, 2020, our product development group consisted of approximately 760 employees in the United States and 900 employees located primarily in Hyderabad, India; Manila, Philippines; and Cebu City, Philippines. Product development expense totaled $133.7 million, $112.2 million and $118.5 million during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.\nSales and Marketing\nWe sell our rental real estate software and services through our direct sales organization. We organize our sales force by geographic region, size of our prospective clients, and property type. We believe this focus provides a higher level of service and understanding of our clients\u2019 unique needs. Our typical sales cycle with a prospective client begins with the generation of a sales lead through Internet marketing, email campaigns, telemarketing efforts, trade shows, or other means of referral. The sales lead is followed by an assessment of the prospective client\u2019s requirements, sales presentations, and product demonstrations. Our sales cycle can vary substantially from client to client but typically requires three to six months for larger clients and one to six weeks for smaller clients.\nIn addition to new client sales, we sell additional solutions and consulting services to our existing clients to help them more efficiently and effectively manage their properties as the rental real estate market evolves and competitive conditions change.\nWe generate qualified client leads, accelerate sales opportunities, and build brand awareness through our marketing programs. Our marketing programs target property management company executives, technology professionals, and senior business leaders. Our marketing team focuses on the unique needs of clients within our target markets. Our marketing programs include the following activities:\n\u2022field marketing events for clients and prospects;\n\u2022participation in, and sponsorship of user conferences, trade shows, and industry events;\n\u2022client programs, including virtual client user meetings and our online client community;\n\u2022online marketing activities, including online advertising and SEO, email campaigns, web campaigns, white papers, free product trials and demos, webcasts, case studies, and the use of social media, including blogging, Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter;\n\u2022public relations;\n\u2022use of our website to provide product and company information, as well as learning opportunities for potential clients; and\n\u2022ongoing consumer email marketing campaigns that drive adoption of transactional products, such as online payments and renter\u2019s insurance, by residents on behalf of our property management clients.\nWe host an annual user conference where clients both participate in and lead various types of sessions and planned discussions designed to help accelerate business performance through the use of our integrated platform of solutions. The conference features a variety of client speakers, panelists, and presentations focused on businesses of all sizes. The event also brings together our clients, technology vendors, service providers, and other key participants in the rental real estate industry to exchange ideas and best practices for improving business performance. Attendees gain insight into our product plans and\nparticipate in interactive sessions that give them the opportunity to provide input into new features and functionality. In 2020, we executed all aspects of the event using a virtual interactive platform.\nStrategic Relationships\nWe maintain relationships with a variety of technology vendors and service providers to enhance the capabilities of our integrated platform of solutions. This approach allows us to expand our platform and client base and to enter new markets. We have established the following types of strategic relationships:\nTechnology Vendors\nWe have relationships with a number of leading technology companies whose products we integrate into our platform or offer to complement our solutions. The cooperative relationships with our software and hardware technology partners allow us to build, optimize, and deliver a broad range of solutions to our clients.\nService Providers\nWe have relationships with a number of service providers that offer complementary services that integrate into our platform and address key requirements of rental property owners and managers, including credit card and ACH services, transaction processing capabilities, and insurance underwriting services.\nClients\nWe are committed to developing long-term client relationships and working closely with our clients to configure our solutions to meet the evolving needs of the rental real estate industry. Our clients include REITs, leading property management companies, fee managers, regionally based owner operators, vacation property owners, and service providers. As of December 31, 2020, we had over 31,700 clients who used one or more of our on demand software solutions to help manage the operations of approximately 19.7 million rental real estate units. Our clients include each of the ten largest multifamily property management companies in the United States, ranked as of January 1, 2020 by the NMHC, based on number of units managed. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, no one client accounted for more than 10% of our revenue. Revenues for our largest client were 5.8%, 6.1%, and 5.9% of total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.\nIntellectual Property\nWe rely on a combination of copyright, trademark, and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual restrictions, to establish and protect our proprietary rights. These laws, procedures, and restrictions provide only limited protection. We currently have a limited number of patents and pending patent applications. In the future, we may file additional patent applications, but patents may not be issued with respect to these patent applications, or if patents are issued, they may not provide us with any competitive advantages, may not be issued in a manner that gives us the protection that we seek, and may be successfully challenged by third parties.\nWe endeavor to enter into agreements with our employees and contractors and with parties with whom we do business in order to limit access to and disclosure of our proprietary information. We cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent unauthorized use or reverse engineering of our technology. Moreover, others may independently develop technologies that are competitive with ours or that infringe on our intellectual property. The enforcement of our intellectual property rights also depends on any legal actions against these infringers being successful, but these actions may not be successful, even when our rights have been infringed.\nFurthermore, effective patent, trademark, trade dress, copyright, and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which our solutions are available over the Internet. In addition, the legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability, and scope of protection of intellectual property rights are uncertain and still evolving.\nRegulatory Matters\nCompliance with legal and regulatory requirements is a top priority for us. We are subject to a number of US federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations that affect various aspects of our businesses. Although we believe that our business practices do not violate any laws, our failure to comply with applicable legal and regulatory requirements could have a negative impact on our financial condition or overall operations.

    "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nSummary of Risk Factors\nBelow is a summary of the principal factors that make an investment in our common stock speculative or risky. This summary does not address all the risks we face. Additional discussion of the risks summarized in this risk factor summary and other risks that we face, can be found below under the heading \u201cRisk Factors\u201d and should be carefully considered, together with other information in this Annual Report and our other filings with the SEC, before making an investment decision regarding our common stock.\nFinancial Risks Related to Our Business\n\u2022The COVID-19 pandemic and its effects could adversely impact our business, results of operations, liquidity and financial condition, and the magnitude and timing of such impact is highly uncertain and difficult to predict.\n\u2022If we are unable to continue to manage the growth of our diverse and complex operations, our financial performance may suffer.\n\u2022Because we recognize subscription revenue over the term of the applicable client agreement, a decline in subscription renewals or new service agreements may not be reflected immediately in our operating results.\n\u2022Transactions relating to our Convertible Notes may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\n\u2022If we are not able to integrate past or future acquisitions successfully, our operating results and prospects could be harmed.\n\u2022Variability in our sales and activation cycles could result in fluctuations in our quarterly results of operations and cause our stock price to decline.\n\u2022Many of our clients are price sensitive, and if market dynamics require us to change our pricing model or reduce prices, our operating results will be harmed.\n\u2022Economic trends that affect the rental housing market may have a negative effect on our business.\n\u2022We may require additional capital to support business growth or acquisitions, and this capital might not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all.\n\u2022A significant decline in our cash flow could impair our ability to make payments under our debt obligations.\n\u2022We generate commission revenue from the insurance policies we sell as a registered insurance agent, and if insurance premiums decline or if the insureds experience greater than expected losses, our revenues could decline and our operating results could be harmed.\nOperational Risks Related to Our Business\n\u2022The nature of our platform is complex and highly integrated, and if we fail to successfully manage releases or integrate new solutions, it could harm our revenues, operating income and reputation.\n\u2022Our business depends substantially on the renewal of our products and services for on demand units managed by our clients and the increase in the use of our on demand products and services for on demand units.\n\u2022We may not be able to continue to add new clients and retain and increase sales to our existing clients, which could adversely affect our operating results.\n\u2022If we are unable to successfully develop or acquire and sell enhancements and new solutions, our revenue growth will be harmed, and we may not be able to meet profitability expectations.\n\u2022Any disruption of service at our data centers or other facilities could interrupt or delay our clients\u2019 access to our solutions, which could harm our operating results.\n\u2022Interruptions or delays in service from our third-party data center providers could impair our ability to deliver certain of our products to our clients, resulting in client dissatisfaction, damage to our reputation, loss of clients, limited growth and reduction in revenue.\n\u2022We provide service level commitments to our clients, and our failure to meet the stated service levels could significantly harm our revenue and our reputation.\n\u2022Material defects or errors in the software we use to deliver our solutions could harm our reputation, result in significant costs to us and impair our ability to sell our solutions.\n\u2022Failure to effectively manage the development, sale and support of our solutions and data processing efforts outside the United States could harm our business.\n\u2022We rely on third-party technologies and services that may be difficult to replace or that could cause errors, failures or disruptions of our service, or introduce supply chain vulnerabilities, any of which could harm our business.\n\u2022We depend upon third-party service providers for important payment processing functions. If these third-party service providers do not fulfill their contractual obligations or choose to discontinue their services, our business and operations could be disrupted, and our operating results would be harmed.\n\u2022If our security measures are breached and unauthorized access is obtained to our software platform, service infrastructure, or our clients\u2019 or their renters\u2019 or prospects\u2019 data, we may incur significant liabilities, third parties may misappropriate our intellectual property or financial assets, our solutions may be perceived as not being secure and clients may curtail or stop using our solutions.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks Related to Our Business\n\u2022We face a number of risks in our payment processing business that could result in a reduction in our revenues and profits.\n\u2022Evolution and expansion of our payment processing business may subject us to additional regulatory requirements and other risks, with respect to which failure to comply or adapt could harm our operating results.\n\u2022Because certain solutions we provide depend on access to client data, decreased access to this data or the failure to comply with the evolving laws and regulations governing privacy of data, cloud computing and cross-border data transfers, or the failure to address privacy concerns applicable to such data, could harm our business.\n\u2022Assertions by a third party that we infringe its intellectual property, whether successful or not, could subject us to costly and time-consuming litigation or expensive licenses.\n\u2022The rental housing industry, electronic commerce and many of the products and services that we offer, including background screening services, utility billing, affordable housing compliance and audit services, insurance and payments are subject to extensive and evolving governmental regulation. Changes in regulations or our failure to comply with regulations could harm our operating results.\nRisks Related to Ownership of our Common Stock\n\u2022The concentration of our capital stock owned by insiders may limit your ability to influence corporate matters.\n\u2022The Capped Calls, Note Hedges and Warrant transactions may affect the value of our common stock.\n\u2022The Merger is subject to receipt of approval from our stockholders as well as the satisfaction of other closing conditions in the Merger Agreement.\n\u2022The announcement and pendency of our agreement to be acquired by funds affiliated with Thoma Bravo may have an adverse effect on our business and operating results.\n\u2022The failure to complete the Merger may adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and stock price.\nFinancial Risks Related to Our Business\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and its effects could adversely impact our business, results of operations, liquidity and financial condition, and the magnitude and timing of such impact is highly uncertain and difficult to predict.\nGlobal health concerns from the COVID-19 pandemic and related government actions have caused significant disruption to the global economic environment. The pandemic has significantly increased economic uncertainty and reduced economic activity, including consumer and business spending, and leasing velocity within the rental housing industry. In response to the pandemic, government authorities have implemented numerous measures designed to contain the spread of the disease, including travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place and lockdown orders, and business limitations and shutdowns. Federal and state governments have also taken actions and provided stimulus to address the adverse economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on businesses and individuals, such as unemployment assistance, business loan programs and other measures. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will impact our operations and financial condition will depend upon future developments which are uncertain and difficult to predict, including the scope, severity and duration of the pandemic and the success of the actions taken to contain the pandemic and mitigate its impact.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is adversely impacting residents of rental properties and their ability or willingness to fully meet their obligations to our customers, which in turn may adversely impact our customers\u2019 ability or willingness to meet their obligations to us or may cause them to otherwise seek modifications to their obligations to us. Delays or failures by government entities in extending economic stimulus and support programs designed to assist individuals and businesses, or delays or failures in modifying such programs to successfully mitigate the hardships caused by the pandemic, could adversely impact residents and businesses who rely upon these programs, and their ability or willingness to meet their obligations to our customers. The impact of any such developments could result in increases in uncollectible receivables or delays in payment to us by our customers. These conditions could also adversely affect the rate of overall technology spending and influence the timing of our customers\u2019 and prospective customers\u2019 technology purchasing and implementation decisions, which could adversely affect their ability or willingness to purchase our solutions, delay purchasing decisions, reduce the value or duration of subscriptions, negatively affect our renewal rates and churn, negatively affect certain of our products associated with leasing velocity such as but not limited to screening, renters insurance, and payments, or result in a decrease in the number of end users of our solutions or the transactions performed using our solutions, any of which could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition on a short-term or longer-term basis.\nTo support the health and wellbeing of our employees, customers, partners and communities and in compliance with governmental restrictive orders in the locations in which we have offices, a significant majority of our employees are currently working remotely. Although such changes did not have a material adverse impact on our business and financial results for the year ended December 31, 2020 and we have been able to effectively operate and provide services and meet our obligations to our customers, if we are not able to continue to respond to and manage these impacts and related changes, our business, results of operations, liquidity and financial condition could be adversely impacted. Furthermore, remote work and the use of our business continuity plans over an extended period could impair or delay our ability to sell our solutions, adversely impact our product development and harm productivity and collaboration. We may also take further actions as may be required by government authorities or as we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers and business partners which could adversely impact our business.\nMany of our customers and vendors are also working remotely, which may delay the timing of orders, implementations, or deliveries. The disruptions to our operations caused by the COVID-19 pandemic may result in inefficiencies, delays and additional costs in our product development, sales, marketing and customer service efforts that we cannot fully mitigate due to the current economic conditions or other unpredictable aspects of the pandemic on our customers and vendors.\nThe pandemic also raises the possibility of an extended global economic downturn, and there has been significant volatility in the financial markets. As a result, our results and financial condition could adversely be impacted even after the pandemic is mitigated or contained and governmental restrictions are suspended or terminated. For example, our customers may continue to experience economic pressures and we may be unable to collect receivables from customers impacted by COVID-19, or such customers may request alternative payment structures that could adversely impact our results. A decrease in orders in a given period could also negatively impact our revenues in future periods because a substantial portion of our services generate revenue recognized over time. Moreover, we may experience materially adverse impacts as a result of the global economic impact, including reduced spending, lower economic activity and weakened banking and financial systems.\nOther factors related to the COVID-19 pandemic that may adversely impact our business operations include:\n\u2022service interruptions or impaired system performance due to failures of or delays in our systems or resources;\n\u2022the possibility that one or more clusters of COVID-19 cases could occur at one of our locations, data centers or other third-party providers, affecting our employees or affecting the systems or employees of our customers or other third parties on which we depend; or\n\u2022challenges to our systems supporting our remote workforce, due to the higher demand on such systems and the hardware needed to support such working conditions.\nThere are no comparable recent events that provide guidance as to the effect the spread of COVID-19 as a global pandemic may have, and, as a result, the ultimate impact of the pandemic is highly uncertain and subject to change. We do not yet know the full extent of the impacts on our business, our operations or the global economy. The pandemic may have the effect of increasing the severity and likelihood of the risks described herein.\nOur quarterly operating results have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate in the future, which could cause our stock price to decline.\nOur quarterly operating results may fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control. Fluctuations in our quarterly operating results may be due to a number of factors, including the risks and uncertainties discussed elsewhere in this filing. Some of the important factors that could cause our revenues and operating results to fluctuate from quarter to quarter include:\n\u2022the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, our customers, and the general economic impact of the pandemic in the short and longer term;\n\u2022general economic, industry and market conditions in the rental housing industry that impact our current and potential clients, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022the extent to which on demand software solutions maintain market acceptance;\n\u2022fluctuations in leasing activity by our clients;\n\u2022our ability to timely introduce enhancements to our existing solutions and new solutions;\n\u2022our ability to renew the use of our on demand solutions for units managed by our existing clients and to increase the use of our on demand solutions for the management of units by our existing and new clients;\n\u2022changes in our pricing policies or those of our competitors or new competitors;\n\u2022the variable nature of our sales and implementation cycles;\n\u2022our ability to anticipate and adapt to external forces and the emergence of new technologies and products;\n\u2022our ability to enter into new markets and capture additional market share;\n\u2022our ability to integrate acquisitions in a cost-effective and timely manner;\n\u2022the timing of revenue and expenses related to recent and potential acquisitions or dispositions of businesses or technologies;\n\u2022changes in local economic, political and regulatory environments of our international operations including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022the amount and timing of our investment in research and development activities;\n\u2022technical difficulties, service interruptions, data or document losses or security breaches;\n\u2022our ability to hire and retain qualified key personnel, including particular key positions in our sales force and IT department;\n\u2022changes in the legal, regulatory or compliance environment related to the rental housing industry or the markets in which we operate, including without limitation changes related to fair credit reporting, payment processing, data protection and privacy, utility billing, insurance, the Internet and e-commerce, licensing, telemarketing, electronic communications, consumer protection, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (\u201cHIPAA\u201d), the Health Information Technology Economic and Clinical Health Act (\u201cHITECH\u201d), and state and local laws related to rent control or regulation;\n\u2022the amount and timing of operating expenses and capital expenditures related to the expansion of our operations and infrastructure;\n\u2022increase in the number or severity of insurance claims on policies sold by us;\n\u2022litigation and settlement costs, including unforeseen costs;\n\u2022new accounting pronouncements and changes in accounting standards or practices, particularly any affecting the recognition of subscription revenue or accounting for mergers and acquisitions; and\n\u2022changes in tax policy in the United States and globally that affect the deductibility of certain expenses and how our profits are taxed.\nFluctuations in our quarterly operating results or guidance that we provide may lead analysts to change their long-term models for valuing our common stock, cause us to face short-term liquidity issues, impact our ability to retain or attract key personnel or cause other unanticipated issues, all of which could cause our stock price to decline. As a result of the potential variations in our quarterly revenue and operating results, we believe that quarter-to-quarter and year-to-date period comparisons of our revenues and operating results may not be meaningful and the results of any one quarter should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance.\nIf we are unable to continue to manage the growth of our diverse and complex operations, our financial performance may suffer.\nThe growth in the size, dispersed geographic locations, complexity and diversity of our business and the expansion of our product lines and client base has placed, and our anticipated growth may continue to place, a significant strain on our managerial, administrative, operational, financial and other resources. We had approximately 7,600 employees and over 31,700 on demand clients as of December 31, 2020. We expect to continue to experience growth, including through acquisitions. Our ability to effectively manage our anticipated future growth will depend on, among other things, the following:\n\u2022successfully supporting and maintaining a broad range of current and emerging solutions;\n\u2022identifying suitable acquisition targets and efficiently managing the closing of acquisitions and the integration of targets into our operations;\n\u2022maintaining continuity in our senior management and key personnel;\n\u2022attracting, retaining, training and motivating our employees, particularly technical, client service and sales personnel;\n\u2022enhancing our financial and accounting systems and controls;\n\u2022enhancing our information technology infrastructure, processes and controls;\n\u2022successfully completing system upgrades and enhancements; and\n\u2022managing expanded operations in geographically dispersed locations.\nIf we do not manage the size, complexity and diverse nature of our business effectively, we could experience product performance issues, delayed software releases and longer response times for assisting our clients with implementation of our solutions and could lack adequate resources to support our clients on an ongoing basis, any of which could adversely affect our reputation in the market and our ability to generate revenue from new or existing clients.\nBecause we recognize subscription revenue over the term of the applicable client agreement, a decline in subscription renewals or new service agreements may not be reflected immediately in our operating results.\nWe generally recognize revenue from clients ratably over the terms of their client agreements, which are typically for a period of one or more years. As a result, much of the revenue we report in each quarter is deferred revenue from client agreements entered into during previous quarters. Consequently, a decline in new or renewed client agreements in any one quarter will not be fully reflected in our revenue or our results of operations until future periods. Accordingly, this revenue recognition model also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue through additional sales in any period, as revenue from new clients must be recognized over the applicable subscription term.\nTransactions relating to our Convertible Notes may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nHolders of the Convertible Notes are entitled to convert the Convertible Notes under certain conditions for specified periods at their option prior to the scheduled maturities of the Convertible Notes. When holders elect to convert their Convertible Notes, unless we elect to satisfy our conversion obligations by delivering solely shares of our common stock (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we are required to settle a portion or all of our conversion obligations through the payment of cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity. In addition, even if holders do not elect to convert their Convertible Notes, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principals of the Convertible Notes as a current rather than long-term liability, which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital.\nThe accounting method for convertible debt securities that may be settled in cash, such as the Convertible Notes, could have a material effect on our reported financial results.\nIn May 2008, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) issued FASB Staff Position No. APB 14-1, Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash Upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement), which has subsequently been codified as Accounting Standards Codification 470-20, Debt with Conversion and Other Options, which we refer to as ASC 470-20. Under ASC 470-20, an entity must separately account for the liability and equity components of convertible debt instruments, such as the Convertible Notes, that may be settled entirely or partially in cash upon conversion in a manner that reflects the issuer\u2019s economic interest cost. The effect of ASC 470-20 on the accounting\nfor the Convertible Notes is that the equity components are required to be included in the additional paid-in capital section of stockholders\u2019 equity on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, and the value of the equity components are treated as original issue discounts for purposes of accounting for the debt components of the Convertible Notes. As a result, we are required to record a greater amount of non-cash interest expense in current periods presented as a result of the amortization of the discounted carrying values of the Convertible Notes to their face amounts over the terms of the Convertible Notes. This adversely affects our reported financial results and could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.\nIn addition, under certain circumstances, convertible debt instruments, such as the Convertible Notes, that may be settled entirely or partly in cash are currently accounted for utilizing the treasury stock method, the effect of which is that the shares issuable upon conversion of the Convertible Notes are not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share except to the extent that the conversion value of the Convertible Notes exceeds their principal amounts. Under the treasury stock method, for diluted earnings per share purposes, the transaction is accounted for as if the number of shares of common stock that would be necessary to settle such excess, if we elected to settle such excess in shares, are issued.\nIn August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Debt - Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entity\u2019s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity\u2019s Own Equity. This ASU will eliminate the requirement described above to separate convertible notes into debt and equity components, instead allowing for these instruments to be accounted for as a single liability measured at its amortized cost. Furthermore, this ASU will require the use of the if-converted method when determined diluted earnings per share. These changes, once adopted, will reduce our reported interest expense and increase our reported net income when compared to our results calculated under existing accounting guidance. This standard may adversely impact our reported diluted shares outstanding and our diluted earnings per share in certain periods because of the required use of the if-converted method. ASU 2020-06 will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, with early adoption permitted for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2020. We currently expect to adopt this ASU effective January 1, 2022 and are still assessing our method of adoption.\nIf we are not able to integrate past or future acquisitions successfully, our operating results and prospects could be harmed.\nWe have acquired new technology and domain expertise through multiple acquisitions, including our most recent acquisitions of WhiteSky, Chirp, Stratis, Modern Message, Buildium, IMS, Simple Bills, Hipercept, and LeaseTerm Solutions. We expect to continue making acquisitions in the future. The success of our future acquisition strategy will depend on our ability to identify, negotiate, complete and integrate acquisitions. Acquisitions are inherently risky, and any acquisitions we complete may not be successful. Any acquisitions we pursue involve numerous risks, including the following:\n\u2022difficulties in integrating and managing the operations and technologies of the companies we acquire;\n\u2022diversion of our management\u2019s attention from normal daily operations of our business;\n\u2022our inability to maintain the clients, the key employees, the key business relationships and the reputations of the businesses we acquire;\n\u2022our inability to generate sufficient revenue from acquisitions to offset our increased expenses associated with acquisitions;\n\u2022difficulties in predicting or achieving the synergies between acquired businesses and our own businesses;\n\u2022our responsibility for the liabilities of the businesses we acquire, including, without limitation, liabilities arising out of their failure to maintain effective data security, data integrity, disaster recovery and privacy controls prior to the acquisition, or their infringement or alleged infringement of third-party intellectual property, contract or data access rights prior to the acquisition;\n\u2022difficulties in complying with new markets or regulatory standards to which we were not previously subject;\n\u2022delays in our ability to implement internal standards, controls, procedures and policies in the businesses we acquire; and\n\u2022adverse effects of acquisition activity on the key performance indicators we use to monitor our performance.\nOur current acquisition strategy includes the acquisition of complementary businesses, products, and solutions. In order to integrate and fully realize the benefits of such acquisitions, we expect to build application interfaces that enable such clients to use a wide range of our solutions while they continue to use their legacy management systems. In addition, over time we expect to migrate certain of our acquired companies\u2019 clients to our on demand property management solutions to retain them as clients and to be in a position to offer them our solutions on a cost-effective basis. These efforts may be unsuccessful or entail costs that result in losses or reduced profitability.\nUnanticipated events and circumstances occurring in future periods may affect the realizability of our intangible assets obtained through acquisitions. The events and circumstances that we consider include significant under-performance relative to projected future operating results and significant changes in our overall business or product strategies. These events and\ncircumstances may cause us to revise our estimates and assumptions used in analyzing the value of our other intangible assets with indefinite lives, and any such revision could result in a non-cash impairment charge that could have a material impact on our financial results.\nWe may be unable to secure the equity or debt funding necessary to finance future acquisitions on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. If we finance acquisitions by issuing equity or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders will likely experience ownership dilution, and if we finance future acquisitions with debt funding, we will incur interest expense and may have to comply with additional financing covenants or secure that debt obligation with our assets.\nVariability in our sales and activation cycles could result in fluctuations in our quarterly results of operations and cause our stock price to decline.\nThe sales and activation cycles for our solutions, from initial contact with a prospective client to contract execution and activation, vary widely by client and solution. We do not recognize revenue until the solution is activated. While most of our activations follow a set of standard procedures, a client\u2019s priorities or other factors may delay activation and our ability to recognize revenue, which could result in fluctuations in our quarterly operating results. Additionally, certain of our products are offered in suites containing multiple solutions, resulting in additional fluctuation in activations depending on each client\u2019s priorities and our own processes related to solutions included in the suite. The COVID-19 pandemic could also adversely affect the rate of technology spending and demand for our solutions, and delay or otherwise influence the timing of purchasing decisions and sales and activation cycles by our existing or prospective customers.\nMany of our clients are price sensitive, and if market dynamics require us to change our pricing model or reduce prices, our operating results will be harmed.\nMany of our existing and potential clients are price sensitive, and uncertain global economic conditions, as well as decreased leasing velocity, have contributed to increased price sensitivity in the multifamily housing market and the other markets that we serve. As market dynamics change, or as new and existing competitors introduce more competitive pricing or pricing models, we may be unable to renew our agreements with existing clients or clients of the businesses we acquire or attract new clients at the same price or based on the same pricing model as previously used. As a result, it is possible that we may be required to change our pricing model, offer price incentives or reduce our prices, which could harm our revenue, profitability and operating results.\nEconomic trends that affect the rental housing market may have a negative effect on our business.\nOur clients include a range of organizations whose success is closely linked to the rental housing market. Economic trends that negatively or positively affect the rental housing market or the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic may adversely affect our business. Instability or downturns affecting the rental housing market may have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations by:\n\u2022decreasing demand for leasing and marketing solutions;\n\u2022reducing the number of occupied sites and units on which we earn revenue;\n\u2022preventing our clients from expanding their businesses and managing new properties;\n\u2022causing our clients to reduce spending on our solutions;\n\u2022subjecting us to increased pricing pressure in order to add new clients and retain existing clients;\n\u2022causing our clients to switch to lower-priced solutions provided by our competitors or internally developed solutions;\n\u2022delaying or preventing our collection of outstanding accounts receivable; and\n\u2022causing payment processing losses related to an increase in client insolvency.\nIn addition, economic trends that reduce the frequency of renter turnover or the quantity of new renters may reduce the number of rental transactions completed by our clients and may, as a result, reduce demand for our rental, leasing or marketing transaction specific services. The economic effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the rental housing industry could provide further pressure on our customers who rely upon residents for rental and other payments and leasing activity through which they earn revenue.\nWe may require additional capital to support business growth or acquisitions, and this capital might not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all.\nWe intend to continue to make investments to support our business growth and may require additional funds to respond to business challenges or opportunities, including the need to develop new solutions or enhance our existing solutions, enhance our operating infrastructure or acquire businesses and technologies. Accordingly, we may need to engage in equity or debt financings to secure additional funds. If we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity or convertible debt\nsecurities, our existing stockholders could suffer significant ownership dilution, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges superior to those of holders of our common stock. In May 2020, we consummated an underwritten public offering of 5.85 million shares of our common stock, with total gross proceeds of $345.0 million. We concurrently issued convertible senior notes with an aggregate principal amount of $345.0 million. In the third quarter of 2019, we entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the \u201cAmended Credit Facility\u201d), and we had also entered into an amendment to our prior credit facility in the first quarter of 2018, each of which increased our borrowing capacity. Future debt financing could increase our interest expense and could involve additional restrictive covenants relating to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions. In addition, we may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us, if at all. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when we require it, our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges or opportunities could be significantly limited.\nOur Amended Credit Facility contains restrictions that impact our business and expose us to risks that could adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition.\nAll of our obligations under the Amended Credit Facility are secured by substantially all of our assets. All of our existing and future domestic subsidiaries are required to guarantee our obligations under the Amended Credit Facility, other than certain immaterial subsidiaries, foreign subsidiary holding companies and our payment processing subsidiaries. Such guarantees by existing and future domestic subsidiaries are and will be secured by substantially all of the assets of such subsidiaries.\nOur Amended Credit Facility contains customary covenants, subject in each case to customary exceptions and qualifications, which limit our and certain of our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to, among other things:\n\u2022incur additional indebtedness or guarantee indebtedness of others;\n\u2022create liens on our assets;\n\u2022enter into mergers or consolidations;\n\u2022dispose of assets;\n\u2022prepay certain indebtedness;\n\u2022make changes to our governing documents and certain of our agreements;\n\u2022pay dividends and make other distributions on our capital stock, and redeem and repurchase our capital stock;\n\u2022make investments, including acquisitions; and\n\u2022enter into transactions with affiliates.\nOur Amended Credit Facility also contains, subject in each case to customary exceptions and qualifications, customary affirmative covenants. We are also required to comply with a maximum Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio, a maximum Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio, and a minimum Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio. See additional discussion of these requirements in Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As of December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with all of the covenants under our Amended Credit Facility.\nThe Amended Credit Facility contains customary events of default, subject to customary cure periods for certain defaults, that include, among others, non-payment defaults, covenant defaults, material judgment defaults, bankruptcy and insolvency defaults, cross-defaults to certain other material indebtedness, ERISA defaults, inaccuracy of representations and warranties and a change in control default.\nEven if we comply with all of the applicable covenants, the restrictions on the conduct of our business could adversely affect our business by, among other things, limiting our ability to take advantage of financings, mergers, acquisitions and other corporate opportunities that may be beneficial to the business. Even if the Amended Credit Facility was terminated, additional debt we could incur in the future may subject us to similar or additional covenants.\nA significant decline in our cash flow could impair our ability to make payments under our debt obligations.\nIf we experience a decline in cash flow due to any of the factors described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section or otherwise, we could have difficulty paying interest and principal amounts due on our indebtedness and meeting the financial covenants set forth in our Amended Credit Facility. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or otherwise obtain the funds necessary to make required payments under our Amended Credit Facility or the respective indentures from the 2022 and 2025 Convertible Notes, or if we fail to comply with the requirements of our indebtedness, we could default under our Amended Credit Facility or respective Convertible Notes indentures. Any default that is not cured or waived could result in the termination of the revolving commitments, the acceleration of the obligations under the Amended Credit Facility or respective Convertible Notes indentures, an increase in the applicable interest rate under the Amended Credit Facility and a requirement that our subsidiaries that have guaranteed the Amended Credit Facility pay the obligations in full, and would permit our lenders to exercise remedies\nwith respect to all of the collateral that is securing the Amended Credit Facility, including substantially all of our and our subsidiary guarantors\u2019 assets. Any such default could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition.\nIf we fail to maintain proper and effective internal controls, our ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements could be impaired, which could harm our operating results, our ability to operate our business and investors\u2019 views of us.\nEnsuring that we have adequate internal financial and accounting controls and procedures so that we can produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis is a costly and time-consuming effort that needs to be re-evaluated frequently. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles. We are required to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which requires annual management assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and a report by our independent auditors. As of September 30, 2019, we identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting which was disclosed in our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2019. The material weakness resulted from certain individual control deficiencies related to our information technology general controls (\u201cITGCs\u201d) that, when viewed in combination, aggregated to a material weakness. This material weakness was remediated during the quarter ended June 30, 2020.\nIf we fail to maintain proper and effective internal controls in the future, our ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements could be impaired, which could harm our operating results, harm our ability to operate our business and reduce the trading price of our stock.\nWe generate commission revenue from the insurance policies we sell as a registered insurance agent, and if insurance premiums decline or if the insureds experience greater than expected losses, our revenues could decline and our operating results could be harmed.\nThrough our wholly owned subsidiaries, we generate commission revenue from offering liability and renter\u2019s insurance. We also sell additional insurance products, including auto and other personal lines insurance, to renters that buy renter's insurance from us. These policies are ultimately underwritten by various insurance carriers. Some of the property owners and managers that participate in our programs opt to require renters to purchase rental insurance policies and agree to grant to us exclusive marketing rights at their properties. If demand for residential rental housing declines, property owners and managers may be forced to reduce their rental rates and to stop requiring the purchase of rental insurance in order to reduce the overall cost of renting. If property owners or managers cease to require renter's insurance, elect to offer policies from competing providers or insurance premiums decline, our revenues from selling insurance policies will be adversely affected.\nAdditionally, one type of commission paid by insurance carriers to us is contingent commission, which is affected by claims experienced at the properties for which the renters purchase insurance. In the event that the severity or frequency of claims by the insureds increase unexpectedly, the contingent commission we typically earn will be adversely affected. As a result, our quarterly, or annual, operating results could fall below the expectations of analysts or investors, in which event our stock price may decline.\nOperational Risks Related to Our Business\nThe nature of our platform is complex and highly integrated, and if we fail to successfully manage releases or integrate new solutions, it could harm our revenues, operating income and reputation.\nWe manage a complex platform of solutions that consists of our property management solutions, integrated software-enabled value-added services and advertising and lease generation services. Many of our solutions include a large number of product centers that are highly integrated and require interoperability with other RealPage, Inc. products, as well as products and services of third-party service providers. Additionally, we typically deploy new releases of the software underlying our on demand software solutions on a bi-weekly, monthly or quarterly schedule, depending on the solution. Due to this complexity and the condensed development cycles under which we operate, we may experience errors in our software, corruption or loss of our data or unexpected performance issues from time to time. For example, our solutions may face interoperability difficulties with software operating systems or programs being used by our clients, or new releases, upgrades, fixes or the integration of acquired technologies may have unanticipated consequences on the operation and performance of our other solutions. If we encounter integration challenges or discover errors in our solutions late in our development cycle, it may cause us to delay our launch dates. Any major integration or interoperability issues or launch delays could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, operating income and reputation.\nOur business depends substantially on the renewal of our products and services for on demand units managed by our clients and the increase in the use of our on demand products and services for on demand units.\nWe generally license our solutions pursuant to client agreements with a term of one year or longer. The pricing of the agreements is typically based on a price per unit basis. Our clients have no obligation to renew these agreements after their term expires, or to renew these agreements at the same or higher annual contract value. In addition, under specific circumstances, our\nclients have the right to cancel their client agreements before they expire, for example, in the event of an uncured breach by us, or in some circumstances, upon the sale or transfer of a client property, by giving 30 days\u2019 notice or paying a cancellation fee. In addition, clients often purchase a higher level of professional services in the initial term than they do in renewal terms to ensure successful activation. As a result, our ability to grow is dependent in part on clients purchasing additional solutions or increasing the number of units they own or manage after the initial term of their client agreement. Though we maintain and analyze historical data with respect to rates of client renewals, upgrades and expansions, those rates may not accurately predict future trends in renewal of on demand units. Our clients\u2019 on demand unit renewal rates may decline or fluctuate for a number of reasons, including, but not limited to, their level of satisfaction with our solutions, our pricing, our competitors\u2019 pricing, reductions in our clients\u2019 spending levels or reductions in the number of on demand units managed by our clients. If our clients cancel or amend their agreements with us during their term, do not renew their agreements, renew on less favorable terms or do not purchase additional solutions or professional services in renewal periods, our revenue may grow more slowly than expected or decline and our profitability may be harmed.\nAdditionally, we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, some level of on demand unit attrition as properties are sold and the new owners and managers of properties previously owned or managed by our clients do not continue to use our solutions. We cannot predict the amount of on demand unit turnover we will experience in the future. However, we have experienced higher rates of on demand unit attrition with our Propertyware property management system, primarily because it serves smaller properties than our OneSite property management system, and we may experience higher levels of on demand unit attrition to the extent Propertyware grows as a percentage of our revenues. If we experience increased on demand unit turnover, our financial performance and operating results could be adversely affected.\nOn demand revenue that is derived from products that help owners and managers lease and market apartments may decrease as occupancy rates rise. We have also experienced, and expect to continue to experience, some number of consolidations of our clients with other parties. In addition, if one of our clients is consolidated with another client, the acquiring client may have negotiated lower prices for our solutions or may use fewer of our solutions than the acquired client. In each case, the consolidated entity may attempt to negotiate lower prices for using our solutions as a result of the entity\u2019s increased size. These consolidations may cause us to lose on demand units or require us to reduce prices as a result of enhanced client leverage, which could cause our financial performance and operating results to be adversely affected.\nWe may not be able to continue to add new clients and retain and increase sales to our existing clients, which could adversely affect our operating results.\nOur revenue growth is dependent on our ability to continually attract new clients while retaining and expanding our service offerings to existing clients. Growth in the demand for our solutions may be inhibited and we may be unable to sustain growth in our sales for a number of reasons, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic upon our clients and their demand for our service offerings;\n\u2022our failure to develop new or additional solutions;\n\u2022our inability to market our solutions in a cost-effective manner to new clients or in new vertical or geographic markets;\n\u2022our inability to expand our sales to existing clients;\n\u2022our inability to build and promote our brand; and\n\u2022perceived or actual security, integrity, reliability, quality or compatibility problems with our solutions.\nA substantial amount of our past revenue growth was derived from purchases of upgrades and additional solutions by existing clients. Our costs associated with increasing revenue from existing clients are generally lower than costs associated with generating revenue from new clients. Therefore, a reduction in the rate of revenue increase from our existing clients, even if offset by an increase in revenue from new clients, could reduce our profitability and have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nIf we are unable to successfully develop or acquire and sell enhancements and new solutions, our revenue growth will be harmed and we may not be able to meet profitability expectations.\nThe industry in which we operate is characterized by rapidly changing client requirements, technological developments and evolving industry standards. Our ability to attract new clients and increase revenue from existing clients will depend in large part on our ability to successfully develop, bring to market and sell enhancements to our existing solutions and new solutions that effectively respond to the rapid changes in our industry. Any enhancements or new solutions that we develop or acquire may not be introduced to the market in a timely or cost-effective manner and may not achieve the broad market acceptance necessary to generate the revenue required to offset the operating expenses and capital expenditures related to development or acquisition. If we are unable to timely develop or acquire and sell enhancements and new solutions that keep\npace with the rapid changes in our industry, our revenue will not grow as expected and we may not be able to maintain or meet profitability expectations.\nAny disruption of service at our data centers or other facilities could interrupt or delay our clients\u2019 access to our solutions, which could harm our operating results.\nThe ability of our clients to access our service is critical to our business. We host our products and services, support our operations and service our clients primarily from data centers in the Dallas, Texas area, but also from data centers located elsewhere in the United States and in Europe.\nWe may fail to provide such service as a result of numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including, without limitation: mechanical failure, power outage, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, human error, physical or electronic information security breaches, war, terrorism and related conflicts or similar events worldwide, fire, earthquake, hurricane, flood and other natural disasters, sabotage and vandalism. We attempt to mitigate these risks at our Texas-based data centers and other facilities through various business continuity efforts, including: redundant infrastructure, 24 x 7 x 365 system activity monitoring, physical security, backup and recovery procedures, use of a secure off-site storage facility for backup media, separate test systems and rotation of management and system security measures, but our precautions may not protect against all potential problems. Disaster recovery procedures are in place to facilitate the recovery of our operations, products and services within the stated service level goals. Our secondary data center is equipped with physical space, power, storage and networking infrastructure and Internet connectivity to support the solutions we provide in the event of the interruption of services at our primary data center. Even with this secondary data center, however, our operations would be interrupted during the transition process should our primary data center experience a failure. Moreover, both our primary and secondary data centers are located in the greater metropolitan Dallas area. As a result, any regional disaster could affect both data centers and result in a material disruption of our services.\nProblems at one or more of our data centers, whether or not within our control, could result in service disruptions or delays or loss or corruption of data or documents. This could damage our reputation, cause us to issue credits to clients, subject us to potential liability or costs related to defending against claims, or cause clients to terminate or elect not to renew their agreements, any of which could negatively impact our revenues and harm our operating results.\nInterruptions or delays in service from our third-party data center providers could impair our ability to deliver certain of our products to our clients, resulting in client dissatisfaction, damage to our reputation, loss of clients, limited growth and reduction in revenue.\nOur products and services are hosted and supported from data centers, operated by third-party providers, in various geographic locations within the continental United States and Europe. Our operations depend on our third-party data center providers\u2019 abilities to protect these facilities against damage or interruption from natural disasters, power or telecommunications failures, criminal acts and similar events. In the event that any of our third-party hosting or facilities arrangements is terminated, or if there is a lapse of service or damage to a facility, we could experience interruptions in the availability of our on demand software as well as delays and additional expenses in arranging new facilities and services.\nDespite precautions taken at these third party data centers, the occurrence of spikes in usage volume, a natural disaster, an act of terrorism, adverse changes in United States or foreign laws and regulations, vandalism or sabotage, a decision to close a third-party facility without adequate notice, or other unanticipated problems at a facility could result in lengthy interruptions in the availability of our on demand software. Even with current and planned disaster recovery arrangements, our business could be harmed. Also, in the event of damage or interruption, our insurance policies may not adequately compensate us for any losses that we may incur. These factors in turn could further reduce our revenue, subject us to liability and cause us to issue credits or cause clients to fail to renew their subscriptions, any of which could materially adversely affect our business.\nWe provide service level commitments to our clients, and our failure to meet the stated service levels could significantly harm our revenue and our reputation.\nOur client agreements provide that we maintain certain service level commitments to our clients relating primarily to product functionality, network uptime, critical infrastructure availability and hardware replacement. For example, our service level agreements generally require that our solutions are available 98% of the time during coverage hours (normally 6:00 a.m. though 10:00 p.m. Central time daily) 365 days per year (other than certain permitted exceptions such as maintenance). If we are unable to meet the stated service level commitments, we may be contractually obligated to provide clients with refunds or credits. Additionally, if we fail to meet our service level commitments a specified number of times within a given time frame or for a specified duration, our clients may terminate their agreements with us or extend the term of their agreements at no additional fee. As a result, a failure to deliver services for a relatively short duration could cause us to issue credits or refunds to a large number of affected clients or result in the loss of clients. In addition, we cannot assure that our clients will accept these credits, refunds, termination or extension rights in lieu of other legal remedies that may be available to them. Our failure to meet our commitments could also result in substantial client dissatisfaction or loss. Because of the loss of future revenues through the issuance of credits or the loss of clients or other potential liabilities, our revenue could be significantly impacted if\nwe cannot meet our service level commitments to our clients. Although we were able to effectively service our customers and meet our service level obligations during the year ended December 31, 2020 after implementing changes to our work environments as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, including working from home in response to governmental orders and safety considerations related to our employees and customers, if we are not able to continue to respond to and manage these impacts and related changes, our business, results of operations, liquidity and financial condition could be adversely impacted.\nWe face intense competitive pressures and our failure to compete successfully could harm our business and operating results.\nWe compete in a number of markets including accounting software, property management software for multifamily, single family and commercial solutions, vertically-integrated cloud computing services, software-enabled value-added services including applicant screening, insurance, relationship management (\u201cCRM\u201d), marketing and web portals, Internet listing services, utility billing and energy management, revenue management, multifamily housing and commercial real estate market research, spend management, payment processing, affordable housing compliance and audit services and vacation rentals. The markets for many of our solutions are intensely competitive, fragmented and rapidly changing. Some of these markets have relatively low barriers to entry. With the introduction of new technologies and market entrants, we expect competition to intensify in the future. Increased competition could result in pricing pressures, reduced sales and reduced margins. Often we compete to sell our solutions against existing systems that our potential clients have already made significant expenditures to install.\nOur competitors vary depending on our product and service. Certain competitors compete with us in a number of areas, including Yardi, Inc., Entrata, Inc., MRI Software LLC, AppFolio, Inc., and CoStar Group, Inc. Other competitors compete with us with respect to a single product or category of products. We compete in various markets, with different competitive considerations in these various markets. In many of our markets we compete with a number of providers, including those who market specifically to multifamily, single family, and commercial real estate owners and property managers as well as other providers. In addition, many of our existing or potential clients have developed or may develop their own solutions that may be competitive with our solutions. We also may face competition for potential acquisition targets from our competitors who are seeking to expand their offerings.\nWith respect to all of our competitors, we compete based on a number of factors, including total cost of ownership, level of integration with property management systems, ease of implementation, product functionality and scope, performance, security, scalability and reliability of service, brand and reputation, sales and marketing capabilities and financial resources. Some of our existing competitors and new market entrants may enjoy substantial competitive advantages, such as greater name recognition, longer operating histories, larger installed client bases and larger sales and marketing budgets, as well as greater financial, technical and other resources. In addition, any number of our existing competitors or new market entrants could combine or consolidate, or obtain new financing through public or private sources, to become a more formidable competitor with greater resources. As a result of such competitive advantages, our existing and future competitors may be able to:\n\u2022develop superior products or services, gain greater market acceptance and expand their offerings more efficiently or more rapidly;\n\u2022adapt to new or emerging technologies and changes in client requirements more quickly;\n\u2022take advantage of acquisition and other opportunities more readily;\n\u2022adopt more aggressive pricing policies, such as offering discounted pricing for purchasing multiple bundled products;\n\u2022devote greater resources to the promotion of their brand and marketing and sales of their products and services; and\n\u2022devote greater resources to the research and development of their products and services.\nIf we are not able to compete effectively, our operating results will be harmed.\nWe integrate our software-enabled value-added services with competitive property management software for some of our clients. Our application infrastructure, marketed to our clients as SmartSource IT, is based on an open architecture that enables third-party applications to access and interface with applications hosted in SmartSource IT through our RealPage Exchange platform. Likewise, through this platform our SmartSource IT services are able to access and interface with other third-party applications, including third-party property management systems. We also provide services to assist in the implementation, training, support and hosting with respect to the integration of some of our competitors\u2019 applications with our solutions. We sometimes rely on the cooperation of our competitors to implement solutions for our clients. However, frequently our reliance on the cooperation of our competitors can result in delays in integration. There is no assurance that our competitors, even if contractually obligated to do so, will continue to cooperate with us or will not prospectively alter their obligations to do so. We also occasionally develop interfaces between our software-enabled value-added services and competitor property management software without their cooperation or consent. There is no assurance that our competitors will not alter their applications in\nways that inhibit or prevent integration or assert that their intellectual property rights restrict our ability to integrate our solutions with their applications. Moreover, regardless of merit, such interface-related activity may result in costly litigation.\nMaterial defects or errors in the software we use to deliver our solutions could harm our reputation, result in significant costs to us and impair our ability to sell our solutions.\nThe software applications underlying our solutions are inherently complex and may contain material defects or errors, particularly when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released. We have, from time to time, found defects in the software applications underlying our solutions, and new errors in our existing solutions may be detected in the future. Any errors or defects that cause performance problems or service interruptions could result in:\n\u2022a reduction in new sales or subscription renewal rates;\n\u2022unexpected sales credits or refunds to our clients, loss of clients and other potential liabilities;\n\u2022delays in client payments, increasing our collection reserve and collection cycle;\n\u2022diversion of development resources and associated costs;\n\u2022harm to our reputation and brand; and\n\u2022unanticipated litigation costs.\nAdditionally, the costs incurred in correcting defects or errors could be substantial and could adversely affect our operating results.\nFailure to effectively manage the development, sale and support of our solutions and data processing efforts outside the United States could harm our business.\nOur success depends on our ability to process high volumes of client data, enhance existing solutions and develop new solutions rapidly and cost effectively. We currently maintain offices in Hyderabad, India; Cebu, Philippines; Manila, Philippines; and Medellin, Colombia, where we employ development and data processing personnel or conduct other business functions important to our operations. We believe that performing these activities in Hyderabad, Cebu, Manila, and Medellin increases the efficiency and decreases the costs of our related operations. We maintain an office in Barcelona, Spain where certain of our vacation rental product development, sales and support operations are based. We also maintain offices in London, England and Sydney, Australia, where we provide property management, online leasing and resident software solutions. We believe our access to a multilingual employee base enhances our ability to serve vacation and other rental property managers outside the United States and in non-English speaking countries. Managing and staffing international operations requires management\u2019s attention and financial resources. The level of cost savings achieved by our international operations may not exceed the amount of investment and additional resources required to manage and operate these international operations. Our product offerings outside the United States may not be profitable or otherwise successful. Additionally, if we experience difficulties as a result of political, social, economic or environmental instability, change in applicable law, limitations of local infrastructure or problems with our workforce or facilities at our or third parties\u2019 international operations, including quarantines or other interruptions that affect our workforce as a result of an outbreak of the coronavirus in any of the locations where we operate, our business could be harmed due to delays in product release schedules or data processing services.\nWe rely on third-party technologies and services that may be difficult to replace or that could cause errors, failures or disruptions of our service, or introduce supply chain vulnerabilities, any of which could harm our business.\nWe rely on third-party providers in connection with the delivery of our solutions. Such providers include, but are not limited to, computer hardware and software vendors, database and data providers and cloud hosting providers. We utilize equipment, software and services from various third party providers. Our OneSite Accounting service relies on a software-as-a-service, or SaaS, accounting system developed and maintained by a third-party service provider. We host this application in our data centers and provide supplemental development resources to extend this accounting system to meet the unique requirements of the rental housing industry. Our shared cloud portfolio reporting service utilizes software licensed from a third party. We expect to utilize additional service providers as we expand our platform. Although the third-party technologies and services that we currently require are commercially available, such technologies and services may not continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Any loss of the right to use any of these technologies or services could result in delays in the provisioning of our solutions until alternative technology is either developed by us, or, if available, is identified, obtained and integrated, and such delays could harm our business. It also may be time consuming and costly to enter into new relationships. Additionally, any errors or defects in the third-party technologies we utilize or delays or interruptions in the third-party services we rely on could result in errors, failures or disruptions of our services, which also could harm our business.\nWe depend upon third-party service providers for important payment processing functions. If these third-party service providers do not fulfill their contractual obligations or choose to discontinue their services, our business and operations could be disrupted and our operating results would be harmed.\nWe rely on several large payment processing service providers to provide payment processing services to our clients. These services include electronic funds transfers, or EFT\u2019s, check services, bank card authorizations, data capture, settlement and merchant accounting services and access to various reporting tools. We and our clients also rely on third-party hardware manufacturers to manufacture check scanning hardware which is utilized to process transactions. Some service providers are our competitors who also directly or indirectly sell payment processing services to our clients in competition with us. With respect to these service providers, we have significantly less control over the systems and processes than if we were to maintain and operate those systems and processes ourselves. In some cases, functions necessary to our business are performed on proprietary third-party systems and software to which we have no access. We also generally do not have long-term contracts with these service providers. Accordingly, the failure of these organizations and service providers to renew their contracts with us or to fulfill their contractual obligations and perform satisfactorily could result in significant disruptions to our operations and adversely affect our operating results. In addition, the businesses we have acquired, or may acquire in the future, typically rely on other payment processing service providers. We may encounter difficulty converting payment processing services from these service providers to our payment processing platform. If we are required to find an alternative source for performing these functions, we may have to expend significant money, time and other resources to develop or obtain an alternative. If developing or obtaining an alternative is not accomplished in a timely manner and without significant disruption to our business, we may be unable to fulfill our responsibilities to our clients or meet their expectations, with the attendant potential for liability claims, damage to our reputation, and loss of our ability to attract or maintain clients.\nIf our security measures are breached and unauthorized access is obtained to our software platform, service infrastructure, or our clients\u2019 or their renters\u2019 or prospects\u2019 data, we may incur significant liabilities, third parties may misappropriate our intellectual property or financial assets, our solutions may be perceived as not being secure and clients may curtail or stop using our solutions.\nMaintaining the security of our software platform and service infrastructure is of paramount importance to us and our clients, and we devote significant resources to this effort. Breaches of the security measures we take to protect our software platform and service infrastructure and our and our clients\u2019 confidential or proprietary information that is stored on and transmitted through those systems could disrupt and compromise the security of our internal systems and on demand applications, impair our ability to provide products and services to our clients and protect the privacy of their data, compromise our confidential or technical business information harming our competitive position, result in theft or misuse of our intellectual property or financial assets or otherwise adversely affect our business.\nThe solutions we provide involve the collection, storage and transmission of confidential personal and proprietary information regarding our clients and our clients\u2019 current and prospective renters and business partners. Specifically, we collect, store and transmit a variety of client data such as demographic information and payment histories of our clients\u2019 prospective and current renters and business partners. Additionally, we collect and transmit sensitive financial data such as credit card and bank account information. Treatment of certain types of data, such as personally identifiable information, protected health information and sensitive financial data may be subject to global, federal or state regulations requiring heightened privacy and security. If our data security or data integrity measures are breached or otherwise fail or prove to be inadequate for any reason, as a result of third-party actions or our employees\u2019 or contractors\u2019 errors or malfeasance or otherwise, and unauthorized persons obtain access to this information, or the data is otherwise compromised, we could incur significant liability to our clients and to their prospective or current renters or business partners, significant costs associated with internal regulatory investigations and litigation, or significant fines and sanctions by payment processing networks or governmental authorities. Any of these events or circumstances could result in damage to our reputation and material harm to our business.\nWe also rely upon our clients as users of our system to promote security of the system and the data within it, such as administration of client-side access credentialing and control of client-side display of data. On occasion, our clients have failed to perform these activities in such a manner as to prevent unauthorized access to data. To date, these breaches have not resulted in claims against us or in material harm to our business, but we cannot be certain that the failure of our clients in future periods to perform these activities will not result in claims against us, which could expose us to potential litigation, damage to our reputation and material harm to our business.\nThere can be no certainty that the measures we have taken to protect our software platform and service infrastructure, our confidential and proprietary information and the privacy and integrity of our clients\u2019, their current or prospective renters\u2019 and business partners\u2019 data are adequate to prevent or remedy unauthorized access to our system. Because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to, or to sabotage, systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures. Experienced computer programmers seeking to intrude or cause harm, or hackers, have penetrated our service infrastructure in the past and are likely to attempt to do so in the future. Hackers may consist of sophisticated organizations, competitors, governments or individuals\nwho launch targeted attacks to gain unauthorized access to our systems and financial assets. A hacker who is able to penetrate our service infrastructure could misappropriate proprietary or confidential information or financial assets or cause interruptions in our services. For example, during May 2018, as disclosed in our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, we were the subject of a targeted email phishing campaign that led to a business email compromise, pursuant to which an unauthorized party gained access to an external third party system used by a subsidiary that we acquired in 2017. The incident resulted in the diversion of approximately $6.0 million of funds, net of recoveries, intended for disbursement to three clients. Although we continue to vigorously pursue recovery of our losses and related expenses arising from this incident, there can be no assurance of recovery or of the timing of any such recovery.\nWe might be required to expend significant capital and resources to protect against, or to remedy, problems caused by intentional or unintentional threats such as hackers, and we may not have a timely remedy against a threat which is able to penetrate our service infrastructure. In addition to purposeful breaches, inadvertent actions or the transmission of computer viruses or malicious other logic could expose us to security risks. If an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs or if our clients and potential clients perceive vulnerabilities, the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed, we could lose sales and clients and our business could be materially harmed.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks Related to Our Business\nWe face a number of risks in our payment processing business that could result in a reduction in our revenues and profits.\nIn connection with our electronic payment processing services, we process renter payments and subsequently settle these renter payments to our clients after varying clearing times. These payments are settled through our sponsor banks, and in the case of EFT, our Originating Depository Financial Institutions, or ODFIs. The renter payments that we process for our clients are identified in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as restricted cash and the corresponding liability for these renter payments is identified as client deposits. Our electronic payment processing business and related maintenance of custodial accounts subjects us to a number of risks, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022liability for client costs related to disputed or fraudulent transactions if those costs exceed the amount of the client reserves we have during the clearing period or after renter payments have been settled to our clients;\n\u2022electronic processing limits on the amount of custodial balances that any single ODFI, or collectively all of our ODFIs, will underwrite;\n\u2022reliance on sponsor banks, card payment processors and other payment service provider partners to process electronic transactions;\n\u2022failure by us or our sponsor banks to adhere to applicable laws and regulatory requirements or the standards of the electronic payments rules and regulations and other rules and regulations that may impact the provision of electronic payment services;\n\u2022continually evolving laws and regulations governing payment processing and money transmission, the application or interpretation of which is not clear in some jurisdictions;\n\u2022incidences of fraud, a security breach or our failure to comply with required external audit standards;\n\u2022our inability to increase or modify our fees at times when sponsor banks, electronic payment partners or associations increase their transaction processing fees or impose restrictions on the type, structure or amount of fees we can charge;\n\u2022repricing actions taken by card associations or payment networks or imposed as a result of governmental regulation or due to competitive pressures, which could negatively impact the prices we can charge customers for our services; and\n\u2022inconsistent and conflicting laws, regulations and card association or payment network rules that may result in fee structures that cause consumer confusion, complaints or litigation.\nIf any of these risks related to our electronic payment processing business were to materialize, our business or financial results could be negatively affected. Although we attempt to structure and adapt our payment processing operations to comply with these complex and evolving laws and regulations, our efforts may not guarantee compliance. In the event we are found to be in violation of regulatory or legal requirements, we may be subject to monetary fines, cease and desist orders, mandatory product changes, or other penalties that could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Additionally, we are exposed to financial risk when payments from renters to our clients are returned or charged-back for various reasons such as insufficient funds, stop payment orders, unauthorized use or other reasons. In instances where there are returns or chargebacks, we attempt to collect these funds from our clients. However, if we are unable to collect such amounts from our clients, we bear the risk of loss for the amount of the return or chargeback. While we have not experienced material losses resulting from payment returns or chargebacks in the past, there can be no assurance that we will not experience significant losses in the future. Any increase in\nreturns or chargebacks that we are not able to recover our clients may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have a service provider agreement with a financial institution under which we are a registered independent sales organization, or ISO. Under this agreement the financial institution processes credit card and debit card payments (\u201cCard Payments\u201d) on behalf of our clients. As an ISO, we assume the underwriting risk for the payments processed on behalf of our clients. If we experience excessive chargebacks, either we or the financial institution have the authority to cease client card processing services, and such events could result in a material adverse effect on our revenues, operating income, and reputation.\nEvolution and expansion of our payment processing business may subject us to additional regulatory requirements and other risks, with respect to which failure to comply or adapt could harm our operating results.\nThe evolution and expansion of our payment processing business may subject us to additional risks and regulatory requirements, including laws governing money transmission and payment processing/settlement services. These requirements vary throughout the markets in which we operate, and have increased over time as the geographic scope and complexity of our product services have expanded. While we maintain a compliance program focused on applicable laws and regulations throughout the payments industry, there is no guarantee that we will not be subject to fines, criminal and civil lawsuits or other regulatory enforcement actions in one or more jurisdictions, or be required to adjust business practices to accommodate future regulatory requirements.\nIn order to maintain flexibility in the growth and expansion of our payments operations, we have obtained money transmitter licenses (or their equivalents) in several states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. Our efforts to maintain these licenses could result in significant management time, effort, and cost, and may still not guarantee compliance given the constant state of change in these regulatory frameworks. Accordingly, costs associated with changes in compliance requirements, regulatory audits, enforcement actions, reputational harm, or other regulatory limitations may impact our ability to grow our payment processing business and could adversely affect our financial results.\nBecause certain solutions we provide depend on access to client data, decreased access to this data or the failure to comply with the evolving laws and regulations governing privacy of data, cloud computing and cross-border data transfers, or the failure to address privacy concerns applicable to such data, could harm our business.\nCertain of our solutions depend on our continued access to our clients\u2019 data regarding their prospective and current renters, including data compiled by other third-party service providers who collect and store data on behalf of our clients. Federal, state and foreign governments have adopted and continue to adopt new laws and regulations addressing data privacy and the collection, processing, storage, transmission, use and disclosure of personal information. Such laws and regulations are subject to differing interpretations and may be inconsistent among jurisdictions. These and other requirements could reduce demand for our solutions or restrict our ability to store and process data or, in some cases, impact our ability to offer our services and solutions in certain locations.\nIn addition to government activity, privacy advocacy and other industry groups have established or may establish new self-regulatory standards that may place additional burdens on us. Our clients may expect us to meet voluntary certification or other standards established by third parties. If we are unable to maintain these certifications or meet these standards, it could adversely affect our ability to provide our solutions to certain clients and could harm our business.\nAny restrictions on the use of or decrease in the availability of data from our clients, or other third parties that collect and store such data on behalf of our clients, and the costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, applicable legislative and regulatory initiatives may limit our ability to collect, aggregate or use this data. Any limitations on our ability to collect, aggregate or use such data could reduce demand for certain of our solutions. Additionally, any inability to adequately address privacy concerns, even if unfounded, or comply with applicable privacy laws, regulations and policies, could result in liability to us or damage to our reputation and could inhibit sales and market acceptance of our solutions and harm our business.\nAssertions by a third party that we infringe its intellectual property, whether successful or not, could subject us to costly and time-consuming litigation or expensive licenses.\nThe software and technology industries are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets and by frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement, misappropriation, misuse and other violations of intellectual property rights. We have received in the past, and may receive in the future, communications from third parties claiming that we have infringed or otherwise misappropriated the intellectual property rights or terms of use of others. Our technologies may not be able to withstand any third-party claims against their use. Since we currently have a limited number of patents, we may not be able to use patent infringement as a defensive strategy in such litigation. Additionally, although we have licensed from other parties proprietary technology covered by patents, we cannot be certain that any such patents will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. If such patents are invalidated or circumvented, this may allow existing and potential competitors to develop products and services that are competitive with, or superior to, our solutions.\nMany of our client agreements require us to indemnify our clients for certain third-party claims, such as intellectual property infringement claims, which could increase our costs of defending such claims and may require that we pay damages if there were an adverse ruling or settlement related to any such claims. These types of claims could harm our relationships with our clients, may deter future clients from purchasing our solutions or could expose us to litigation for these claims. Even if we are not a party to any litigation between a client and a third party, an adverse outcome in any such litigation could make it more difficult for us to defend our intellectual property in any subsequent litigation in which we are a named party.\nLitigation could force us to stop selling, incorporating or using our solutions that include the challenged intellectual property or redesign those solutions that use the technology. In addition, we may have to pay damages if we are found to be in violation of a third party\u2019s rights. We may have to procure a license for the technology, which may not be available on reasonable terms, if at all, may significantly increase our operating expenses or may require us to restrict our business activities in one or more respects. As a result, we may also be required to develop alternative non-infringing technology, which could require significant effort and expense. There is no assurance that we would be able to develop alternative solutions or, if alternative solutions were developed, that they would perform as required or be accepted in the relevant markets. In some instances, if we are unable to offer non-infringing technology, or obtain a license for such technology, we may be required to refund some or the entire license fee paid for the infringing technology by our clients.\nOur exposure to risks associated with the use of intellectual property may be increased as a result of acquisitions, as we have a lower level of visibility into the development process with respect to acquired technology or the care taken to safeguard against infringement risks. Such risks include, without limitation, patent infringement risks, copyright infringement risks, risks arising from the inclusion of open source software that is subject to onerous license provisions that could even require disclosure of our proprietary source code, or violations of terms of use for third party solutions that our acquisition targets use. Third parties may make infringement and similar or related claims after we have acquired technology that had not been asserted prior to our acquisition.\nAny failure to protect and successfully enforce our intellectual property rights could compromise our proprietary technology and impair our brands.\nOur success depends on our ability to protect our proprietary rights to the technologies we use in our solutions. If we are unable to protect our proprietary rights adequately, our competitors could use the intellectual property we have developed to enhance their own products and services, which could harm our business. We rely on a combination of copyright, service mark, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual restrictions, to establish and protect our proprietary rights, all of which provide only limited protection. We currently have a limited number of issued patents and pending patent applications, and we may be unable to obtain patent protection in the future. In addition, if any patents are issued in the future, they may not provide us with any competitive advantages, may not be issued in a manner that gives us the protection that we seek and may be successfully challenged by third parties. Unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use the technologies underlying our solutions. Monitoring unauthorized use of our technologies is difficult, and we do not know whether the steps we have taken will prevent unauthorized use of our technology. If we are unable to protect our proprietary rights, we may find ourselves at a competitive disadvantage to others who have not incurred the substantial expense, time and effort required to create similar innovative products.\nWe cannot assure that any future service mark or trademark registrations will be issued for pending or future applications or that any registered service marks or trademarks will be enforceable or provide adequate protection of our proprietary rights. If we are unable to secure new marks, maintain already existing marks and enforce the rights to use such marks against unauthorized third-party use, our ability to brand, identify and promote our solutions in the marketplace could be impaired, which could harm our business.\nWe customarily enter into agreements with our employees, contractors and certain parties with whom we do business to limit access to, use of, and disclosure of our confidential and proprietary information. The legal and technical steps we have taken, however, may not prevent unauthorized use or the reverse engineering of our technology. Moreover, we may be required to release the source code of our software to third parties under certain circumstances. For example, some of our client agreements provide that if we cease to maintain or support a certain solution without replacing it with a successor solution, then we may be required to release the source code of the software underlying such solution. In addition, others may independently develop technologies that are competitive to ours or infringe our intellectual property. Moreover, it may be difficult or practically impossible to detect copyright infringement or theft of our software code. Enforcement of our intellectual property rights also depends on our legal actions being successful against these infringers, but these actions may not be successful, even when our rights have been infringed. Furthermore, the legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights in Internet-related industries are uncertain and still evolving.\nAdditionally, as we sell our solutions internationally, effective patent, trademark, service mark, copyright and trade secret protection may not be available or as robust in every country in which our solutions are available. As a result, we may not be able to effectively prevent competitors outside the United States from infringing or otherwise misappropriating our intellectual property rights, which could reduce our competitive position and ability to compete or otherwise harm our business.\nWe may be unable to halt the operations of websites that aggregate or misappropriate data from our websites.\nFrom time to time, third parties have misappropriated data from our websites through website scraping, software robots or other means and aggregated this data on their websites with data from other companies. In addition, copycat websites have misappropriated data on our network and attempted to imitate our brand or the functionality of our website. When we have become aware of such websites, we have employed technological or legal measures in an attempt to halt their operations. However, we may be unable to detect all such websites in a timely manner and, even if we could, technological and legal measures may be insufficient to halt their operations. In some cases, particularly in the case of websites operating outside of the United States, our available remedies may not be adequate to protect us against the impact of the operation of such websites. Regardless of whether we can successfully enforce our rights against the operators of these websites, any measures that we may take could require us to expend significant financial or other resources, which could harm our business, results of operations or financial condition. In addition, to the extent that such activity creates confusion among consumers or advertisers, our brand and business could be harmed.\nLegal proceedings against us could be costly and time consuming to defend.\nWe are from time to time subject to legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, including claims brought by our clients or vendors in connection with commercial disputes, claims brought by our clients\u2019 current or prospective renters, including class action lawsuits based on asserted statutory or regulatory violations, employment-based claims made by our current or former employees, and other claims brought by administrative agencies, government regulators, or insurers.\nOn February 23, 2015, we received from the Federal Trade Commission (\u201cFTC\u201d) a Civil Investigative Demand consisting of interrogatories and a request to produce documents relating to our compliance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act (\u201cFCRA\u201d). We responded to the request and requests for additional information by the FTC. On November 2, 2017, the FTC staff informed us of its belief that there was a basis for claims that could include monetary and injunctive relief against us for failing to follow reasonable procedures to assure maximum possible accuracy of our tenant screening reports. In October 2018, we reached a settlement with the FTC resolving all issues raised by the FTC related to this matter. Under the settlement, we paid $3.0 million to the FTC and agreed to continue to comply with the FCRA. The settlement does not require any changes to our current business practices. We believe that our business practices did not, and do not, violate the FCRA or any other laws.\nIn connection with the Merger Agreement, we filed with the SEC the Proxy Statement on February 5, 2021. Following the filing of the Proxy Statement, four lawsuits relating to the Merger were filed: (i) Asp v. RealPage, Inc., et al., Case No: 1:21-cv-00158-LPS, filed in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware on February 5, 2021, on behalf of an individual stockholder of the Company (the \u201cAsp Action\u201d); (ii) Parshall v. RealPage, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:21-cv-00206-LPS, filed in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware on February 16, 2021 on behalf of an individual stockholder of the Company (the \u201cParshall Action\u201d); (iii) Anderson v. RealPage, Inc., et al., Case No: 1:21-cv-00212-LPS, filed in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware on February 16, 2021 on behalf of an individual stockholder of the Company (the \u201cAnderson Action\u201d); and (iv) Waterman v. RealPage, Inc. et al, Case No. 1:21-cv-00230-LPS, filed in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware on February 18, 2021 on behalf of an individual stockholder of the Company (the \u201cWaterman Action\u201d and together with the Asp Action, the Parshall Action, and the Anderson Action, the \u201cActions\u201d). In addition, the Company received a demand letter relating to the Merger on February 8, 2021 from counsel representing an individual stockholder of the Company (the \u201cDemand Letter\u201d and together with the Actions, the \u201cMatters\u201d). The Matters each allege that the defendants named therein violated Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, because the Proxy Statement allegedly omits or misstates certain material information. The Actions each seek, among other things, injunctive relief preventing the consummation of the Merger, rescission of the Merger if it is consummated, damages and attorneys\u2019 fees. We believe that the claims asserted in the Matters are without merit.\nLitigation, enforcement actions and other legal proceedings, regardless of their outcome, may result in substantial costs and may divert management\u2019s attention and our resources, which may harm our business, overall financial condition and operating results. In addition, legal claims that have not yet been asserted against us may be asserted in the future. Although we maintain insurance, there is no guarantee that such insurance will be available or sufficient to cover any such legal proceedings or claims. For example, insurance may not cover such legal proceedings or claims or the insurer may withhold or dispute coverage of such legal proceedings or claims on various grounds, including by alleging such coverage is beyond the scope of such policies, that we are not in compliance with the terms of such insurance policies or that such policies are not in effect, even after proceeds under such insurance policies have been received by us. A legal proceeding or claim brought against us that is uninsured or under-insured could result in unanticipated costs, thereby harming our operating results. We are currently involved in a dispute with our insurance carrier regarding coverage for a May 2018 targeted email phishing incident that led to a business email compromise and the diversion of funds totaling approximately $6.0 million, net of recoveries, that were intended for disbursement to three of our clients. The insurance carrier made payment on a portion of our claim in January 2019, and while there can be no assurance of the final outcome, we intend to vigorously pursue repayment of the remaining losses. Insurance\nmay not be sufficient for one or more such legal proceedings or claims and may not continue to be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all.\nWe could be sued for contract, warranty or product liability claims, and such lawsuits may disrupt our business, divert management\u2019s attention and our financial resources or have an adverse effect on our financial results.\nWe provide warranties to clients of certain of our solutions and services relating primarily to product functionality, network uptime, critical infrastructure availability and hardware replacement. General errors, defects, inaccuracies or other performance problems in the software applications underlying our solutions or inaccuracies in or loss of the data we provide to our clients could result in financial or other damages to our clients. Additionally, errors associated with any delivery of our services, including utility billing, could result in financial or other damages to our clients. There can be no assurance that any warranty disclaimers, general disclaimers, waivers or limitations of liability set forth in our contracts would be enforceable or would otherwise protect us from liability for damages. We maintain general liability insurance coverage, including coverage for errors and omissions, in amounts and under terms that we believe are appropriate. There can be no assurance that this coverage will continue to be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all, or in sufficient amounts to cover one or more claims, or that the insurer will not deny coverage for any future claim or dispute coverage of such legal proceedings or claims even after proceeds under such insurance policies have been received by us. The successful assertion of one or more claims against us that exceeds available insurance coverage, could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe rental housing industry, electronic commerce and many of the products and services that we offer, including background screening services, utility billing, affordable housing compliance and audit services, insurance and payments are subject to extensive and evolving governmental regulation. Changes in regulations or our failure to comply with regulations could harm our operating results.\nThe rental housing industry is subject to extensive and complex federal, state and local laws and regulations. Our services and solutions must work within the extensive and evolving legal and regulatory requirements applicable to us, our clients or our third-party service providers, including, but not limited to, those under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Deceptive Trade Practices Act, the Drivers Privacy Protection Act, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act, the United States Tax Reform Act of 1986 (TRA86), which is an IRS law governing tax credits, the Privacy Rules, Safeguards Rule and Consumer Report Information Disposal Rule promulgated by the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, the FTC\u2019s Telemarketing Sales Rule, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA), the CAN-SPAM Act, the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, the regulations of the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development, or HUD, HIPAA/HITECH, rules and regulations of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), the Americans with Disabilities Act, and complex and divergent state and local laws and regulations related to data privacy and security, credit and consumer reporting, deceptive trade practices, discrimination in housing, telemarketing, electronic communications, call recording, utility billing and energy and gas consumption. These regulations are complex, change frequently and may become more stringent over time. Although we attempt to structure and adapt our solutions and service offerings to comply with these complex and evolving laws and regulations, we may be found to be in violation. If we are found to be in violation of any applicable laws or regulations, we could be subject to administrative and other enforcement actions as well as class action lawsuits or demands for client reimbursement. Additionally, many applicable laws and regulations provide for penalties or assessments on a per occurrence basis. Due to the nature of our business, the type of services we provide and the large number of transactions processed by our solutions, our potential liability in an enforcement action or class action lawsuit could be significant. In addition, entities such as HUD, the FTC and the CFPB have the authority to promulgate rules and regulations that may impact us, our clients and our business.\nOn February 23, 2015, we received from the FTC a Civil Investigative Demand consisting of interrogatories and a request to produce documents relating to our compliance with the FCRA. We responded to the request and requests for additional information by the FTC. On November 2, 2017, the FTC staff informed us of its belief that there was a basis for claims that could include monetary and injunctive relief against us for failing to follow reasonable procedures to assure maximum possible accuracy of our tenant screening reports. We believe that our business practices did not, and do not, violate the FCRA or any other law. In October 2018, we reached a settlement with the FTC resolving all issues raised by the FTC related to this matter. Under the settlement, we paid $3.0 million to the FTC and agreed to continue to comply with the FCRA. The settlement does not require any changes to our current business practices.\nWe believe increased regulation is likely in the area of data privacy, and laws and regulations applying to the solicitation, collection, processing or use of personally identifiable information or consumer information could affect our and our clients\u2019 ability to use and share data, potentially reducing demand for our on demand software solutions. In October 2015, the European Court of Justice invalidated the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor framework, which had been the primary compliance mechanism for establishing data transfers outside of the European Economic Area in accordance with the European Union\u2019s Data Protection Directive 95-46 EC. In July 2016, the U.S. and European Union entered into a new compliance framework, (the \u201cPrivacy Shield\u201d), which was intended to replace the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor framework. The Privacy Shield framework was subsequently\ninvalidated in July 2020, creating uncertainty regarding compliance with applicable privacy laws and regulations. While alternative compliance options exist, the long-term viability of the overall compliance framework remains in question, which could result in increased regulation, cost of compliance and limitations on data transfers for both our clients and us. In May 2018, the General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d) became effective in the European Union and imposed new requirements and restrictions upon companies that process personal data of EU citizens. In June 2018, the State of California passed the California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d), which created new requirements and restrictions for processing personal data of California citizens beginning January 1, 2020. If we are unable to meet the requirements of applicable privacy laws and regulations, the Privacy Shield, GDPR or CCPA with respect to our services subject to these provisions, we may incur monetary or other penalties which could harm our business or financial condition.\nSome of our LeaseStar products operate under the real estate brokerage laws of numerous states and require maintaining licenses in many of these states. Brokerage laws in these states could change, affecting our ability to provide some LeaseStar or, if applicable, other products in these states.\nIncreased regulation is also likely in states and local jurisdictions related to rent control and rent regulation. During 2019, California, New York and Oregon each adopted state legislation that regulates rent pricing, and other states and municipalities are considering similar legislation. Such legislation impacts our clients\u2019 businesses as they determine rental rates, and could impact the supply of rental units over time in markets impacted by such regulation. The impact of restrictions on rental rates could also depress demand and pricing for certain of our products designed to enable our clients to evaluate market conditions in determining rental rates.\nWe deliver our on demand software solutions over the Internet and sell and market certain of our solutions over the Internet. As Internet commerce continues to evolve, increasing regulation by federal, state or foreign agencies becomes more likely. Taxation of products or services provided over the Internet or other charges imposed by government agencies or by private organizations for accessing the Internet may also be imposed. Any regulation imposing greater fees for Internet use or restricting information exchange over the Internet could result in a decline in the use of the Internet and the viability of on demand software solutions, which could harm our business and operating results.\nOur insurance business is subject to governmental regulation which could reduce our profitability or limit our growth.\nThrough our wholly owned subsidiaries, we hold insurance agent licenses from a number of individual state departments of insurance and are subject to state governmental regulation and supervision in connection with the operation of our insurance business. In addition, we have appointed numerous sub-producing agents to generate insurance business for our products. These sub-producing agents primarily consist of property owners and managers who market insurance products to residents. The sub-producing agents are subject to the same state regulation and supervision, and we cannot ensure that these sub-producing agents will not violate these regulations, and thus expose our insurance business to sanctions by these state departments of insurance for any such violations. Furthermore, state insurance departments conduct periodic examinations, audits and investigations of the affairs of insurance agents. This state governmental supervision could reduce our profitability or limit the growth of our insurance business by increasing the costs of regulatory compliance, limiting or restricting the solutions we provide or the methods by which we provide them or subjecting us to the possibility of regulatory actions or proceedings. Our continued ability to maintain these insurance agent licenses in the jurisdictions in which we are licensed depends on our compliance with the rules and regulations promulgated from time to time by the regulatory authorities in each of these jurisdictions.\nIn all jurisdictions, the applicable laws and regulations are subject to amendment or interpretation by regulatory authorities. Generally, such authorities are vested with relatively broad discretion to grant, renew and revoke licenses and approvals and to implement regulations, as well as regulate rates that may be charged for premiums on policies. Accordingly, we may be precluded or temporarily suspended from carrying on some or all of the activities of our insurance business or fined or penalized in a given jurisdiction. No assurances can be given that our insurance business can continue to be conducted in any given jurisdiction as it has been conducted in the past.\nWe are required to maintain a 50-state general agency insurance license as well as individual insurance licenses for each sales agent involved in the solicitation of insurance products. Both the agency and individual licenses require compliance with state insurance regulations, payment of licensure fees, and continuing education programs. In the event that regulatory compliance requirements are not met, we could be subject to license suspension or revocation, state Department of Insurance audits and regulatory fines. As a result, our ability to engage in the business of insurance could be restricted, and our revenue and financial results will be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Ownership of our Common Stock\nThe concentration of our capital stock owned by insiders may limit your ability to influence corporate matters.\nOur executive officers, directors, and entities affiliated with them together beneficially owned approximately 11.1% of our common stock as of December 31, 2020. Of such amount, Stephen T. Winn, our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board, and entities beneficially owned by Mr. Winn held an aggregate of approximately 10.1% of our common stock as of\nDecember 31, 2020. Beneficial ownership is determined in accordance with the rules of the SEC. The number of shares of common stock deemed outstanding includes all shares of restricted stock and those shares issuable upon exercise of options that may be exercised within 60 days after December 31, 2020. This concentration of ownership may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock because investors often perceive disadvantages in owning stock in companies with large stockholders. Mr. Winn and entities beneficially owned by Mr. Winn may exert significant influence over our management and affairs and matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and the approval of significant corporate transactions, such as mergers, consolidations or the sale of substantially all of our assets. Consequently, this concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control, including a merger, consolidation or other business combination involving us, or discouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control, even if that change of control would benefit our other stockholders.\nThe trading price of our common stock may be volatile.\nThe trading price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, including, but not limited to, those described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section, some of which are beyond our control. Factors affecting the trading price of our common stock include:\n\u2022variations in our operating results or in expectations regarding our operating results;\n\u2022variations in operating results of similar companies;\n\u2022changes in our financial guidance and how our actual results compare to such guidance;\n\u2022changes in the estimates of our operating results or changes in recommendations by any research analysts that elect to follow our common stock;\n\u2022announcements of technological innovations, new solutions or enhancements, acquisitions, strategic alliances or agreements by us or by our competitors;\n\u2022announcements by competitors regarding their entry into new markets, and new product, service and pricing strategies;\n\u2022marketing, advertising or other initiatives by us or our competitors;\n\u2022increases or decreases in our sales of products and services for use in the management of units by clients and increases or decreases in the number of units managed by our clients;\n\u2022threatened or actual litigation;\n\u2022changes in our board of directors or management;\n\u2022recruitment or departure of key personnel;\n\u2022market conditions in our industry and the economy as a whole;\n\u2022the overall performance of the equity markets;\n\u2022sales of our shares of common stock by existing stockholders;\n\u2022volatility in our stock price, which may lead to higher stock-based expense under applicable accounting standards; and\n\u2022adoption or modification of regulations, policies, procedures or programs applicable to our business.\nIn addition, the stock market in general, and the market for technology and specifically Internet-related companies, has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. Broad market and industry factors may harm the market price of our common stock regardless of our actual operating performance. In addition, in the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a particular company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against these companies. This litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management\u2019s attention and our resources, whether or not we are successful in such litigation.\nFuture sales of our common stock in the public market could lower the market price for our common stock.\nIn the future, we may sell additional shares of our common stock to raise capital. On June 5, 2018, we amended our certificate of incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of common stock by 125,000,000 shares, bringing the total authorized shares of common stock to 250,000,000. In May 2020, we consummated an underwritten public offering of 5.85 million shares of our common stock, with total gross proceeds of $345.0 million. A substantial number of shares of our common stock is reserved for issuance of awards under our equity plan, and upon conversion of the Convertible Notes. We cannot predict the size of future issuances or the effect, if any, that they may have on the market price for our common stock. The issuance and sale of substantial amounts of common stock, or the perception that such issuances and sales may occur, could\nadversely affect the market price of our common stock and impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity.\nThe Capped Calls, Note Hedges and Warrant transactions may affect the value of our common stock.\nIn connection with the pricing of the Convertible Notes issued in May 2017 and May 2020, we entered into hedging transactions (the Capped Calls and Note Hedges, collectively referred to as the \u201cNote Hedge Instruments\u201d) with the option counterparties. We also entered into Warrant transactions with the May 2017 option counterparties. The Hedge Instruments are expected, subject to certain limits in the case of the Capped Calls, to reduce the potential dilution upon conversion of the Convertible Notes and/or offset any cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of Convertible Notes once converted, as the case may be. However, the Warrants could separately have a dilutive effect on our common stock to the extent that the market price per share of our common stock exceeds the strike price of the Warrants.\nIn connection with establishing their initial hedges of the Hedge Instruments and Warrants, the option counterparties or their respective affiliates expected to enter into various derivative transactions with respect to our common stock concurrently with or shortly after the pricing of the Convertible Notes issued in May 2017 and May 2020. The option counterparties or their respective affiliates may modify any such hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to our common stock and/or purchasing or selling our common stock or other securities of ours in secondary market transactions prior to the maturity of the Convertible Notes (and are likely to do so during any observation period related to a conversion of the Convertible Notes). This activity could also cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in the market price of our common stock.\nOur charter documents and Delaware law could prevent a takeover that stockholders consider favorable and could also reduce the market price of our stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control of our company. These provisions could also make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions. These provisions include:\n\u2022a classified board of directors whose members serve staggered three-year terms;\n\u2022not providing for cumulative voting in the election of directors;\n\u2022authorizing our board of directors to issue, without stockholder approval, preferred stock with rights senior to those of our common stock;\n\u2022prohibiting stockholder action by written consent; and\n\u2022requiring advance notification of stockholder nominations and proposals.\nThese and other provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws and under Delaware law could discourage potential takeover attempts, reduce the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock and result in the market price of our common stock being lower than it would be without these provisions.\nWe do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock.\nWe do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. If we do not pay cash dividends, you would receive a return on your investment in our common stock only if the market price of our common stock has increased when you sell your shares. In addition, the terms of our credit facilities currently restrict our ability to pay dividends. See additional discussion under the Dividend Policy heading of Part II, Item 5 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe Merger is subject to receipt of approval from our stockholders as well as the satisfaction of other closing conditions in the Merger Agreement.\nThe Merger Agreement contains a number of customary conditions to complete the Merger, including, (1) the adoption of the Merger Agreement by the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock, (2) the expiration or early termination of the applicable waiting period under the HSR Act, and the approval of the Merger under other applicable antitrust approvals, (3) the absence of an order, injunction or law prohibiting the Merger, (4) receipt of governmental consents (or, in certain circumstances, implementation of alternative arrangements) with respect to a change of control of certain money transmitter licenses held by a subsidiary of RealPage, (5) the accuracy of the other party\u2019s representations and warranties, subject to certain materiality standards set forth in the Merger Agreement, (6) compliance in all material respects with the other party\u2019s obligations under the Merger Agreement and (7) no Company Material Adverse Effect (as defined in the Merger Agreement) having occurred since the date of the Merger Agreement. We can provide no assurance that all required approvals will be obtained or that all closing conditions will be satisfied, and, if all required approvals are obtained and the closing conditions are satisfied, we can provide no assurance as to the terms, conditions and timing of such approvals or the timing of\nthe completion of the Merger. Any delay in completing the Merger could cause us not to realize some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve if the Merger is successfully completed within its expected timeframe.\nThe announcement and pendency of our agreement to be acquired by funds affiliated with Thoma Bravo may have an adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nOn December 20, 2020, we entered into the Merger Agreement with Parent and Merger Sub, pursuant to which Parent agreed to acquire us subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein. Our pending acquisition by Parent may have an adverse effect on our revenue in the near term if our customers delay, defer, or cancel purchases or orders pending completion of the Merger. In addition, the announcement and pendency of the Merger may cause reluctance by customers to begin or continue to do business with us due to potential uncertainty about the direction of our products and solutions following consummation of the Merger. We are subject to additional risks in connection with the announcement and pendency of the Merger, including:\n\u2022difficulties maintaining existing and/or establishing business relationships, including relationships with significant customers, suppliers and partners;\n\u2022disruption to our business, including increased costs and diversion of management time and resources that could otherwise have been devoted to other opportunities that may have been beneficial to us;\n\u2022the restrictions imposed on our business and operations pursuant to certain covenants set forth in the Merger Agreement, which may prevent us from pursuing certain opportunities, responding to competitive pressures and industry developments, or taking certain actions without Parent\u2019s approval;\n\u2022adverse effects on our ability to attract, recruit, retain and motivate current and prospective employees who may be uncertain about their future roles following completion of the Merger, and the possibility that our employees could lose productivity as a result of uncertainty regarding their employment following the Merger;\n\u2022the outcome of legal proceedings that have been and may be instituted against us, our directors, executive officers and others relating to the Merger; and\n\u2022the diversion of our employees\u2019 attention due to activities related to the Merger.\nThe failure to complete the Merger may adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and stock price.\nAs described above, consummation of the Merger remains subject to certain customary closing conditions. There can be no assurance that these conditions to the completion of the Merger will be satisfied in a timely manner or at all. If the Merger is not completed, our stock price could fall to the extent its current price reflects an assumption that the Merger will be completed, and it is uncertain when, if ever, our stock price would return to the price at which our shares currently trade. Furthermore, if the Merger is not completed, we may suffer other consequences that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and stock price, including the following:\n\u2022any disruptions to our business resulting from the announcement and pendency of the Merger, including adverse changes in our relationships with customers, suppliers, partners and employees, may continue or intensify in the event the Merger is not consummated or is significantly delayed;\n\u2022matters relating to the Merger require substantial commitments of management time and resources that could otherwise have been devoted to other opportunities that may have been beneficial to us;\n\u2022we would have incurred significant costs, including professional services fees and other transaction costs, in connection with the Merger that we would be unable to recover;\n\u2022we may have to pay Parent a termination fee of $288.0 million under certain circumstances that give rise to the termination of the Merger Agreement;\n\u2022we may be subject to negative publicity or be negatively perceived by the investment or business communities;\n\u2022we have been and may be subject to legal proceedings related to the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement;\n\u2022we may not be able to take advantage of alternative business opportunities or effectively respond to competitive pressures; and\n\u2022we may experience a departure of employees.\nOther General Risks\nChanges in, or errors in our interpretations and applications of, financial accounting standards or practices may cause adverse, unexpected financial reporting fluctuations and affect our reported results of operations.\nA change in accounting standards or practices can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even affect our reporting of transactions completed before the change is effective. New accounting pronouncements and varying interpretations of accounting pronouncements have occurred and may occur in the future. Changes to existing rules or the questioning of current practices or errors in our interpretations and applications of financial accounting standards or practices may adversely affect our reported financial results or the way in which we conduct our business.\nFor more information on recently issued accounting standards, see Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOur ability to use net operating losses to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations.\nIn general, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Internal Revenue Code, a corporation that undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its pre-change net operating losses, or NOLs, to offset future taxable income. Our ability to utilize NOLs of companies that we have acquired or may acquire in the future may be subject to limitations. Future changes in our stock ownership, some of which are outside of our control, could result in an ownership change under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. For these reasons, we may not be able to utilize a material portion of the NOLs reflected on our balance sheet, even if we maintain profitability.\nIf we are required to collect sales and use taxes on the solutions we sell in additional taxing jurisdictions, we may be subject to liability for past sales and our future sales may decrease.\nStates and some local taxing jurisdictions have differing rules and regulations governing sales and use taxes, and these rules and regulations are subject to varying interpretations that may change over time. We review these rules and regulations periodically and currently collect and remit sales taxes in taxing jurisdictions where we believe we are required to do so. However, additional state and/or local taxing jurisdictions may seek to impose sales or other tax collection obligations on us, including for past sales. A successful assertion that we should be collecting additional sales or other taxes on our solutions could result in substantial tax liabilities for past sales, discourage clients from purchasing our solutions or otherwise harm our business and operating results. This risk may be greater with regard to solutions acquired through acquisitions because the acquired entities may not have had the same practices and procedures that we have in place.\nWe may also become subject to tax audits or similar procedures in jurisdictions where we already collect and remit sales taxes. A successful assertion that we have not collected and remitted taxes at the appropriate levels may also result in substantial tax liabilities for past sales. Liability for past taxes may also include very substantial interest and penalty charges. Our client contracts provide that our clients must pay all applicable sales and similar taxes. Nevertheless, clients may be reluctant to pay back taxes and may refuse responsibility for interest or penalties associated with those taxes. If we are required to collect and pay back taxes and the associated interest and penalties, and if our clients fail or refuse to reimburse us for all or a portion of these amounts, we will incur unplanned expenses that may be substantial. Moreover, imposition of such taxes on our solutions going forward will effectively increase the cost of such solutions to our clients and may adversely affect our ability to continue to sell those solutions to existing clients or to gain new clients in the areas in which such taxes are imposed.\nChanges to applicable U.S. or foreign tax laws and regulations may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to federal and state income taxes in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions, and our domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to the allocation of expenses in differing jurisdictions. Our tax rate is affected by changes in the mix of earnings and losses in jurisdictions with differing statutory tax rates, including jurisdictions in which we have completed or may complete acquisitions and the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, including our ability to utilize our net operating losses. Increases in our effective tax rate could harm our operating results.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\u201cTax Reform Act\u201d), which was signed into law on December 22, 2017, contains significant changes to the U.S. federal income tax laws, including changes to the corporate tax rate, business-related deductions, and taxation of foreign earnings, among others, that are generally effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. Throughout calendar year 2018, the U.S. Treasury and certain states issued proposed and final legislation and clarifying guidance with respect to the various provisions of the Tax Reform Act. Additional legislation and guidance may still be issued in the future, which could have a material adverse impact on the value of our U.S. deferred tax assets, result in significant changes to currently computed income tax liabilities for past and current tax periods, and increase our future U.S. tax expense. The implementation by us of new practices and processes designed to comply with, and benefit from, the Tax Reform Act and its rules and regulations could require us to make substantial changes to our business practices, allocate additional resources, and increase our costs, which could negatively affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business is subject to the risks of international operations.\nCompliance with complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations increases our cost of doing business. These numerous and sometimes conflicting laws and regulations include internal control and disclosure rules, data privacy and filtering requirements, anti-corruption laws, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials, and antitrust and competition regulations, among others.\nViolations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business and on our ability to carry on operations in one or more countries, and could also materially affect our brand, our international expansion efforts, our ability to attract and retain employees, our business and our operating results. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, or agents will not violate our policies.\nIn addition, we are subject to a variety of risks inherent in doing business internationally, including:\n\u2022political, social, economic or environmental instability, terrorist attacks and security concerns in general;\n\u2022limitations of local infrastructure;\n\u2022fluctuations in currency exchange rates;\n\u2022higher levels of credit risk and payment fraud;\n\u2022reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries;\n\u2022difficulties in staffing and managing global operations and the increased travel, infrastructure and legal compliance costs associated with multiple international locations;\n\u2022compliance with statutory equity requirements and management of tax consequences; and\n\u2022outbreaks of highly contagious diseases.\nIf we are unable to manage the complexity of our international operations successfully, our financial results could be adversely affected.\nWe rely on our management team and need additional personnel to grow our business, and the loss of one or more key employees or our inability to attract and retain qualified personnel could harm our business.\nOur success and future growth depend on the skills, working relationships and continued services of our management team. The loss of our Chief Executive Officer or other senior executives, or our inability to successfully integrate certain new members of our management, could adversely affect our business. Our future success also will depend on our ability to attract, retain and motivate highly skilled software developers, marketing and sales personnel, technical support and product development personnel in the United States and internationally. Our employees work for us on an at-will basis. Competition for these types of personnel is intense, particularly in the software industry. As a result, we may be unable to attract or retain qualified personnel. Our inability to attract and retain the necessary personnel could adversely affect our business.\nIf securities analysts do not continue to publish research or reports about our business or if they publish negative evaluations of our stock, the price of our stock could decline.\nWe expect that the trading price for our common stock may be affected by research or reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade their evaluations of our stock, the price of our stock could decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company, we could lose visibility in the market for our stock, which in turn could cause our stock price to decline.",

    "item_2": "Item 2. Properties.\nAt December 31, 2020, we leased approximately 457,000 square feet of space for our corporate headquarters in Richardson, Texas under a lease agreement that expires in August 2028 (with two 5-year renewal options). We also lease office space in a variety of other areas. These locations include, among others, the following: Irvine, California; San Diego, California; Lombard, Illinois; Boston, Massachusetts; Hackensack, New Jersey; Greenville, South Carolina; Hyderabad, India; Cebu, Philippines; and Manila, Philippines. We also license data center space and employ the services of cloud service providers at multiple locations in the U.S. and internationally. We believe our current and planned office and data center facilities will be adequate for the foreseeable future.",
    "item_3": "Item 3. Legal Proceedings.\nOn February 23, 2015, we received from the FTC a Civil Investigative Demand consisting of interrogatories and a request to produce documents relating to our compliance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act (\u201cFCRA\u201d). We responded to the request and requests for additional information by the FTC. On November 2, 2017, the FTC staff informed us of its belief that there was a basis for claims that could include monetary and injunctive relief against us for failing to follow reasonable procedures to assure maximum possible accuracy of our tenant screening reports. We believe that our business practices did not, and do not, violate the FCRA or any other laws.\nIn October 2018, we reached a settlement with the FTC resolving all issues raised by the FTC related to this matter. Under the settlement, we paid $3.0 million to the FTC and agreed to continue to comply with the FCRA. The settlement did not require any changes to our current business practices.\nIn connection with the Merger Agreement, we filed with the SEC the Proxy Statement on February 5, 2021. Following the filing of the Proxy Statement, four lawsuits relating to the Merger were filed: (i) Asp v. RealPage, Inc., et al., Case No: 1:21-cv-00158-LPS, filed in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware on February 5, 2021, on behalf of an individual stockholder of the Company (the \u201cAsp Action\u201d); (ii) Parshall v. RealPage, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:21-cv-00206-LPS, filed in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware on February 16, 2021 on behalf of an individual stockholder of the Company (the \u201cParshall Action\u201d); (iii) Anderson v. RealPage, Inc., et al., Case No: 1:21-cv-00212-LPS, filed in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware on February 16, 2021 on behalf of an individual stockholder of the Company (the \u201cAnderson Action\u201d); and (iv) Waterman v. RealPage, Inc. et al, Case No. 1:21-cv-00230-LPS, filed in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware on February 18, 2021 on behalf of an individual stockholder of the Company (the \u201cWaterman Action\u201d and together with the Asp Action, the Parshall Action, and the Anderson Action, the \u201cActions\u201d). In addition, the Company received a demand letter relating to the Merger on February 8, 2021 from counsel representing an individual stockholder of the Company (the \u201cDemand Letter\u201d and together with the Actions, the \u201cMatters\u201d). The Matters each allege that the defendants named therein violated Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, because the Proxy Statement allegedly omits or misstates certain material information. The Actions each seek, among other things, injunctive relief preventing the consummation of the Merger, rescission of the Merger if it is consummated, damages and attorneys\u2019 fees. We believe that the claims asserted in the Matters are without merit.\nWe are subject to legal proceedings and claims arising in the ordinary course of business. We are involved in litigation and other legal proceedings and claims, including purported class action lawsuits, that have not been fully resolved. At this time, we believe that any reasonably possible adverse outcome of such matters would not be material either individually or in the aggregate. Our view of these matters may change in the future as litigation and events related thereto unfold. See the risk factors \u201cAssertions by a third party that we infringe its intellectual property, whether successful or not, could subject us to costly and time-consuming litigation or expensive licenses,\u201d \u201cThe rental housing industry, electronic commerce and many of the products and services that we offer, including background screening services, utility billing, affordable housing compliance and audit services, insurance and payments are subject to extensive and evolving governmental regulation.

Restricted shares granted under our stock-based expense plans which have not yet vested are considered to be held by one holder. Because many of our shares of common stock are held by brokers and other institutions on behalf of stockholders, the number of record holders of our shares is not indicative of the total number of stockholders.\nDividend Policy\nWe have neither declared nor paid any cash dividends on our common stock in recent fiscal years. We do not expect to pay cash dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future. Instead, we anticipate that all of our earnings will be used for the operation and growth of the business. Any future determination to declare cash dividends would be subject to the discretion of our board of directors and would depend upon various factors, including our results of operations; financial condition and liquidity requirements; restrictions that may be imposed by applicable law and our contracts; and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors.\nPerformance Graph\nThe following graph compares the relative performance of our common stock, the NASDAQ Global Market Index, NASDAQ Composite, and the NASDAQ Computer and Data Processing Index. This graph covers the annual periods ending December 31, 2015 through December 31, 2020.

In November 2019, our board of directors approved a new share repurchase program authorizing the repurchase of up to $100.0 million of our outstanding common stock through November 7, 2020. In October 2020, our board of directors approved a one year extension of this program authorizing the repurchase of up to $100.0 million of our outstanding common stock through November 7, 2021.

    "item_7": "Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our audited Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere in this filing. This discussion contains forward-looking statements based on current expectations and related to our plans, estimates, beliefs, and anticipated future financial performance. These statements involve risks and uncertainties, and our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including those set forth under \u201cRisk Factors,\u201d \u201cSpecial Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,\u201d and elsewhere in this filing.\nOverview\nWe are a leading global provider of software and data analytics to the real estate industry. Clients use our platform of solutions to improve operating performance and increase capital returns. By leveraging data as well as integrating and streamlining a wide range of complex processes and interactions among the rental real estate ecosystem, our platform helps our clients improve financial and operational performance and prudently place and harvest capital.\nThe substantial majority of our revenue is derived from sales of our on demand software solutions, representing 97.2%, 96.5%, and 95.9% of our total revenue during 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. We also derive revenue from our professional and other services, and a small percentage of our revenue is derived from sales of our on premise software solutions. Our on demand software solutions are sold pursuant to subscription license agreements, and our on premise software solutions are sold pursuant to term or perpetual licenses and associated maintenance agreements. For our insurance-based solutions, we earn revenue based on a commission rate that considers earned premiums, agent commission, incurred losses, and profit retained by our underwriting partner. Our transaction-based solutions are priced based on a fixed rate per transaction. We sell our solutions through our direct sales organization and derive substantially all of our revenue from sales in the United States. Our revenue has increased from $988.1 million in 2019 to $1,158.5 million in 2020. The increase in revenue was driven by growth in the sales of our on demand software solutions and incremental revenue from our recent acquisitions.\nWe believe there is increasing demand for solutions that bring efficiency and precision to the rental real estate industry, which has historically lacked the tools available to many other investment classes. While the use of, and transition to, data analytics and on demand software solutions in the rental real estate industry is growing rapidly, we believe it remains at a relatively early stage of adoption. Additionally, there is a modest level of penetration of our on demand software solutions in our existing client base. These factors present us with significant opportunities to generate revenue through sales of additional data analytics and on demand software solutions.\nOur company was formed in 1998 to acquire Rent Roll, Inc., which marketed and sold on premise property management systems for the conventional and affordable multifamily rental housing markets. In June 2001, we released OneSite, our first on demand property management system. Since 2002, we have expanded our platform of solutions to include property management, leasing and marketing, resident services, and asset optimization capabilities. In addition to the multifamily markets, we now serve the single family, senior living, student living, military housing, commercial, hospitality, homeowner association, short-term rental and vacation rental markets. Since July 2002, we have completed over 50 acquisitions of complementary technologies to supplement our internal product development and sales and marketing efforts and expand the scope of our solutions, the types of rental housing and vacation rental properties served by our solutions, and our client base. In connection with this expansion and these acquisitions, we have committed greater resources to developing and increasing sales of our platform of data analytics and on demand solutions. As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 7,600 employees.\nCOVID-19 Pandemic\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we responded to the challenges that the evolving COVID-19 (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) pandemic created for us and our customers. We transitioned a large percentage of our workforce to a work-from-home environment while continuing to support our customers as they used our software services to sustain their operations while reducing in-person interactions with their customers. Portions of our business, including our electronic payment processing services, experienced accelerated growth as a result of the pandemic. Certain of our other services experienced lower transactional volumes at the onset of COVID-19, before beginning a return to more normalized levels in the second half of the year.\nRecent Developments\nThoma Bravo Acquisition\nOn December 21, 2020, we entered into the Merger Agreement to be acquired by Thoma Bravo, a leading private equity investment firm focused on the software and technology-enabled services sector, in an all-cash transaction that values RealPage at approximately $10.2 billion, including net debt. Subject to the terms, conditions and certain exceptions set forth in the Merger Agreement, RealPage stockholders will receive $88.75 per share in cash, less any applicable withholding taxes, upon\ncompletion of the Merger. The Merger is expected to be completed in the second calendar quarter of 2021.\nBecause the Merger is not yet complete, and except as otherwise specifically stated, the descriptions and disclosures presented elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including those that present forward-looking information as that term is defined elsewhere herein assume the continuation of RealPage, Inc. as a public company. If the Merger is consummated, our actions and results may be different than those anticipated by such forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and such differences may be material.\n2021 Winter Storm\nWe offer risk mitigation services to our clients by acting as an insurance agent whereby we derive commission revenue from the sale of insurance products to our clients\u2019 residents. These agent commissions are based upon a percentage of the premium that the insurance companies charge the policyholders.\nWe also receive contingent commissions from the insurance companies that are based on the profitability of the policies over a defined time period. We record contingent commissions based on estimates that consider historical and projected claims loss rates.\nIn mid-February 2021, a major winter storm affected large portions of the United States including several states that do not normally experience such severe weather. Policy holders in the impacted areas suffered property damage and related expenses caused by the severe weather and by accompanying power and water outages that occurred during and following the storms. As a result, we expect that a substantially higher than normal volume of insurance claims will be filed in the impacted areas.\nAs insurance claims continue to develop, we are assessing the impact of these claims on our consolidated financial statements. Based on preliminary information, we believe our contingent commission revenue for 2021 could be adversely impacted by as much as $5 million to $15 million.\nAcquisition Activity\nWhiteSky\nOn December 31, 2020, we entered into a Purchase Agreement by which we acquired all the outstanding equity interests of WhiteSky Communications, LLC (\u201cWhiteSky\u201d), a provider of managed communications services, enabling multifamily, student and other properties to provide managed bulk Internet, video, voice-over-internet protocol (VOIP) phone, and Wi-Fi services. Aggregate purchase consideration was $64.9 million, including deferred cash obligations of up to $6.5 million, which are subject to working capital adjustments and indemnification claims. The acquisition was financed with cash on hand.\nChirp\nOn September 21, 2020, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger by which we acquired all the outstanding stock of Chirp Systems, Inc. (\u201cChirp\u201d), a provider of smart access software and technology solutions to the multifamily housing industry. Aggregate purchase consideration was $16.8 million, including contingent consideration of up to $10.0 million that is tied to operational performance targets through 2022, and deferred cash obligations of up to $1.3 million, which are subject to working capital adjustments and indemnification claims. The acquisition was financed with cash on hand. The parent company of one of the significant selling shareholders of Chirp is a customer of RealPage. In addition, a member of the board of directors of that customer is also a member of our board of directors.\nStratis\nOn August 31, 2020, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger by which we acquired all the outstanding stock of Stratis IoT, Inc. (\u201cStratis\u201d), a provider of software, technology and services that enable smart apartments and intelligent buildings, including a software-as-a-service (\u201cSaaS\u201d) platform specifically built for the complexities of the multifamily and student housing industries. Aggregate purchase consideration was $64.8 million, including deferred cash obligations of up to $6.0 million, subject to working capital adjustments and indemnification claims. The acquisition was financed with cash on hand.\nModern Message\nOn January 22, 2020, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger by which we acquired all the outstanding stock of Modern Message Inc. (\u201cModern Message\u201d), a provider of resident engagement solutions to the multifamily housing industry. Aggregate purchase consideration was $64.7 million, including deferred cash obligations of up to $2.0 million, which are subject to working capital adjustments and indemnification claims. The acquisition was financed with cash on hand.\nRefer to Note 3 of the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of these acquisitions.\nKey Business Metrics\nIn addition to traditional financial measures, we monitor our operating performance using a number of financially and non-financially derived metrics that are not included in our consolidated financial statements. We monitor the key performance indicators reflected in the following table:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2019 2018\n(in thousands, except dollar per unit data)\nRevenue:\nTotal revenue $ 1,158,484 $ 988,136 $ 869,480\nOn demand revenue $ 1,125,838 $ 953,576 $ 833,709\nOn demand revenue as a percentage of total revenue 97.2 % 96.5 % 95.9 %\nNon-GAAP total revenue $ 1,159,986 $ 989,004 $ 871,370\nNon-GAAP on demand revenue $ 1,127,340 $ 954,444 $ 835,599\nAdjusted EBITDA $ 322,476 $ 281,685 $ 231,176\nEnding on demand units 19,709 18,475 16,219\nAverage on demand units 19,070 16,758 14,847\nOn demand annual client value $ 1,161,648 $ 1,039,588 $ 876,637\nOn demand revenue per ending on demand unit $ 58.94 $ 56.27 $ 54.05\nOn demand revenue: This metric represents the GAAP revenue derived from license and subscription fees relating to our on demand software solutions, typically licensed over one year terms; commission income from sales of renter\u2019s insurance policies; and transaction fees for certain of our on demand software solutions. We consider on demand revenue to be a key business metric because we believe the market for our on demand software solutions represents the largest growth opportunity for our business.\nOn demand revenue as a percentage of total revenue: This metric represents on demand revenue for the period presented divided by total revenue for the same period. We use on demand revenue as a percentage of total revenue to measure our success executing our strategy to increase the penetration of our on demand software solutions and expand our recurring revenue streams attributable to these solutions. We expect our on demand revenue to remain a significant percentage of our total revenue although the actual percentage may vary from period to period due to a number of factors, including the timing of acquisitions, professional and other revenues, and on premise perpetual license sales and maintenance fees.\nNon-GAAP total revenue: This metric is calculated by adding acquisition-related deferred revenue to total revenue. We believe it is useful to include deferred revenue written down for GAAP purposes under purchase accounting rules in order to appropriately measure the underlying performance of our business operations in the period of activity and associated expense. Further, we believe this measure is useful to investors as a way to evaluate our ongoing performance because it provides a more accurate depiction of revenue arising from our strategic acquisitions.\nThe following provides a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP total revenue:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2019 2018\n(in thousands)\nTotal revenue $ 1,158,484 $ 988,136 $ 869,480\nAcquisition-related deferred revenue 1,502 868 1,890\nNon-GAAP total revenue $ 1,159,986 $ 989,004 $ 871,370\nNon-GAAP on demand revenue: This metric reflects total on demand revenue plus acquisition-related deferred revenue, as described above. We believe inclusion of these items provides a useful measure of the underlying performance of our on demand business operations in the period of activity and associated expense. Further, we believe that investors and financial analysts find this measure to be useful in evaluating our ongoing performance because it provides a more accurate depiction of on demand revenue arising from our strategic acquisitions.\nThe following provides a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP on demand revenue:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2019 2018\n(in thousands)\nOn demand revenue $ 1,125,838 $ 953,576 $ 833,709\nAcquisition-related deferred revenue 1,502 868 1,890\nNon-GAAP on demand revenue $ 1,127,340 $ 954,444 $ 835,599\nAdjusted EBITDA: We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income, plus (1) acquisition-related deferred revenue, (2) depreciation, asset impairment, and loss on disposal of assets, (3) amortization of product technologies and intangible assets, (4) change in fair value of equity investment, (5) loss due to cyber incident, net of recoveries, (6) acquisition-related expense, (7) organizational realignment costs, (8) regulatory and legal matters, (9) stock-based expense, (10) interest expense, net, and (11) income tax expense (benefit). We believe that investors and financial analysts find this non-GAAP financial measure to be useful in analyzing our financial and operational performance, comparing this performance to our peers and competitors, and understanding our ability to generate income from ongoing business operations.\nThe following provides a reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2019 2018\n(in thousands)\nNet income $ 46,314 $ 58,208 $ 34,725\nAcquisition-related deferred revenue 1,502 868 1,890\nDepreciation, asset impairment, and loss on disposal of assets 36,817 36,724 35,211\nAmortization of product technologies and intangible assets 103,002 80,764 71,708\nChange in fair value of equity investment - (2,600) -\nLoss due to cyber incident, net of recoveries - - 4,952\nAcquisition-related expense 9,728 4,754 2,437\nOrganizational realignment 2,431 1,533 -\nRegulatory and legal matters 5,969 1,465 78\nStock-based expense 59,274 62,563 50,641\nInterest expense, net 52,446 35,056 29,959\nIncome tax expense (benefit) 4,993 2,350 (425)\nAdjusted EBITDA $ 322,476 $ 281,685 $ 231,176\nEnding on demand units: This metric represents the number of units managed by our clients with one or more of our on demand software solutions at the end of the period. We use ending on demand units to measure the success of our strategy of increasing the number of units managed with our on demand software solutions. Property unit counts are provided to us by our clients as new sales orders are processed. Property unit counts may be adjusted periodically as information related to our clients\u2019 properties is updated or supplemented, which could result in adjustments to the number of units previously reported.\nAverage on demand units: We calculate average on demand units as the average of the beginning and ending on demand units for each quarter in the period presented. This metric is a measure of our success increasing the number of on demand software solutions utilized by our clients to manage their property units, our overall revenue, and profitability.\nOn demand annual client value (\u201cACV\u201d): ACV represents our estimate of the annual value of our on demand revenue contracts at a point in time. We monitor this metric to measure our success in increasing the number of on demand units, and the amount of software solutions utilized by our clients to manage their property units.\nOn demand revenue per ending on demand unit (\u201cRPU\u201d): We define RPU as ACV divided by ending on demand units. We monitor this metric to measure our success in increasing the penetration of on demand software solutions utilized by our clients to manage their property units.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe report our financial results in accordance with GAAP; however, we believe that, in order to properly understand our short-term and long-term financial, operational, and strategic trends, it may be helpful for investors to exclude certain non-cash or non-recurring items when used as a supplement to financial performance measures in accordance with GAAP. These items result from facts and circumstances that vary in both frequency and impact on continuing operations. We also use results of operations excluding such items to evaluate our operating performance compared against prior periods, make operating decisions, determine executive compensation, and serve as a basis for long-term strategic planning. These non-GAAP financial measures provide us with additional means to understand and evaluate the operating results and trends in our ongoing business by eliminating certain non-cash expenses and other items that we believe might otherwise make comparisons of our ongoing business with prior periods more difficult, obscure trends in ongoing operations, reduce our ability to make useful forecasts, or obscure the ability to evaluate the effectiveness of certain business strategies and management incentive structures. In addition, we also believe that investors and financial analysts find this information helpful in analyzing our financial and operational performance and comparing this performance to our peers and competitors. These non-GAAP financial measures are used in conjunction with traditional GAAP financial measures as part of our overall assessment of our performance.\nWe do not place undue reliance on non-GAAP financial measures as measures of operating performance. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered substitutes for other measures of financial performance or liquidity reported in accordance with GAAP. There are limitations to using non-GAAP financial measures, including that other companies may calculate these measures differently than we do; that they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital; and that they do not reflect our capital expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures. We compensate for the inherent limitations associated with using non-GAAP financial measures through disclosure of these limitations, presentation of our financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.\nWe exclude or adjust each of the items identified below from the applicable non-GAAP financial measure referenced above for the reasons set forth with respect to each excluded item:\nAcquisition-related deferred revenue: This item is included to reflect deferred revenue written down for GAAP purposes under purchase accounting in order to appropriately measure the underlying performance of our business operations in the period of activity and associated expense.\nAsset impairment and loss on disposal of assets: This item comprises losses on the disposal and impairment of long-lived assets, and impairment of intangible assets, which are not reflective of our ongoing operations. We believe exclusion of this item facilitates a more accurate comparison of our results of operations between periods.\nDepreciation of long-lived assets: Long-lived assets are depreciated over their estimated useful lives in a manner reflecting the pattern in which the economic benefit is consumed. Management is limited in its ability to change or influence these charges after the asset has been acquired and placed in service. We do not believe that depreciation expense accurately reflects the performance of our ongoing operations for the period in which the charges are incurred, and it is therefore not considered by management in making operating decisions.\nAmortization of product technologies and intangible assets: Intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after initial capitalization. Accordingly, this item is not considered by us in making operating decisions. We do not believe such charges accurately reflect the performance of our ongoing operations for the period in which such charges are incurred.\nChange in fair value of equity investment: This item represents changes in fair value of our equity investment based on observable price changes in orderly transactions for an identical or similar investment of the same issuer. We believe exclusion of this item facilitates a more accurate comparison of our results of operations between periods as this item is not reflective of our ongoing operations.\nLoss due to cyber incident, net of recoveries: This item relates to losses, net of recoveries, arising from the May 2018 incident in which we were the subject of a targeted email phishing campaign. We believe this loss is not reflective of our ongoing operations and that exclusion of this item facilitates a more accurate comparison of our results of operations between periods.\nAcquisition-related expense: This item consists of direct costs incurred in our business acquisition transactions and expenses related to integration activities, costs associated with our pending acquisition by Thoma Bravo, and the impact of changes in the fair value of acquisition-related contingent consideration obligations. Examples of these direct costs include transaction fees, due diligence costs, acquisition retention bonuses and severance, and third-party consultants to assist with integration. We believe exclusion of this item facilitates a more accurate comparison of the results of our ongoing operations across periods and eliminates volatility related to changes in the fair value of acquisition-related contingent consideration obligations.\nOrganizational realignment: This item consists of direct costs associated with the alignment of our business strategies. In connection with these actions, we recognize costs related to termination benefits, exit costs associated with closure of facilities, certain asset impairments, cancellation of certain contracts, and other professional and consulting fees associated with these initiatives. We believe exclusion of this item facilitates a more accurate comparison of our ongoing results of operations between periods.\nRegulatory and legal matters: This item is comprised of certain regulatory and similar costs and certain legal settlement costs, such as costs related to the company\u2019s Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act review process incurred in connection with our acquisitions or the settlement of certain legal matters. These costs are excluded as they are irregular in timing and scope, and may not be indicative of our past and future performance. We believe exclusion of this item facilitates a more accurate comparison of the company\u2019s results of operations between periods.\nStock-based expense: This item is excluded because it is a non-cash expenditure that we do not consider part of ongoing operating results when assessing the performance of our business, and also because the total amount of the expenditure is partially outside of management\u2019s control because it is based on factors such as stock price, volatility, and interest rates, which may be unrelated to our performance during the period in which the expenses are incurred.\nKey Components of Our Results of Operations\nRevenue\nWe derive our revenue from two primary sources: our on demand software solutions and our professional and other services.\nOn demand revenue: Revenue from our on demand software solutions is comprised of license and subscription fees relating to our on demand software solutions, typically licensed for one year terms; commission income from sales of renter\u2019s insurance policies; and transaction fees for certain on demand software solutions, such as payment processing, spend management, and billing services. For our insurance based solutions, our agreements provide for a fixed commission on earned premiums related to the policies sold by us. The agreements also provide for a contingent commission to be paid to us in accordance with the agreements. Our transaction-based solutions are priced based on a fixed rate per transaction.\nProfessional and other revenue: Revenue from professional and other services consists of consulting and implementation services; training; and other ancillary services. We complement our solutions with professional and other services for our clients willing to invest in enhancing the value or decreasing the implementation time of our solutions. Our professional and other services are typically priced as time and materials engagements. Professional and other revenue also includes revenues generated from sub-meter installation services under our resident utility management solutions, and our on premise solutions.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue consists primarily of personnel costs related to our operations; support services; training and implementation services; expenses related to the operation of our data centers; transaction processing fees; and fees paid to third-party service providers. Personnel costs include salaries, bonuses, stock-based expense, and employee benefits. Cost of revenue also includes an allocation of facilities costs, overhead costs, and depreciation, which are allocated based on headcount.\nAmortization of Product Technologies\nAmortization of product technologies includes amortization of developed product technologies related to strategic acquisitions and amortization of capitalized development costs.\nOperating Expenses\nWe classify our operating expenses into four primary categories: product development, sales and marketing, general and administrative, and amortization of intangible assets. Our operating expenses primarily consist of personnel costs, costs for third-party contracted development, marketing, legal, accounting and consulting services, and other professional service fees. Personnel costs for each category of operating expenses include salaries, bonuses, stock-based expense, and employee benefits for employees in that category. Our operating expenses also include an allocation of facilities costs, overhead costs, and depreciation based on headcount for the product development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative categories.\nProduct development: Product development expense consists primarily of personnel costs for our product development employees and executives, information technology and facilities, and fees to contract development vendors. Our product development efforts are focused primarily on increasing the functionality and enhancing the ease of use of our platform of solutions and expanding our suite of data analytics and on demand software solutions. In addition to our locations in the United States, we maintain product development and service centers in Hyderabad, India; Manila, Philippines; Medellin, Colombia; and Cebu City, Philippines.\nSales and marketing: Sales and marketing expense consists primarily of personnel costs for our sales, marketing, and business development employees and executives, information technology, travel and entertainment, and marketing programs. Marketing programs consist of amounts paid for product marketing, renter\u2019s insurance, other advertising, trade shows, user conferences, public relations, and industry sponsorships and affiliations.\nGeneral and administrative: General and administrative expense consists of personnel costs for our executives, finance and accounting, human resources, management information systems, and legal personnel. In addition, general and administrative expense includes fees for professional services, including legal, accounting, and other consulting services; information technology and facilities costs; and acquisition-related costs, including direct costs incurred to complete our acquisitions and changes in the fair value of our acquisition-related contingent consideration obligations.\nAmortization of intangible assets: Amortization of intangible assets consist of amortization of purchased intangible assets, including client relationships, key vendor and supplier relationships, finite-lived trade names, and non-compete agreements, obtained in connection with our acquisitions.\nInterest Expense and Other, Net\nInterest expense and other, net, consists primarily of interest expense, interest income, gains and losses from changes in fair value of our equity investment based on observable price changes for identical or similar investments, and impairments on investments. Interest income represents earnings from our cash and cash equivalents. Interest expense is associated with amounts borrowed under the Amended Credit Facility, Convertible Notes, finance lease obligations, and certain acquisition-related liabilities, and includes expense from the amortization of related discounts and debt issuance costs. We participate in interest rate swap agreements, the purpose of which is to eliminate variability in interest rate payments on a portion of the Term Loans. For that portion, the swap agreements replace the Term Loan\u2019s variable rate with a fixed rate.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by GAAP and does not require management\u2019s judgment in its application, while in other cases, management\u2019s significant judgment is required to make estimates, assumptions, and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, and related disclosures. We base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. In some instances, we could reasonably use different accounting estimates, and in other instances, results could differ significantly from our estimates. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. To the extent that there are differences between our estimates and actual results, our future financial statement presentation, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows will be affected.\nWhile our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 \u201cSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe that the following accounting policies are critical to understanding our historical and future performance, as these policies relate to the more significant areas involving our management\u2019s judgments, assumptions and estimates.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenues are derived from on demand software solutions, professional services and other goods and services. We recognize revenue as we satisfy one or more service obligations under the terms of a contract, generally as control of goods and services are transferred to our clients. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for transferring goods or providing services. We include estimated variable consideration in revenue to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue will not occur. We estimate and accrue a reserve for credit accommodations and other adjustments as a reduction to revenue based on several factors, including past history.\nOn Demand Revenue\nOur on demand revenue consists of license and subscription fees, transaction and payment processing fees related to certain of our software-enabled value-added services, and commissions derived from our selling certain risk mitigation services.\nWe generally recognize revenue from subscription fees on a straight-line basis over the access period beginning on the date that we make our service available to the client. Our subscription agreements generally are non-cancellable, have an initial term of one year or longer and are billed either monthly, quarterly or annually in advance. Non-refundable up-front fees billed at the initial order date that are not associated with an up-front service obligation are recognized as revenue on a straight-line basis over the period in which the client is expected to benefit, which we consider to be three years.\nWe recognize revenue from transaction fees in the month the related services are performed based on the amount we have the right to invoice.\nWe offer risk mitigation services to our clients by acting as an insurance agent and derive commission revenue from the sale of insurance products to our clients\u2019 residents. The commissions are based upon a percentage of the premium that the insurance company charges to the policyholder and are subject to forfeiture in instances where a policyholder cancels prior to the end of the policy. Our contracts with our underwriting partners provide for contingent commissions to be paid to us in accordance with the agreements. Our estimate of contingent commission revenue considers the variable factors identified in the terms of the applicable agreement. We recognize commissions related to these services as earned ratably over the policy term and insurance commission receivable in \u201cAccounts receivable, less allowances\u201d in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nProfessional and Other Revenue\nProfessional services and other revenues generally consist of the fees we receive for providing implementation and consulting services, submeter and other equipment and ongoing maintenance of our existing on premise licenses.\nProfessional services are billed either on a time and materials basis or on a fixed price basis, and revenue is recognized over time as we perform the obligation or at completion. Professional services are typically sold in a combined contract with other on demand solutions but may be sold separately. Professional service contracts sold separately generally have terms of one year or less.\nOther revenues consist primarily of submeter equipment sales that include related installation services. Such sales are considered bundled, and revenue from these bundled sales is recognized in proportion to the number of installed units completed to date as compared to the total contracted number of units to be provided and installed. For all other equipment sales, we generally recognize revenue when control of the hardware has transferred to our client.\nRevenue recognized for on premise software sales generally consists of annual maintenance renewals on existing term or perpetual licenses, which is recognized ratably over the service period.\nContracts with Multiple Performance Obligations\nThe majority of the contracts we enter into with clients, including multiple contracts entered into at or near the same time with the same client, require us to provide one or more on demand software solutions, professional services and may include equipment. For these contracts, we account for individual performance obligations separately: i) if they are distinct or ii) if the promised obligations represent a series of distinct services that are substantially the same and have the same pattern of transfer to the client. Once we determine the performance obligations, we determine the transaction price, which includes estimating the amount of variable consideration, if any, to be included in the transaction price. For contracts with multiple performance obligations, we allocate the transaction price to the separate performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price basis. The standalone selling prices of our service are estimated using a market assessment approach based on our overall pricing objectives taking into consideration market conditions and other factors including the number of solutions sold, client demographics and the number and types of users within our contracts.\nSales, value add, and other taxes we collect from clients and remit to governmental authorities are excluded from revenues.\nDeferred Commissions\nWe capitalize certain commissions as incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a client if we expect to recover those costs. The commissions are capitalized and amortized over a period of benefit determined to be three years. Deferred commissions were capitalized for open contracts upon adoption of ASC 606 and were capitalized for new contracts beginning in 2018. As a result, there was a net benefit to \u201cOperating income\u201d in our Consolidated Statements of Operations during 2018 as capitalization of costs exceeded amortization. This accretive benefit was reduced in 2019 and normalized in 2020.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the current and noncurrent balance of capitalized commissions costs recorded in the lines \u201cOther current assets\u201d and \u201cOther assets\u201d in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets was $11.6 million and $10.3 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2019, the current and noncurrent balance of capitalized commissions costs was $9.9 million and $8.5 million, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, we amortized commission costs totaling $12.0 million, $8.7 million, and $5.4 million, respectively, which are included in \u201cSales and marketing\u201d expense in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nStock-Based Expense\nWe recognize compensation expense related to awards of stock options and restricted stock granted to employees, non-employee directors, and other service providers based on the estimated fair value of the awards on the date of grant. We recognize expense for stock options and time-based restricted stock awards on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the awards. For market-based awards and performance-based awards, expense is recognized over the requisite service period using the graded-vesting attribution method. Compensation expense is reduced for forfeitures as they occur.\nThe fair value of our time-based restricted stock awards is based on the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant. The fair value of our market-based restricted stock awards is estimated using a discrete model based on multiple stock price-paths developed through the use of Monte Carlo simulation. Changes to the assumptions underlying our valuation model may have a significant impact on the underlying value of the market-based restricted stock awards, which could have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. The fair value of our performance-based awards is based on obligations denominated in fixed dollar amounts and our expectation of future operating results and the specific performance criteria within each agreement. For awards subject to performance criteria, we reassess the likelihood of the performance criteria being met at each reporting date based on our expectation of future operating results and adjust the total compensation expense to be recognized.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes are recorded based on the liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. We recognize the effect of tax rate changes on current and accumulated deferred income taxes in the period in which the rate changes are enacted.\nValuation allowances are provided when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. The factors used to assess the need for a valuation allowance include historical earnings, our latest forecast of taxable income, and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets. In projecting future taxable income, we begin with historical results and incorporate assumptions including the amount of future state, federal and foreign pretax operating income, the reversal of temporary differences, and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies, if any. These assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses.\nWe may recognize a tax benefit from uncertain tax positions only if it is at least more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon settlement with the taxing authorities.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe allocate the fair value of the purchase consideration of our acquisitions to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and intangible assets acquired generally based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. Purchase consideration includes assets transferred, liabilities assumed, and/or equity interests issued by us, all of which are measured at their fair value as of the date of acquisition. Our business combination transactions may be structured to include a combination of up-front, deferred and contingent payments to be made at specified dates subsequent to the date of acquisition. These payments may include a combination of cash and equity and are generally settled within one to four years from the date of acquisition. Deferred and contingent payments determined to be purchase consideration are recorded at fair value as of the acquisition date. Deferred obligations are generally subject to adjustments specified in the underlying purchase agreement related to the seller\u2019s indemnification obligations, including indemnification assets that contractually can be recorded as a reduction to outstanding deferred obligations. Our contingent consideration arrangements are obligations to make future payments to sellers contingent upon the achievement of future operational or financial targets and are remeasured to fair value at the end of each reporting period until the obligations are settled.\nThe valuation of the net assets acquired as well as certain elements of purchase consideration requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to future expected cash flows, useful lives, and discount rates. Management\u2019s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain, and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. During the measurement period, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with a corresponding offset to goodwill. Subsequent changes to the fair value of contingent consideration are reflected in \u201cGeneral and administrative\u201d in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nAcquisition costs are expensed as incurred and are included in \u201cGeneral and administrative\u201d in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. We include the results of operations from acquired businesses in our consolidated financial statements from the effective date of the acquisition.\nGoodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets\nWe test goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment separately on an annual basis in the fourth quarter of each year, or more frequently if circumstances indicate that the assets may not be recoverable. For purposes of goodwill impairment testing, we have one reporting unit.\nWe evaluate impairment of goodwill either by assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, or by performing a quantitative assessment. Qualitative factors include industry and market considerations, overall financial performance, and other relevant events and circumstances affecting the reporting unit. If we choose to perform a qualitative assessment and after considering the totality of events or circumstances, we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we would perform a quantitative fair value test. Our quantitative impairment assessment utilizes a weighted combination of a discounted cash flow model (known as the income approach) and comparisons to publicly traded companies engaged in similar businesses (known as the market approach). These approaches involve judgmental assumptions, including forecasted future cash flows expected to be generated by the business over an extended period of time, long-term growth rates, the identification of comparable companies, and our discount rate based on our weighted average cost of capital. These assumptions are predominately unobservable inputs and considered Level 3 measurements. We adopted ASU 2017-04, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other, which simplifies the testing for goodwill impairment by eliminating the requirement to determine the fair value of individual assets and liabilities of a reporting unit to measure goodwill impairment, prospectively on January 1, 2020. To calculate any potential impairment when we perform a quantitative test, we compare the fair value of our reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. Any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit\u2019s goodwill over its fair value is recognized as an impairment loss, and the carrying value of goodwill is written down.\nWe quantitatively evaluate indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment by estimating the fair value of those assets based on estimated future earnings derived from the assets using the income approach. Key assumptions for this assessment include forecasted future cash flows from estimated royalty rates and our discount rate based on our weighted average cost of capital. These assumptions are unobservable Level 3 measurements. Assets with indefinite lives that have been determined to be inseparable due to their interchangeable use are grouped into single units of accounting for purposes of testing for impairment. If the carrying amount of an identified intangible asset with an indefinite life exceeds its fair value, we recognize an impairment loss equal to the excess of carrying value over fair value.\nInternally Developed Software\nCosts incurred to develop software intended for our internal use are capitalized during the application development stage. Capitalization of such costs ceases once the project is substantially complete and ready for its intended use. We also capitalize costs related to specific upgrades and enhancements when it is probable the expenditure will result in additional functionality. Costs related to preliminary project activities and post-implementation operating activities are expensed as incurred.\nInternally developed software costs are included in \u201cProperty, equipment, and software, net\u201d in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Amortization of internally developed software is included in \u201cAmortization of product technologies\u201d in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nConvertible Notes\nWe account for our Convertible Notes as separate liability and equity components. The initial carrying amounts of the liability components are calculated by measuring the fair value of a similar liability that does not have an associated convertible feature. We estimate fair value using a discounted cash flow model that relies upon subjective assumptions including expected volatility and discount rates determined using observable yields for stand-alone debt instruments with comparable credit ratings and terms. The carrying amounts of the equity components representing the conversion options are determined by deducting the fair value of the liability components from the par value of the Convertible Notes. The difference represents a debt discount that is amortized to interest expense over the terms of the Convertible Notes using the effective interest method. The equity components are not remeasured as long as they continue to meet the conditions for equity classification.\nIssuance costs related to our Convertible Notes are allocated to the liability and equity components based on their relative values. Costs allocated to the liability components are amortized to interest expense over the terms of the Convertible Notes using the effective interest method. Costs allocated to the equity components, and any impact of deferred taxes arising from the discount to the par value of the Convertible Notes, reduce the carrying amount of the equity component.\nTo the extent we receive conversion requests for our Convertible Notes prior to maturity, the settlement consideration is allocated to the liability component of the respective Convertible Note equal to the fair value of the component immediately prior to the extinguishment, with any residual consideration recorded as a reduction to the equity component. Any difference between the amount allocated to the liability component and its net carrying amount is recorded as a gain or loss on debt extinguishment.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nAccounting Standards Update 2016-13\nIn June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. The amendments in this ASU replaced the incurred loss impairment methodology in GAAP with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires\nconsideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. Our financial assets in the scope of ASU 2016-13 mainly consist of short-term trade receivables. We have also considered contract assets in our evaluation. Historically, our actual credit losses have not been material. In addition to continuing to individually assess overdue customer balances for expected credit losses, we have implemented modifications to our historical methodology that reflect the expected credit losses on receivables considering both historical experience and forward-looking assumptions. We adopted ASU 2016-13 using the modified retrospective approach on January 1, 2020, resulting in no cumulative adjustment to retained earnings. The adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. We will continue to actively monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on expected credit losses.\nSee Note 2 \u201cSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion about new accounting pronouncements adopted and those pending.\nResults of Operations\nThe following tables set forth our results of operations for the specified periods. The following generally discusses 2020 and 2019 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2020 and 2019. The discussion of historical items and year-to-year comparisons between 2019 and 2018 can be found in \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, filed with the SEC on March 2, 2020, and incorporated by reference herein.

Many of our products facilitate leasing-related and other transactional services with current or potential residents without person-to-person contact, benefiting both residents and our customers who are operating with significantly reduced numbers of on-site employees. Certain of our revenue streams experienced challenges at the onset of COVID-19, including our leasing and marketing solutions due to lower transactional volumes, and our vacation rental business due to concerns about safety of travel, before beginning a return to more normalized levels in the second half of the year.\nOn demand revenue: During the year ended December 31, 2020, on demand revenue increased $172.3 million, or 18.1%, as compared to the same period in 2019. This increase was attributable to growth across our platform, primarily in resident services and property management. This includes organic growth and acquired revenue from our 2019 and 2020 acquisitions.\nOn demand revenue generated by our property management solutions increased $43.9 million, or 21.3%. This increase was primarily attributable to incremental revenues from our 2019 acquisitions and organic growth within certain of the property management solutions.\nOn demand revenue from our resident services solutions continued to experience significant growth, increasing by $99.7 million, or 23.7%. Resident services increased primarily from continued growth in our payments solutions, incremental revenues from our 2019 acquisitions of Buildium, Simple Bills and Lease Term Solutions, and organic growth in our renter\u2019s insurance solutions. Our payments business benefited from increased transactional volumes as residents and our clients moved towards payment mechanisms that allow for reduced personal contact.\nOn demand revenue from our leasing and marketing solutions increased $11.1 million, or 6.2%. During 2020, we recognized incremental revenues from our recent acquisitions of $18.3 million that were partially offset by a reduction in leasing velocity associated with COVID-19.\nOn demand revenue from our asset optimization solutions increased $17.6 million, or 12.0%. This increase was largely attributable to incremental revenue from our 2019 acquisition of IMS and organic growth across our revenue management and business intelligence solutions.\nOn demand unit metrics: As of December 31, 2020, one or more of our on demand solutions was utilized in the management of approximately 19.7 million rental property units, representing a year-over-year net increase of 1.2 million units, or 6.7%. This growth is primarily attributable to our 2020 acquisitions, which accounted for approximately 3.3% of total ending on demand units, as well as organic unit growth. On demand revenue per ending on demand unit increased 4.7% year-over-year, driven by expansion and adoption of our products, offset by the impact of acquired units. On demand units managed by our clients renewed at an average rate of 96.6% over a trailing twelve-month period ended December 31, 2020.\nCost of Revenue\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2019 Change % Change\n(in thousands)\nCost of revenue $ 419,260 $ 364,443 $ 54,817 15.0 %\nStock-based expense 7,937 5,604 2,333 41.6\nDepreciation expense 15,768 15,665 103 0.7\nTotal cost of revenue $ 442,965 $ 385,712 $ 57,253 14.8 %\nCost of revenue, excluding stock-based expense and depreciation expense, increased $54.8 million, or 15.0%. Direct costs increased $35.3 million, driven by higher transaction volume from our payment processing solutions and incremental costs from our recent acquisitions. Personnel expense increased $21.8 million, primarily attributable to incremental headcount from our recent acquisitions and investments to accelerate implementations of our product offerings. These increases were partially offset by a decline in travel expenses due to travel restrictions we implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAmortization of Product Technologies\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2019 Change % Change\n(in thousands)\nAmortization of product technologies $ 58,313 $ 40,461 $ 17,852 44.1 %\nAmortization of product technologies increased $17.9 million, or 44.1%. Higher amortization expense was driven by the addition of developed product technologies in connection with our recent acquisitions and an increase in amortization of developed software related to investment in innovation and product solutions.\nGross margin as a percentage of total revenue declined from 56.9% to 56.7%. This margin compression was primarily due to the impact of higher amortization of product technologies from our acquisitions.\nOperating Expenses\nProduct development\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2019 Change % Change\n(in thousands)\nProduct development expense $ 117,800 $ 97,713 $ 20,087 20.6 %\nStock-based expense 9,216 8,159 1,057 13.0\nDepreciation expense 6,645 6,350 295 4.6\nTotal product development expense $ 133,661 $ 112,222 $ 21,439 19.1 %\nProduct development expense, excluding stock-based expense and depreciation expense, increased $20.1 million, or 20.6%. Personnel expense, net of capitalized software development costs, increased $21.2 million. This increase was primarily attributable to incremental personnel costs from our recent acquisitions and increased product investment, partially offset by our efficiency initiatives implemented in 2019 to centralize our product development team and direct a greater portion of work effort towards major new development projects.\nProduct development expense as a percentage of total revenue increased from 11.4% to 11.5%, primarily due to increased personnel costs.\nSales and marketing\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2019 Change % Change\n(in thousands)\nSales and marketing expense $ 190,414 $ 163,767 $ 26,647 16.3 %\nStock-based expense 20,908 23,978 (3,070) (12.8)\nDepreciation expense 7,159 6,217 942 15.2\nTotal sales and marketing expense $ 218,481 $ 193,962 $ 24,519 12.6 %\nSales and marketing expense, excluding stock-based expense and depreciation expense, increased $26.6 million, or 16.3%. Personnel expense increased $22.7 million, driven by incremental headcount from our recent acquisitions and our continued investments in our sales force and product marketing teams. These investments also resulted in an increase in information technology and facility related expenses of $4.0 million. Marketing and travel expenses decreased $4.9 million, driven by travel restrictions implemented by management during 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and partially offset by increased digital advertising.\nSales and marketing expense as a percentage of total revenue decreased from 19.6% to 18.9%. This decline was a result of the reductions in travel and marketing expenses discussed above, coupled with reduced stock compensation expense related to the reversal of market-based restricted stock award expense associated with forfeitures.\nGeneral and administrative\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2019 Change % Change\n(in thousands)\nGeneral and administrative expense $ 130,190 $ 92,278 $ 37,912 41.1 %\nStock-based expense 21,213 24,822 (3,609) (14.5)\nDepreciation expense 6,205 5,956 249 4.2\nTotal general and administrative expense $ 157,608 $ 123,056 $ 34,552 28.1 %\nGeneral and administrative expense, excluding stock-based expense and depreciation expense, increased $37.9 million, or 41.1%. Personnel expense increased $20.3 million due to incremental headcount from our recent acquisitions and investments to support our continued growth. Legal and professional expenses increased $14.5 million driven by expenses incurred with our recent acquisitions and integration activities, increases in our accruals for legal contingencies, and costs incurred in connection with the Merger Agreement and related activities, as defined in Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. IT and facility related expenses increased $3.8 million due primarily to incremental costs from our recent acquisitions. Favorable fair value adjustments to acquisition-related liabilities of $6.7 million partially offset these increases.\nGeneral and administrative expense as a percentage of total revenue increased from 12.5% to 13.6%, primarily due to the incremental acquisition and legal expenses discussed above.\nAmortization of intangible assets\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2019 Change % Change\n(in thousands)\nAmortization of intangible assets $ 44,689 $ 40,303 $ 4,386 10.9 %\nAmortization of intangible assets increased $4.4 million, or 10.9%, primarily from incremental amortization expense from the addition of finite-lived client relationship and trade name assets in connection with our recent acquisitions.\nStock-based expense\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2019 Change % Change\n(in thousands)\nStock-based expense $ 59,274 $ 62,563 $ (3,289) (5.3) %\nStock-based expense declined $3.3 million, or 5.3%. Forfeitures of certain market-based restricted stock awards resulted in the reversal of $4.2 million of expense during the period. These reversals, coupled with normal forfeiture activity during the year, more than offset incremental awards in connection with our 2019 and 2020 acquisitions. Stock-based expense as a percent of total revenue declined from 6.3% to 5.1% due to the activity discussed above.\nDepreciation expense\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2019 Change % Change\n(in thousands)\nDepreciation expense $ 35,777 $ 34,188 $ 1,589 4.6 %\nDepreciation expense increased a nominal $1.6 million, or 4.6%. The change in depreciation expense as a percentage of total revenue was not material.\nInterest Expense and Other, Net\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2019 Change % Change\n(in thousands)\nInterest expense $ (52,655) $ (37,129) $ (15,526) 41.8 %\nInterest income 208 2,073 (1,865) (90.0)\nChange in fair value of equity investment - 2,600 (2,600) (100.0)\nOther income 987 594 393 66.2\nTotal interest expense and other, net $ (51,460) $ (31,862) $ (19,598) 61.5 %\nInterest expense and other, net increased $19.6 million, or 61.5%. Interest expense increased $15.5 million primarily due to increased borrowings under our Amended Credit Facility and our convertible debt offering that was completed in May 2020. Our 2019 results also benefited from a $2.6 million increase in the fair value of our equity investment following an observable price change during 2019.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nOur effective tax rate was 9.7% and 3.9% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized consolidated tax expense of $5.0 million on income before income taxes of $51.3 million. Our effective tax rate was lower than the statutory rate of 21% in 2020 and 2019 primarily due to higher benefits realized for excess stock compensation deductions and benefits from research and development credits.\nFor further discussion, including a reconciliation of our effective tax rate from the statutory federal rate, see Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur primary sources of liquidity as of December 31, 2020, consisted of $594.7 million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, $600.0 million available under our Revolving Facility, amounts available under the Amended Credit Facility\u2019s Accordion Feature, and $14.4 million of working capital (excluding $594.7 million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, $318.3 million of convertible notes, and $144.0 million of deferred revenue).\nOur principal uses of liquidity have been to fund our working capital requirements, capital expenditures and acquisitions, to service our debt obligations, and to repurchase shares of our common stock. We expect that working capital requirements, capital expenditures, acquisitions, and debt service will continue to be our principal needs for liquidity for at least the next year. We made capital expenditures of $63.6 million, approximately 5% of total revenues, during the year ended December 31, 2020. We expect capital expenditures to remain at 5% of total revenues during the next few years. In addition, we have made several acquisitions in which a portion of the cash purchase consideration is payable at various times through 2022. Our gross deferred cash obligations, excluding potential reductions related to the sellers\u2019 indemnification obligations, total approximately $30.1 million, of which approximately $24.6 million is payable during 2021. In addition, we have contingent consideration obligations of up to $35.3 million with a fair value of $4.3 million as of December 31, 2020. We expect to fund these obligations from cash provided by operating activities, our existing unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, or funds available under our Amended Credit Facility.\nIn May 2018, we filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC, which became effective upon filing. The shelf registration allows us to periodically offer and sell, in one or more future offerings, an indeterminate amount of our common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, and other securities specified therein. In May 2020, we consummated an underwritten public offering of 5.85 million shares of our common stock. The offering was priced at $59.00 per share for total gross proceeds of $345.0 million. The aggregate net proceeds to us were $334.1 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses in the aggregate amount of $10.9 million. Net proceeds from this offering were used to repay $230.0 million of indebtedness outstanding under our revolving facility and will be used for other general corporate purposes in the future.\nIn May 2020, we also issued convertible senior notes with an aggregate principal amount of $345.0 million which will mature on May 15, 2025 (the \u201c2025 Convertible Notes\u201d). The 2025 Convertible Notes were issued pursuant to an Indenture dated May 22, 2020, by and between us and U.S. Bank National Association, as Trustee. We received net proceeds from the offering of approximately $337.5 million after adjusting for debt issuance costs, including the underwriting discount.\nIn February 2020, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement (the \u201c2020 Swap Agreement\u201d) to effectively convert the LIBOR-based variable interest obligation on a $100.0 million notional portion of our variable rate debt into a fixed rate obligation at a rate of 1.89% from February 2020 to September 2024. In connection with this transaction, we terminated our previous cash flow hedge relationships, which had a blended fixed rate of 2.57%, and designated the 2020 Swap Agreement under a new cash flow hedge relationship. The fair value of the terminated swap agreement immediately prior to termination and of the 2020 Swap Agreement at inception was a liability of $2.5 million. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic\u2019s impact on macroeconomic trends and the resulting significant declines in LIBOR rates, the fair value of this interest rate cash flow hedge at December 31, 2020 was a liability of $6.0 million. The changes in fair value of this derivative instrument are initially recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and are subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings. As of December 31, 2020, we estimate that $2.5 million of the total net loss related to our swap agreement recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss will be reclassified into earnings within the next twelve months. Because the 2020 Swap Agreement contained an other-than-insignificant financing element at its inception, the associated cash flows are reported as a financing activity in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, we spent $2.9 million on computer equipment and other capital items to facilitate our shift to an almost entirely work-from-home environment. During the same period we also incurred incremental operating costs totaling approximately $2.4 million in our response to COVID-19, including costs to support our work-from-home strategy, costs for temporary staffing, additional facilities expenses, and other expenses incurred to help ensure our ability to deliver uninterrupted services to our clients even in the event of a temporary decline in the availability of our internal labor force. We expect to continue to incur some of these costs in the future until the pandemic abates, but we currently do not expect these additional costs to be material. As allowed by the Coronavirus, Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the \u201cCARES Act\u201d), we have deferred payment of $14.4 million of employment taxes as of December 31, 2020. Under the terms of the CARES Act, we will be required to pay these deferred amounts in two installments with half of the amount to be paid by the end of 2021 and half by the end of 2022. The current and non-current portions of these deferred amounts are included in \u201cAccrued expenses and other current liabilities\u201d and \u201cOther long-term liabilities\u201d, respectively, in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. We made no significant changes to customer payment terms or contracts during the period, nor did we identify significant changes in customer payment behavior as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Nevertheless, our future operating results and related cash flows could be adversely effected if the COVID-19 pandemic continues to negatively affect the general economy in ways that cause our customers to be unable to meet their payment obligations to us in a timely\nmanner, or to slow purchase or implementation decisions, or if a reduction in overall leasing velocity as a result of the pandemic leads to a significant reduction in our transactional revenues.\nWe believe that our existing unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, working capital (excluding unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, convertible notes, and deferred revenue), and our cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund our working capital requirements and planned capital expenditures, and to service our debt obligations for at least the next twelve months. Our future working capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our rate of revenue growth, the timing and size of future acquisitions, the expansion of our sales and marketing activities, the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts, the timing of introductions of new solutions and enhancements to existing solutions, and the continuing market acceptance of our solutions. We expect to enter into acquisitions of complementary businesses, applications, or technologies in the future that could require us to seek additional equity or debt financing. Additional funds may not be available on terms favorable to us, or at all.\nAs of December 31, 2020, our federal and state net operating loss (\u201cNOL\u201d) carryforwards are $246.9 million and $88.6 million, respectively. Our federal and state NOL carryforwards may be available to offset potential payments of future income tax liabilities. If unused, the federal NOLs will begin to expire in 2026, and the state NOLs will begin to expire in 2021. Total state NOLs expiring in the next five years is approximately $1.5 million.\nThe following table sets forth cash flow data for the periods indicated therein:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2019 2018\n(in thousands)\nNet cash provided by operating activities $ 276,503 $ 316,973 $ 244,807\nNet cash used in investing activities $ (252,176) $ (719,094) $ (331,296)\nNet cash provided by financing activities $ 357,277 $ 460,011 $ 304,085\nChanges in Cash and Cash Equivalents during the year ended December 31, 2020:\nNet Cash Provided by Operating Activities\nDuring 2020, net cash provided by operating activities consisted of net income of $46.3 million, net non-cash adjustments to net income of $231.0 million, and a net cash outflow from changes in assets and liabilities of $0.8 million. Non-cash adjustments to net income primarily consisted of depreciation and amortization expense of $138.8 million, stock-based expense of $59.3 million, amortization of debt discount and issuance costs of $20.8 million, and amortization of our right-of-use assets of $13.6 million.\nChanges in working capital during 2020 included cash outflows for customer deposits of $19.4 million, primarily attributable to the timing of cash settlements for previously initiated resident transactions related to our payments solutions. Accounts payable declined $1.3 million due to the timing of vendor invoice receipt and payments, and net declines in other current and long-term liabilities of $1.1 million were a result of lease payments and changes in acquisition related liabilities, offset partially by increases in other long-term liabilities for the long-term portion of deferred employment taxes in connection with the CARES Act and unrealized losses related to our derivative instruments. These items were offset by a $16.5 million increase in accrued compensation related expenses due to payroll related accruals, including for the current portion of deferred employment taxes in connection with the CARES Act. Net cash inflows from accounts receivable of $3.4 million, and an increase in deferred revenue of $1.8 million, were reflective of our growth.\nNet Cash Used in Investing Activities\nIn 2020, we used $252.2 million for our investing activities, which included $188.6 million, net of cash and restricted cash acquired, for our strategic acquisitions and $63.6 million for capital expenditures during the period. Capital expenditures during the period primarily included capitalized software development costs and expenditures to support our information technology infrastructure.\nNet Cash Provided by Financing Activities\nThe net cash provided by our financing activities during 2020 primarily consisted of net proceeds of $334.1 million from our May 2020 public offering of 5.85 million shares of our common stock and net proceeds of $337.5 million from our simultaneous offering of $345.0 million of convertible notes, partially offset by $39.4 million paid for capped call instruments related to the convertible notes. We used $230.0 million of the offering proceeds to retire all amounts then outstanding under our revolving credit facility. We also made principal payments on our Term Loans, payments of acquisition-related consideration, and payments of finance lease obligations of $18.8 million, $17.3 million and $3.3 million, respectively, and other net payments of $5.5 million primarily related to our stock-based compensation plans.\nChanges in Cash and Cash Equivalents during the year ended December 31, 2019:\nNet Cash Provided by Operating Activities\nDuring 2019, net cash provided by operating activities consisted of net income of $58.2 million, net non-cash adjustments to net income of $205.9 million, and a net inflow of cash from changes in assets and liabilities of $52.9 million. Non-cash adjustments to net income primarily consisted of depreciation and amortization expense of $115.0 million, stock-based expense of $62.6 million, amortization of debt discount and issuance costs of $13.7 million, and amortization of our right-of-use assets of $11.4 million.\nChanges in working capital during 2019 included net cash inflows from customer deposits of $82.6 million, which was primarily attributable to the timing of cash settlements for previously initiated resident transactions related to our payments solutions. Net cash inflows also included changes in accounts payable of $9.3 million due to the timing of vendor invoice receipts and payments, and changes in deferred revenue of $7.7 million. These items were partially offset by net cash outflows for accounts receivable of $14.7 million, which is reflective of our revenue growth; outflows for prepaid expenses and other current assets of $13.8 million, primarily attributable to the $11.7 million of deferred compensation paid into escrow in connection with our acquisition of Buildium; and outflows for other current and long-term liabilities of $12.0 million, primarily attributable to rental payments for our operating leases.\nNet Cash Used in Investing Activities\nIn 2019, we used $719.1 million for our investing activities, which primarily included $665.8 million, net of cash and restricted cash acquired, for our strategic acquisitions; $51.5 million for capital expenditures during the period; and $1.8 million for our additional investment in CompStak. Capital expenditures during the period primarily included capitalized software development costs and expenditures to support our information technology infrastructure.\nNet Cash Provided by Financing Activities\nThe net cash provided by our financing activities during 2019 primarily consisted of aggregate borrowings under our Amended Credit Facility of $830.0 million. These borrowings were partially offset by payments on our term loans of $308.7 million; payments of acquisition-related consideration of $30.4 million; activity under our stock-based expense plans of $15.0 million, primarily attributable to shares repurchased from employees to cover their cost of taxes upon vesting of restricted stock; and treasury stock purchases of $8.5 million under our share repurchase program.\nContractual Obligations, Commitments, and Contingencies\nThe following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations as of December 31, 2020, including interest when applicable, for long-term debt and other obligations for the next five years and thereafter:\nPayments Due by Period\nTotal Less Than\n1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years More Than\n5 years\n(in thousands)\nConvertible Notes (1)\n$ 723,633 $ 10,350 $ 360,520 $ 352,763 $ -\nTerm Loans (2)\n612,112 39,699 101,180 471,233 -\nOperating and finance lease obligations 176,771 21,795 43,953 36,933 74,090\nAcquisition-related liabilities (3)\n30,110 24,585 5,525 - -\n$ 1,542,626 $ 96,429 $ 511,178 $ 860,929 $ 74,090\n(1)Represents the aggregate principal amount of $690.0 million and anticipated coupon interest payments related to our Convertible Notes and excludes the unamortized discount and debt issuance costs reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n(2)Represents the contractually required principal payments for our Term Loan and Delayed Draw Term Loan. These amounts exclude unamortized debt issuance costs reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. These amounts also include the anticipated interest obligations under our Amended Credit Facility, which were estimated using a LIBOR forward rate curve and include the related effects of our interest rate swap agreements.\n(3)Represents obligations in connection with our acquisitions comprised of undiscounted amounts payable for our deferred cash obligations. These amounts exclude deferred stock obligations, contingent consideration of up to $35.3 million with a fair value of $4.3 million, and potential reductions related to the sellers\u2019 indemnification obligations.\nCredit Facility\nThe Amended Credit Facility matures on September 5, 2024 (subject to early maturity provisions in certain circumstances, as described below), and includes the following:\nRevolving Facility: The Amended Credit Facility provides $600.0 million in aggregate commitments for secured revolving loans, with sublimits of $10.0 million for the issuance of letters of credit and $20.0 million for swingline loans (\u201cRevolving Facility\u201d). During the second quarter of 2020, we repaid the previous amount outstanding under the revolving facility.\nInitial Term Loan: An initial term loan of $300.0 million was borrowed on the closing date for the Amended Credit Facility (the \u201cTerm Loan\u201d). The proceeds of the Term Loan were used to repay the term loan balances outstanding under the 2014 Credit Facility.\nDelayed Draw Term Loan: In December 2019, we drew funds of $300.0 million available under the delayed draw term loan (\u201cDelayed Draw Term Loan\u201d).\nRevolving loans under the Amended Credit Facility may be voluntarily prepaid and re-borrowed. Principal payments on the Term Loan and Delayed Draw Term Loan (collectively, the \u201cTerm Loans\u201d) are due in quarterly installments equal to an initial amount of $3.8 million, which increased to $7.5 million on December 31, 2020, increases to $11.3 million beginning on December 31, 2022, and increases to $15.0 million beginning on December 31, 2023. Once repaid or prepaid, the Term Loans may not be re-borrowed. All outstanding principal and accrued but unpaid interest is due, and the commitments for the Revolving Facility terminate, on the maturity date. The Term Loans are subject to mandatory repayment requirements in the event of certain asset sales or if certain insurance or condemnation events occur, subject to customary reinvestment provisions. We may prepay the Term Loans in whole or in part at any time without premium or penalty.\nAccordion Feature: The Amended Credit Facility also allows us, subject to certain conditions, to request additional term loan commitments and/or additional revolving commitments in an aggregate principal amount of up to the greater of $250.0 million or 100% of consolidated EBITDA (as defined within the Amended Credit Facility) for the most recent four fiscal quarters, plus an amount that would not cause our Senior Leverage Ratio (as defined in Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) to exceed 3.50 to 1.00.\nAll outstanding revolving loans and term loans under the Amended Credit Facility mature on September 5, 2024. If on or prior to August 16, 2022, we have failed to demonstrate to the Agent (as defined in Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) that we would be in compliance with each financial covenant after giving pro forma effect to the repayment in full of the 2022 Convertible Notes which mature on November 15, 2022, then the Amended Credit Facility will mature on August 16, 2022. In addition, if on any business day during the period beginning on August 16, 2022 until the 2022 Convertible Notes are paid in full, our available liquidity is less than an amount equal to 125% of the outstanding principal amount of the 2022 Convertible Notes, then amounts outstanding under the Amended Credit Facility are due the next business day.\nRefer to Note 9 of the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Amended Credit Facility, including its terms and conditions.\nConvertible Notes\n2025 Convertible Notes\nIn May 2020, we issued convertible senior notes with an aggregate principal amount of $345.0 million which will mature on May 15, 2025 (the \u201c2025 Convertible Notes\u201d). The 2025 Convertible Notes were issued pursuant to an Indenture dated May 22, 2020, by and between us and U.S. Bank National Association, as Trustee. We received net proceeds from the offering of approximately $337.5 million after adjusting for debt issuance costs, including the underwriting discount.\nThe 2025 Convertible Notes accrue interest at a rate of 1.50% per year until maturity, payable semi-annually in arrears on May 15 and November 15 of each year, beginning on November 15, 2020. On or after February 15, 2025 until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders may convert at their option all or any portion of their 2025 Convertible Notes at the then applicable conversion rate. Prior to February 15, 2025, holders may convert their notes, and we may redeem the 2025 Convertible Notes, under certain circumstances specified in the Indenture. The 2025 Convertible Notes are convertible at an initial rate of 13.04 shares of our common stock per $1,000 of principal amount of 2025 Convertible Notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $76.70 per share of our common stock). Upon conversion, we will pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock, at our election. Upon any conversion of the 2025 Convertible Notes, it is our current intent to settle the first $1,000 of conversion value for each $1,000 principal amount of the 2025 Convertible Notes through combination settlement, which involves repayment of the principal portion in cash and any excess of the conversion value over the principal amount in shares of our common stock.\nIn conjunction with the 2025 Convertible Notes offering, we purchased the Capped Calls initially covering approximately 4.5 million shares of our common stock at a cost of $39.4 million. The Capped Calls are subject to anti-dilution provisions substantially similar to those of the 2025 Convertible Notes, have a strike price of approximately $76.70 per share, are subject to a cap price of $118 per share, are exercisable by us upon any conversion under the 2025 Convertible Notes, and expire on May 15, 2025. The Capped Calls are generally expected to reduce the potential dilution to our common stock (or, in the event\nthe conversion is settled in cash, to reduce our cash payment obligation) in the event that at the time of conversion our stock price exceeds the conversion price under the 2025 Convertible Notes.\n2022 Convertible Notes\nIn May 2017, we issued convertible senior notes with an aggregate principal amount of $345.0 million which will mature on November 15, 2022 (the \u201c2022 Convertible Notes\u201d). The 2022 Convertible Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture dated May 23, 2017, by and between us and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as Trustee. We received net proceeds from the offering of approximately $304.2 million after adjusting for debt issuance costs, including the underwriting discount, the net cash used to purchase the Note Hedges and the proceeds from the issuance of the Warrants which are discussed below.\nThe 2022 Convertible Notes accrue interest at a rate of 1.50% per year until maturity, payable semi-annually in arrears on May 15 and November 15 of each year. On or after May 15, 2022 until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders may convert at their option all or any portion of their 2022 Convertible Notes at the then applicable conversion rate. Prior to May 15, 2022, holders may convert their notes under certain circumstances specified in the indenture. The 2022 Convertible Notes are convertible at an initial rate of 23.84 shares of our common stock per $1,000 of principal amount of 2022 Convertible Notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $41.95 per share of our common stock). Upon conversion, we will pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock, at our election. Upon any conversion of the 2022 Convertible Notes, it is our current intent to settle the first $1,000 of conversion value for each $1,000 principal amount of the 2022 Convertible Notes through combination settlement, which involves repayment of the principal portion in cash and any excess of the conversion value over the principal amount in shares of our common stock.\nIn conjunction with the 2022 Convertible Notes offering, we purchased Note Hedges and issued Warrants initially covering approximately 8.2 million shares of our common stock. We paid $62.5 million to purchase the Note Hedges and received proceeds of $31.5 million from the issuance of the Warrants. The Note Hedges have an exercise price of $41.95 per share, consistent with the conversion price of the 2022 Convertible Notes, and expire in November 2022. The Note Hedges are generally expected to reduce the potential dilution to our common stock (or, in the event the conversion is settled in cash, to reduce our cash payment obligation) in the event that at the time of conversion our stock price exceeds the conversion price under the 2022 Convertible Notes. The Warrants have a strike price of $57.58 per share and expire in ratable portions on a series of expiration dates commencing on February 15, 2023.\nRefer to Note 9 of the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of these transactions and their accounting implications.\nStock Repurchase Program\nIn October 2018, our board of directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing the repurchase of up to $100.0 million of our outstanding common stock. The share repurchase program expired on October 25, 2019. In November 2019, our board of directors approved a new share repurchase program authorizing the repurchase of up to $100.0 million of our outstanding common stock. In October 2020, our board of directors approved a one year extension of this program authorizing the repurchase of up to $100.0 million of our outstanding common stock through November 7, 2021.\nShares repurchased under the stock repurchase program are retired. Repurchase activity during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was as follows:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2019 2018\nNumber of shares repurchased - 158,971 599,664\nWeighted-average cost per share $ - $ 53.41 $ 46.83\nTotal cost of shares repurchased, in thousands $ - $ 8,491 $ 28,082",
    "item_7A": "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\nMarket risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates. Our market risk exposure is primarily a result of fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange risks. We do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes.\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of $594.7 million and $197.2 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We hold cash and cash equivalents for working capital purposes. We do not have material exposure to market risk with respect to investments, as our investments consist primarily of highly liquid investments purchased with original maturities of three months or less.\nWe had $577.5 million and $596.3 million outstanding under our Term Loans at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We had $230.0 million outstanding under our Revolving Facility at December 31, 2019. We did not have any outstanding borrowings under our Revolving Facility at December 31, 2020. At our option, amounts borrowed under the Amended Credit Facility accrue interest at a per annum rate equal to either LIBOR, plus a margin ranging from 1.00% to 2.00%, or the Base Rate, plus a margin ranging from 0.00% to 1.00% (\u201cApplicable Margin\u201d). The base LIBOR rate is, at our discretion, equal to either one, three, or six month LIBOR. The Base Rate is defined as the greater of Wells Fargo's prime rate, the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.50%, or one month LIBOR plus 1.00%. In each case, the Applicable Margin is determined based upon our consolidated net leverage ratio.\nOn December 24, 2018, we entered into two interest rate swap agreements (collectively the \u201c2018 Swap Agreements\u201d). The 2018 Swap Agreements covered an aggregate notional amount of $100.0 million from December 2018 to February 2022 by replacing the obligation\u2019s variable rate with a blended fixed rate of 2.57%. We designated the 2018 Swap Agreements as cash flow hedges of interest rate risk.\nOn February 10, 2020, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement (the \u201c2020 Swap Agreement\u201d) that covers an aggregate notional amount of $100.0 million from February 2020 to September 2024 by replacing the obligation\u2019s variable rate with a blended rate of 1.89%. In connection with this transaction, we terminated the 2018 Swap Agreements cash flow hedge relationship on a prospective basis and designated the 2020 Swap Agreement under a new cash flow hedge relationship. The fair value of the 2018 Swap Agreements immediately prior to termination was a liability of $2.5 million. Because the forecasted transactions that the 2018 Swap Agreements were designated to hedge are still probable to occur, the unrealized loss will be reclassified into earnings through September 2024. The 2020 Swap Agreement is designated as a cash flow hedge of interest rate risk.\nIf the applicable variable interest rates changed by 50 basis points, our interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2020, as reported in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations, would have changed by approximately $2.9 million.\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk\nWe have foreign currency risks related to certain of our foreign subsidiaries, primarily in the Philippines and in India. The functional currency of these foreign subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar. The local currencies of these foreign subsidiaries are the Philippine peso and India rupee. Operating expenses in these foreign subsidiaries are primarily denominated in the respective local currencies and are remeasured into our reporting currency at the average exchange rate in effect during the month. As of December 31, 2020, we entered into foreign currency exchange forward contracts with an aggregate notional amount of $25.1 million to protect a portion of our forecasted U.S. dollar-equivalent operating expenses from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These hedging contracts reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the impact of adverse foreign currency exchange rate movements. These contracts are designated as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes. For additional details, see Note 16 of the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.\nWe also enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge fluctuations associated with foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, primarily associated with our lease liabilities. These forward contracts are not designated for hedge accounting treatment. Accordingly, the change in fair value of these derivatives is recorded as a component of \u201cGeneral and administrative\u201d in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations and offsets the change in fair value of the foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities, which are also recorded in \u201cGeneral and administrative\u201d. As of December 31, 2020, the notional amounts of outstanding foreign currency contracts entered into under our balance sheet hedge program was $2.0 million. The effect of derivatives not designated as hedge instruments for the period ending December 31, 2020 was de minimis.\nAdverse changes in exchange rates of 10% would have resulted in an adverse impact on income before income taxes as reported in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations of approximately $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. These reasonably possible adverse changes in exchange rates of 10% were applied to total monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of our subsidiaries at the balance sheet date to compute the impact these changes would have had on our income before income taxes in the near term.",

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nINDEX TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nPage\nReports of Ernst & Young LLP, Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 67\nConsolidated Balance Sheets 71\nConsolidated Statements of Operations 72\nConsolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income 73\nConsolidated Statements of Stockholders\u2019 Equity 74\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows 76\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements 78\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of RealPage, Inc.\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of RealPage, Inc. (the Company) as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders\u2019 equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes and the financial statement schedule listed in the Index under Item 15(c) (collectively referred to as the \u201cconsolidated financial statements\u201d). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated March 1, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company\u2019s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nCapitalized internal-use software development costs\nDescription of\nthe Matter As more fully described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company capitalizes certain internal-use software development costs incurred during development stage activities, if direct and incremental, until the software is substantially complete and ready for its intended use. The Company capitalizes certain costs related to internal-use software upgrades and enhancements when it is probable the expenditures will result in significant additional functionality. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had capitalized internal-use software development costs of $79 million, net of amortization.\nAuditing the Company's capitalization of internal-use software development costs was an area of complexity because management\u2019s determination of which costs qualify for capitalization requires significant judgment, as only those costs incurred during development stage activities can be capitalized in accordance with the applicable accounting standards.\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company\u2019s internal-use software development costs process. This included testing controls over management\u2019s determination of which projects and costs qualify for capitalization in accordance with the applicable accounting standards.\nOur audit procedures included, among others, inspecting underlying documentation to evaluate the nature of the costs incurred, the projects and phase of development to which the costs relate, and that the costs incurred in the development phase of software production are properly capitalized in accordance with the applicable accounting standards. We also inquired of project managers for significant projects to gather additional evidence for this evaluation.\nAccounting for issuance of convertible notes\nDescription of\nthe Matter As more fully described in Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements, in May 2020, the Company issued convertible senior notes in an aggregate principal amount of $345 million (the Convertible Notes). The Convertible Notes were classified as a liability and the conversion feature was bifurcated and classified in equity based on the respective estimated fair values of the liability and equity components. The Company concluded the fair value of the liability and equity components were $288 million and $57 million, respectively.\nThe Company applied a discounted cash flow model to determine the fair value of the debt instrument, absent the conversion feature. This model required discounting the contractual cash flows of the Convertible Notes at a risk-adjusted yield that incorporates assumptions of the time value of money corresponding to the remaining term of the Convertible Notes and the credit risk of the Company. The significant assumptions in the fair value determination included the Convertible Notes\u2019 effective yield and expected volatility. Auditing the Company's determination of fair value of the liability component of the Convertible Notes was complex due to significant estimation uncertainty in estimating the fair value of the debt instrument, absent the conversion feature.\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over management\u2019s process for determining the fair value of the liability component, including management\u2019s review of the model and significant assumptions used in the fair value calculation.\nOur audit procedures included utilizing a valuation specialist to assist in evaluating the fair value methodology and the significant valuation assumptions applied by the Company in estimating the fair value of the liability component. To test the Convertible Notes\u2019 effective yield and expected volatility, we evaluated completeness and accuracy of the underlying data supporting the significant assumptions and estimates, assessed whether management\u2019s assumptions were consistent with publicly available information and evaluated entity-specific adjustments made by the Company. Additionally, to test the effective yield, we performed a comparative calculation using market data and our internally developed models.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nWe have served as the Company\u2019s auditor since 2004.\nDallas, Texas\nMarch 1, 2021\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of RealPage, Inc.\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited RealPage, Inc.\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, RealPage, Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on the COSO criteria.\nAs indicated in the accompanying \u201cManagement\u2019s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting,\u201d management\u2019s assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of Modern Message Inc. (Modern Message), Stratis IoT, Inc. (Stratis), Chirp Systems, Inc. (Chirp), and WhiteSky Communications, LLC (WhiteSky), which are included in the 2020 consolidated financial statements of the Company.\nModern Message, Stratis, and WhiteSky each constituted approximately 2% of total assets and less than 1% of total revenues, as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020, respectively. Chirp constituted less than 1% of total assets and less than 1% of total revenues as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of the Company also did not include an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of Modern Message, Stratis, Chirp, and WhiteSky.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders\u2019 equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes and the financial statement schedule listed in the Index under Item 15(c) and our report dated March 1, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company\u2019s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying \u201cManagement\u2019s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.\u201d Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nDallas, Texas\nMarch 1, 2021\nRealPage, Inc.\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\n(in thousands, except per share and share amounts)\nDecember 31,\n2020 2019\nAssets\nCurrent assets:\nCash and cash equivalents $ 594,734 $ 197,154\nRestricted cash 227,522 243,323\nAccounts receivable, less allowances of $14,272 and $10,271 at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively\n145,681 143,127\nPrepaid expenses 29,576 24,539\nOther current assets 29,559 27,387\nTotal current assets 1,027,072 635,530\nProperty, equipment, and software, net 181,211 163,282\nRight-of-use assets 110,637 121,941\nGoodwill 1,771,035 1,611,749\nIntangible assets, net 344,879 372,996\nDeferred tax assets, net 23,471 33,812\nOther assets 29,710 30,507\nTotal assets $ 3,488,015 $ 2,969,817\nLiabilities and stockholders\u2019 equity\nCurrent liabilities:\nAccounts payable $ 44,034 $ 40,092\nAccrued expenses and other current liabilities 116,530 89,038\nCurrent portion of deferred revenue 143,956 134,148\nCurrent portion of term loans 30,000 18,750\nConvertible notes, net 318,281 -\nCustomer deposits held in restricted accounts 227,373 243,316\nTotal current liabilities 880,174 525,344\nDeferred revenue 4,227 4,793\nRevolving facility -

The Company\nRealPage, Inc., a Delaware corporation (together with its subsidiaries, the \u201cCompany\u201d or \u201cwe\u201d or \u201cus\u201d), is a leading global provider of software and data analytics to the real estate industry. Our platform of data analytics and software solutions enables the rental real estate industry to manage property operations (such as marketing, pricing, screening, leasing, payment processing, and accounting), identify opportunities through market intelligence, and obtain data-driven insight for better operational and financial decision-making. Our integrated, on demand platform provides a single point of access and a massive repository of real-time lease transaction data, including prospect, renter, and property data. By leveraging data as well as integrating and streamlining a wide range of complex processes and interactions among the rental real estate ecosystem (owners, managers, prospects, renters, service providers, and investors), our platform helps our clients improve financial and operational performance and prudently place and harvest capital.\nCOVID-19 Pandemic\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we responded to the challenges that the evolving COVID-19 virus (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) pandemic created for us and our customers. We transitioned a large percentage of our workforce to a work-from-home environment while continuing to support our customers as they used our software services to sustain their operations while reducing in-person interactions with their customers. Portions of our business, including our electronic payment processing services, experienced accelerated growth as a result of the pandemic. Certain of our other services experienced lower transactional volumes at the onset of COVID-19, before beginning a return to more normalized levels in the second half of the year.\nMerger Agreement\nOn December 20, 2020, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the \u201cMerger Agreement\u201d) with Mirasol Parent, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (\u201cParent\u201d), and Mirasol Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (\u201cMerger Sub\u201d), pursuant to which Merger Sub will merge with and into RealPage (the \u201cMerger\u201d), with RealPage surviving the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. Parent and Merger Sub are affiliates of funds advised by Thoma Bravo, L.P. (\u201cThoma Bravo\u201d).\nOur Board of Directors has unanimously approved the Merger Agreement and, subject to certain exceptions set forth in the Merger Agreement, resolved to recommend that our stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement. As a result of the Merger, each share of our common stock outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger (the \u201cEffective Time\u201d) (subject to certain exceptions, including for shares of common stock owned by stockholders of RealPage who have not voted in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and have properly exercised appraisal rights in accordance with Section 262 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware) will, at the Effective Time, automatically be converted into the right to receive $88.75 in cash, subject to applicable withholding taxes (the \u201cMerger Consideration\u201d). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, as of the Effective Time, each option to purchase shares of common stock will vest at closing and be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of Merger Consideration (less the applicable exercise price) and the number of shares of common stock covered by such option (less any applicable withholding taxes). At the Effective Time, each award of restricted common stock granted prior to the date of the Merger Agreement (subject to certain exceptions) will be exchanged for an amount in cash, less any applicable withholding taxes, equal to the product obtained by multiplying (A) the Merger Consideration by (B) the number of shares of common stock covered by such award immediately prior to the Effective Time (which shall be the maximum number of shares covered by the award in the case of any such award subject to performance based vesting conditions). If the Merger is consummated, our common stock will be delisted from the NASDAQ Global Select Market and deregistered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d).\nCompletion of the Merger is subject to certain closing conditions, including (1) the adoption of the Merger Agreement by the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock, (2) the expiration or early termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the \u201cHSR Act\u201d), and the approval of the Merger under other applicable antitrust approvals, (3) the absence of an order, injunction or law prohibiting the Merger, (4) receipt of governmental consents (or, in certain circumstances, implementation of alternative arrangements) with respect to a change of control of certain money transmitter licenses held by a subsidiary of RealPage, (5) the accuracy of the other party\u2019s representations and warranties, subject to certain materiality standards set forth in the Merger Agreement, (6) compliance in all material respects with the other party\u2019s obligations under the Merger Agreement and (7) no Company Material Adverse Effect (as defined in the Merger Agreement) having occurred since the date of the Merger Agreement. The parties expect the transaction to close in the second quarter of 2021. RealPage and Parent made the filings required under the HSR Act on January 5, 2021, and the applicable waiting period under the HSR Act expired on February 4, 2021. A special meeting of our shareholders to consider and vote on the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement is scheduled to be held on March 8, 2021.\nUntil February 3, 2021 (the \u201cGo Shop Period\u201d), we had the right to, among other things, (1) solicit alternative acquisition proposals and (2) provide information (including nonpublic information) to third parties in connection therewith pursuant to an acceptable confidentiality agreement. During the Go Shop Period, representatives of BofA Securities, at the direction of our Board of Directors, communicated with additional parties to gauge their interest in making an alternative acquisition proposal. No party made an alternative acquisition proposal during the Go Shop Period. From and after February 4, 2021, we must comply with customary non-solicitation restrictions. Subject to certain customary \u201cfiduciary out\u201d exceptions, our Board is required to recommend that our Company\u2019s stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement.\nWe have made customary representations, warranties and covenants in the Merger Agreement, including, among others, covenants to use commercially reasonable efforts to conduct our business in all material respects in the ordinary course during the period between the date of the Merger Agreement and the completion of the Merger. The parties have agreed to use reasonable best efforts to take all actions necessary to consummate the merger, including cooperating to obtain the regulatory approvals necessary to complete the Merger. Either we or Parent may terminate the Merger Agreement upon certain circumstances, as described in the Merger Agreement. In addition, the Merger Agreement provides for a termination fee of $288 million payable by us to Parent, or a reverse termination fee of $528 million payable by Parent to us, in each case under certain circumstances described in the Merger Agreement.\nFor additional information related to the Merger Agreement, please refer to our filings previously made with the SEC in connection with the transaction including our definitive proxy statement filed on February 5, 2021 (the \u201cProxy Statement\u201d) and the full text of the Merger Agreement, a copy of which was filed on December 21, 2020 as Exhibit 2.1 to our Current Report on Form 8-K.\nBecause the Merger is not yet complete, and except as otherwise specifically stated, the descriptions and disclosures presented elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K assume the continuation of RealPage, Inc. as a public company.\n2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements and footnotes have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d). The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\u201cGAAP\u201d) and include the accounts of RealPage, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Such significant estimates include, but are not limited to, the determination of the allowances against our accounts receivable; useful lives of intangible assets; impairment assessments on long-lived assets (including goodwill and intangible assets); contingent commissions related to the sale of insurance products; fair value of acquired net assets and contingent consideration in connection with business combinations; the nature and timing of the satisfaction of performance obligations and related reserves; fair values of stock-based awards; loss contingencies; fair value of the debt component of convertible notes, and the recognition, measurement and valuation of current and deferred income taxes. Actual results could differ from these estimates. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable, the result of which forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities.\nConcentration of Credit Risk\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable. Our cash accounts are maintained at various high credit, quality financial institutions and may exceed federally insured limits. We have not experienced any losses in such accounts.\nSubstantially all of our accounts receivable are derived from clients in the residential rental housing market. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable and revenue are limited due to a large, diverse customer base. We do not require collateral from clients. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon the expected collectability of accounts receivable. No single client accounted for 10% or more of our revenue or accounts receivable for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, or 2018.\nThe financial health of our customers, including their ability to generate cash flows sufficient to meet their obligations to us, is dependent on, among other things, the ability of their residents to meet their lease obligations on a consistent and timely basis. A portion of those residents have already been, or may in the future be, affected by the general business closures and limitations resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. The degree to which our customers will be adversely affected by COVID-19 is still not yet fully known and will be affected by several factors including the severity and duration of what has\nbecome a prolonged outbreak in the United States, the effect of the expiration of initial government subsidies, and the scope and duration of new subsidies that recently have been or may be provided to both residents, owners and managers of rental properties and other businesses in general.\nWe maintain an allowance for credit losses based upon the expected collectability of accounts receivable using historical loss rates adjusted for forward-looking assumptions based on management\u2019s judgments. During the year ended December 31, 2020, our estimates include judgments which give consideration to the potential impact of COVID-19. However, our reserves may not be sufficient if the effects of COVID-19 on our customers become more severe or continue for an extended term. We continue to work closely with our customers to help them address the operational challenges they face as a result of COVID-19, and we will adjust our estimates of reserves for credit losses in future periods as appropriate.\nSegment and Geographic Information\nOur chief operating decision maker is our Chief Executive Officer, who reviews financial information on a consolidated basis for purposes of allocating resources and evaluating financial performance. Accordingly, we have determined we operate as a single operating segment.\nPrincipally, all of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 was earned in the United States. Net property, equipment, and software located in the United States amounted to $171.4 million and $154.5 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Net property, equipment, and software located in our international subsidiaries amounted to $9.8 million and $8.8 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Substantially all of the net property, equipment, and software held in our international subsidiaries was located in the Philippines and India at December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nCash and Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash\nWe consider all highly liquid investments with an initial maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. The fair value of our cash and cash equivalents approximates carrying value.\nRestricted cash primarily consists of cash collected from tenants that will be remitted to our clients.\nAccounts Receivable\nAccounts receivable primarily represent trade receivables from clients recorded at the invoiced amount, net of allowances, which are based on our historical experience, the aging of our trade receivables, and management judgment.\nTrade receivables are written off against the allowance when management determines a balance is uncollectible. During the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, we incurred bad debt expense of $4.2 million, $2.9 million, and $4.0 million, respectively.\nProperty, Equipment, and Software\nProperty, equipment, and software are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization, which are computed using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives:\nData processing and communications equipment 3 - 5 years\nFurniture, fixtures, and other equipment 3 - 5 years\nSoftware 3 - 5 years\nLeasehold improvements Shorter of lease term or estimated useful life\nSoftware includes both purchased and internally developed software. Gains and losses from asset disposals are included in the line \u201cGeneral and administrative\u201d in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nInternally Developed Software\nCosts incurred to develop software intended for our internal use are capitalized during the application development stage. Capitalization of such costs ceases once the project is substantially complete and ready for its intended use. We also capitalize costs related to specific upgrades and enhancements when it is probable the expenditure will result in additional functionality. Costs related to preliminary project activities and post-implementation operating activities are expensed as incurred.\nInternally developed software costs are included in \u201cProperty, equipment, and software, net\u201d in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets and are amortized on a straight-line basis over their expected useful lives. Amortization of internally developed software is included in \u201cAmortization of product technologies\u201d in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nTangible long-lived assets held and used are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include, but are not limited to, significant under-performance relative to current and historical or projected future operating results, significant changes in the manner of our use of the asset, or significant changes in our overall business and/or product strategies. If circumstances require that a long-lived asset group be tested for impairment, determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by that long-lived asset or asset group. If the carrying amount of the long-lived asset or asset group is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis, we would recognize an impairment charge equal to the excess of the carrying value over its fair value.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe allocate the fair value of the purchase consideration of our acquisitions to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and intangible assets acquired generally based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. Purchase consideration includes assets transferred, liabilities assumed, and/or equity interests issued by us, all of which are measured at their fair value as of the date of acquisition. Our business combination transactions may be structured to include a combination of up-front, deferred and contingent payments to be made at specified dates subsequent to the date of acquisition. These payments may include a combination of cash and equity and are generally settled within one to four years from the date of acquisition. Deferred and contingent payments determined to be purchase consideration are recorded at fair value as of the acquisition date. Deferred obligations are generally subject to adjustments specified in the underlying purchase agreement related to the seller\u2019s indemnification obligations, including indemnification assets that contractually can be recorded as a reduction to outstanding deferred obligations. Our contingent consideration arrangements are obligations to make future payments to sellers contingent upon the achievement of future operational or financial targets and are remeasured to fair value at the end of each reporting period until the obligations are settled.\nThe valuation of the net assets acquired as well as certain elements of purchase consideration requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to future expected cash flows, useful lives, and discount rates. Management\u2019s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. During the measurement period, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with a corresponding offset to goodwill. Subsequent changes to the fair value of contingent consideration are reflected in \u201cGeneral and administrative\u201d in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nAcquisition costs are expensed as incurred and are included in \u201cGeneral and administrative\u201d in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. We include the results of operations from acquired businesses in our consolidated financial statements from the effective date of the acquisition.\nGoodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets\nWe test goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment separately on an annual basis in the fourth quarter of each year, or more frequently if circumstances indicate that the assets may not be recoverable. For purposes of goodwill impairment testing, we have one reporting unit.\nWe evaluate impairment of goodwill either by assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, or by performing a quantitative assessment. Qualitative factors include industry and market considerations, overall financial performance, and other relevant events and circumstances affecting the reporting unit. If we choose to perform a qualitative assessment and after considering the totality of events or circumstances, we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we would perform a quantitative fair value test. Our quantitative impairment assessment utilizes a weighted combination of a discounted cash flow model (known as the income approach) and comparisons to publicly traded companies engaged in similar businesses (known as the market approach). These approaches involve judgmental assumptions, including forecasted future cash flows expected to be generated by the business over an extended period of time, long-term growth rates, the identification of comparable companies, and our discount rate based on our weighted average cost of capital. These assumptions are predominately unobservable inputs and considered Level 3 measurements. We adopted ASU 2017-04, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other, which simplifies the testing for goodwill impairment by eliminating the requirement to determine the fair value of individual assets and liabilities of a reporting unit to measure goodwill impairment, prospectively on January 1, 2020. To calculate any potential impairment when we perform a quantitative test, we compare the fair value of our reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. Any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit\u2019s goodwill over its fair value is recognized as an impairment loss, and the carrying value of goodwill is written down.\nWe quantitatively evaluate indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment by estimating the fair value of those assets based on estimated future earnings derived from the assets using the income approach. Key assumptions for this assessment\ninclude forecasted future cash flows from estimated royalty rates and our discount rate based on our weighted average cost of capital. These assumptions are unobservable Level 3 measurements. Assets with indefinite lives that have been determined to be inseparable due to their interchangeable use are grouped into single units of accounting for purposes of testing for impairment. If the carrying amount of an identified intangible asset with an indefinite life exceeds its fair value, we recognize an impairment loss equal to the excess of carrying value over fair value.\nIntangible Assets\nIntangible assets with determinable economic lives are carried at cost, less accumulated amortization. Our intangible assets are largely acquired in business combinations and include developed technologies, client relationships, vendor relationships, non-competition agreements and trade names. Intangible assets are amortized over the shorter of the contractual life or the estimated useful life. Intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis, except for client relationships which generally are amortized proportionately to the expected discounted cash flows derived from the asset.\nEstimated useful lives for intangible assets primarily consist of the following:\nDeveloped technologies 3 - 7 years\nClient relationships 3 - 10 years\nVendor relationships 7 years\nTrade names 1 - 7 years\nNon-competition agreements 5 - 10 years\nAmortization of acquired developed technologies is included in \u201cAmortization of product technologies\u201d, and amortization of acquired client relationships, vendor relationships, non-competition agreements and trade names is included in \u201cAmortization of intangible assets\u201d in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nOther Current and Long-Term Liabilities\nAccrued expenses and other current liabilities consisted of the following at December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nDecember 31,\n2020 2019\n(in thousands)\nAccrued compensation, payroll taxes, and benefits $ 48,465 $ 28,444\nSales tax obligations 12,965 4,232\nCurrent portion of liabilities related to acquisitions 17,773 23,431\nLease-related liabilities 17,880 16,127\nAccrued legal and professional fees 8,513 3,405\nOther current liabilities 10,934 13,399\nTotal accrued expenses and other current liabilities $ 116,530 $ 89,038\nOther long-term liabilities consisted of the following at December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nDecember 31,\n2020 2019\n(in thousands)\nLiabilities related to acquisitions $ 9,650 $ 14,852\nDeferred tax liabilities 3,879 2,353\nLong-term accrued compensation and payroll taxes 10,371 1,693\nOther long-term liabilities 9,131 4,042\nTotal other long-term liabilities $ 33,031 $ 22,940\nLeases\nWe determine if an arrangement contains a lease at inception. Right-of-use (\u201cROU\u201d) assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and the corresponding lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Our ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. The ROU asset is reduced for tenant incentives and excludes any initial direct costs incurred. For our real estate contracts with lease and non-lease components, we have elected to combine the lease and non-lease components into a single lease component. The implicit rate within our leases are generally not readily determinable, and\ninstead we use our incremental borrowing rate at the lease commencement date to determine the present value of lease payments. The determination of our incremental borrowing rate requires judgment. We determine our incremental borrowing rate for each lease using our current borrowing rate, adjusted for various factors including collateralization and term to align with the terms of the lease. Certain of our leases include options to extend the lease. Our lease values include options to extend the lease when it is reasonably certain we will exercise such options.\nOperating and finance leases are included in \u201cRight-of-use assets\u201d, \u201cAccrued expenses and other current liabilities\u201d, and \u201cLease liabilities, net of current portion\u201d in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nLease expenses for minimum lease payments for operating leases are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Amortization expense of the ROU asset for finance leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and interest expense for finance leases is recognized based on the incremental borrowing rate.\nWe have elected not to recognize a lease liability or ROU asset for short-term leases, defined as those which have an initial term of twelve months or less.\nConvertible Notes\nWe account for our Convertible Notes as separate liability and equity components. The initial carrying amounts of the liability components are calculated by measuring the fair value of a similar liability that does not have an associated convertible feature. We estimate fair value using a discounted cash flow model that relies upon subjective assumptions including expected volatility and discount rates determined using observable yields for stand-alone debt instruments with comparable credit ratings and terms. The carrying amounts of the equity components representing the conversion options are determined by deducting the fair value of the liability components from the par value of the Convertible Notes. The difference represents a debt discount that is amortized to interest expense over the terms of the Convertible Notes using the effective interest method. The equity components are not remeasured as long as they continue to meet the conditions for equity classification.\nIssuance costs related to our Convertible Notes are allocated to the liability and equity components based on their relative values. Costs allocated to the liability components are amortized to interest expense over the terms of the Convertible Notes using the effective interest method. Costs allocated to the equity components, and any impact of deferred taxes arising from the discount to the par value of the Convertible Notes, reduce the carrying amount of the equity component.\nTo the extent we receive conversion requests for our Convertible Notes prior to maturity, the settlement consideration is allocated to the liability component of the respective Convertible Note equal to the fair value of the component immediately prior to the extinguishment, with any residual consideration recorded as a reduction to the equity component. Any difference between the amount allocated to the liability component and its net carrying amount is recorded as a gain or loss on debt extinguishment.\nDeferred Revenue\nFor several of our solutions, we invoice our clients in annual, quarterly, or monthly installments in advance of the commencement of the service period. Deferred revenue is recognized when billings are due or payments are received in advance of revenue recognition from our subscription and other services. Accordingly, the deferred revenue balance does not represent the total contract value of annual subscription agreements.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenues are derived from on demand software solutions, professional services and other goods and services. We recognize revenue as we satisfy one or more service obligations under the terms of a contract, generally as control of goods and services are transferred to our clients. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for transferring goods or providing services. We include estimated variable consideration in revenue to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue will not occur. We estimate and accrue a reserve for credit accommodations and other adjustments as a reduction to revenue based on several factors, including past history.\nOn Demand Revenue\nOur on demand revenue consists of license and subscription fees, transaction and payment processing fees related to certain of our software-enabled value-added services, and commissions derived from our selling certain risk mitigation services.\nWe generally recognize revenue from subscription fees on a straight-line basis over the access period beginning on the date that we make our service available to the client. Our subscription agreements generally are non-cancellable, have an initial term of one year or longer and are billed either monthly, quarterly or annually in advance. Non-refundable up-front fees billed at the initial order date that are not associated with an up-front service obligation are recognized as revenue on a straight-line basis over the period in which the client is expected to benefit, which we consider to be three years.\nWe recognize revenue from transaction fees in the month the related services are performed based on the amount we have the right to invoice.\nWe offer risk mitigation services to our clients by acting as an insurance agent and derive commission revenue from the sale of insurance products to our clients\u2019 residents. The commissions are based upon a percentage of the premium that the insurance company charges to the policyholder and are subject to forfeiture in instances where a policyholder cancels prior to the end of the policy. Our contracts with our underwriting partners provide for contingent commissions to be paid to us in accordance with the agreements. Our estimate of contingent commission revenue considers the variable factors identified in the terms of the applicable agreement. We recognize commissions related to these services as earned ratably over the policy term and insurance commission receivable in \u201cAccounts receivable, less allowances\u201d.\nProfessional and Other Revenue\nProfessional services and other revenues generally consist of the fees we receive for providing implementation and consulting services, submeter and other equipment and ongoing maintenance of our existing on premise licenses.\nProfessional services are billed either on a time and materials basis or on a fixed price basis, and revenue is recognized over time as we perform the obligation or at completion. Professional services are typically sold in a combined contract with other on demand solutions but may be sold separately. Professional service contracts sold separately generally have terms of one year or less.\nOther revenues consist primarily of submeter equipment sales that include related installation services. Such sales are considered bundled, and revenue from these bundled sales is recognized in proportion to the number of installed units completed to date as compared to the total contracted number of units to be provided and installed. For all other equipment sales, we generally recognize revenue when control of the hardware has transferred to our client.\nRevenue recognized for on premise software sales generally consists of annual maintenance renewals on existing term or perpetual licenses, which is recognized ratably over the service period.\nContracts with Multiple Performance Obligations\nThe majority of the contracts we enter into with clients, including multiple contracts entered into at or near the same time with the same client, require us to provide one or more on demand software solutions, professional services and may include equipment. For these contracts, we account for individual performance obligations separately: i) if they are distinct or ii) if the promised obligations represent a series of distinct services that are substantially the same and have the same pattern of transfer to the client. Once we determine the performance obligations, we determine the transaction price, which includes estimating the amount of variable consideration, if any, to be included in the transaction price. For contracts with multiple performance obligations, we allocate the transaction price to the separate performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price basis. The standalone selling prices of our service are estimated using a market assessment approach based on our overall pricing objectives taking into consideration market conditions and other factors including the number of solutions sold, client demographics and the number and types of users within our contracts.\nSales, value add, and other taxes we collect from clients and remit to governmental authorities are excluded from revenues.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue consists primarily of salaries and related personnel expenses of our operations and support personnel, including training and implementation services; expenses related to the operation of our data centers; transaction processing fees; fees paid to third-party providers; allocations of facilities overhead costs; and depreciation.\nSales and Marketing Expenses and Deferred Commissions\nSales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel and related costs, including salaries, benefits, bonuses, commissions, travel, and stock-based compensation. Other costs included are marketing and promotional events, our annual user conference, and other online and product marketing costs. We amortize sales commissions that are directly attributable to a contract over an estimated customer benefit period of three years.\nAdvertising costs are expensed as incurred and totaled $35.9 million, $34.4 million, and $30.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.\nStock-Based Expense\nWe recognize compensation expense related to awards of stock options and restricted stock granted to employees, non-employee directors, and other service providers based on the estimated fair value of the awards on the date of grant. We recognize expense for stock options and time-based restricted stock awards on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the awards. For market-based awards and performance-based awards, expense is recognized over the requisite service period using the graded-vesting attribution method. Compensation expense is reduced for forfeitures as they occur.\nThe fair value of our time-based restricted stock awards is based on the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant. The fair value of our market-based restricted stock awards is estimated using a discrete model based on multiple stock\nprice-paths developed through the use of Monte Carlo simulation. Changes to the assumptions underlying our valuation model may have a significant impact on the underlying value of the market-based restricted stock awards, which could have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. The fair value of our performance-based awards is based on obligations denominated in fixed dollar amounts and our expectation of future operating results and the specific performance criteria within each agreement. For awards subject to performance criteria, we reassess the likelihood of the performance criteria being met at each reporting date based on our expectation of future operating results and adjust the total compensation expense to be recognized.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes are recorded based on the liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. We recognize the effect of tax rate changes on current and accumulated deferred income taxes in the period in which the rate changes are enacted.\nValuation allowances are provided when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. The factors used to assess the need for a valuation allowance include historical earnings, our latest forecast of taxable income, and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets. In projecting future taxable income, we begin with historical results and incorporate assumptions including the amount of future state, federal and foreign pretax operating income, the reversal of temporary differences, and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies, if any. These assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses.\nWe may recognize a tax benefit from uncertain tax positions only if it is at least more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon settlement with the taxing authorities.\nFair Value Measurements\nWe measure our financial instruments and acquisition-related contingent consideration obligations at fair value at each reporting period using a fair value hierarchy. A financial instrument\u2019s classification within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Three levels of inputs may be used to measure fair value:\nLevel 1 - Inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\nLevel 2 - Inputs are quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, and market-corroborated inputs which are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data.\nLevel 3 - Inputs are derived from valuation techniques in which one or more of the significant inputs or value drivers are unobservable.\nThe categorization of an asset or liability is based on the inputs described above and does not necessarily correspond to our perceived risk of that asset or liability. Moreover, the methods used by us may produce a fair value calculation that is not indicative of the net realizable value or reflective of future fair values. Furthermore, although we believe our valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments and non-financial assets and liabilities could result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date.\nCertain financial instruments, which may include cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses are recorded at their carrying amounts, which approximates their fair values due to their short-term nature.\nWe hold an equity investment which does not have a readily determinable fair value. We measure this investment at cost less impairment, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Standards\nAccounting Standards Update 2016-13\nIn June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. The amendments in this ASU replaced the incurred loss impairment methodology in GAAP with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires\nconsideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. Our financial assets in the scope of ASU 2016-13 mainly consist of short-term trade receivables. We have also considered contract assets in our evaluation. Historically, our actual credit losses have not been material. In addition to continuing to individually assess overdue customer balances for expected credit losses, we have implemented modifications to our historical methodology that reflect the expected credit losses on receivables considering both historical experience and forward-looking assumptions. We adopted ASU 2016-13 using the modified retrospective approach on January 1, 2020, resulting in no cumulative adjustment to retained earnings. The adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. We will continue to actively monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on expected credit losses.\nThe rollforward of the allowance for credit losses, a component of our allowance for accounts receivable, as of December 31, 2020 was as follows (in thousands):\nBalance as of January 1, 2020 $ 4,545\nProvision for credit losses 1,097\nWrite-offs, net of recoveries (527)\nBalance as of March 31, 2020 5,115\nProvision for credit losses 1,168\nWrite-offs, net of recoveries (740)\nBalance as of June 30, 2020 5,543\nProvision for credit losses 800\nWrite-offs, net of recoveries (682)\nBalance as of September 30, 2020 5,661\nProvision for credit losses 1,161\nWrite-offs, net of recoveries (1,640)\nBalance as of December 31, 2020 $ 5,182\nAccounting Standards Update 2018-15\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-15, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other-Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer's Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That is a Service Contract. This ASU aligns the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a cloud-based hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software. We adopted ASU 2018-15 prospectively as of January 1, 2020. The impact to our financial statements will depend on the nature of our future cloud computing arrangements; however, this standard did not have a material impact on our financial statements as of December 31, 2020.\nAccounting Standards Update 2020-04\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848). ASU 2020-04 contains practical expedients for activities related to reference rate reform that impact debt, leases, derivatives and other contracts. The guidance in ASU 2020-04 is optional and may be elected over time as reference rate reform activities occur. During 2020, we elected to apply the hedge accounting expedients related to probability and the assessments of effectiveness for future LIBOR-indexed cash flows to assume that the index upon which future hedged transactions will be based matches the index on the corresponding derivatives. Application of these expedients preserves the presentation of derivatives consistent with past presentation. We continue to evaluate the impact of the guidance and may apply other elections, as applicable, as additional changes in the market occur.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nAccounting Standards Update 2019-12\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes, which is intended to simplify various aspects related to accounting for income taxes. ASU 2019-12 removes certain exceptions to the general principles in Topic 740 and also clarifies and amends existing guidance to improve consistent application. ASU 2019-12 will be effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2020. The adoption of this standard will not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nAccounting Standards Update 2020-06\nIn August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Debt - Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entity\u2019s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and\nContracts in an Entity\u2019s Own Equity. This ASU simplifies the accounting for certain convertible instruments by eliminating the requirement to separate convertible notes into debt and equity components, instead allowing for the convertible debt to be accounted for as a single liability measured at its amortized cost. These changes will reduce reported interest expense to an amount more closely aligned with the convertible debt instrument\u2019s coupon interest rate and increase reported net income for entities that have issued a convertible instrument that was bifurcated according to existing GAAP. Furthermore, this ASU amends the diluted earnings per share calculation for convertible instruments by requiring the use of the if-converted method. Once the new standard is adopted, our use of the treasury stock method will no longer be available. ASU 2020-06 will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, with early adoption permitted for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2020. We expect to adopt this ASU effective January 1, 2022 and are still assessing our method of adoption. Once we adopt ASU 2020-06, we expect our total remaining interest expense over the contractual terms of our convertible debt to be approximately $51.0 million less than under the existing accounting standards. We continue to evaluate the impact of the guidance on our net income, basic and dilutive earnings per share.\n3. Acquisitions\nFiscal Year 2020\nWhiteSky\nOn December 31, 2020, we entered into a Purchase Agreement by which we acquired all the outstanding equity interests of WhiteSky Communications, LLC (\u201cWhiteSky\u201d), a provider of managed communications services, enabling multifamily, student and other properties to provide managed bulk Internet, video, voice-over-internet protocol (VOIP) phone, and Wi-Fi services. Aggregate purchase consideration was $64.9 million, including deferred cash obligations of up to $6.5 million, which are subject to working capital adjustments and indemnification claims. The acquisition was financed with cash on hand.\nThe purchase agreement also provided for up to $20.0 million in contingent consideration tied to both continued employment services and performance targets. Such arrangement will be treated as a separate transaction from the business combination and will be expensed as post-combination services are provided.\nThe acquired identified intangible assets consisted of client relationships, technology and trade names that were assigned estimated useful lives of ten, ten, and five years, respectively. Preliminary goodwill recognized of $45.1 million is primarily comprised of expansion of our product offerings as part of our CommunityConnect business as well as anticipated synergies from sale of such services to our existing customers. Goodwill and the acquired intangible assets are deductible for tax purposes due to the previous LLC tax status of the acquired entity. Acquisition costs associated with this transaction of $0.7 million were expensed as incurred.\nChirp\nOn September 21, 2020, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger by which we acquired all the outstanding stock of Chirp Systems, Inc. (\u201cChirp\u201d), a provider of smart access software and technology solutions to the multifamily housing industry. Aggregate purchase consideration was $16.8 million, including contingent consideration of up to $10.0 million that is tied to operational performance targets through 2022, and deferred cash obligations of up to $1.3 million, which are subject to working capital adjustments and indemnification claims. The acquisition was financed with cash on hand. The parent company of one of the significant selling shareholders of Chirp is a customer of RealPage. In addition, a member of the board of directors of that customer is also a member of our board of directors.\nCertain executives of Chirp at or near the transaction date were provided up to $5.0 million in retention incentives tied to post acquisition employment service and the achievement of performance targets by December 31, 2023. The incentives, if achieved, will be in the form of incentive grants that may be settled in the future in stock or cash, at our option. As of December 31, 2020, we expect the executives to earn a payout of $1.7 million under these awards, and we will update this estimate on a quarterly basis. As these awards are tied in part to employment services, we will record the estimated amount as stock-based compensation expense over the requisite service period.\nThe acquired identified intangible assets consist of developed technology and client relationships that were each assigned estimated useful lives of seven years. Preliminary goodwill recognized of $12.2 million is primarily comprised of expansion of our product offerings into the smart access market as part of our CommunityConnect business as well as anticipated synergies from sale of such products to our existing customers. Goodwill and the acquired intangible assets are not deductible for tax purposes. Acquisition costs associated with this transaction of $0.2 million were expensed as incurred.\nStratis\nOn August 31, 2020, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger by which we acquired all the outstanding stock of Stratis IoT, Inc. (\u201cStratis\u201d), a provider of software, technology and services that enable smart apartments and intelligent buildings, including a software-as-a-service (\u201cSaaS\u201d) platform specifically built for the complexities of the multifamily and student housing industries. Aggregate purchase consideration was $64.8 million, including deferred cash obligations of up to\n$6.0 million, which are subject to working capital adjustments and indemnification claims. The acquisition was financed with cash on hand.\nCertain employees of Stratis at or near the transaction date were provided up to $15.0 million in retention incentives tied to post acquisition employment service and the achievement of performance targets by June 30, 2024. The incentives, if achieved, will be in the form of incentive grants that may be settled in the future in stock or cash, at our option. As of December 31, 2020, we expect the employees to earn a payout of $5.0 million under these awards, and we will update this estimate on a quarterly basis. As these awards are tied in part to employment services, we will record the estimated amount as stock-based compensation expense over the requisite service period.\nThe acquired identified intangible assets consisted of developed technology, client relationships, and trade names that were assigned estimated useful lives of seven, ten and three years, respectively. Preliminary goodwill recognized of $50.4 million is primarily comprised of expansion of our product offerings into the smart devices and intelligent building market as part of our CommunityConnect business as well as anticipated synergies from sale of such products to our existing customers. Goodwill and the acquired intangible assets are not deductible for tax purposes. Acquisition costs associated with this transaction of $0.6 million were expensed as incurred.\nModern Message\nOn January 22, 2020, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, by which we acquired all the outstanding stock of Modern Message Inc. (\u201cModern Message\u201d), a provider of resident engagement solutions to the multifamily housing industry. Aggregate purchase consideration was $64.7 million, including deferred cash obligations of up to $2.0 million, which are subject to working capital adjustments and indemnification claims. In addition, the Agreement and Plan of Merger provided for retention incentives for certain executives in the form of restricted stock grants that are tied to post-acquisition employment service. These shares were granted during the first quarter of 2020, and had an aggregate grant date fair value of $10.7 million which will be recognized as stock-based compensation over the requisite service period. The acquisition was financed with cash on hand.\nThe acquired identified intangible assets consisted of developed technology, client relationships, and trade names that were assigned estimated useful lives of five, nine and five years, respectively. Preliminary goodwill recognized of $49.1 million is primarily comprised of anticipated synergies from the expansion of our resident engagement platform. Goodwill and the acquired intangible assets are not deductible for tax purposes. Acquisition costs associated with this transaction of $0.6 million were expensed as incurred.\nPurchase Consideration and Purchase Price Allocations\nThe estimated fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed for Stratis, Chirp and WhiteSky are provisional and are based primarily on the information available as of the acquisition date. We believe this information provides a reasonable basis for estimating the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, but we are awaiting additional information necessary to finalize those values including the fair value of intangible assets acquired. Therefore, the provisional measurements of fair value are subject to change, and such changes could be significant. We expect to finalize the valuations of these assets and liabilities as soon as practicable, but no later than one year from the respective acquisition closing dates. The components of the purchase consideration and the preliminary allocations of purchase price as of December 31, 2020 are as follows:\nModern Message Stratis Chirp WhiteSky\n(in thousands)\nFair value of purchase consideration:\nCash, net of cash acquired $ 62,748 $ 58,948 $ 11,249 $ 58,894\nDeferred obligations, net 1,998 5,802 1,201 6,016\nContingent consideration - - 4,300 -\nTotal fair value of purchase consideration $ 64,746 $ 64,750 $ 16,750 $ 64,910\nFair value of net assets acquired:\nRestricted cash $ 3,248 $ - $ - $ -\nAccounts receivable 1,222 2,442 44 2,257\nOther current assets 425 1,728 - 8,476\nProperty, equipment, and software - 900 - 500\nDeferred tax asset, net - - - 1,068\nIntangible assets:\nDeveloped product technologies 8,700 11,100 4,000 500\nClient relationships 9,400 5,700 1,400 15,500\nTrade names 700 150 - 1,000\nRight-of-use assets - - - 1,316\nGoodwill 49,138 50,350 12,164 45,107\nOther assets - - 8 1,807\nAccounts payable and accrued liabilities (886) (2,392) (334) (8,129)\nClient deposits held in restricted accounts (3,451) - - -\nDeferred revenue (198) (2,612) - (3,489)\nOther long-term liabilities - - - (1,003)\nDeferred tax liability, net (3,552) (2,616) (532) -\nTotal fair value of net assets acquired $ 64,746 $ 64,750 $ 16,750 $ 64,910\nAcquisitions Prior to 2020\nWe completed nine acquisitions during fiscal years 2019 and 2018.

(collectively with NovelPay, \u201cClickPay\u201d), we issued an aggregate of 154,281 shares of our common stock to the equity holders of ClickPay. These shares were subject to a holdback in respect of indemnification and post-closing purchase price adjustments pursuant to the acquisition agreements. In May 2020, these shares were settled net of holdback claims, resulting in the retirement of 9,994 previously issued shares of our common stock.\nIn September 2019, we settled a deferred equity obligation with regard to our September 2018 acquisition of LeaseLabs, Inc. through the issuance of 80,012 shares of our common stock.\nPro Forma Results of Acquisitions\nThe following table presents unaudited pro forma results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, as if the aforementioned 2020 and 2019 acquisitions had occurred as of January 1, 2019 and January 1, 2018, respectively. The pro forma information includes the business combination accounting effects resulting from these acquisitions, including interest expense, tax expense or benefit, issuance of our common shares, and additional amortization resulting from the valuation of amortizable intangible assets. We prepared the pro forma financial information for the combined entities for comparative purposes only, and it is not indicative of what actual results would have been if the acquisitions had occurred at the beginning of the periods presented, or of future results.\nYear Ended December 31,\nPro Forma 2019\nPro Forma\n(unaudited)\n(in thousands, except per share amounts)\nTotal revenue $ 1,194,199 $ 1,090,140\nNet income $ 46,851 $ 10,548\nNet income per share:\nBasic $ 0.48 $ 0.11\nDiluted $ 0.46 $ 0.11\n4.

Our SaaS solutions are provided pursuant to contractual commitments that typically include a promise that we will stand ready, on a monthly basis, to deliver access to our technology platform over defined service delivery periods. These solutions represent a series of distinct services that are substantially the same and have the same pattern of transfer to the client. Revenue from our SaaS solutions is generally recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement.\nConsideration for our on demand subscription services consist of fixed, variable and usage-based fees. We invoice a portion of our fees at the initial order date and then monthly or annually thereafter. Subscription fees are generally fixed based on the number of sites and the level of services selected by the client.\nWe sell certain usage-based services, primarily within our property management, resident services and leasing and marketing solutions, to clients based on a fixed rate per transaction. Revenues are calculated based on the number of transactions processed monthly and will vary from month to month based on actual usage of these transaction-based services over the contract term, which is typically one year in duration. The fees for usage-based services are not associated with every distinct service promised in the series of distinct services we provide our clients. As a result, we allocate variable usage-based fees only to the related transactions and recognize them in the month that usage occurs.\nAs part of our resident services offerings, we offer risk mitigation services to our clients by acting as an insurance agent, and we derive commission revenue from the sale of insurance products to our clients\u2019 residents. The commissions are based upon a percentage of the premium that the insurance company underwriting partners charge to the policyholder and are subject to forfeiture in instances where a policyholder cancels prior to the end of the policy. The overall insurance services we provide represent a single performance obligation that qualifies as a separate series. Our contracts with our underwriting partners also provide for contingent commissions to be paid to us in accordance with the agreements. The contingent commissions are not associated with every distinct service promised in the series of distinct insurance services we provide. We generally accrue and recognize contingent commissions monthly based on estimates of the variable factors identified in the terms of the applicable agreements.\nProfessional Services and Other Revenues\nProfessional services and other revenues generally consist of the fees we receive for providing implementation and consulting services, submeter and other equipment and ongoing maintenance of our existing on premise licenses.\nProfessional services revenues primarily consist of fees for implementation services, consulting services and training. Professional services are billed either on a fixed rate per hour (time) and materials basis or on a fixed price basis, and revenue is recognized over time as we perform the obligation or at completion. Professional services are typically sold in a combined contract with other on demand solutions but may be sold separately. For contracts with multiple performance obligations, we allocate the transaction price to separate services based on their relative standalone selling prices if a service is separately identifiable from other items in the bundled arrangement and if a client can benefit from it on its own or with other resources readily available to the client.\nOther revenues consist of submeter equipment sales that include related installation services, sales of other equipment and on premise software sales. Submeter hardware and installation services are considered to be part of a single performance obligation due to the significance of the integration and interdependency of the installation services with the meter equipment. Our typical payment terms for submeter installations require a percentage of the overall transaction price to be paid up-front, with the remainder billed as progress payments. We recognize submeter revenue in proportion to the number of fully installed units completed to date as compared to the total contracted number of units to be provided and installed. For all other equipment sales, we generally recognize revenue when control of the hardware has transferred to our client, which occurs at a point in time, typically upon delivery to the client.\nThe majority of on premise revenue consists of maintenance renewals from clients who renew for an additional one-year term. Maintenance renewal revenue is recognized ratably over the service period based upon the standalone selling price of that service obligation.\nContract Balances\nContract assets generally consist of amounts recognized as revenue before they can be invoiced to clients or amounts invoiced to clients prior to the period in which the service is provided where the right to payment is subject to conditions other than just the passage of time. These contract assets are included in \u201cAccounts receivable\u201d in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures. Contract liabilities are comprised of billings or payments received from our clients in advance of performance under the contract. We refer to these contract liabilities as \u201cDeferred revenue\u201d in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures. We recognized $131.6 million of on demand revenue during the year ended December 31, 2020, which was included in the line \u201cDeferred revenue\u201d in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets as of the beginning of the period.\nContract Acquisition Costs\nWe capitalize certain commissions as incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a client if we expect to recover those costs. The commissions are capitalized and amortized over a period of benefit determined to be three years. Below is a summary of our capitalized commissions costs and their respective locations in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets:\nDecember 31,\nBalance Sheet Location 2020 2019\n(in thousands)\nCapitalized commissions costs - current Other current assets $ 11,595 $ 9,870\nCapitalized commissions costs - noncurrent Other assets 10,319 8,463\nTotal capitalized commissions costs $ 21,914 $ 18,333\nAmortization of the capitalized commissions was $12.0 million, $8.7 million, and $5.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 respectively.\nRemaining Performance Obligations\nCertain clients commit to purchase our solutions for terms ranging from two to seven years. We expect to recognize approximately $515.5 million of revenue in the future related to performance obligations for on demand contracts with an original duration greater than one year that were unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied as of December 31, 2020. Our estimate does not include amounts related to:\n\u2022professional and usage-based services that are billed and recognized based on services performed in a certain period;\n\u2022amounts attributable to unexercised contract renewals that represent a material right; or\n\u2022amounts attributable to unexercised client options to purchase services that do not represent a material right.\nWe expect to recognize revenue on approximately 70.5% of the remaining performance obligations over the next 24 months, with the remainder recognized thereafter. Revenue from remaining performance obligations for long-term professional service contracts as of December 31, 2020 was immaterial.\n5. Accounts Receivable\nAccounts receivable consisted of the following at December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nDecember 31,\n2020 2019\n(in thousands)\nTrade receivables from clients $ 141,031 $ 137,039\nInsurance commissions receivable 18,922 16,359\nAccounts receivable, gross 159,953 153,398\nLess: Allowances (14,272) (10,271)\nAccounts receivable, net $ 145,681 $ 143,127\nTrade receivables include amounts billed to our clients, primarily under our on demand subscription solutions. Trade receivables also includes amounts invoiced to clients prior to the period in which the service is provided and amounts for which we have met the requirements to recognize revenue in advance of invoicing the client. Insurance commissions receivable consists of commissions derived from the sale of insurance products to individuals and contingent commissions related to those policies. Contingent commissions are determined based on a calculation that considers earned agent commissions, a percent of premium retained by our underwriting partner, incurred losses, and profit retained by our underwriting partner during the time period. Contingent commissions receivables are recorded at their estimated net realizable value, based on estimates and considerations which include, but are not limited to, the historical and projected loss rates incurred by the underlying policies.\n6. Property, Equipment, and Software\nProperty, equipment, and software consisted of the following at December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nDecember 31,\n2020 2019\n(in thousands)\nLeasehold improvements $ 71,517 $ 70,558\nData processing and communications equipment 95,502 77,358\nFurniture, fixtures, and other equipment 40,673 35,856\nSoftware 198,293 157,832\nProperty, equipment, and software, gross 405,985 341,604\nLess: Accumulated depreciation and amortization (224,774) (178,322)\nProperty, equipment, and software, net $ 181,211 $ 163,282\nDepreciation and amortization expense for property, equipment, and purchased software was $31.8 million, $30.2 million, and $28.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.\nThe unamortized amount of capitalized software development costs was $79.0 million and $66.5 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Amortization expense related to capitalized software development costs totaled $17.8 million, $14.8 million, and $11.9 million during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.\n7. Leases\nWe adopted ASU 2016-02 effective January 1, 2019 using the modified retrospective approach. Prior period amounts have not been adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with our historic accounting under Topic 840. Our leases are primarily comprised of real estate leases of office facilities and equipment under operating leases that expire on various dates through 2033. In May 2015, we entered into a lease agreement for office space located in Richardson, Texas to serve as our corporate headquarters and data center. The lease is for a term of twelve years, beginning in 2016, and includes optional extension periods. The lease agreement contains provisions for rent escalations over the term of the lease and leasehold improvement incentives, and is currently classified as a finance lease.\nThe components of lease costs for the year ended December 31, 2020 were as follows:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2019\n(in thousands)\nOperating lease cost $ 16,842 $ 13,949\nFinance lease cost:\nDepreciation of finance lease asset $ 3,969 $ 3,969\nInterest on lease liabilities 4,074 4,221\nTotal finance lease cost $ 8,043 $ 8,190\nRent expense for short-term leases for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was not material. Rent expense for operating leases for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $15.8 million.\nSupplemental balance sheet information related to leases at December 31, 2020, was as follows:\nOperating Leases Finance Leases Total Leases\n(in thousands, except lease term and discount rate)\nRight-of-use assets $ 59,312 $ 51,325 $ 110,637\nLease liabilities, current (1)\n$ 14,021 $ 3,859 $ 17,880\nLease liabilities, net of current portion 50,512 70,615 121,127\nTotal lease liabilities $ 64,533 $ 74,474 $ 139,007\nWeighted average remaining term (in years) 5.2 12.6\nWeighted average discount rate 4.8 % 5.4 %\n(1)Included in the line \u201cAccrued expenses and other current liabilities\u201d in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nSupplemental balance sheet information related to leases at December 31, 2019, was as follows:\nOperating Leases Finance Leases Total Leases\n(in thousands, except lease term and discount rate)\nRight-of-use assets $ 67,700 $ 54,241 $ 121,941\nLease liabilities, current (1)\n$ 12,873 $ 3,254 $ 16,127\nLease liabilities, net of current portion 59,822 73,491 133,313\nTotal lease liabilities $ 72,695 $ 76,745 $ 149,440\nWeighted average remaining term (in years) 6.1 13.7\nWeighted average discount rate 4.8 % 5.4 %\n(1)Included in the line \u201cAccrued expenses and other current liabilities\u201d in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nSupplemental cash flow information related to leases for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, was as follows, in thousands:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2019\nCash payments for lease liabilities within operating activities:\nOperating leases $ 17,495 $ 14,890\nFinance leases $ 4,074 $ 4,221\nAt December 31, 2020, future maturities of lease liabilities due under these lease agreements were as follows for the years ending December 31, in thousands:\nOperating Leases Finance Leases Total Leases\n2021 $ 14,612 $ 7,183 $ 21,795\n2022 14,920 7,867 22,787\n2023 13,194 7,972 21,166\n2024 11,097 8,077 19,174\n2025 9,743 8,016 17,759\nThereafter 9,801 64,289 74,090\nTotal undiscounted lease payments 73,367 103,404 176,771\nPresent value adjustment (8,834) (28,930) (37,764)\nPresent value of lease payments $ 64,533 $ 74,474 $ 139,007\n8. Goodwill and Identified Intangible Assets\nChanges in the carrying amount of goodwill during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, were as follows, in thousands:\nBalance at January 1, 2019 $ 1,053,119\nGoodwill acquired 558,977\nMeasurement period and other adjustments (347)\nBalance at December 31, 2019 1,611,749\nGoodwill acquired 156,948\nMeasurement period and other adjustments 2,338\nBalance at December 31, 2020 $ 1,771,035\nWe completed our annual goodwill impairment test during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020. Based on the results of the qualitative analysis, we concluded that there was no impairment of goodwill. No impairment of goodwill was recognized during 2019 or 2018.\nIntangible assets consisted of the following at December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nDecember 31, 2020 December 31, 2019\nCarrying\nAmount Accumulated\nAmortization Net Carrying\nAmount Accumulated\nAmortization Net\n(in thousands)\nFinite-lived intangible assets:\nDeveloped technologies $ 302,254 $ (166,863) $ 135,391 $ 277,030 $ (125,537) $ 151,493\nClient relationships 372,438 (180,647) 191,791 341,438 (140,044) 201,394\nTrade names 27,407 (19,142) 8,265 25,557 (16,928) 8,629\nNon-compete agreements 5,273 (3,208) 2,065 5,273 (2,186) 3,087\nTotal finite-lived intangible assets 707,372 (369,860) 337,512 649,298 (284,695) 364,603\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets:\nTrade names 7,367 - 7,367 8,393 - 8,393\nTotal intangible assets $ 714,739 $ (369,860) $ 344,879 $ 657,691 $ (284,695) $ 372,996\nAmortization expense for finite-lived intangible assets totaled $85.2 million, $66.0 million, and $59.8 million during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.\nThe following table sets forth the estimated amortization of intangible assets for the years ending December 31, in thousands:\n2021 $ 80,714\n2022 $ 68,034\n2023 $ 59,645\n2024 $ 54,451\n2025 $ 21,173\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized an impairment charge of $1.0 million related to certain indefinite-lived trade names associated with a previous acquisition based on the excess of the carrying value of these assets over their estimated fair values. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded an impairment charge of $2.0 million related to certain developed technology and customer relationship intangible assets associated with our international operations based on the excess of the carrying value of these assets over their estimated fair values. Fair values were estimated using a standard valuation methodology (the income approach) incorporating management\u2019s assumptions on revenue growth rates and discount rates. There was no remaining carrying value for these intangible assets subsequent to the impairment charges in 2020 and 2019. The method utilized to estimate the fair value incorporated significant unobservable inputs, and we concluded that the measurement should be classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.\nThe impairment charges for the period ended December 31, 2020 are included in \u201cSales and marketing\u201d, and the impairment charges for the period ended 2019 are included in \u201cCost of revenue\u201d and \u201cSales and marketing\u201d in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n9. Debt\nOn September 5, 2019, we entered into a $1.2 billion Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the \u201cAmended Credit Facility\u201d) to amend and restate our previous credit facility, originally dated as of September 30, 2014 (as previously amended, the \u201c2014 Credit Facility\u201d). The Amended Credit Facility was entered into by and among the Company, the lenders from time to time party thereto (the \u201cLenders\u201d), and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent (the \u201cAgent\u201d).\nThe Amended Credit Facility extends the maturity date of the 2014 Credit Facility from February 27, 2022 to September 5, 2024 (subject to early maturity provisions in certain circumstances, as described below), reduces our borrowing costs, provides additional borrowing capacity, and increases covenant flexibility. The Amended Credit Facility provides for the following:\nRevolving Facility: The Amended Credit Facility provides $600.0 million in aggregate commitments for secured revolving loans, with sublimits of $10.0 million for the issuance of letters of credit and $20.0 million for swingline loans (\u201cRevolving Facility\u201d).\nInitial Term Loan: An initial term loan of $300.0 million was borrowed on the closing date for the Amended Credit Facility (the \u201cTerm Loan\u201d). The proceeds of the Term Loan were used to repay the term loan balances outstanding under the\n2014 Credit Facility.\nDelayed Draw Term Loan: In December 2019, we drew funds of $300.0 million available under the delayed draw term loan (\u201cDelayed Draw Term Loan\u201d).\nRevolving loans under the Amended Credit Facility may be voluntarily prepaid and re-borrowed. Principal payments on the Term Loan and Delayed Draw Term Loan (collectively, the \u201cTerm Loans\u201d) are due in quarterly installments equal to an initial amount of $3.8 million, which increased to $7.5 million on December 31, 2020, increases to $11.3 million beginning on December 31, 2022, and increases to $15.0 million beginning on December 31, 2023. Once repaid or prepaid, the Term Loans may not be re-borrowed. All outstanding principal and accrued but unpaid interest is due, and the commitments for the Revolving Facility terminate, on the maturity date. The Term Loans are subject to mandatory repayment requirements in the event of certain asset sales or if certain insurance or condemnation events occur, subject to customary reinvestment provisions. We may prepay the Term Loans in whole or in part at any time without premium or penalty.\nAccordion Feature: The Amended Credit Facility also allows us, subject to certain conditions, to request additional term loan commitments and/or additional revolving commitments in an aggregate principal amount of up to the greater of $250.0 million or 100% of consolidated EBITDA (as defined within the agreement) for the most recent four fiscal quarters, plus an amount that would not cause our Senior Leverage Ratio (as defined below) to exceed 3.50 to 1.00.\nAll outstanding revolving loans and term loans under the Amended Credit Facility mature on September 5, 2024. If on or prior to August 16, 2022, we have failed to demonstrate to the Agent that we would be in compliance with each financial covenant after giving pro forma effect to the repayment in full of the 2022 Convertible Notes which mature on November 15, 2022, then the Amended Credit Facility will mature on August 16, 2022. In addition, if on any business day during the period beginning on August 16, 2022 until the 2022 Convertible Notes are paid in full, our available liquidity is less than an amount equal to 125% of the outstanding principal amount of the 2022 Convertible Notes, then amounts outstanding under the Amended Credit Facility are due the next business day.\nAt our option, amounts outstanding under the Amended Credit Facility accrue interest at a per annum rate equal to either LIBOR, plus a margin ranging from 1.00% to 2.00%, or the Base Rate, plus a margin ranging from 0.00% to 1.00% (\u201cApplicable Margin\u201d). The base LIBOR is, at our discretion, equal to either one, three, or six month LIBOR. The Base Rate is defined as the greater of Wells Fargo's prime rate, the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.50%, or one month LIBOR plus 1.00%. In each case, the Applicable Margin is determined based upon our Net Leverage Ratio, as defined below. Accrued interest on amounts outstanding under the Amended Credit Facility is due and payable quarterly, in arrears, for loans bearing interest at the Base Rate and at the end of the applicable interest period in the case of loans bearing interest at the adjusted LIBOR. Unused commitments under the Revolving Facility are subject to a commitment fee to be paid in arrears on the last day of each fiscal quarter, ranging from 0.15% to 0.35% per annum determined based on our Net Leverage Ratio, as defined below.\nCertain of our existing and future material domestic subsidiaries are required to guarantee our obligations under the Amended Credit Facility, and the obligations under the Amended Credit Facility are secured by substantially all of our assets and the assets of the subsidiary guarantors. The Amended Credit Facility contains customary affirmative and negative covenants. The negative covenants limit our and our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, grant liens on our assets, make investments including acquisitions, dispose of assets, or pay dividends or distributions or repurchase our stock, subject in each case to customary exceptions and qualifications. Our covenants also include requirements that we comply with the following financial ratios:\nConsolidated Net Leverage Ratio: The Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio (\u201cNet Leverage Ratio\u201d), defined as a ratio of consolidated funded indebtedness less qualified cash and cash equivalents, each as defined in the Amended Credit Facility, on the last day of each fiscal quarter to the sum of the four previous consecutive fiscal quarters\u2019 consolidated EBITDA, as defined in the Amended Credit Facility, of no greater than 5.00 to 1.00 (or, at our election following certain material acquisitions, 5.50 to 1.00).\nConsolidated Interest Coverage Ratio: The Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio (\u201cInterest Coverage Ratio\u201d), defined as a ratio of the sum of the four previous fiscal quarters\u2019 consolidated EBITDA to our interest expense for the same period, excluding non-cash interest attributable to the Convertible Notes, as defined below, of no less than 3.00 to 1.00.\nConsolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio: The Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio (\u201cSenior Leverage Ratio\u201d), defined as a ratio of consolidated senior secured indebtedness less qualified cash and cash equivalents, each as defined in the Amended Credit Facility, on the last day of each fiscal quarter to the sum of the four previous consecutive fiscal quarters\u2019 consolidated EBITDA, of no greater than 3.75 to 1.00 (or, at our election following certain material acquisitions, 4.25 to 1.00).\nAs of December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with the covenants under our Amended Credit Facility.\nThe Amended Credit Facility contains customary events of default, subject to customary cure periods for certain defaults. In the event of a default, the obligations under the Amended Credit Facility could be accelerated, the applicable interest rate\ncould be increased, the loan commitments could be terminated, our subsidiary guarantors could be required to pay the obligations in full and our lenders would be permitted to exercise remedies with respect to all of the collateral that is securing the Amended Credit Facility. Any such default that is not cured or waived could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition.\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019 we had $600.0 million and $370.0 million, respectively, of available revolving credit under the credit facilities in effect at these dates. There were no outstanding revolving borrowings at December 31, 2020. Principal outstanding for the Revolving Facility was $230.0 million at December 31, 2019. We incur commitment fees on the unused portion of the Revolving Facility. The carrying value of the Revolving Facility approximates its fair value.\nUnamortized debt issuance costs for the revolving facilities in effect at December 31, 2020 and 2019 were $2.1 million and $2.7 million, respectively, and are included in the line \u201cOther assets\u201d in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nPrincipal outstanding and unamortized debt issuance costs for the term loans were as follows at December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nDecember 31, 2020 December 31, 2019\nTerm Loans\n(in thousands)\nPrincipal outstanding\n$ 577,500 $ 596,250\nUnamortized issuance costs\n(719) (942)\nUnamortized discount\n(951) (1,245)\nCarrying value\n$ 575,830 $ 594,063\nThe fair value of the term loans on December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $516.3 million and $582.7 million, respectively. The fair value was estimated by discounting future cash flows using prevailing market interest rates on debt with similar creditworthiness, terms, and maturities. We concluded that this fair value measurement should be categorized within Level 2.\nFuture maturities of principal under the Term Loans are as follows for the years ending December 31, in thousands:\nTerm Loans\n2021 $ 30,000\n2022 33,750\n2023 48,750\n2024 465,000\n$ 577,500\nConvertible Notes\n2025 Convertible Notes\nIn May 2020, we issued convertible senior notes in an aggregate principal amount of $345.0 million (including the underwriters\u2019 exercise in full of their over-allotment option of $45.0 million) which will mature on May 15, 2025 (the \u201c2025 Convertible Notes\u201d). The 2025 Convertible Notes were issued pursuant to an Indenture, dated May 22, 2020, by and between us and U.S. Bank National Association, as Trustee, as supplemented by the First Supplemental Indenture (as supplemented, the \u201cIndenture\u201d). We received net proceeds from the offering of approximately $337.5 million after adjusting for debt issuance costs, including the underwriting discount.\nThe 2025 Convertible Notes accrue interest at a rate of 1.50% per year until maturity, payable semi-annually in arrears on May 15 and November 15 of each year, beginning on November 15, 2020. On or after February 15, 2025, until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders may convert at their option all or any portion of their 2025 Convertible Notes at the then applicable conversation rate. The 2025 Convertible Notes are convertible at an initial rate of 13.04 shares of our common stock per $1,000 principal amount of 2025 Convertible Notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $76.70 per share of our common stock). The conversion rate is subject to customary adjustments for certain events as described in the Indenture. Upon conversion, we will pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock, at our election. Upon any conversion of the 2025 Convertible Notes, it is our current intent to settle the first $1,000 of conversion value for each $1,000 principal amount of the 2025 Convertible Notes through combination settlement, which involves repayment of the principal portion in cash and any excess of the conversion value over the principal amount in shares of our common stock. Based on our closing stock price of $87.24 on December 31, 2020, the if-converted value exceeded the aggregate principal amount of the 2025 Convertible Notes by $47.4 million.\nHolders may convert all or any portion of their 2025 Convertible Notes, at their option, prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding February 15, 2025 only under the following circumstances:\n\u2022during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending on September 30, 2020 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price of our common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price on each applicable trading day;\n\u2022during the five business day period after any five consecutive trading day period (the \u201cMeasurement Period\u201d) in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of the 2025 Convertible Notes for each trading day of the Measurement Period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sales price of our common stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day;\n\u2022if we call any or all of the 2025 Convertible Notes for redemption at any time prior to the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the redemption date; or\n\u2022upon the occurrence of specified corporate events, as described in the Indenture.\nOn or after May 20, 2023, we may redeem for cash, at our option, all or part of the 2025 Convertible Notes if the last reported sale price of our common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any 30 consecutive trading day period (including the last trading day of such period) ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which we provide notice of redemption, is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price on each applicable trading day. There is no sinking fund provided for the 2025 Convertible Notes.\nIn accounting for the issuance of the 2025 Convertible Notes, we separated the 2025 Convertible Notes into liability and equity components. We allocated $288.0 million of the 2025 Convertible Notes to the liability component, and $57.0 million to the equity component. The portion allocated to equity is presented in stockholders\u2019 equity net of $3.9 million of related deferred taxes and of allocated issuance cost as described below. The excess of the principal amount of the liability component over its carrying amount is amortized to interest expense over the term of the 2025 Convertible Notes using the effective interest method. The equity component will not be remeasured as long as it continues to meet the conditions for equity classification.\nWe incurred issuance costs of $7.5 million related to the 2025 Convertible Notes. Issuance costs were allocated to the liability and equity components based on their relative values. Issuance costs attributable to the liability component are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the 2025 Convertible Notes, and issuance costs attributable to the equity component are included along with the equity component in stockholders' equity.\n2022 Convertible Notes\nIn May 2017, we issued convertible senior notes with aggregate principal of $345.0 million (including the underwriters\u2019 exercise in full of their over-allotment option of $45.0 million) which mature on November 15, 2022 (the \u201c2022 Convertible Notes\u201d). The 2022 Convertible Notes were issued under an indenture dated May 23, 2017 (\u201cIndenture\u201d), by and between us and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as Trustee. We received net proceeds from the offering of approximately $304.2 million after adjusting for debt issuance costs, including the underwriting discount, the net cash used to purchase the Note Hedges and the proceeds from the issuance of the Warrants which are discussed below.\nThe 2022 Convertible Notes accrue interest at a rate of 1.50%, payable semi-annually on May 15 and November 15 of each year. On or after May 15, 2022, and until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders may convert their 2022 Convertible Notes at their option. The 2022 Convertible Notes are convertible at an initial rate of 23.84 shares per $1,000 of principal (equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $41.95 per share of our common stock). The conversion rate is subject to customary adjustments for certain events as described in the Indenture. Upon conversion, we will pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock, at our election. It is our current intent to settle conversions of the 2022 Convertible Notes through combination settlement, which involves repayment of the principal portion in cash and any excess of the conversion value over the principal amount in shares of our common stock. Based on our closing stock price of $87.24 on December 31, 2020, the if-converted value exceeded the aggregate principal amount of the 2022 Convertible Notes by $372.5 million.\nWe may not redeem the 2022 Convertible Notes prior to their maturity date, and no sinking fund is provided for them. Holders may convert their 2022 Convertible Notes, at their option, prior to May 15, 2022 only under the following circumstances:\n\u2022during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending on June 30, 2017 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price of our common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price on each applicable trading day;\n\u2022during the five business day period after any five consecutive trading day period (the \u201cMeasurement Period\u201d) in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of the Convertible Notes for each trading day of the Measurement Period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sales price of our common stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day; or\n\u2022upon the occurrence of specified corporate events, as defined in the Indenture.\nIn accounting for the issuance of the 2022 Convertible Notes, we separated the 2022 Convertible Notes into liability and equity components. We allocated $282.5 million of the Convertible Notes to the liability component, and $62.5 million to the equity component. The excess of the principal amount of the liability component over its carrying amount is amortized to interest expense over the term of the 2022 Convertible Notes using the effective interest method. The equity component will not be remeasured as long as it continues to meet the conditions for equity classification.\nWe incurred issuance costs of $9.8 million related to the 2022 Convertible Notes. Issuance costs were allocated to the liability and equity components based on their relative values. Issuance costs attributable to the liability component are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the 2022 Convertible Notes, and issuance costs attributable to the equity component are included along with the equity component in stockholders' equity.\nFor both the 2022 and 2025 Convertible Notes (collectively referred to as the \u201cConvertible Notes\u201d), if we undergo a fundamental change (as defined in the respective Indentures), subject to certain conditions, holders may require us to repurchase for cash all or any portion of their Convertible Notes. The fundamental change repurchase price is equal to 100% of the principal amount of the respective Convertible Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date. If holders elect to convert their Convertible Notes in connection with a make-whole fundamental change, as described in the Indentures, we will, to the extent provided in the Indentures, increase the conversion rate applicable to the Convertible Notes.\nThe Convertible Notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank senior in right of payment to any of our indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Convertible Notes and equal in right of payment to any of our existing and future unsecured indebtedness that is not subordinated. The Convertible Notes are effectively junior in right of payment to any of our secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of assets securing such indebtedness and structurally junior to all existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities, including trade payables, of our subsidiaries. The Indentures do not limit the amount of debt that we or our subsidiaries may incur. The Convertible Notes are not guaranteed by any of our subsidiaries.\nThe Indentures do not contain any financial or operating covenants or restrictions on the payment of dividends, the incurrence of indebtedness, or the issuance or repurchase of securities by us or any of our subsidiaries. The Indentures contain customary events of default with respect to the Convertible Notes and provide that upon certain events of default occurring and continuing, the Trustee may, and the Trustee at the request of holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the Convertible Notes shall, declare all of principal and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, of the Convertible Notes to be due and payable. In case of certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization involving us or a significant subsidiary, all of the principal of and accrued and unpaid interest on the Convertible Notes will automatically become due and payable.\nThe net carrying amounts of the Convertible Notes at December 31, 2020 and 2019, were as follows:\nDecember 31, 2020 December 31, 2019\n2022 Convertible Notes 2025 Convertible Notes 2022 Convertible Notes\n(in thousands)\nLiability component:\nPrincipal amount $ 344,995 $ 345,000 $ 344,995\nUnamortized discount (23,680) (51,110) (35,287)\nUnamortized debt issuance costs (3,034) (5,607) (4,520)\nConvertible notes, net $ 318,281 $ 288,283 $ 305,188\nEquity component, net of issuance costs and deferred tax: $ 61,390 $ 51,821 $ 61,390\nThe estimated fair values of the 2022 and 2025 Convertible Notes at December 31, 2020 were $723.9 million and $443.7 million, respectively. The estimated fair value of the 2022 Convertible Notes at December 31, 2019 was $486.7 million. The estimated fair values are based on quoted market prices as of the last trading day of the year; however, the Convertible Notes have only a limited trading volume and as such this fair value estimate is not necessarily the value at which the Convertible Notes could be retired or transferred. We concluded this measurement should be classified within Level 2.\nThe following table sets forth total interest expense related to the Convertible Notes for the year ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2019 2018\n(in thousands)\nContractual interest expense $ 8,339 $ 5,175 $ 5,175\nAmortization of debt discount 17,497 10,948 10,322\nAmortization of debt issuance costs 2,170 1,402 1,322\nTotal interest expense $ 28,006 $ 17,525 $ 16,819\nThe effective interest rate of the liability component for each of the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 was 5.87% for the 2022 Convertible Notes. The effective interest rate of the liability component for the year ended December 31, 2020 was 5.74% for the 2025 Convertible Notes.\nConvertible Note Hedges and Warrants\nOn May 22, 2020, we entered into privately negotiated option contracts to purchase hedge instruments (the \u201cCapped Calls\u201d) initially covering approximately 4.5 million shares of our common stock at a cost of $39.4 million. The Capped Calls are subject to anti-dilution provisions substantially similar to those of the 2025 Convertible Notes, have a strike price of approximately $76.70 per share, are subject to a cap price of $118.00 per share, are exercisable by us upon any conversion under the 2025 Convertible Notes, and expire on May 15, 2025. The Capped Calls are transactions that are separate from the terms of the 2025 Convertible Notes, and holders of the 2025 Convertible Notes have no rights with respect to the Capped Calls.\nOn May 23, 2017, we entered into privately negotiated transactions to purchase hedge instruments (\u201cNote Hedges\u201d), covering approximately 8.2 million shares of our common stock at a cost of $62.5 million. The Note Hedges are subject to anti-dilution provisions substantially similar to those of the Convertible Notes, have a strike price of approximately $41.95 per share, are exercisable by us upon any conversion under the Convertible Notes, and expire on November 15, 2022.\nThe Capped Calls and Note Hedges (collectively referred to as the \u201cNote Hedge Instruments\u201d) are generally expected to reduce the potential dilution to our common stock (or, in the event the conversion is settled in cash, to reduce our cash payment obligation) in the event that at the time of conversion our stock price exceeds the conversion price under our previously issued Convertible Notes. The costs of the Note Hedge Instruments are expected to be tax deductible as original issue discounts over the lives of the respective convertible notes, as the Note Hedge Instruments represent integrated debt instruments for tax purposes. As the Note Hedge Instruments meet certain accounting criteria, they are recorded in stockholders\u2019 equity as a reduction of additional paid-in-capital and are not accounted for as derivatives. The fair values of the Note Hedge Instruments are not remeasured each reporting period.\nOn May 23, 2017, we also sold warrants for the purchase of up to 8.2 million shares of our common stock for aggregate proceeds of $31.5 million (\u201cWarrants\u201d). The Warrants have a strike price of $57.58 per share and are subject to customary anti-dilution provisions. The Warrants will expire in ratable portions on a series of expiration dates commencing on February 15, 2023. The proceeds from the issuance of the Warrants were recorded as an increase to our additional paid-in capital in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe Note Hedges are transactions that are separate from the terms of the 2022 Convertible Notes and the Warrants, and holders of the 2022 Convertible Notes and the Warrants have no rights with respect to the Note Hedges. The Warrants are similarly separate in both terms and rights from the Note Hedges and the 2022 Convertible Notes.\n10. Stock-based Expense and Employee Benefits\nOn June 3, 2020, our stockholders approved the 2020 Equity Incentive Plan (\u201c2020 Plan\u201d). The 2020 Plan provides for the grant of incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights, performance units and performance shares. The 2020 Plan replaced our 2010 Equity Incentive Plan (the \u201c2010 Plan\u201d), which previously replaced our Amended and Restated 1998 Stock Incentive Plan. No further awards will be made under the 2010 Plan after the effective date of the 2020 Plan. Additionally, any awards that expire or are forfeited under the 2010 Plan will become available for issuance under the 2020 Plan.\nWe also grant awards to our directors which are generally in the form of restricted stock. The awards granted to directors generally vest ratably over a period of four quarters; however, should a director leave the board, we have the right to repurchase shares as if the awards vested on a pro rata basis.\nOur board of directors periodically approves increases to the number of shares of common stock reserved for issuance under the 2020 Plan. At December 31, 2020 there were 9.5 million remaining shares of our common stock reserved for awards under the 2020 Plan. The 2020 Plan permits the exercise of stock options and grants of restricted stock to be fulfilled through the issuance of previously authorized but unissued common stock shares, or the reissuance of shares held in treasury. We use both unissued common stock shares and treasury shares when stock options are exercised or restricted stock is granted.\nThe following table represents a consolidated summary of our stock-based plan activity:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2019 2018\n(in thousands)\nTotal compensation expense recognized $ 59,274 $ 62,563 $ 50,641\nCash proceeds related to stock-based expense transactions $ 14,575 $ 5,833 $ 13,163\nAggregate grant-date fair value of shares and stock options that vested during the year $ 66,896 $ 49,229 $ 49,711\nTotal unrecognized compensation expense related to our stock-based expense plans, including our contingent share awards, was $83.3 million at December 31, 2020, and is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.0 years.\nStock Option Awards\nStock options granted generally vested ratably over a period of twelve quarters. Expense was recognized over the requisite service period in a manner that reflected the vesting of the related awards. Awards under the plan generally expire ten years from the date of the grant. All outstanding options were granted at exercise prices equal to or exceeding our estimate of the fair market value of our common stock at the date of grant.\nThe following table summarizes stock option transactions under our Stock Incentive Plan and Equity Incentive Plan:\nNumber of Shares Range of\nExercise Prices Weighted Average\nExercise Price\nBalance as of January 1, 2018 2,200,465 $ 4.28 - $ 29.50 $ 19.26\nExercised (658,564) 4.92 - 29.50 20.00\nForfeited/cancelled (11,329) 15.19 - 25.70 18.85\nExpired (2,250) 7.00 - 7.00 7.00\nBalance at December 31, 2018 1,528,322 4.28 - 29.50 18.96\nExercised (305,030) 4.28 - 29.50 19.12\nForfeited/cancelled (725) 18.79 - 20.34 19.79\nOther 2,585 17.67 - 27.18 22.59\nBalance at December 31, 2019 1,225,152 7.50 - 29.50 18.94\nExercised (796,750) 7.50 - 29.50 18.29\nForfeited/cancelled (3,342) 17.75 - 21.54 19.57\nExpired (600) 27.18 - 27.18 27.18\nOther (4,750) 9.00 - 24.03 15.02\nBalance at December 31, 2020 419,710 $ 15.19 - $ 29.50 $ 20.23\nThe below table provides information regarding outstanding stock options which were fully vested and exercisable at December 31:\n2020 2019\nOptions Fully Vested & Exercisable Options Fully Vested & Exercisable\nNumber of options 419,710 1,225,152\nWeighted-average remaining contractual term (in years) 3.3 3.1\nWeighted-average exercise price $ 20.23 $ 18.94\nAggregate intrinsic value, in thousands $ 28,124 $ 42,650\nThe aggregate intrinsic value of options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, was $40.9 million, $12.3 million, and $23.0 million, respectively. There were no stock options awarded during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018.\nRestricted Stock Awards\nRestricted stock awards entitle the holder to receive shares of our common stock as the award vests. Grants of restricted stock are classified as time-based, market-based, or performance-based depending on the vesting criteria of the award.\nTime-based restricted stock awards:\nTime-based awards granted generally vest ratably over a period of twelve quarters with the first vesting on the first day of the second calendar quarter immediately following the grant date. The fair value of time-based restricted stock awards is based on the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant. Compensation expense for time-based restricted stock awards is recognized over the vesting period on a straight-line basis.\nA summary of time-based restricted stock award activity is presented in the table below.\nNumber of\nShares Weighted\nAverage Grant-Date Fair Value\nNon-vested shares at January 1, 2018 1,755,988 $ 30.05\nGranted 1,289,866 53.26\nVested (1,017,367) 31.92\nForfeited/cancelled (242,675) 40.70\nNon-vested shares at December 31, 2018 1,785,812 44.34\nGranted 880,594 60.37\nVested (1,036,973) 42.22\nForfeited/cancelled (261,416) 52.53\nNon-vested shares at December 31, 2019 1,368,017 54.70\nGranted 1,126,377 61.73\nVested (924,214) 53.75\nForfeited/cancelled (299,261) 57.91\nNon-vested shares at December 31, 2020 1,270,919 $ 60.84\nMarket-based restricted stock awards:\nMarket-based restricted stock awards become eligible for vesting upon the achievement of specific market-based conditions based on the per share price of our common stock. Shares that become eligible to vest, if any, become Eligible Shares. Eligible Shares generally vest ratably over a period of four quarters, with the first vesting on the first day of the quarter immediately after becoming Eligible Shares. Vesting is conditional upon the recipient remaining a service provider to us, as defined in the plan document, through each applicable vesting date.\nA summary of market-based restricted stock award activity is presented in the table below.\nNumber of\nShares Weighted\nAverage Grant-Date Fair Value\nBalance as of January 1, 2018 690,165 $ 22.76\nGranted 517,364 35.66\nVested (677,857) 23.02\nBalance at December 31, 2018 529,672 35.03\nGranted 489,948 38.24\nVested (144,455) 33.37\nForfeited/cancelled (36,703) 35.66\nBalance at December 31, 2019 838,462 37.17\nGranted 461,948 30.65\nVested (421,576) 35.06\nForfeited/cancelled (226,912) 35.89\nBalance at December 31, 2020 651,922 $ 34.36\nWe estimate the fair value of market-based restricted stock awards using a discrete model to analyze the fair value of the subject shares. The discrete model utilizes multiple stock price-paths, through the use of a Monte Carlo simulation, which are then analyzed to determine the fair value of the subject shares. The weighted average of assumptions used to value awards granted during 2020, 2019, and 2018 were as follows:\n2020 2019 2018\nRisk-free interest rate 0.7 % 2.5 % 2.5 %\nExpected volatility 33.0 % 29.6 % 31.2 %\nRisk-free interest rate. We estimate the risk-free rate from the U.S. Treasury strip note yield curve for the period corresponding to the expiration date of the grant as of the valuation date.\nExpected volatility. We estimate expected volatility based on our historic and implied volatility rate.\nExpense related to the market-based restricted stock awards is recognized over the requisite service period using the graded-vesting attribution method. The requisite service period is a measure of the expected time to achieve the specified market condition plus the time-based vesting period. The expected time to achieve the market condition is estimated utilizing a Monte Carlo simulation, considering only those stock price-paths in which the market condition is achieved. The estimated requisite service period for market-based restricted stock shares issued in 2020 ranged from three to twelve quarters. Market-based restricted stock awards granted in 2019 had requisite service periods ranging from two to twelve quarters.\nContingent share awards:\nCertain of our acquisitions include contingent share award agreements for obligations denominated in fixed dollar amounts, subject to the achievement of performance criteria for periods ranging from 2021 through 2024 and continued post-acquisition employment services. As of December 31, 2020, the estimated intrinsic value of these awards was $18.2 million. The number of contingently issuable restricted shares that may be granted in the future will be based on the satisfaction of the underlying performance criteria and our share price on the date of satisfaction. These awards typically vest over four quarters beginning the first quarter subsequent to the satisfaction of the performance criteria, or cliff vest at the end of the performance criteria measurement periods. These awards are accounted for under the liability method. We reassess the likelihood of the performance criteria being met at each reporting date based on our expectations of future operating results and adjust the total compensation expense to be recognized over the expected vesting period. A fair value liability is recognized as compensation expense is recorded and is included within \u201cAccrued expenses and other current liabilities\u201d and \u201cOther long-term liabilities\u201d within our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Upon the issuance of these restricted shares the fair value liability will be reclassified to additional paid-in capital.\nFor the periods ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the total compensation expense recognized for these liability awards was $4.9 million and $2.2 million, respectively. Total unrecognized compensation expense for these awards was $11.9 million at December 31, 2020, and is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.3 years. Compensation expense for these contingent share award agreements prior to 2019 was de minimis.\nModification of restricted stock awards:\nSubsequent to the approval by our Board of Directors of the Merger Agreement, we modified the terms of certain market and time-based restricted stock awards for nine executives. These modifications accelerated all or portions of certain unvested restricted stock awards that had previously been granted between 2018 and 2020 (approximately 430,000 shares). In the event any of the executives are terminated by the Company for cause or by the executive without good reason prior to the completion of the acquisition by Thoma Bravo, any portion of these accelerated shares that would not have otherwise vested under the original terms of the awards must be returned or repaid to the Company, net of applicable withholding taxes. These modifications were accounted for as equity award modifications under ASC Topic 718, resulting in incremental stock-based expense of $1.1 million based on the fair value of the modified awards. Because these awards may be required to be returned or repaid, total expense will continue to be recognized based on the original vesting terms of the awards. However, because shares that were withheld for taxes are no longer subject to the repayment requirements outlined above, we accelerated the relative proportion of unrecognized compensation expense, approximately $2.2 million, for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nEmployee Benefit Plans\nIn 1998, our board of directors approved a defined contribution plan that provides retirement benefits under the provisions of Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Our 401(k) Plan (\u201cPlan\u201d) covers substantially all U.S. employees who meet a minimum service requirement. Contributions of $6.2 million, $4.5 million, and $4.2 million were made by us under the Plan for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.\n11. Commitments and Contingencies\nGuarantor Arrangements\nWe have agreements whereby we indemnify our officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is or was serving at our request in such capacity. The term of the indemnification period is for the officer or director\u2019s lifetime. The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited; however, we have a director and officer insurance policy that limits our exposure and enables us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid. As a result of our insurance policy coverage, we believe the estimated fair value of these indemnification agreements is minimal. Accordingly, we had no liabilities recorded for these agreements as of December 31, 2020 or 2019.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we include standard indemnification provisions in our agreements with clients. Pursuant to these provisions, we indemnify our clients for losses suffered or incurred in connection with third-party claims that our products infringed upon any U.S. patent, copyright, trademark, or other intellectual property right. Where applicable, we generally limit such infringement indemnities to those claims directed solely to our products and not in combination with other software or products. With respect to our products, we also generally reserve the right to resolve any such claims by designing a non-infringing alternative, by obtaining a license on reasonable terms, or by terminating our relationship with the client and refunding the client\u2019s fees.\nThe potential amount of future payments to defend lawsuits or settle indemnified claims under these indemnification provisions is unlimited in certain agreements; however, we believe the estimated fair value of these indemnification provisions is minimal, and, accordingly, we had no liabilities recorded for these agreements as of December 31, 2020 or 2019.\nLitigation\nFrom time to time, in the normal course of our business, we are a party to litigation matters and claims, including purported class action lawsuits and other complex litigation matters. Such matters can be expensive and disruptive to our normal business operations. Moreover, the results of such proceedings are difficult to predict, and our view of these matters may change in the future as the litigation and events related thereto unfold. We expense legal fees as incurred. Insurance recoveries associated with legal costs incurred are recorded when they are deemed probable of recovery.\nAt December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had accrued amounts for estimated settlement losses related to certain legal matters. We do not believe there is a reasonable possibility that a material loss exceeding amounts already recognized may have been incurred as of the date of the balance sheets presented herein. We are involved in other litigation matters, including purported class action lawsuits, that are not likely to be material either individually or in the aggregate based on information available at this time.\nOther Matters\nDuring May 2018, we were the subject of a targeted email phishing campaign that led to a business email compromise, pursuant to which an unauthorized party gained access to an external third party system used by a subsidiary that we acquired in 2017. The incident resulted in the diversion of approximately $6.0 million, net of recovered funds, intended for disbursement to three clients. We immediately restored all funds to the client accounts.\nWe maintain insurance coverage to limit our losses related to criminal and network security events. During January 2019, we received approximately $1.0 million from our primary insurance carrier as a partial repayment toward our losses from the business email compromise. We intend to vigorously pursue repayment of the remaining losses under such insurance coverage. Due to the uncertainty regarding timing and full collectability of the loss, we recorded an allowance of $5.0 million for the remaining amount of the loss during 2018. We also incurred an additional $0.4 million in related expenses. These charges are included in the line \u201cGeneral and administrative\u201d in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nSubsequent to the year ended December 31, 2020, we received $2.9 million in recovered funds from the U.S. Secret Service. We will recognize a gain of $2.9 million for the period ended March 31, 2021 related to these recovered funds.\n12. Net Income per Share\nBasic net income per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per share is computed by using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding, after giving effect to all potential dilutive common shares outstanding during the period. Included within diluted net income per share is the dilutive effect of outstanding stock options and restricted stock using the treasury stock method. Weighted average shares from common share equivalents in the amount of approximately 213,000, 149,000, and 286,000 were excluded from the dilutive shares outstanding because their effect was anti-dilutive for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.\nFor purposes of considering the Convertible Notes in determining diluted net income per share, it is our current intent to settle conversions of the Convertible Notes through combination settlement, which involves repayment of the principal portion in cash and any excess of the conversion value over the principal amount (the \u201cconversion premium\u201d) in shares of our common stock. Therefore, only the impact of the conversion premium is included in total dilutive weighted average shares outstanding using the treasury stock method. The dilutive effects of the conversion premium are shown in the table below.\nThe Warrants sold in connection with the issuance of the 2022 Convertible Notes are considered to be dilutive when the average price of our common stock during the period exceeds the Warrants\u2019 strike price of $57.58 per share. The effect of the additional shares that may be issued upon exercise of the Warrants is included in total dilutive weighted average shares outstanding using the treasury stock method and, to the extent dilutive, is shown in the table below. The Note Hedge Instruments purchased in connection with the issuance of the Convertible Notes are considered to be anti-dilutive and therefore do not impact our calculation of diluted net income per share. Refer to Note 9 for further discussion regarding the Convertible Notes.\nWe exclude common shares subject to a holdback pursuant to business combinations from the calculation of basic weighted average shares outstanding where the release of such shares is contingent upon an event not solely subject to the passage of time. During 2020, approximately 150,000 previously contingently returnable shares were issued upon settlement of sellers\u2019 indemnification obligations and included in basic weighted average shares outstanding. As of December 31, 2020, there were no remaining contingently returnable shares outstanding. As of December 31, 2019, there were approximately 163,000 contingently returnable shares related to certain acquisitions which were excluded from the computation of basic net income per share as these shares were subject to sellers\u2019 indemnification obligations and are subject to a holdback. There were no contingently returnable shares as of December 31, 2018. Dilutive common shares outstanding include the weighted average contingently returnable shares discussed above that are subject to a holdback, and any contingently returnable shares prior to their release each period.\nCertain of our performance-based restricted stock awards are considered contingently issuable shares and are excluded from the diluted weighted average shares outstanding computation because the related performance-based criteria were not achieved as of the end of the reporting period.\nThe following table presents the calculation of basic and diluted net income per share attributable to common stockholders:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2019 2018\n(in thousands, except per share amounts)\nNumerator:\nNet income $ 46,314 $ 58,208 $ 34,725\nDenominator:\nBasic:\nWeighted average shares used in computing basic net income per share: 96,841 92,017 87,290\nDiluted:\nAdd weighted average effect of dilutive securities:\nStock options and restricted stock 1,253 1,368 2,032\nConvertible Notes and Warrants 3,205 2,675 1,948\nContingently issuable or returnable shares in connection with our acquisitions 66 222 261\nWeighted average shares used in computing diluted net income per share: 101,365 96,282 91,531\nNet income per share:\nBasic $ 0.48 $ 0.63 $ 0.40\nDiluted $ 0.46 $ 0.60 $ 0.38\n13. Income Taxes\nThe domestic and foreign components of income before income taxes were as follows:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2019 2018\n(in thousands)\nDomestic $ 48,308 $ 60,024 $ 32,190\nForeign 2,999 534 2,110\nTotal $ 51,307 $ 60,558 $ 34,300\nOur income tax expense (benefit) consisted of the following components:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2019 2018\n(in thousands)\nCurrent:\nFederal $ - $ (1,769) $ 666\nState 517 478 295\nForeign 1,033 1,536 738\nTotal current income tax expense 1,550 245 1,699\nDeferred:\nFederal 3,186 3,284 (1,543)\nState (386) 366 (255)\nForeign 643 (1,545) (326)\nTotal deferred income tax expense (benefit) 3,443 2,105 (2,124)\nTotal income tax expense (benefit) $ 4,993 $ 2,350 $ (425)\nThe reconciliation of our income tax expense computed at the U.S. federal statutory tax rate to the actual income tax expense is as follows:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2019 2018\n(in thousands)\nExpense derived by applying the Federal income tax rate to income before income taxes $ 10,774 $ 12,717 $ 7,203\nState income tax, net of federal benefit 110 728 (204)\nForeign income tax (217) 63 26\nChange in valuation allowance 1,163 (91) 734\nNondeductible officer compensation 6,473 1,329 1,092\nOther nondeductible expenses 1,849 1,095 1,095\nStock-based expense (11,919) (2,142) (11,788)\nResearch and development credit (2,427) (10,765) -\nBase erosion and anti-abuse tax - (1,117) 1,117\nOther (813) 533 300\nTotal income tax expense (benefit) $ 4,993 $ 2,350 $ (425)\nOur effective tax rate of 9.7% for the year ended December 31, 2020 was higher than our effective tax rate of 3.9% for the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to lower benefits recognized in 2020 from federal and state research and development credits and increased expense for covered officers under Internal Revenue Code (\u201cIRC\u201d) Section 162(m), partially offset by higher windfall benefits for stock compensation.\nOur effective tax rate of 3.9% for the year ended December 31, 2019 was higher than our effective tax rate of (1.2)% for the year ended December 31, 2018 primarily due to lower excess tax benefits realized from stock-based compensation offset in part by benefits from federal and state research and development credits from a study conducted during the quarter ended\nDecember 31, 2019 for tax years 2013 through 2018 and the reversal of estimated base erosion and anti-avoidance tax (\u201cBEAT\u201d) accrued during 2018 pursuant to the 2017 U.S. tax reform commonly known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\u201cTCJA\u201d). During the quarter ended June 30, 2019, we completed a review of certain U.S. tax reform elements primarily related to BEAT and verified the existence of required information to confirm our eligibility for certain exceptions allowed under the BEAT provisions. As a result, we determined that we no longer had liability related to the BEAT as clarified in additional guidance from proposed regulations issued on December 13, 2018 and finalized on December 6, 2019.\nUnder the TCJA, we are also subject to current tax on Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (\u201cGILTI\u201d) earned by foreign subsidiaries. The FASB Staff Q&A Topic No. 5, Accounting for Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income, states that an entity can make an accounting policy election either to recognize deferred taxes for temporary differences that are expected to reverse as GILTI in future years or provide for the tax expense related to GILTI resulting from those items in the year the tax is incurred. It is our policy to recognize GILTI as a period expense in the period the tax is incurred.\nThe components of deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows:\nDecember 31,\n2020 2019\n(in thousands)\nDeferred tax assets:\nReserves, deferred revenue and accrued liabilities $ 16,145 $ 8,015\nStock-based expense 6,902 8,635\nLease liabilities 28,760 31,686\nNet operating loss carryforwards and tax credits 73,594 69,043\nDeferred tax assets before valuation allowance 125,401 117,379\nValuation allowance (2,467) (1,233)\nTotal deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance 122,934 116,146\nDeferred tax liabilities:\nProperty, equipment, and software (20,081) (16,270)\nRight-of-use assets (22,522) (25,412)\nIntangible assets (45,883) (30,914)\nOther (14,856) (12,091)\nTotal deferred tax liabilities (103,342) (84,687)\nNet deferred tax assets(1)\n$ 19,592 $ 31,459\n(1) Includes net deferred tax assets and liabilities from the acquisitions of Modern Message, Stratis, Chirp, and WhiteSky discussed in Note 3.\nWe recognize valuation allowances on deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We had valuation allowances against certain deferred tax assets of $2.5 million and $1.2 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. In 2020, we recognized an additional valuation allowance of $1.2 million against net operating losses in a UK subsidiary which we do not expect to realize against future taxable income.\nAs of December 31, 2020, our federal, state, and international net operating loss (\u201cNOL\u201d) carryforwards are $246.9 million, $88.6 million, and $8.7 million, respectively. These carryforwards, combined with federal, state and international tax credits of $15.0 million, comprise a major component of our deferred tax assets. If not used, the underlying federal NOLs will begin to expire in 2026. The state NOLs will begin to expire in 2021, with approximately $1.5 million expiring in the next five years. If not used, $0.1 million of our tax credits will expire in 2026, and the remaining credits will begin to expire in 2034. Approximately $0.7 million of our tax credits will be fully realizable by 2021. Our NOL carryforward balance partially consists of $66.7 million subject to Section 382 limitations, as these balances were generated by subsidiaries prior to our acquiring them as part of current and previous stock acquisitions. If unused, these NOLs begin to expire in 2026.\nWe consider our investments in our foreign subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested. As of December 31, 2020, we have no basis differences that would result in material unrecognized deferred tax liabilities.\nOur subsidiary in Hyderabad, India benefits from a tax holiday under the Special Economic Zone program. This benefit was initially granted on July 8, 2013 and applies to a portion of our operations in this location. The benefit was reduced from a 100% tax holiday to a 50% tax holiday in April 2018 and is set to expire in April 2023. During 2020, the Company expanded operations and was granted a new tax holiday. The benefit related to the new holiday provides a 100% tax holiday through 2025\nand a 50% tax holiday through 2030. We realized tax savings from these holidays of $0.3 million, $0.4 million, and $0.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.\nOur subsidiary in Manila, Philippines benefits from income tax holidays pursuant to registration with the Philippine Economic Zone Authority (\u201cPEZA\u201d). Tax savings realized under the Philippine tax holidays were $0.3 million, $0.1 million, and $0.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. The income tax holidays are set to expire in June 2021 and May 2022.\nUncertain Tax Positions\nAt December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had no unrecognized tax benefits. Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized income tax benefits in income tax expense, and as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, there were no accrued interest and penalties.\nWe file consolidated and separate tax returns in the U.S. and seven foreign jurisdictions. We are no longer subject to U.S. federal income tax examinations for years before 2017 and are no longer subject to state and local income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2016; however, net operating losses from all years continue to be subject to examinations and adjustments for at least three years following the year in which the attributes are used.\nOur subsidiary, RealPage India Private Limited (\u201cRealPage India\u201d), is currently undergoing an income tax examination for the fiscal years beginning April 1, 2011, April 1, 2012, and April 1, 2013. We determined that resolution of the RealPage India audit would best be accomplished through the US-India tax treaty\u2019s article known as Mutual Agreement Procedures (\u201cMAP\u201d) with the competent authorities from both the US and India. We expect resolution for the previous years\u2019 examinations as well as the go-forward mark-up sometime in late 2021.\n14. Fair Value Measurements\nAssets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis:\nInterest rate swap agreements: The fair value of our interest rate derivatives is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of the derivatives. This analysis reflects the contractual terms of the derivatives, including the period to maturity, and uses observable market-based inputs, including interest rate curves. We incorporate credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both our own nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty\u2019s nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements.\nAlthough the credit valuation adjustments associated with our derivatives utilize Level 3 inputs, such as estimates of current credit spreads, we have determined that the majority of the inputs used to value our derivatives fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. We have assessed the significance of the impact of the credit valuation adjustments on the overall valuation of our derivative positions and determined that the credit valuation adjustments are not significant to the overall valuation of our interest rate swaps. As a result, we determined that our interest rate swap valuation in its entirety is classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.\nForeign currency forward contracts: We enter into foreign exchange currency contracts to hedge fluctuations associated with foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, and the future payment of operating expenses by certain of our non-U.S. subsidiaries. The fair values of our foreign exchange currency contracts are based on quoted foreign exchange forward rates at the reporting date and are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.\nContingent consideration obligations: The fair value of our contingent consideration obligations includes inputs not observable in the market and thus represent Level 3 measurements. The amount to be paid under these obligations is contingent upon the achievement of stipulated operational or financial targets by the business subsequent to acquisition. The fair values of our contingent consideration obligations are estimated using probability weighted discount models which consider the achievement of the conditions upon which the contingent obligations are dependent. The probability of achieving the specified conditions is generally assessed by applying Monte Carlo weighted-average models. Inputs into the valuation model include a discount rate specific to the acquired entity, a measure of the estimate volatility, and a risk of target metric rate, which for the period ended December 31, 2020 were 2.6%, 32.8%, and 11.8%, respectively. These estimates are generally sensitive to changes in these projections. We develop the projected future operating results based on an analysis of historical results, market conditions, and the expected impact of anticipated changes in our overall business and/or product strategies.\nThe following tables disclose the assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, by the fair value hierarchy levels as described above:\nFair Value at December 31, 2020\nTotal Level 1 Level 2 Level 3\n(in thousands)\nAssets:\nForeign currency forward contracts (1)\n$ 581 $ - $ 581 $ -\nTotal assets measured at fair value $ 581 $ - $ 581 $ -\nLiabilities:\nInterest rate swap agreements $ 6,008 $ - $ 6,008 $ -\nForeign currency forward contracts 1 - 1 -\nContingent consideration liabilities 4,328 - - 4,328\nTotal liabilities measured at fair value $ 10,337 $ - $ 6,009 $ 4,328\n(1) The fair value of foreign currency forward contracts include those designated as cash flow hedge instruments and those designated as balance sheet hedge instruments.\nFair Value at December 31, 2019\nTotal Level 1 Level 2 Level 3\n(in thousands)\nAssets:\nForeign currency forward contracts (2)\n$ 237 $ - $ 237 $ -\nTotal assets measured at fair value $ 237 $ - $ 237 $ -\nLiabilities:\nInterest rate swap agreements $ 2,193 $ - $ 2,193 $ -\nForeign currency forward contracts 14 - 14 -\nContingent consideration liabilities 6,536 - - 6,536\nTotal liabilities measured at fair value $ 8,743 $ - $ 2,207 $ 6,536\n(2) The fair value of foreign currency forward contracts include those designated as cash flow hedge instruments and those designated as balance sheet hedge instruments.\nThe maximum remaining potential payments related to our contingent consideration liabilities are $35.3 million as of December 31, 2020.\nChanges in the fair value of Level 3 measurements for the reporting periods were as follows during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nDecember 31,\n2020 2019\n(in thousands)\nBalance at beginning of period $ 6,536 $ 6,000\nInitial contingent consideration fair value 4,300 6,700\nSettlements through cash payments - (5,963)\nNet change in fair value (6,508) (201)\nBalance at end of period $ 4,328 $ 6,536\nGains and losses resulting from changes in the fair value of the above liabilities are included in \u201cGeneral and administrative\u201d expense in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nAssets and liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis:\nIn August 2016, we acquired a $3.0 million noncontrolling interest in an unrelated company that specializes in the aggregation of commercial lease data. We have elected the measurement alternative for our equity investment, whereby we measure the investment at cost, less any impairment, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for an identical or similar investment of the same issuer. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded a gain of $2.6 million based on an observable price change, which is reflected in the line \u201cInterest expense and other, net\u201d in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. The factors considered in the remeasurement included the price at which the investee issued equity instruments similar to those of our investment and the rights and preferences of those equity instruments compared to ours. We concluded that this fair value measurement should be categorized within Level 2.\nWe invested an additional $1.8 million in our investment during the year ended December 31, 2019. The carrying value of this investment at December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $7.4 million, and is included in \u201cOther assets\u201d in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nRefer to Note 8 for further information about assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis at December 31, 2020 and 2019. There were no liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis at December 31, 2020 and 2019.\n15. Stockholders\u2019 Equity\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)\nChanges in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) by component for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 were as follows:\nUnrealized Gain (Loss) on Derivative Instruments, Net of Tax Foreign Currency Translation Adjustments Total\n(in thousands)\nBalance as of January 1, 2018 $ 776 $ (533) $ 243\nOther comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications 61 (183) (122)\nAmounts reclassified to income (613) - (613)\nNet other comprehensive income (loss) (552) (183) (735)\nBalance as of December 31, 2018 224 (716) (492)\nCumulative effect of adopting ASU 2017-12 25 - 25\nOther comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications (1,233) (171) (1,404)\nAmounts reclassified to income (477) - (477)\nNet other comprehensive income (loss) (1,710) (171) (1,881)\nBalance as of December 31, 2019 (1,461) (887) (2,348)\nOther comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications (3,380) 175 (3,205)\nAmounts reclassified to income 1,150 - 1,150\nNet other comprehensive income (loss) (2,230) 175 (2,055)\nBalance as of December 31, 2020 $ (3,691) $ (712) $ (4,403)\nStock Repurchase Program\nIn October 2018, our board of directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing the repurchase of up to $100.0 million of our outstanding common stock. The share repurchase program expired on October 25, 2019. In November 2019, our board of directors approved a new share repurchase program authorizing the repurchase of up to $100.0 million of our outstanding common stock. In October 2020, our board of directors approved a one year extension of this program authorizing the repurchase of up to $100.0 million of our outstanding common stock through November 7, 2021.\nShares repurchased under the stock repurchase program are retired. Repurchase activity during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was as follows:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2019 2018\nNumber of shares repurchased - 158,971 599,664\nWeighted-average cost per share $ - $ 53.41 $ 46.83\nTotal cost of shares repurchased, in thousands $ - $ 8,491 $ 28,082\nShelf Registration and Public Offering\nIn May 2018, we filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-225074) with the SEC, which became effective upon filing. The shelf registration allows us to sell, from time to time, an unspecified number of shares of common stock; shares of preferred stock; debt securities; warrants to purchase shares of common stock, preferred stock, or other securities; purchase contracts; and units representing two or more of the foregoing securities.\nIn May 2020, we consummated an underwritten public offering of 5.85 million shares of our common stock, which included 0.76 million shares sold pursuant to the underwriters\u2019 full exercise of their option to purchase additional shares. The offering was priced at $59.00 per share for total gross proceeds of $345.0 million. The aggregate net proceeds to us were $334.1 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses in the aggregate amount of $10.9 million.\n16. Derivative Financial Instruments\nCash Flow Hedges\nInterest Rate Swap Agreements\nWe are exposed to interest rate risk on our variable rate debt. We have entered into interest rate swap agreements to effectively convert portions of our variable rate debt to a fixed-rate basis. The principal objective of these contracts is to eliminate or reduce the variability of the cash flows in interest payments associated with our variable rate debt, thus reducing the impact of interest rate changes on future interest payment cash flows. These derivative instruments are designated as cash flow hedges, as defined in ASC 815, and are assessed for effectiveness against the underlying exposure every reporting period.\nOn December 24, 2018, we entered into two interest rate swap agreements (collectively the \u201c2018 Swap Agreements\u201d). The 2018 Swap Agreements covered an aggregate notional amount of $100.0 million from December 2018 to February 2022 by replacing the obligation\u2019s variable rate with a blended fixed rate of 2.57%. We designated the 2018 Swap Agreements as cash flow hedges of interest rate risk.\nOn February 10, 2020, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement (the \u201c2020 Swap Agreement\u201d) that covers an aggregate notional amount of $100.0 million from February 2020 to September 2024 by replacing the obligation\u2019s variable rate with a fixed rate of 1.89%. In connection with this transaction, we terminated the 2018 Swap Agreements on a prospective basis and designated the 2020 Swap Agreement under a new cash flow hedge relationship. The fair value of the 2018 Swap Agreements immediately prior to termination was a liability of $2.5 million. The 2020 Swap Agreement contains a blend of the current interest rate environment and the unfavorable portion of the terminated 2018 Swap Agreements, which resulted in a significant financing element at inception of the new cash flow hedge due to off-market terms. Because the forecasted transactions that the 2018 Swap Agreements were designated to hedge are still probable to occur, the unrealized loss will be reclassified into earnings through September 2024.\nThe changes in the fair value of the swap agreements are initially recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) net of tax and are subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings. Amounts reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to the swap agreements will be reclassified to \u201cInterest expense and other, net\u201d in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations as interest payments are made on our variable rate debt.\nForeign Currency Exchange Contracts\nWe are exposed to market risk that includes changes in foreign exchange rates. We have operations in certain foreign countries where the functional currency is the local currency. For international operations that are determined to be extensions of the parent company, the U.S. dollar is the functional currency. As of December 31, 2020, we have entered into a series of foreign exchange forward contracts with a total notional amount of $25.1 million to hedge the effect of adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates for the Indian rupee and Philippines peso. These contracts are designated as cash flow hedges, as defined by ASC 815, of forecasted transactions, are intended to offset the impact of movement of exchange rates on future operating costs, and are scheduled to mature within twelve months.\nThe changes in the fair value of these contracts are initially recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) net of tax and are subsequently reclassified to \u201cCost of revenue\u201d and \u201cOperating expenses\u201d in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations in the same period that the hedged transactions affect earnings.\nThe table below presents the fair value of the derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges as well as their classification in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nFair Value at\nBalance Sheet Location December 31, 2020 December 31, 2019\n(in thousands)\nDerivatives designated as cash flow hedging instruments:\nAssets:\nForeign currency forward contracts Other current assets $ 532 $ 217\nTotal derivative assets $ 532 $ 217\nLiabilities:\nInterest rate swaps Other long-term liabilities $ 6,008 $ 2,193\nForeign currency forward contracts Other current liabilities 1 14\nTotal derivative liabilities $ 6,009 $ 2,207\nAs of December 31, 2020, we have not posted any collateral related to our derivative instruments. If we had breached any of the default provisions at December 31, 2020, we could have been required to settle our obligations under the agreements at their termination value of $5.7 million.\nThe table below presents the amount of gains and losses related to the derivative instruments and their location in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018:\nDerivatives designated as cash flow hedging instruments: Gain (Loss) Recognized in OCI Gain (Loss) Recognized in Income\nYear ended December 31, 2020 2019 2018 Location of Gain (Loss) Recognized in Income 2020 2019 2018\nSwap agreements, net of tax $ (3,935) $ (1,477) $ 61 Interest expense and other $ (1,495) $ 403 $ 613\nForeign currency forward contracts, net of tax 555 244 - Cost of revenue and operating expenses 345 74 -\nAs of December 31, 2020, we estimate that $2.0 million of the net loss related to derivatives designated as cash flow hedges recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income is expected to be reclassified into earnings within the next twelve months.\nGains and losses on our cash flow hedges are net of income tax benefit (expense) of $0.7 million, $0.9 million, and $(0.2) million during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. Cash flows from these derivative instruments, and those from the underlying items being hedged, are included within operating activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The 2020 Swap Agreement contains an other-than-insignificant financing element and, accordingly, the associated cash flows are reported as financing activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nBalance Sheet Hedges\nWe also enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge fluctuations associated with foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, primarily associated with our lease liabilities. These forward contracts are not designated for hedge accounting treatment, therefore, the change in fair value of these derivatives is recorded as a component of \u201cGeneral and administrative\u201d in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations and offsets the change in fair value of the foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities, which are also recorded in \u201cGeneral and administrative\u201d. As of December 31, 2020, the notional amounts of outstanding foreign currency contracts entered into under our balance sheet hedge program totaled $2.0 million. The effects of derivatives not designated as hedge instruments for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were de minimis.\n17. Customer Deposits Held in Restricted Accounts\nIn connection with our payment processing services, we collect tenant funds and subsequently remit these tenant funds, net of our fees, to our clients after varying holding periods. These funds are settled through our Originating Depository\nFinancial Institution (\u201cODFI\u201d) custodial accounts at major banks. The balances in the custodial accounts were $193.7 million and $222.4 million, and the related client deposit liability was $193.4 million and $222.4 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The balances in the custodial accounts are included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as restricted cash. The corresponding liability for these custodial balances is reflected as client deposits. In connection with the timing of our payment processing services, we are exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance, such as returned checks, by other parties. We utilize credit analysis and other controls to manage the credit risk exposure. We have not experienced any material credit losses to date. Any expected losses are included in our allowance for credit losses. The custodial accounts are in the name of RealPage\u2019s wholly-owned subsidiaries, or in the name of the sponsoring bank for debit or credit card transactions. The obligations under the custodial account agreements are guaranteed by us.\nWe offer invoice processing services to our clients as part of our overall utility management solution. This service includes the collection of invoice payments from our clients and the remittance of those payments to utility companies. We had $20.4 million and $14.7 million in restricted cash and $20.4 million and $14.7 million in client deposits related to these services at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nIn connection with our renter insurance products, we collect premiums from policy holders and subsequently remit the premiums, net of our commission, to the underwriter.

    "item_9A": "Item 9A. Controls and Procedures.\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nPursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) and Rule 15d-15(b) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d), we carried out an evaluation, with the participation of our management, and under the supervision of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined under Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective in ensuring that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC\u2019s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management\u2019s assessment of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures is expressed at the level of reasonable assurance because management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives.\nManagement\u2019s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nOur internal controls over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree or compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nUnder supervision and with participation of management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020. In conducting this evaluation, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (\u201cCOSO\u201d) in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013 framework). Management\u2019s assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of certain businesses which we acquired during 2020 (i.e. Modern Message, Stratis, Chirp, and WhiteSky), which businesses are included in our 2020 Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\u2022Modern Message constituted approximately 2% of our consolidated total assets as of December 31, 2020, and less than 1% of our consolidated total revenues for the year then ended.\n\u2022Stratis constituted approximately 2% of our consolidated total assets as of December 31, 2020, and less than 1% of our consolidated total revenues for the year then ended.\n\u2022Chirp constituted less than 1% of our consolidated total assets as of December 31, 2020, and less than 1% of our consolidated total revenues for the year then ended.\n\u2022WhiteSky constituted approximately 2% of our consolidated total assets as of December 31, 2020, and less than 1% of our consolidated total revenues for the year then ended.\nBased on our evaluation using criteria set by COSO, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2020.\nThe effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020 has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, which is stated in their report included in Part II Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nChanges in Internal Controls\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended December 31, 2020 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nInherent Limitations of Internal Controls\nOur management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.\nBecause of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.",
