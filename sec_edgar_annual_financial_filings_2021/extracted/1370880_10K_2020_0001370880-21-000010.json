    "item_1": "Item 1. Business\nGeneral\nFireEye, Inc. is a global cybersecurity company with a mission to protect our customers from cyber attacks using innovative technology, intelligence and expertise from the front lines.\nWe provide intelligence-based cybersecurity control products, software-as-a-service (SaaS) solutions, managed services and professional services that allow organizations to prepare for, prevent, investigate, respond to and remediate cyber attacks, including attacks targeting on-premise, remote, cloud, hybrid and critical infrastructure environments.\nWe have evolved our business from a focus on appliance-based detection and prevention of stealthy and targeted cyber attacks, known as advanced persistent threats (\u201cAPTs\u201d) in customers\u2019 on-premise networks by expanding our portfolio of products, technologies, and services to help customers address today\u2019s cybersecurity challenges. These challenges include a constantly evolving threat environment, expanding attack surfaces, digital transformation, and an acute shortage of cybersecurity talent.\nWe accomplish this through the integration of our core competitive advantages across our portfolio of security control products, SaaS solutions and professional services. Our core competitive advantages include:\n\u2022our accumulated security expertise derived from responding to thousands of significant breaches over the past 15 years,\n\u2022our intelligence on threats and threat actors based on our experience responding to thousands of significant security incidents every year, as well as threat intelligence gathered by our security analysts, consultants and the continuous flow of machine-based threat data from our global network of threat sensors and virtual machines and,\n\u2022our technologies, including artificial intelligence-based extended detection and response (\"XDR\") technologies, our security validation technology, our machine-learning, behavioral-based, and rules-based threat detection, analysis and correlation technologies, our cloud visibility capabilities, our proprietary Multi-vector Virtual Execution (\"MVX\") engine, and our security orchestration, automation and response (\"SOAR\") technology.\nWe design our cybersecurity products and solutions to rapidly incorporate the latest threat intelligence as the threat environment evolves. Through our work on the front lines, we learn the tactics, techniques and procedures attackers are using to circumvent current security safeguards. Our expertise and threat intelligence fuels our detection, validation, and automated response capabilities and becomes an integral component of our technologies in a cycle of intelligence-driven innovation. We also offer managed and consulting services to our customers to augment their internal security resources, to aid in the deployment and management of our solutions and to provide expertise on-demand when needed.\nWe believe that the combination of our technologies, threat intelligence and security expertise allows us to deliver more effective cybersecurity control products and SaaS solutions, help customers improve the effectiveness of their security investments, and enables us to build long-term relationships with our customers.\nWe market our products, solutions and services under two brands: FireEye products and Mandiant solutions.\nFireEye products provide security control by detecting, blocking and analyzing advanced, targeted and other evasive attacks, including ransomware and phishing attacks in customers' on-premise, remote, cloud and critical infrastructure environments. Our security-control products include our network, email, endpoint, and cloud security products and use our patented MVX engine, a virtual machine-based threat detection and analysis engine that works in conjunction with our machine-learning and behavioral analysis technologies. Our security control products are complemented by our Helix security operations platform. Helix aggregates and enriches data and security alerts from our products, as well as data from the products of other vendors, and serves as an investigative and security incident and event management (SIEM) platform for security analysts.\nMandiant solutions help customers improve their resilience to cyber attacks by automating and operationalizing our intelligence and expertise in software, and by augmenting internal resources with managed services, expertise on demand and consulting services. Our Mandiant solutions include our controls-agnostic threat intelligence, validation, and XDR SaaS solutions, as well as our portfolio of managed services and consulting services. We are developing the Mandiant Advantage platform to be a single portal for customers to access all Mandiant solutions.\nIn January 2020, we acquired Cloudvisory LLC, a provider of cloud visibility and control solutions.\nIn November 2020, we acquired Respond Software, Inc., a cybersecurity investigation automation company.\nIn December 2020, we issued and sold 400,000 shares of a newly designated 4.5% Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.0001 per share, at a price of $1,000 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of $400.0 million.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 9,900 end-customers, including more than 50% of the Forbes Global 2000. Our customers include leading enterprises in a diverse set of industries, including telecommunications, technology, financial services, public utilities, healthcare and oil and gas, as well as leading U.S. and international governmental agencies.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, our revenue was $940.6 million, $889.2 million and $831.0 million, respectively, representing year-over-year growth of 6% for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 7% for the year ended December 31, 2019, and our net losses were $207.3 million, $257.4 million and $243.1 million, respectively.\nImpact of COVID-19 on our Business\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) a global pandemic. We operate in geographic locations that have been impacted by COVID-19. The pandemic has impacted, and could further impact, our operations and the operations of our customers as a result of quarantines, various local, state and federal government public health orders, facility and business closures, and travel and logistics restrictions. While we instituted a global work-from-home policy and restricted employee travel to essential, business-critical trips toward the end of the first quarter of 2020, we were able to maintain strong customer relationships and deliver our technology-enabled managed and professional services to customers without interruption. As a result, we did not incur significant disruptions to our operations during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nWe anticipate governments and businesses will likely take additional actions or extend existing actions to respond to the risks of the COVID-19 pandemic. We continue to actively monitor the impacts and potential impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic in all aspects of our business. Although we are unable to predict the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, results of operations, liquidity or capital resources at this time, we expect we may be negatively affected if the pandemic and related public health measures result in substantial manufacturing or supply chain problems, disruptions in local and global economies, volatility in the global financial markets, overall reductions in demand, delays in payment, restrictions on the shipment of our products, or other ramifications from the COVID-19 pandemic.\nFor a further discussion of the uncertainties and business risks associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, see the section entitled \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in Part I,",
    "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOur operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties including those described below. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we currently believe are not material, also may become important factors that affect us. If any of the following risks or others not specified below materialize, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline.\nSummary\n\u2022 If the IT security market does not continue to adopt our security solutions, our sales will not grow as quickly as anticipated, or at all, and our business, results of operations and financial condition would be harmed.\n\u2022 We have had operating losses each year since our inception, and may not achieve or maintain profitability in the future.\n\u2022 We face intense competition and could lose market share to our competitors, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\u2022 Real or perceived defects, errors or vulnerabilities in our products or services, the misconfiguration of our products, the failure of our products or services to block malware or prevent a security breach, or the failure of customers to take action on attacks identified by our products could harm our reputation and adversely impact our business, financial position and results of operations.\n\u2022 Our results of operations may vary significantly from period to period, which could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline.\n\u2022 If we are unable to retain our customers, renew and expand our relationships with them, and add new customers, we may not be able to sustain revenue growth and we may not achieve or maintain profitability in the future.\n\u2022 We have experienced network or data security incidents in the past, and we may experience additional network or data security incidents in the future, which, whether actual, alleged or perceived, may harm our reputation, create liability and adversely impact our financial results.\n\u2022 If securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research reports about our business, our share price and trading volume could decline.\n\u2022 The price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile, and the value of your investment could decline.\n\u2022 Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public markets, or sales of our common stock by our executive officers and directors under Rule 10b5-1 plans, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\n\u2022 The global COVID-19 pandemic could harm our business and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Our Industry\nIf the IT security market does not continue to adopt our security solutions, our sales will not grow as quickly as anticipated, or at all, and our business, results of operations and financial condition would be harmed.\nOur future success depends on market adoption of our unique approach to IT security, which combines our technology, threat intelligence and security expertise in solutions that detect and prevent threats, measure security effectiveness, investigate and respond to breaches and enable customers to adapt to changes in the threat environment. We are seeking to disrupt the IT security market with our security solutions. Our solutions interoperate with, but do not replace, other IT security products. Enterprises and governments that use other security products, including signature-based and advanced products, for their IT security may be hesitant to purchase our security solutions if they believe their existing products provide a level of IT security that is sufficient to meet their needs. Currently, many enterprises and governments have not allocated a fixed portion of their budgets to separate advanced security products, standalone threat intelligence or solutions that evaluate security effectiveness. As a result, to expand our customer base, we need to convince potential customers to allocate a portion of their discretionary budgets to purchase our technology, threat intelligence and expertise. However, even if we are successful in doing so, any future deterioration in general economic conditions, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, may cause our customers to cut their overall IT spending, and such cuts may fall disproportionately on solutions like ours. If we do not succeed in convincing customers that our solutions should be an integral part of their overall approach to IT security and that a fixed portion of their annual IT budgets should be allocated to our solutions, our sales will not grow as quickly as anticipated, or at all, which would have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nEven if there is significant demand for security solutions like ours, if our competitors include functionality that is, or is perceived to be, better than or equivalent to that of our solutions, we may have difficulty increasing the market penetration of our solutions. Furthermore, even if the functionality offered by other IT security providers is different and more limited than the functionality of our solutions, organizations may elect to accept such limited functionality in lieu of adding solutions and services from additional vendors like us, especially if competitor offerings are free or available at a lower cost.\nIn addition, changes in customer requirements could reduce customer demand for our security solutions. For example, if customers were to reduce their number of web egress points or migrate their workloads to a cloud platform, they would not need to purchase as many of our network and email security appliances, which currently account for a significant portion of our revenue. Similarly, if one or more governments share, on a free or nearly free basis, threat intelligence with other governmental agencies or organizations, such as critical infrastructure companies, then those agencies or organizations might have less demand for additional threat intelligence and may purchase less of our standalone threat intelligence offerings.\nIf enterprises and governments do not continue to adopt our security solutions for any of the reasons discussed above or for other reasons not contemplated, our sales would not grow as quickly as anticipated, or at all, and our business, results of operations and financial condition would be harmed.\nWe have had operating losses each year since our inception, and may not achieve or maintain profitability in the future.\nWe have incurred operating losses each year since our inception, including net losses of $207.3 million, $257.4 million and $243.1 million during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Any failure to increase our revenue and manage our cost structure as we grow our business could prevent us from achieving or, if achieved, maintaining profitability. Even if we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. If we are unable to become and remain profitable, the value of our company could decrease and our ability to raise capital, maintain our research and development efforts, and expand our business could be negatively impacted.\nWe face intense competition and could lose market share to our competitors, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe market for security products and services is intensely competitive and characterized by rapid changes in technology, customer requirements, industry standards, threat vectors and frequent new product introductions and improvements. We anticipate continued challenges from current competitors, which in many cases are more established and enjoy greater resources than us, as well as by new entrants into the industry. If we are unable to anticipate or effectively react to these competitive challenges, our competitive position could weaken, and we could experience a decline in our growth rate or revenue that could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur competitors and potential competitors include large networking vendors such as Cisco Systems and Juniper Networks that may emulate or integrate security features similar to ours into their own products; large companies such as IBM, Oracle and HPE that have acquired security solutions in recent years and have the technical and financial resources to bring competitive solutions to the market; independent security vendors such as Palo Alto Networks, Proofpoint and CrowdStrike that offer products or features that claim to perform similar functions to our platform; small and large companies, including new market entrants, that offer niche security solutions that compete with some of the features present in our solutions; providers of traditional signature-based security solutions, such as Symantec and McAfee; and other providers of incident response and compromise assessment services. Other IT providers offer, and may continue to introduce, security features that compete with our platform, either in stand-alone security products or as additional features in their network infrastructure products. Many of our existing competitors have, and some of our potential competitors could have, substantial competitive advantages such as:\n\u2022greater name recognition, longer operating histories and larger customer bases;\n\u2022larger sales and marketing budgets and resources;\n\u2022broader distribution and established relationships with channel and distribution partners and customers;\n\u2022greater customer support resources;\n\u2022greater resources to make acquisitions or enter into strategic partnerships;\n\u2022lower labor and research and development costs;\n\u2022larger and more mature intellectual property portfolios; and\n\u2022substantially greater financial, technical and other resources.\nIn addition, some of our larger competitors have substantially broader product offerings and may be able to leverage their relationships with distribution partners and customers based on other products or incorporate functionality into existing products to gain business in a manner that discourages users from purchasing our products, subscriptions and services, including by selling at zero or negative margins, product bundling or offering closed technology platforms. Potential customers may also prefer to purchase from their existing suppliers rather than a new supplier regardless of product performance or features. As a result, even if the features of our platform are superior, customers may not purchase our products. In addition, new innovative start-up companies, and larger companies that are making significant investments in research and development, may invent similar or superior products and technologies that compete with our platform. Our current and potential competitors may also establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties that may further enhance their resources. Further, as our customers refresh the security products bought in prior years, they may seek to consolidate vendors, which may result in current customers choosing to purchase products from our competitors on an ongoing basis.\nSome of our competitors have made or could make acquisitions of businesses that allow them to offer more competitive and comprehensive solutions. As a result of such acquisitions, our current or potential competitors may accelerate the adoption of new technologies that better address end-customer needs, devote greater resources to bring these products and services to market, initiate or withstand substantial price competition, or develop and expand their product and service offerings more quickly than we do. These\ncompetitive pressures in our market or our failure to compete effectively may result in price reductions, fewer orders, reduced revenue and gross margins, and loss of market share.\nIf we are unable to compete successfully, or if competing successfully requires us to take costly actions in response to the actions of our competitors, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nReal or perceived defects, errors or vulnerabilities in our products or services, the misconfiguration of our products, the failure of our products or services to block malware or prevent a security breach, or the failure of customers to take action on attacks identified by our products could harm our reputation and adversely impact our business, financial position and results of operations.\nBecause our products and services are complex, they have contained and may contain design or manufacturing defects or errors that are not detected until after their deployment. Our products also provide our customers with the ability to customize a multitude of settings, and it is possible that a customer could misconfigure our products or otherwise fail to configure our products in an optimal manner. Such defects and misconfigurations of our products could cause our products or services to be vulnerable to security attacks, cause them to fail to secure networks and detect and block threats, or temporarily interrupt the networking traffic of our customers. In addition, because the techniques used by computer hackers to access or sabotage networks change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, there is a risk that an advanced attack could emerge that our products and services are unable to detect or prevent. Moreover, as our products and services are adopted by an increasing number of enterprises and governments, it is possible that the individuals and organizations behind advanced malware attacks will focus on finding ways to defeat our products and services. If this happens, our networks, products, services and subscriptions could be targeted by attacks specifically designed to disrupt our business and undermine the perception that our products and services are capable of providing superior IT security, which, in turn, could have a serious impact on our reputation as a provider of security solutions. For example, in the fourth quarter of 2020, we experienced an attack from a highly sophisticated threat actor which gained access to our networks and systems via trojanized updates to SolarWinds\u2019 Orion IT monitoring and management software as further described below. In addition, defects or errors in our subscription updates or our products could result in a failure of our subscriptions to effectively update customers' hardware and cloud-based products. Our data centers and networks may experience technical failures and downtime, may fail to distribute appropriate updates, or may fail to meet the increased requirements of a growing installed customer base, any of which could temporarily or permanently expose our customers\u2019 networks, leaving their networks unprotected against the latest security threats. Moreover, our products must interoperate with our customers\u2019 existing infrastructure, which often have different specifications, utilize multiple protocol standards, deploy products from multiple vendors, and contain multiple generations of products that have been added over time. As a result, unanticipated failures could occur if a customer deploys our products in an untested configuration. Similarly, if we inadvertently update our products with an erroneous configuration or untested detection content, invalid detections or product downtime could occur. Any of these situations could result in negative publicity to us, damage to our reputation, declining sales, increased expenses and customer relations issues, and therefore adversely impact our business, financial position and results of operations.\nIf any of our customers becomes infected with malware after using our products or services, such customer could be disappointed with our products and services, regardless of whether our products or services blocked the theft of any of such customer\u2019s data or would have blocked such theft if configured properly. Similarly, if our products detect attacks against a customer but the customer has not permitted our products to block the theft of customer data, customers and the public may erroneously believe that our products were not effective. For any security breaches against customers that use our services, such as customers that have hired us to monitor their networks and endpoints through our own or our co-branded security operation centers, breaches against those customers may result in customers and the public believing that our products and services failed. Furthermore, if any enterprises or governments that are publicly known to use our products or services are the subject of an advanced cyber attack that becomes publicized, our other current or potential customers may look to our competitors for alternatives to our products and services. Real or perceived security breaches of our customers\u2019 networks could cause disruption or damage to their networks or other negative consequences and could result in negative publicity to us, damage to our reputation, declining sales, increased expenses and customer relations issues.\nFurthermore, our products and services may fail to detect or prevent malware, ransomware, viruses, worms or similar threats for any number of reasons, including our failure to enhance and expand our products and services to reflect industry trends, new technologies and new operating environments, the complexity of the environment of our clients and the sophistication of malware, viruses and other threats. In addition, from time to time, firms test our products against other security products. Our products may fail to detect or prevent threats in any particular test for a number of reasons, including misconfiguration. To the extent potential customers, industry analysts or testing firms believe that the occurrence of a failure to detect or prevent any particular threat is a flaw or indicates that our products or services do not provide significant value, our reputation and business could be harmed. Failure to keep pace with technological changes in the IT security industry and changes in the threat landscape could adversely affect our ability to protect against security breaches and could cause us to lose customers. In addition, in the event that a customer suffers a cyber attack, we could be subject to claims based on a misunderstanding of the scope of our contractual warranties or the protection afforded by the Support Anti-Terrorism by Fostering Effective Technologies Act of 2002.\nIn addition, we cannot assure you that any limitation of liability provisions in our customer agreements, contracts with third-party vendors and service providers or other contracts would be enforceable or adequate or would otherwise protect us from any liabilities or damages with respect to any particular claim relating to a security breach or other security-related matter. While our insurance policies include liability coverage for certain of these matters, if we experienced a widespread security breach or other incident that impacted a significant number of our customers to whom we owe indemnity obligations, we could be subject to indemnity claims or other damages that exceed our insurance coverage. We also cannot be certain that our insurance coverage will be adequate for data handling or data security liabilities actually incurred, that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all, or that any future claim will not be excluded or otherwise be denied coverage by any insurer. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage, or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, could have a material adverse effect on our business, including our financial condition, operating results and reputation.\nAny real or perceived defects, errors or vulnerabilities in our products and services, or any other failure of our products and services to detect an advanced threat, could result in:\n\u2022a loss of existing or potential customers or channel partners;\n\u2022delayed or lost revenue and harm to our financial condition and results of operations;\n\u2022a delay in attaining, or the failure to attain, market acceptance;\n\u2022the expenditure of significant financial and product development resources in efforts to analyze, correct, eliminate, or work around errors or defects, to address and eliminate vulnerabilities, or to identify and ramp up production with alternative third-party manufacturers;\n\u2022an increase in warranty and other claims, or an increase in the cost of servicing warranty and other claims, either of which would adversely affect our gross margins;\n\u2022harm to our reputation or brand; and\n\u2022claims and litigation, regulatory inquiries, or investigations, enforcement actions, and other claims and liabilities, all of which may be costly and burdensome and further harm our reputation.\nOur results of operations may vary significantly from period to period, which could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline.\nOur results of operations have varied significantly from period to period, and we expect that our results of operations, including, but not limited to our GAAP and non-GAAP measures, will continue to vary as a result of a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control and may be difficult to predict, including:\n\u2022our ability to attract new and retain existing customers or sell additional solutions to our existing customers;\n\u2022our ability to offset decreases in appliance sales (and attached support) with increases in software, subscription and services sales;\n\u2022potential adverse impacts from our re-allocation of resources from our mature appliance-based products to our cloud security and platform solutions;\n\u2022changes in our mix of products, subscriptions and services sold, including changes in the average contract length for subscriptions and support;\n\u2022the timing and success of new platform, subscription or service introductions by us or our competitors;\n\u2022real or perceived reductions in the efficacy of our solutions by our customers or in the marketplace;\n\u2022budgeting cycles, seasonal buying patterns and purchasing practices of customers;\n\u2022the timing of new contracts or shipments of our products and length of our sales cycles;\n\u2022changes in customer, distributor or reseller requirements or market needs;\n\u2022changes in the growth rate of the IT security market, particularly the market for advanced threat detection and protection products, solutions that measure security effectiveness, or managed detection and response services;\n\u2022any change in the competitive landscape of the IT security market, including consolidation among our customers or competitors and strategic partnerships entered into by and between our competitors;\n\u2022deferral of orders from customers in anticipation of new products or product enhancements announced by us or our competitors;\n\u2022our ability to successfully and continuously expand our business domestically and internationally;\n\u2022reductions in customer retention rates for our subscriptions and support;\n\u2022decisions by organizations to purchase IT security solutions from larger, more established security vendors or from their primary IT equipment vendors;\n\u2022changes in our pricing policies or those of our competitors;\n\u2022any disruption in, or termination of, our relationships with channel partners;\n\u2022our inability to fulfill our customers\u2019 orders due to supply chain delays or events that impact our manufacturers or their suppliers;\n\u2022the timing and costs related to the development or acquisition of technologies or businesses or strategic partnerships;\n\u2022the lack of synergy or the inability to realize expected synergies, resulting from acquisitions or strategic partnerships;\n\u2022our inability to execute, complete or integrate efficiently any acquisition that we may undertake;\n\u2022increased expenses, unforeseen liabilities, or write-downs and any impact on our operating results from any acquisitions we consummate;\n\u2022insolvency or credit difficulties confronting our customers, affecting their ability to purchase or pay for our products, subscriptions and services, or confronting our key suppliers, particularly our sole source suppliers, which could disrupt our supply chain;\n\u2022the cost and potential outcomes of future litigation;\n\u2022seasonality or cyclical fluctuations in our business;\n\u2022political, economic and social instability;\n\u2022public health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and related measures to protect the public health;\n\u2022future accounting pronouncements or changes in our accounting policies or practices;\n\u2022the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures related to the maintenance and expansion of our business, operations and infrastructure;\n\u2022the amount and timing of costs related to any cost reduction initiatives and the impact of such initiatives; and\n\u2022increases or decreases in our revenues and expenses caused by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.\nAny of the above factors, individually or in the aggregate, may result in significant fluctuations in our financial and other operating results from period to period. For example, as we offer more and more solutions through subscriptions and services, it becomes increasingly difficult for us to predict whether customers will purchase our solutions as a product, a subscription or a service. If customers purchase our solutions through subscriptions and services that have less profit associated with them than our products, our operating results could be harmed. Changes in the mix of offerings sold impacts the timing of recognition of revenue for our sales. Consequently, given the different revenue recognition policies associated with sales of our products, subscriptions and services, customers purchasing more of our subscription and services offerings and less of our product offerings than we anticipated could result in our actual revenue falling below our publicly announced guidance or the expectations of securities analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in our stock price.\nAs a result of this variability, our historical results of operations should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. Moreover, this variability and unpredictability could result in our failure to meet our operating plan or the expectations of investors or analysts for any period. If we fail to meet such expectations for these or other reasons, the market price of our common stock could fall substantially, and we could face costly lawsuits, including securities class action suits.\nIf we are unable to retain our customers, renew and expand our relationships with them, and add new customers, we may not be able to sustain revenue growth and we may not achieve or maintain profitability in the future.\nFrom the year ended December 31, 2010 to the year ended December 31, 2020, our revenue grew from $11.8 million to $941 million, which represents a compounded annual growth rate of approximately 55%. Although we have experienced rapid growth in the past, we may not continue to grow in the future. Any success that we may experience in the future will depend, in large part, on our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022maintain, renew and expand our existing customer base;\n\u2022win new customers to our solutions;\n\u2022increase revenues from existing customers through increased use of our products, subscriptions and services within their organizations;\n\u2022improve the capabilities of our products and subscriptions through research and development;\n\u2022continue to develop our cloud-based solutions;\n\u2022maintain the rate at which customers purchase our subscriptions and support;\n\u2022continue to successfully expand our business domestically and internationally; and\n\u2022successfully compete with other companies.\nIf we are unable to maintain consistent or increasing revenue growth or if our revenues decline, it may be difficult to achieve and maintain profitability and our business and financial results could be adversely affected. Our revenue for any prior quarterly or annual periods should not be relied upon as any indication of our future revenue or revenue growth.\nDisruptions or other business interruptions that affect the availability of our Dynamic Threat Intelligence (\"DTI\") cloud, our Helix platform, or other cloud-based products and services we offer or may offer could adversely impact our customer relationships as well as our overall business.\nWhen a customer purchases one or more of our threat prevention appliances, it must also purchase a subscription to our DTI cloud for a term of one to three years. Our DTI cloud enables security content updates and global sharing of threat intelligence uploaded by any of our customers\u2019 cloud-connected FireEye appliances. We also offer additional cloud-based platforms such as our Email Threat Prevention, Mobile Threat Prevention and Threat Analytics Platforms and provide security solutions through our own and our co-branded security operation centers.\nOur customers depend on the continuous availability of our DTI cloud and other cloud-based products and services. Our cloud-based products and services are vulnerable to damage or interruption from a variety of sources, including damage or interruption caused by fire, earthquake, power loss, telecommunications or computer systems failure, cyber attack, human error, terrorist acts and war. Our data centers and networks may experience technical failures and downtime, may fail to distribute appropriate updates, or may fail to meet the increased requirements of a growing customer base, any of which could temporarily or permanently expose our customers\u2019 networks, leaving their networks unprotected against the latest security threats or, in the case of technical failures and downtime of security operation centers, all security threats.\nWith respect to DTI, there may also be system or network interruptions if new or upgraded systems are defective or not installed properly. Moreover, interruptions in our subscription updates could result in a failure of our DTI cloud to effectively update customers\u2019 hardware products and thereby leave our customers more vulnerable to attacks. Interruptions or failures in our service delivery could cause customers to terminate their subscriptions with us, could adversely affect our retention rates, and could harm our ability to attract new customers. Our business would also be harmed if our customers believe that our DTI cloud or other cloud-based products and services are unreliable.\nIn addition, we provide our cloud-based products and services through third-party data center hosting facilities located in the United States and other countries. While we control and have access to our servers and all of the components of our network that are located in our data centers, we do not control the operation of these hosting facilities. We rely on the owners or operators of these hosting facilities in maintaining the availability of their services, maintenance of their infrastructure, and in providing appropriate backup, disaster recovery and security measures. The owners of the data center hosting facilities have no obligation to renew their agreements with us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. If we are unable to renew these agreements on commercially reasonable terms, or if one of our data center operators is acquired, we may be required to transfer our servers and other infrastructure to new data center facilities, and we may incur significant costs and possible service interruption in connection with doing so.\nFurthermore, we have and will continue to make substantial investments to support growth at our data centers and improve the profitability of our cloud platform. If our cloud-based server costs were to increase, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected. Ongoing improvements to cloud infrastructure may be more expensive than we anticipate, and may not yield the expected savings in operating costs or the expected performance benefits. In addition, we may be required to re-invest any cost savings achieved from prior cloud infrastructure improvements in future infrastructure projects to maintain the levels of service required by our customers. We may not be able to maintain or achieve cost savings from our investments, which could harm our financial results.\nRecent, past and future acquisitions and investments could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition and operating results.\nOur success will depend, in part, on our ability to expand our platform and grow our business in response to changing technologies, customer demands and competitive pressures. In some circumstances, we may decide to do so through the acquisition of complementary businesses and technologies rather than through internal development, including, for example, our acquisitions of Clean Communications Limited (d/b/a The Email Laundry) (\"The Email Laundry\"), X15 Software Inc (\"X15\"), Verodin, Inc. (\"Verodin\"), Cloudvisory LLC (\"Cloudvisory\") and Respond Software, Inc. (\u201cRespond Software\u201d).\nThe identification of suitable acquisition candidates can be difficult, time-consuming and costly, and we may not be able to successfully complete acquisitions that we target in the future. The risks we face in connection with acquisitions, including our acquisitions of The Email Laundry, X15, Verodin, Cloudvisory and Respond Software include:\n\u2022diversion of management time and focus from operating our business to addressing acquisition integration challenges;\n\u2022our ability to successfully achieve billings and revenue targets of acquired businesses;\n\u2022coordination of research and development and sales and marketing functions;\n\u2022integration of product and service offerings;\n\u2022retention of key employees from the acquired company;\n\u2022changes in relationships with strategic partners as a result of product acquisitions or strategic positioning resulting from the acquisition;\n\u2022cultural challenges associated with integrating employees from the acquired company into our organization;\n\u2022integration of the acquired company\u2019s accounting, management information, human resources and other administrative systems, as well as the acquired operations, technology and rights into our offerings, and any unanticipated expenses related to such integration;\n\u2022the need to implement or improve controls, procedures, and policies at a business that prior to the acquisition may have lacked sufficiently effective controls, procedures and policies;\n\u2022financial reporting, revenue recognition or other financial or control deficiencies of the acquired company that we don\u2019t adequately address and that cause our reported results to be incorrect;\n\u2022liability for activities of the acquired company before the acquisition, including intellectual property infringement claims, violations of laws, commercial disputes, tax liabilities and other known and unknown liabilities;\n\u2022completing the transaction and achieving or utilizing the anticipated benefits of the acquisition within the expected timeframe, or at all;\n\u2022unanticipated write-offs or charges; and\n\u2022litigation or other claims in connection with the acquired company, including claims from terminated employees, customers, former stockholders or other third parties which may differ from or be more significant than the risks our business faces.\nOur failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with our past or future acquisitions and investments could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions or investments, cause us to incur unanticipated liabilities, and harm our business generally. Future acquisitions could also result in dilutive issuances of equity securities. For example, in October 2017, we issued 259,425 shares of common stock in connection with our acquisition of The Email Laundry; in January 2018, we issued 1,016,334 shares of common stock in connection with our acquisition of X15; in May 2019, we issued 8,404,609 shares of common stock in connection with our acquisition of Verodin and in November 2020, we issued 4,931,862 shares of common stock in connection with our acquisition of Respond Software.\nThere is also a risk that future acquisitions will result in the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities, amortization expenses, incremental operating expenses or the write-off of goodwill, any of which could harm our financial condition or operating results.\nIf we are unable to maintain successful relationships with our channel partners and technology alliance partners, or if our channel partners or technology alliance partners fail to perform, our ability to market, sell and distribute our platform will be limited, and our business, financial position and results of operations will be harmed.\nIn addition to our direct sales force, we rely on our indirect channel partners to sell and support our platform. We derive a substantial portion of our revenue from sales of our products, subscriptions and services through, or with the assistance of, our indirect channel, and we expect that sales through channel partners will continue to be a significant percentage of our revenue. We also partner with our technology alliance partners to design go-to-market strategies that combine our platform with products or services provided by our technology alliance partners.\nOur agreements with our channel partners and our technology alliance partners are generally non-exclusive, meaning our partners may offer customers products from several different companies, including products that compete with ours. If our channel partners do not effectively market and sell our platform, choose to use greater efforts to market and sell their own products or those of our competitors, or fail to meet the needs of our customers, our ability to grow our business and sell our platform may be adversely affected. Our channel partners and technology alliance partners may cease marketing our platform with limited or no notice and with little or no penalty, and new channel partners require extensive training and may take several months or more to achieve productivity. The loss of a substantial number of our channel partners, our possible inability to replace them, or the failure to recruit additional channel partners could materially and adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, sales by channel partners are more likely than direct sales to involve collectability concerns, particularly in developing markets. Our channel partner structure could also subject us to lawsuits or reputational harm if, for example, a channel partner misrepresents the functionality of our platform to customers or violates applicable laws or our corporate policies.\nOur ability to achieve revenue growth in the future will depend in part on our success in maintaining successful relationships with our channel partners, and in training our channel partners to independently sell and deploy our platform. If we are unable to maintain our relationships with these channel partners or otherwise develop and expand our indirect sales channel, or if our channel partners fail to perform, our business, financial position and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIf we fail to effectively manage our growth, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be harmed.\nAlthough our business has experienced significant growth in the past, we cannot provide any assurance that our business will continue to grow at the same rate or at all. To improve our infrastructure, we continue to enhance our enterprise resource planning system, including revenue recognition and management software, and implement and enhance additional systems and controls. There is no assurance that we will be able to successfully scale improvements to our enterprise resource planning system or implement or scale improvements to our other systems, processes and controls in a manner that keeps pace with our growth or that such systems, processes and controls will be effective in preventing or detecting errors, omissions or fraud.\nAs part of our efforts to improve our internal systems, processes and controls, we have licensed technology from third parties. The support services available for such third-party technology are outside of our control and may be negatively affected by consolidation in the software industry. In addition, if we do not receive adequate support for the software underlying our systems, processes and controls, our ability to provide products and services to our customers in a timely manner may be impaired, which may cause us to lose customers, limit us to smaller deployments of our platform or increase our technical support costs.\nMany of our expenses are relatively fixed, at least in the short term. If our projections or assumptions on which we base our projections are incorrect, we may not be able to adjust our expenses rapidly enough to avoid an adverse impact on our profitability or cash flows.\nTo manage this growth effectively, we must continue to improve our operational, financial and management systems and controls by, among other things:\n\u2022effectively hiring, training and integrating new employees, particularly members of our sales and management teams;\n\u2022further improving our key business applications, processes and IT infrastructure, including our data centers, to support our business needs;\n\u2022continuing to refine our ability to forecast our bookings, billings, revenues, expenses and cash flows;\n\u2022enhancing our information and communication systems to ensure that our employees and offices around the world are well coordinated and can effectively communicate with each other and our growing base of channel partners and customers;\n\u2022improving our internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures to ensure timely and accurate reporting of our operational and financial results; and\n\u2022appropriately documenting and testing our IT systems and business processes.\nThese and other improvements in our systems and controls will require significant capital expenditures and the allocation of valuable management and employee resources. If we fail to implement these improvements effectively, our ability to manage our expected growth, ensure uninterrupted operation of key business systems and comply with the rules and regulations applicable to public reporting companies would be impaired, and our business, financial condition and results of operations would be harmed.\nIf the general level of advanced cyber attacks declines, or is perceived by our current or potential customers to have declined, our business could be harmed.\nOur business is substantially dependent on enterprises and governments recognizing that advanced cyber attacks are pervasive and are not effectively prevented by legacy security solutions. High visibility attacks on prominent enterprises and governments have increased market awareness of the problem of advanced cyber attacks and help to provide an impetus for enterprises and governments to devote resources to protecting against advanced cyber attacks, such as testing our platform, purchasing it, and broadly deploying it within their organizations. If advanced cyber attacks were to decline, or enterprises or governments perceived that the general level of advanced cyber attacks have declined, our ability to attract new customers and expand our offerings within existing customers could be materially and adversely affected. A change in the threat landscape may reduce the demand from customers or prospects for our solutions, and therefore could increase our sales cycles and harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf organizations do not adopt cloud-based SaaS-delivered security solutions, our ability to grow our business and results\nof operations may be adversely affected.\nWe believe our future success will depend in large part on the growth, if any, in the market for cloud-based SaaS-delivered security solutions. The use of SaaS solutions to manage and automate security and IT operations is at an early stage and rapidly evolving. As such, it is difficult to predict its potential growth, if any, customer adoption and retention rates, customer demand for our solutions, or the success of existing competitive products. Any expansion in our market depends on a number of factors, including the cost, performance, and perceived value associated with our solutions and those of our competitors. If our solutions do not achieve widespread adoption or there is a reduction in demand for our solutions due to a lack of customer acceptance, technological challenges, competing products, privacy concerns, decreases in corporate spending, weakening economic conditions or otherwise, it could result in early terminations, reduced customer retention rates, or decreased revenue, any of which would adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial results. We do not know whether the trend in adoption of cloud-based SaaS-delivered security solutions we have experienced in the past will continue in the future. Furthermore, if we or other SaaS security providers experience security incidents, loss or disclosure of customer data, disruptions in delivery, or other problems, the market for SaaS solutions as a whole, including our security solutions, may be negatively affected. You should consider our business and prospects in light of the risks and difficulties we encounter in this new and evolving market.\nActions that we are taking to restructure our business to better align with our business model transition strategy may be costly and may not be as effective as anticipated.\nOn April 23, 2020, our board of directors approved a restructuring plan to streamline the Company\u2019s operations to more closely align expenses to the Company\u2019s projected revenue, position the Company for improved operating performance and allow the Company to increase investment in strategic growth areas of the business. This April 2020 restructuring plan resulted in the reduction of 6% of the Company\u2019s workforce as well as the exiting and downsizing of certain real estate facilities and the impairment of certain assets and consisted of severance, other one-time termination benefits and other restructuring related costs. These charges are primarily cash-based and were recognized in the second quarter of 2020. This April 2020 restructuring plan reduced total non-GAAP operating expenses by more than $25 million in 2020 compared to 2019. In August 2020 and December 2020, we implemented additional restructuring plans, predominantly related to facilities and obsolete assets in order to position the Company for improved operating performance. These August and December 2020 restructuring plans resulted in the reduction of approximately 1% of the Company\u2019s workforce. The actions associated with the April 2020 restructuring plan were completed by the end of the second quarter of 2020, the actions associated with the August 2020 restructuring plan were completed by the end of the third quarter of 2020 and the actions associated with the December 2020 restructuring plan were completed by the end of the fourth quarter of 2020. However, there may be adverse consequences related to such actions which include various charges for severance and severance-related costs and the loss of propriety information and in-house knowledge in connection with the planned reduction in our workforce. This type of restructuring activity may result in business disruptions and may not produce the full efficiency and cost reduction benefits anticipated. Further, the benefits may be realized later than expected and the cost of implementing these measures may be greater than anticipated. If these measures are not successful, we may need to undertake additional cost reduction efforts, which could result in future charges. Moreover, the restructuring plans may cause business disruptions with customers and elsewhere if our cost reduction efforts prove ineffective, and our business may not be more efficient or effective than prior to implementation of the plan. Our restructuring activities, including the related charges and the impact of the related workforce reduction, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe rely on our management team and other key employees and will need additional personnel to grow our business, and the loss of one or more key employees or our inability to hire, integrate, train and retain qualified personnel, including members for our board of directors, could harm our business.\nOur future success is substantially dependent on our ability to hire, integrate, train, retain and motivate the members of our management team and other key employees throughout our organization, including key employees obtained through our acquisitions. Competition for highly skilled personnel is intense, especially in the San Francisco Bay Area and the Washington D.C. Area, where we have a substantial presence and need for highly skilled personnel. We may not be successful in hiring or retaining qualified\npersonnel to fulfill our current or future needs, and potential changes in U.S. immigration and work authorization laws and regulations, including those that restrain the flow of technical and professional talent, may make it difficult to renew or obtain visas for highly skilled personnel that we have hired or are actively recruiting. We are also substantially dependent on the continued service of our existing engineering personnel because of the complexity of our platform. Our competitors may be successful in recruiting and hiring members of our management team or other key employees, including key employees obtained through our acquisitions, and it may be difficult for us to find suitable replacements on a timely basis, on competitive terms, or at all. Also, to the extent we hire employees from mature public companies with significant financial resources, we may be subject to allegations that such employees have been improperly solicited, or that they have divulged proprietary or other confidential information or that their former employers own such employees\u2019 inventions or other work product.\nThe workforce reductions made in connection with our restructuring plans may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain highly skilled employees. Even if our key personnel are not directly affected by these reductions, the termination of others may have a negative impact on morale and our ability to retain current personnel, as well as our ability to attract qualified new personnel in the future.\nDuring the past year, we made a number of organizational changes. Leadership transitions and management changes can be inherently difficult to manage and may cause uncertainty or a disruption to our business or may increase the likelihood of turnover in key officers and employees. Our success depends in part on having a successful leadership team. If we cannot effectively manage the leadership transitions and management changes, it could make it more difficult to successfully operate our business and pursue our business goals.\nIn addition, we believe that it is important to establish and maintain a corporate culture that facilitates the maintenance and transfer of institutional knowledge within our organization and also fosters innovation, teamwork, a passion for customers and a focus on execution. Any of our organizational changes may result in a loss of institutional knowledge and cause disruptions to our business. In addition, if we are not successful in integrating new key employees into our organization, such failure could delay or hinder our product development efforts and the achievement of our strategic objectives, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur employees, including our executive officers, work for us on an \u201cat-will\u201d basis, which means they may terminate their employment with us at any time. We do not maintain key person life insurance policies on any of our key employees. If one or more of our key employees resigns or otherwise ceases to provide us with their service, our business could be harmed.\nOur failure to raise additional capital or generate the significant capital necessary to expand our operations and invest in new products could reduce our ability to compete and could harm our business.\nWe intend to continue to make investments to support our business growth and may require additional funds to respond to business challenges, including the need to develop new products and enhancements to our platform, improve our operating infrastructure or acquire complementary businesses and technologies. Accordingly, we may need to engage in equity or debt financings to secure additional funds. If we raise additional equity financing, our stockholders may experience significant dilution of their ownership interests and the per share value of our common stock could decline. Furthermore, if we engage in additional debt financing, the holders of debt would have priority over the holders of common stock, and we may be required to accept terms that restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness. We may also be required to take other actions that would otherwise be in the interests of the debt holders and force us to maintain specified liquidity or other ratios, any of which could harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition. If we need additional capital and cannot raise it on acceptable terms, we may not be able to, among other things:\n\u2022develop or enhance our products and subscriptions;\n\u2022continue to expand our sales and marketing and research and development organizations;\n\u2022acquire complementary technologies, products or businesses;\n\u2022expand operations, in the United States or internationally;\n\u2022hire, train and retain employees; or\n\u2022respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated working capital requirements.\nOur failure to do any of these things could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we do not accurately anticipate and respond promptly to changes in our customers\u2019 technologies, business plans or security needs, our competitive position and prospects could be harmed.\nThe IT security market has grown quickly and is expected to continue to evolve rapidly. Moreover, many of our customers operate in markets characterized by rapidly changing technologies and business plans, which require them to add numerous network access points and adapt to increasingly complex IT networks, incorporating a variety of hardware, software applications, operating systems and networking protocols. As their technologies and business plans grow more complex, we expect these customers to face new and increasingly sophisticated methods of attack. We face significant challenges in ensuring that our platform effectively identifies and responds to these advanced and evolving attacks without disrupting our customers\u2019 network performance. As a result of the continued rapid innovations in the technology industry, including the rapid growth of smart phones, tablets and other devices, the trend of \u201cbring your own device\u201d in enterprises, and the rapidly evolving Internet of Things, we expect the networks of our customers to continue to change rapidly and become more complex.\nWe have identified a number of new products and enhancements to our platform that we believe are important to our continued success in the IT security market, including our FireEye Helix platform and enhancements to our endpoint solution. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in developing and marketing, on a timely basis, such new products or enhancements or that our new products or enhancements will adequately address the changing needs of the marketplace. In addition, some of our new products and enhancements may require us to develop new hardware architectures that involve complex, expensive and time-consuming research and development processes. Although the market expects rapid introduction of new products and enhancements to respond to new threats, the development of these products and enhancements is difficult and the timetable for commercial release and availability is uncertain, as there can be significant time lags between initial beta releases and the commercial availability of new products and enhancements. We may experience unanticipated delays in the availability of new products and enhancements to our platform and fail to meet customer expectations with respect to the timing of such availability. If we do not quickly respond to the rapidly changing and rigorous needs of our customers by developing, releasing and making available on a timely basis new products and enhancements to our platform, such as our FireEye Helix platform and enhancements to our endpoint solution, that can adequately respond to advanced threats and our customers\u2019 needs, our competitive position and business prospects will be harmed. Furthermore, from time to time, we or our competitors may announce new products with capabilities or technologies that could have the potential to replace or shorten the life cycles of our existing products. There can be no assurance that announcements of new products will not cause customers to defer purchasing our existing products.\nAdditionally, the process of developing new technology is expensive, complex and uncertain. The success of new products and enhancements depends on several factors, including appropriate component costs, timely completion and introduction, differentiation of new products and enhancements from those of our competitors, and market acceptance. To maintain our competitive position, we must continue to commit significant resources to developing new products or enhancements to our platform before knowing whether these investments will be cost-effective or achieve the intended results. There can be no assurance that we will successfully identify new product opportunities, develop and bring new products or enhancements to market in a timely manner, or achieve market acceptance of our platform, or that products and technologies developed by others will not render our platform obsolete or noncompetitive. If we expend significant resources on researching and developing products or enhancements to our platform and such products or enhancements are not successful, our business, financial position and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nOur current research and development efforts may not produce successful products or enhancements to our platform that result in significant revenue, cost savings or other benefits in the near future, if at all.\nWe must continue to dedicate significant financial and other resources to our research and development efforts if we are to maintain our competitive position. However, developing products and enhancements to our platform is expensive and time consuming, and there is no assurance that such activities will result in significant new marketable products or enhancements to our platform, design improvements, cost savings, revenue or other expected benefits. If we spend significant resources on research and development and are unable to generate an adequate return on our investment, our business and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nSeasonality may cause fluctuations in our revenue.\nWe believe there are significant seasonal factors that may cause us to record higher revenue in some quarters compared with others. We believe this variability is largely due to (i) our customers\u2019 budgetary and spending patterns, as many customers spend the unused portions of their discretionary budgets prior to the end of their fiscal years, and (ii) our sales compensation plans, which are typically structured around annual quotas and stair step commission rates. For example, we have historically recorded our highest level of revenue in our fourth quarter, which we believe corresponds to the fourth quarter of a majority of our customers. Similarly, we have historically recorded our second-highest level of revenue in our third quarter, which corresponds to the fourth quarter of U.S. federal agencies and other customers in the U.S. federal government. Our growth rate over the last couple years may have made seasonal\nfluctuations more difficult to detect. If our rate of growth slows over time, seasonal or cyclical variations in our operations may become more pronounced, and our business, results of operations and financial position may be adversely affected.\nOur operating history and changes to our business model makes it difficult to evaluate our current business and prospects and may increase the risk that we will not be successful.\nWe were founded in 2004, and we shipped our first commercially successful solution for on-premises network security in 2008. Since then, we have continued to expand our offerings, both organically and through acquisitions, to address changes in the threat environment, evolving customer requirements, and the continued migration of workloads to cloud platforms. Acquired solutions included Mandiant Corporation\u2019s endpoint threat detection, response and remediation products, advanced threat intelligence capabilities and incident response and security consulting services; Invotas International's security automation and orchestration functionality; iSIGHT Security's standalone threat intelligence subscriptions; Verodin\u2019s security instrumentation platform; Cloudvisory\u2019s cloud visibility application and Respond Software\u2019s cybersecurity investigation automation. The markets for many of our acquired solutions are in the early stages of development and customer adoption remains limited. Additionally, most of our acquired solutions are sold as subscriptions, often to large enterprises or governments, and contract terms may vary significantly. The shift in sales mix from mature on-premise appliance-based solutions to cloud-based subscriptions in early-stage markets makes it difficult to evaluate our current business and prospects and plan for and model our future growth. We have encountered and will continue to encounter risks and uncertainties frequently encountered by emerging technology-based companies in developing markets.\nIf our assumptions regarding these risks and uncertainties are incorrect or change in response to changes in the IT security market, our results of operations and financial results could differ materially from our plans and forecasts. Although we have experienced rapid growth in the past, there is no assurance that such growth will continue. Any success we may experience in the future will depend in large part on our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022maintain and expand our customer base and the ways in which customers use our products and services;\n\u2022expand revenue from existing customers through increased or broader use of our products, subscriptions and services within their organizations;\n\u2022grow our revenues from software, subscriptions and recent offerings from acquisitions such as Verodin, Cloudvisory and Respond Software;\n\u2022convince customers to allocate a fixed portion of their annual IT budgets to our products and services;\n\u2022improve the performance and capabilities of our platform through research and development;\n\u2022effectively expand our business domestically and internationally; and\n\u2022successfully compete with other companies that currently provide, or may in the future provide, solutions like ours that protect against advanced cyber attacks, measure security effectiveness, or investigate and respond to attacks.\nIf we are unable to achieve our key objectives, including the objectives listed above, our business and results of operations will be adversely affected and the fair market value of our common stock could decline.\nWe are exposed to the credit risk of some of our distributors, resellers and customers and to credit exposure in weakened markets, which could result in material losses.\nMost of our sales are on an open credit basis. Although we have programs in place that are designed to monitor and mitigate these risks, we cannot assure you these programs will be effective in reducing our credit risks, especially as we expand our business internationally. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic may negatively affect the ability of our customers, especially in certain industries such as travel, entertainment, food and hospitality, to pay us on a timely basis or at all. If we are unable to adequately control these risks, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be harmed.\nFailure to comply with governmental laws and regulations could harm our business.\nOur business is subject to regulation by various U.S. federal, state, local and foreign governmental agencies, including agencies responsible for monitoring and enforcing employment and labor laws, workplace safety, product safety, environmental laws, consumer protection laws, privacy and data-protection laws, anti-bribery laws (including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K.\nAnti-Bribery Act), import/export controls, federal securities laws and tax laws and regulations. In certain jurisdictions, these regulatory requirements may be more stringent than those in the United States. Noncompliance with applicable regulations or requirements could subject us to investigations, sanctions, mandatory product recalls, enforcement actions, disgorgement of profits, fines, damages, civil and criminal penalties, injunctions or other collateral consequences. If any governmental sanctions are imposed, or if we do not prevail in any possible civil or criminal litigation, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. In addition, responding to any action will likely result in a significant diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources and an increase in professional fees. U.S. regulations surrounding our operating activities in foreign jurisdictions are not always consistent with, and at times are in contravention to, the local regulations or laws in such jurisdictions. Enforcement actions and sanctions could harm our business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we fail to comply with environmental requirements, our business, financial condition, results of operations and reputation could be adversely affected.\nWe are subject to various environmental laws and regulations including laws governing the hazardous material content of our products and laws relating to the collection and recycling of electrical and electronic equipment. Examples of these laws and regulations include the EU Restrictions on the Use of certain Hazardous Substances in Electronic Equipment Directive and the EU Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive as well as the implementing legislation of the EU member states. Similar laws and regulations have been passed or are pending in China, South Korea and Japan and may be enacted in other regions, including in the United States, and we are, or may in the future be, subject to these laws and regulations.\nOur failure to comply with past, present, and future laws could result in reduced sales of our products, substantial product inventory write-offs, reputational damage, penalties, and other sanctions, any of which could harm our business and financial condition. We also expect that our products will be affected by new environmental laws and regulations on an ongoing basis. To date, our expenditures for environmental compliance have not had a material impact on our results of operations or cash flows, and although we cannot predict the future impact of such laws or regulations, they will likely result in additional costs and may increase penalties associated with violations or require us to change the content of our products or how they are manufactured, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we do not achieve increased tax benefits as a result of our corporate structure, our operating results and financial condition may be negatively impacted.\nWe generally conduct our international operations through wholly-owned subsidiaries and report our taxable income in various jurisdictions worldwide based upon our business operations in those jurisdictions. In 2019, we reorganized our corporate structure and intercompany relationships to better align our corporate organization with the expansion of our international business activities. Although we anticipate achieving a reduction in our overall effective tax rate in the future as a result of this reorganized corporate structure, we may not realize any benefits. Our intercompany relationships are subject to complex transfer pricing regulations administered by taxing authorities in various jurisdictions. The relevant taxing authorities may disagree with our determinations as to the income and expenses attributable to specific jurisdictions. If such a disagreement were to occur, and our position were not sustained, we could be required to pay additional taxes, interest and penalties, which could result in one-time tax charges, higher effective tax rates, reduced cash flows and lower overall profitability of our operations. In addition, if the intended tax treatment of our reorganized corporate structure is not accepted by the applicable taxing authorities, changes in tax law negatively impact the structure or we do not operate our business consistent with the structure and applicable tax laws and regulations, we may fail to achieve any tax advantages as a result of the reorganized corporate structure, and our future operating results and financial condition may be negatively impacted. In addition, we continue to evaluate our corporate structure in light of current and pending tax legislation, and any changes to our corporate structure may require us to incur additional expenses and may impact our overall effective tax rate.\nWe could be subject to additional tax liabilities.\nWe are subject to U.S. federal, state, local and sales taxes in the United States and foreign income taxes, withholding taxes and transaction taxes in numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and our worldwide provision for taxes. During the ordinary course of business, there are many activities and transactions for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. In addition, our tax obligations and effective tax rates could be adversely affected by changes in the relevant tax, accounting and other laws, regulations, principles and interpretations, including those relating to income tax nexus and impacts of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \u201cTax Act\u201d), as modified by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the \u201cCARES Act\u201d), by recognizing tax losses or lower than anticipated earnings in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated earnings in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory rates, by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, or by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities. We may be audited in various jurisdictions, and such jurisdictions may assess additional taxes, sales taxes and value-added taxes against us. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of any tax audits or litigation could be materially different from our historical tax provisions and\naccruals, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period for which a determination is made.\nRisks Related to Privacy and Data Protection\nWe have experienced network or data security incidents in the past, and we may experience additional network or data security incidents in the future, which, whether actual, alleged or perceived, may harm our reputation, create liability and adversely impact our financial results.\nIncreasingly, companies are subject to a wide variety of attacks on their networks on an ongoing basis. In addition to traditional computer \u201chackers,\u201d malicious code (such as viruses and worms), phishing attempts, ransomware, employee theft or misuse, accidental disclosure, and denial of service attacks, sophisticated nation-state and nation-state supported actors engage in intrusions and attacks (including advanced persistent threat intrusions) and add to the risks to our internal networks, cloud deployed enterprise and customer facing environments and the information they store and process. We also utilize third-party service providers to host, transmit, or otherwise process electronic data in connection with our business activities, including our supply chain processes, operations, and communications. We and/or our third-party service providers have faced and may continue to face security threats and attacks from a variety of sources. Our data, corporate systems, third-party systems and security measures have been and may continue to be subject to breaches or intrusions due to the actions of outside parties, employee error, malfeasance, a combination of these, or otherwise, including social engineering and employee and contractor error or malfeasance, and, as a result, an unauthorized party may obtain access to our systems, networks, or data. There have been and may continue to be significant software supply chain attacks, and we cannot guarantee that our or our third-party service providers\u2019 systems and networks have not been breached or that they do not contain exploitable defects or bugs that could result in a breach of or disruption to our systems and networks or the systems and networks of third parties that support us and our services. Techniques used to sabotage or obtain unauthorized access to systems and networks are constantly evolving and, in some instances, are not identified until or after they are launched against a target, and we may face difficulties or delays in identifying or otherwise responding to any attacks or actual or potential breaches of security. Furthermore, as a well-known provider of security solutions, we may be a more attractive target for such attacks. A breach in our data security or an attack against our service availability, or that of our third-party service providers, could impact our networks or networks secured by our products and subscriptions, creating system disruptions or slowdowns and exploiting security vulnerabilities of our products, and the information stored on our networks or those of our third-party service providers could be accessed, publicly disclosed, altered, lost, or stolen, which could result in a loss of intellectual property or loss of data and subject us to liability and cause us financial harm.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2020, we experienced an attack from a highly sophisticated threat actor, one whose discipline, operational security, and techniques lead us to believe it was a state-sponsored attack. Like numerous other public and private organizations affected by this attack, the threat actor gained access to our networks and systems via trojanized updates to SolarWinds\u2019 Orion IT monitoring and management software. We conducted a comprehensive investigation in coordination with the Federal Bureau of Investigation and other key partners, including Microsoft. Our investigation identified that the attacker targeted and accessed certain Red Team assessment tools that we use to test our customers\u2019 security. These tools mimic the behavior of many cyber threat actors and enable us to provide essential diagnostic security services to our customers and, if used or publicly disclosed by the threat actor, could be used to conduct additional attacks on us or other organizations. Our investigation also identified that, consistent with a nation-state cyber-espionage effort, the attacker was able to access certain of our internal systems and primarily sought information related to certain government customers. We notified affected customers and government agencies, as we deemed was required or appropriate. We have incurred costs to respond to this attack and may continue to incur costs to remediate and support our efforts to enhance our security measures.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be successful in preventing security breaches or other security incidents nor that we will be successful in mitigating their effects, despite the implementation of security measures for systems, networks, or data within our control. Similarly, there can be no assurance that our third-party service providers, distributors and other contractors will be successful in protecting our data on their systems or in protecting other systems upon which we may rely. Any actual, alleged or perceived breach of network security in our systems or networks, or any other actual, alleged or perceived data security incident we or our third-party service providers suffer, could result in damage to our reputation, negative publicity, loss of channel partners, customers and sales, loss of competitive advantages over our competitors, increased costs to remedy any problems and otherwise respond to any incident, regulatory investigations and enforcement actions, costly litigation, and other liability. In addition, we may incur significant costs and operational consequences of investigating, remediating, eliminating and putting in place additional tools and devices designed to prevent actual or perceived security breaches and other security incidents, as well as the costs to comply with any notification or other legal obligations resulting from any security incidents. Any of these negative outcomes could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources, distract management and technical personnel, adversely impact the market perception of our products and subscriptions and end-customer and investor confidence in our company and could seriously harm our business or operating results.\nAlthough we maintain cyber liability insurance coverage that may cover certain liabilities in connection with security breaches and other security incidents, we cannot be certain our insurance coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred, that\ninsurance will continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms (if at all) or that any insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claim. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage, the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, or denials of coverage, could have a material adverse effect on our business, including our financial condition, results of operations and reputation.\nIf we fail to adequately protect personal information or other information we process or maintain, our business, financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected.\nA wide variety of provincial, state, national, and international laws and regulations apply to the collection, use, retention, protection, disclosure, transfer and other processing of personal data and other information. Evolving and changing definitions of personal data and personal information within the European Union (\"EU\"), the United States, and elsewhere, especially relating to classification of Internet Protocol addresses, machine identification, location data and other information, may limit or inhibit our ability to operate or expand our business, including limiting technology alliance partners that may involve the sharing of data. Data protection and privacy-related laws and regulations are evolving and may result in ever-increasing regulatory and public scrutiny and escalating levels of enforcement and sanctions.\nFor example, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (\"GDPR\"), which became fully effective on May 25, 2018, imposes more stringent data protection requirements than previously effective EU data protection law and provides for penalties for noncompliance of up to the greater of \u20ac20 million or four percent of worldwide annual revenues. The GDPR requires, among other things, that personal data only be transferred outside of the EU to certain jurisdictions, including the United States, if steps are taken to legitimize those data transfers. We historically relied on the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield programs, and the use of model contractual clauses approved by the EU Commission, to legitimize these transfers. Both the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield and these model contractual clauses have been subject to legal challenge, however, and on July 16, 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union (\u201cCJEU\u201d) invalidated the U.S.-EU Privacy Shield framework that had been in place since 2016, which allowed companies like us to meet certain European legal requirements for the transfer of personal data from the European Economic Area (\u201cEEA\u201d) to the United States, and imposed additional obligations on companies when relying on the model clauses approved by the EU Commission. This CJEU decision may result in different EEA data protection regulators applying differing standards for the transfer of personal data from the EEA to the United States, and may even require ad hoc verification of measures taken with respect to data flows. The CJEU decision requires us to take additional steps to legitimize any impacted personal data transfers, with its full impact uncertain at this time. The CJEU decision and related developments could result in increased costs of compliance and limitations on our customers and us. More generally, as a result of the CJEU decision or related developments, we may find it necessary or desirable to modify our data handling practices, and our practices relating to cross-border transfers of data or other data handling practices, or those of our customers and vendors, may be challenged our business, financial condition and operating results may be adversely impacted. Some countries also are considering or have enacted legislation requiring local storage and processing of data that could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our services.\nFurther, in June 2016, the United Kingdom (\"U.K.\") voted to leave the EU, commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit,\u201d which resulted in the U.K. exiting the EU on January 31, 2020, subject to a transition period ending December 31, 2020. Brexit could lead to further legislative and regulatory changes. The U.K. has implemented legislation that substantially implements the GDPR, with penalties for noncompliance of up to the greater of \u00a317.5 million or four percent of worldwide revenues. Aspects of U.K. data protection laws and regulations, however, including with respect to the role of the U.K. Information Commissioner\u2019s Office and regulation of data transfers to and from the U.K. in the medium to longer term, remain unclear.\nCalifornia enacted legislation in 2018, the California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d), that became operative on January 1, 2020. The CCPA requires covered companies to, among other things, provide new disclosures to California consumers, and affords such consumers new abilities to opt-out of certain sales of personal information. Aspects of the CCPA and its interpretation remain unclear. We cannot fully predict the impact of the CCPA on our business or operations, but it may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and to incur substantial costs and expenses in an effort to comply. Additionally, a new privacy law, the California Privacy Rights Act (\u201cCPRA\u201d), was approved by California voters in the November 3, 2020 election. The CPRA creates obligations relating to consumer data beginning on January 1, 2022, with implementing regulations expected on or before July 1, 2022, and enforcement beginning July 1, 2023. The CPRA significantly modifies the CCPA, potentially resulting in further uncertainty and requiring us to incur additional costs and expenses.\nEven the perception of privacy, data protection or information security concerns, whether or not valid, may harm our reputation, inhibit adoption of our products by current and future customers, or adversely impact our ability to hire and retain workforce talent. If our security measures are or are believed to be inadequate or breached as a result of third-party action, employee negligence, error or malfeasance, product defects, social engineering techniques or otherwise, and this results in, or is believed to result in, the disruption of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of our systems or networks or any data we process or maintain, or the loss, destruction or corruption of such data, or our privacy practices are or are perceived to be inadequate, we could incur significant liability, we could\nface a loss of revenues, and our business may suffer and our reputation and competitive position may be damaged. Additionally, our service providers may suffer, or be perceived to suffer, privacy or data security breaches or other incidents that may compromise, or be perceived to compromise, data stored or processed for us that may give rise to any of the foregoing.\nOur actual or perceived failure to adequately comply with applicable laws and regulations, or to protect personal data and other data we process or maintain, could result in regulatory investigations and enforcement actions against us, fines, penalties and other liabilities, imprisonment of company officials and public censure, claims for damages by customers and other affected individuals, required efforts to mitigate or otherwise respond to incidents, litigation, damage to our reputation and loss of goodwill (both in relation to existing customers and prospective customers), any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial performance and business. Even the perception of privacy, data protection or information security concerns, whether or not valid, may harm our reputation and inhibit adoption of our products and subscriptions by current and future customers.\nRisks Related to Sales of Our Products, Subscriptions and Services\nIf we are unable to sell additional products, subscriptions and services, as well as renewals of our subscriptions and services, to our customers, our future revenue and operating results will be harmed.\nOur future success depends, in part, on our ability to expand the deployment of our platform with existing customers by selling them additional products, subscriptions and services, such as our FireEye Helix platform. This may require increasingly sophisticated and costly sales efforts and may not result in additional sales. In addition, the rate at which our customers purchase additional products, subscriptions and services depends on a number of factors, including the perceived need for additional IT security, general economic conditions, and our customers' level of satisfaction with our existing solutions they have previously purchased. If our efforts to sell additional products, subscriptions and services to our customers are not successful, our business may suffer.\nFurther, existing customers that purchase our platform have no contractual obligation to renew their subscriptions and support and maintenance services after the initial contract period, and given our limited operating history, we may not be able to accurately predict our retention rates. Our customers\u2019 retention rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including the level of their satisfaction with our platform, our customer support, customer budgets and the pricing of our platform compared with the products and services offered by our competitors. If our customers renew their subscriptions, they may renew for shorter contract lengths or on other terms that are less economically beneficial to us. We cannot assure you that our customers will renew their subscriptions, and if our customers do not renew their subscriptions or renew them on less favorable terms, our revenue may grow more slowly than expected, not grow at all, or even decline.\nWe also depend on our installed customer base for future support and maintenance revenue. We offer our support and maintenance agreements for terms that generally range between one and five years. If customers choose not to renew their support and maintenance agreements or seek to renegotiate the terms of their support and maintenance agreements prior to renewing such agreements, our revenue may grow more slowly than expected, not grow at all, or even decline.\nOur sales cycles can be long and unpredictable, and our sales efforts require considerable time and expense. As a result, our sales, billings and revenue are difficult to predict and may vary substantially from period to period, which may cause our results of operations to fluctuate significantly.\nOur results of operations may fluctuate, in part, because of the resource intensive nature of our sales efforts, the length and variability of our sales cycle and the short-term difficulty in adjusting our operating expenses. Our results of operations depend in part on sales to large organizations. The length of our sales cycle, from proof of concept to delivery of and payment for our platform, is typically three to nine months but can be more than a year. To the extent our competitors develop products that our prospective customers view as equivalent to ours, our average sales cycle may increase. Because the length of time required to close a sale varies substantially from customer to customer, it is difficult to predict exactly when, or even if, we will make a sale with a potential customer. As a result, large individual sales have, in some cases, occurred in quarters subsequent to or in advance of those we anticipated, or have not occurred at all. We are generally billing a number of large deals in any quarter, and the loss or delay of one or more of these large transactions in a quarter could impact our results of operations for that quarter and any future quarters for which revenue from that transaction is delayed. Furthermore, some sales (such as product sales) generally result in immediate recognition of revenue, while other sales, such as product subscription sales, require the recognition of revenue over periods of one year or longer typically. As a result of these factors, it is difficult for us to forecast our revenue accurately in any quarter based on our internal forecasts of billings. Because a substantial portion of our expenses are relatively fixed in the short term, our results of operations will suffer if our revenue falls below our expectations in a particular quarter, which could cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nWe rely on revenue from sales of products, subscriptions, and maintenance and support, and because we recognize revenue from most of these sales over the term of the relevant useful life or subscription period, downturns or upturns in sales are not immediately reflected in full in our results of operations.\nRevenue from sales of our products, subscriptions, and maintenance and support accounts for a significant portion of our total revenue. New or renewal sales of subscription and maintenance and support contracts may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including customers\u2019 level of satisfaction with our products and subscriptions, the actual or perceived efficacy of our security solutions, the prices of our products and subscriptions, the prices of products and subscriptions offered by our competitors or reductions in our customers\u2019 spending levels. If our sales of new or renewal subscription and service contracts decline, our revenue and revenue growth rate may decline and adversely affect our business. In addition, we recognize revenue from most of our security appliances sales ratably over the useful life, and we recognize revenue from our subscriptions and maintenance and support contracts revenue ratably over the term of the relevant contract period, which is generally between one to five years. As a result, much of the product, subscription and support revenue we report each quarter is derived from sales in prior quarters. Consequently, a decline in new or renewal sales in any one quarter will not be fully reflected in revenue in that quarter but will negatively affect our revenue in future quarters. Accordingly, the effect of significant decreases in the market acceptance of, or demand for, our intelligence-dependent security appliances, subscriptions or maintenance and support contracts may not be immediately apparent from our results of operations until future periods. Also, it is difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue through additional sales in any period, as the majority of our revenue is derived from sales of our products, subscriptions and services sold in prior periods. Furthermore, any increases in the average term of our subscriptions or maintenance and support contracts would result in a longer revenue recognition period, and could reduce the amount of revenue recognized in each period.\nThe sales prices of our products, subscriptions and services may decrease or the mix of our sales may change, which may reduce our gross profits and adversely impact our financial results.\nThe sales prices for our products, subscriptions and services may decline for a variety of reasons, including competitive pricing pressures, discounts, a change in our mix of products, subscriptions and services, anticipation of the introduction of new products, subscriptions or services, introduction of new pricing and packaging or promotional programs. Competition continues to increase in the market segments in which we participate, and we expect competition to further increase in the future, thereby leading to increased pricing pressures. Larger competitors with more diverse product and service offerings may reduce the price of products or subscriptions that compete with ours or may bundle them with other products and subscriptions. Additionally, although we price our products and subscriptions worldwide in U.S. dollars, currency fluctuations in certain countries and regions may negatively impact actual prices that partners and customers are willing to pay in those countries and regions, or the effective prices we realize in our reporting currency. Furthermore, we anticipate that the sales prices and gross profits for our appliance-based products will decrease over product life cycles. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in developing and introducing new offerings with enhanced functionality on a timely basis, or that our new subscription offerings, if introduced, will enable us to maintain our gross profits at levels that will allow us to achieve profitability.\nIf we do not effectively hire, integrate and train our direct sales force, we may be unable to add new customers or increase sales to our existing customers, and our business will be adversely affected.\nWe continue to be substantially dependent on our direct sales force to obtain new customers and increase sales with existing customers. There is significant competition for sales personnel with the skills and technical knowledge that we require. Our ability to achieve revenue growth will depend, in large part, on our success in recruiting, integrating, training and retaining sufficient numbers of sales personnel to support our growth, particularly in international markets. New hires require significant training and may take significant time before they achieve full productivity. Our recent hires and planned hires may not become productive as quickly as we expect, and we may be unable to hire or retain sufficient numbers of qualified individuals in the markets where we do business or plan to do business. If we are unable to hire and train a sufficient number of effective sales personnel, or the sales personnel we hire are not successful in obtaining new customers or increasing sales to our existing customer base, our business will be adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to increase sales of our solutions to large organizations while mitigating the risks associated with serving such customers, our business, financial position and results of operations may suffer.\nOur growth strategy is dependent, in part, upon increasing sales of our solutions to large enterprises and governments. Sales to large customers involve risks that may not be present (or that are present to a lesser extent) with sales to smaller entities. These risks include:\n\u2022increased purchasing power and leverage held by large customers in negotiating contractual arrangements with us;\n\u2022more stringent or costly requirements imposed upon us in our support service contracts with such customers, including stricter support response times and penalties for any failure to meet support requirements;\n\u2022more complicated implementation processes;\n\u2022longer sales cycles and the associated risk that substantial time and resources may be spent on a potential customer that ultimately elects not to purchase our platform or purchases less than we hoped;\n\u2022closer relationships with, and dependence upon, large technology companies who offer competitive products; and\n\u2022more pressure for discounts and write-offs.\nIn addition, because security breaches with respect to larger, high-profile enterprises are likely to be heavily publicized, there is increased reputational risk associated with serving such customers. If we are unable to increase sales of our offerings to large enterprise and government customers while mitigating the risks associated with serving such customers, our business, financial position and results of operations may suffer.\nU.S. federal, state and local government sales are subject to a number of challenges and risks that may adversely impact our business.\nSales to U.S. federal, state, and local governmental agencies have accounted for, and may in the future account for, a significant portion of our revenue. Sales to such government entities are subject to the following risks:\n\u2022selling to governmental agencies can be highly competitive, expensive and time consuming, often requiring significant upfront time and expense without any assurance that such efforts will generate a sale;\n\u2022government certification requirements applicable to our products may change and, in doing so, restrict our ability to sell into the U.S. federal government sector until we have attained the revised certification;\n\u2022government demand and payment for our products and services may be impacted by government shutdowns, public sector budgetary cycles, contracting requirements and funding authorizations, with funding reductions or delays adversely affecting public sector demand for our products and services;\n\u2022we sell our platform to governmental agencies through our indirect channel partners, and these agencies may have statutory, contractual or other legal rights to terminate contracts with our distributors and resellers for convenience or due to a default, and any such termination may adversely impact our future results of operations;\n\u2022governments routinely investigate and audit government contractors\u2019 administrative processes, and any unfavorable audit could result in the government refusing to continue buying our platform, which would adversely impact our revenue and results of operations, or institute fines or civil or criminal liability if the audit were to uncover improper or illegal activities; and\n\u2022governments may require certain products purchased by it to be manufactured in the United States and other relatively high-cost manufacturing locations, and we may not manufacture all products in locations that meet these requirements, affecting our ability to sell these products to governmental agencies.\nOur ability to maintain customer satisfaction depends in part on the quality of our professional service organization and technical and other support services, including the quality of the support provided on our behalf by certain channel partners. Failure to maintain high-quality customer support could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOnce our platform is deployed within our customers\u2019 networks, our customers depend on our technical and other support services, as well as the support of our channel partners, to resolve any issues relating to the implementation and maintenance of our platform. If we or our channel partners do not effectively assist our customers in deploying our platform, succeed in helping our customers quickly resolve post-deployment issues, or provide effective ongoing support, our ability to sell additional products, subscriptions or services as part of our platform to existing customers would be adversely affected and our reputation with potential customers could be damaged. Many larger organizations have more complex networks and require higher levels of support than smaller customers. If we fail to meet the requirements of our larger customers, it may be more difficult to execute on our strategy of upselling and cross selling with these customers. Additionally, if our channel partners do not effectively provide support to the satisfaction of our customers, we may be required to provide this level of support to those customers, which would require us to hire additional personnel and to invest in additional resources. It can take significant time and resources to recruit, hire, and train qualified technical support employees. We\nmay not be able to hire such resources fast enough to keep up with demand. To the extent that we or our channel partners are unsuccessful in hiring, training, and retaining adequate support resources, our ability and the ability of our channel partners to provide adequate and timely support to our customers will be negatively impacted, and our customers\u2019 satisfaction with our platform will be adversely affected. Additionally, to the extent that we need to rely on our sales engineers to provide post-sales support, our sales productivity will be negatively impacted, which would harm our results of operations.\nIf our products do not effectively interoperate with our customers\u2019 IT infrastructure, installations could be delayed or cancelled, which would harm our business.\nOur products must effectively interoperate with our customers\u2019 existing or future IT infrastructure, which often has different specifications, utilizes multiple protocol standards, deploys products from multiple vendors, and contains multiple generations of products that have been added over time. As a result, when problems occur in a network, it may be difficult to identify the sources of these problems. If we find errors in the existing software or defects in the hardware used in our customers\u2019 infrastructure or problematic network configurations or settings, we may have to modify our software or hardware so that our products will interoperate with our customers\u2019 infrastructure. In such cases, our products may be unable to provide significant performance improvements for applications deployed in our customers\u2019 infrastructure. These issues could cause longer installation times for our products and could cause order cancellations, either of which would adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, government and other customers may require our products to comply with certain security or other certifications and standards. If our products are late in achieving or fail to achieve compliance with these certifications and standards, or our competitors achieve compliance with these certifications and standards, we may be disqualified from selling our products to such customers, or may otherwise be at a competitive disadvantage, either of which would harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property and Technology Licensing\nClaims by others that we infringe their proprietary technology or other rights could harm our business.\nTechnology companies frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. In addition, patent holding companies seek to monetize patents they have purchased or otherwise obtained. As we face increasing competition and gain an increasingly higher profile, the possibility of intellectual property rights claims against us grows. From time to time, third parties have asserted, and we expect that third parties will continue to assert, claims of infringement of intellectual property rights against us. For example, on December 29, 2017, we executed Confidential Patent License Agreements with Finjan Holdings, Inc. (\u201cFinjan\u201d), whereby we resolved all pending litigation matters. Under the terms of the settlement agreement, we paid Finjan a one-time net cash settlement amount of $12.5 million in December 2017, in exchange for the resolution and settlement of all claims between FireEye and Finjan and for cross-licenses between the companies of certain issued patents and patent applications. Other security companies have paid amounts to the same plaintiff to license some of the patents asserted against us. Third parties may in the future also assert claims against our customers or channel partners, whom our standard license and other agreements obligate us to indemnify against claims that our products infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties. Many of our competitors and others may now and in the future have significantly larger and more mature patent portfolios than we have. In addition, future litigation may involve patent holding companies or other patent owners who have no relevant product offerings or revenue and against whom our own patents may therefore provide little or no deterrence or protection. Any claim of intellectual property infringement by a third party, even a claim without merit, could cause us to incur substantial costs defending against such claim, could distract our management from our business and could require us to cease use of such intellectual property. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by the discovery process.\nAlthough third parties may offer a license to their technology or other intellectual property, the terms of any offered license may not be acceptable, and the failure to obtain a license or the costs associated with any license could cause our business, financial condition and results of operations to be materially and adversely affected. We may also be subject to additional fees or be required to obtain new licenses if any of our licensors allege that we have not properly paid for such licenses or that we have improperly used the technologies under such licenses. In addition, some licenses may be non-exclusive, and therefore our competitors may have access to the same technology licensed to us. If a third party does not offer us a license to its technology or other intellectual property on reasonable terms, or at all, we could be enjoined from continued use of such intellectual property. As a result, we may be required to develop alternative, non-infringing technology, which could require significant time (during which we could be unable to continue to offer our affected products, subscriptions or services), effort, and expense and may ultimately not be successful. Furthermore, a successful claimant could secure a judgment or we may agree to a settlement that prevents us from distributing certain products, providing certain subscriptions or performing certain services or that requires us to pay substantial damages, royalties or other fees. Any of these events could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur technology alliance partnerships expose us to a range of business risks and uncertainties that could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial results.\nWe have entered, and intend to continue to enter, into technology alliance partnerships with third parties to support our future growth plans. Such relationships include technology licensing, joint technology development and integration, research cooperation, co-marketing activities and sell-through arrangements. We face a number of risks relating to our technology alliance partnerships that could prevent us from realizing the desired benefits from such partnerships on a timely basis or at all, which, in turn, could have a negative impact on our business and financial results.\nTechnology alliance partnerships require significant coordination between the parties involved, particularly if a partner requires that we integrate its products with our products. This could involve a significant commitment of time and resources by our technical staff and their counterparts within our technology alliance partner. The integration of products from different companies may be more difficult than we anticipate, and the risk of integration difficulties, incompatible products and undetected programming errors or defects may be higher than the risks normally associated with the introduction of new products. It may also be more difficult to market and sell products developed through technology alliance partnerships than it would be to market and sell products that we develop on our own. Sales and marketing personnel may require special training, as the new products may be more complex than our other products.\nWe invest significant time, money and resources to establish and maintain relationships with our technology alliance partners, but we have no assurance that any particular relationship will continue for any specific period of time. Generally, our agreements with these technology alliance partners are terminable without cause with no or minimal notice or penalties. If we lose a significant technology alliance partner, we could lose the benefit of our investment of time, money and resources in the relationship. In addition, we could be required to incur significant expenses to develop a new strategic alliance or to determine and implement an alternative plan to pursue the opportunity that we targeted with the former partner.\nWe may be unable to protect our intellectual property adequately, which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe believe that our intellectual property is an essential asset of our business. We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark, database rights, and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions, to establish and protect our intellectual property rights in the United States and abroad. The efforts we have taken to protect our intellectual property may not be sufficient or effective, and our trademarks, copyrights and patents may be held invalid or unenforceable. Any U.S. or other patents issued to us may not be sufficiently broad to protect our proprietary technologies, and given the costs of obtaining patent protection, we may choose not to seek patent protection for certain of our proprietary technologies. We may not be effective in policing unauthorized use of our intellectual property, and even if we do detect violations, litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights. Any enforcement efforts we undertake, including litigation, could be time-consuming and expensive, could divert management\u2019s attention and may result in a court determining that our intellectual property rights are unenforceable. If we are not successful in cost-effectively protecting our intellectual property rights, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed.\nWe incorporate technology from third parties into our products, and our inability to obtain or maintain rights to the technology could harm our business.\nWe incorporate technology from third parties into our products. We cannot be certain that our suppliers and licensors are not infringing the intellectual property rights of third parties or that the suppliers and licensors have sufficient rights to the technology in all jurisdictions in which we may sell our products. Some of our agreements with our suppliers and licensors may be terminated for convenience by them. If we are unable to obtain or maintain rights to any of this technology because of intellectual property infringement claims brought by third parties against our suppliers and licensors or against us, or if we are unable to continue to obtain such technology or enter into new agreements on commercially reasonable terms, our ability to develop and sell products, subscriptions and services containing such technology could be severely limited, and our business could be harmed. Additionally, if we are unable to obtain necessary technology from third parties, including certain sole suppliers, we may be forced to acquire or develop alternative technology, which may require significant time, cost and effort and may be of lower quality or performance standards. This would limit and delay our ability to offer new or competitive products and increase our costs of production. If alternative technology cannot be obtained or developed, we may not be able to offer certain functionality as part of our products, subscriptions and services. As a result, our margins, market share and results of operations could be significantly harmed.\nOur products and subscriptions contain third-party open source software components, and failure to comply with the terms of the underlying open source software licenses could restrict our ability to sell our products and subscriptions.\nOur products and subscriptions contain software modules licensed to us by third-party authors under \u201copen source\u201d licenses. The use and distribution of open source software may entail greater risks than the use of third-party commercial software, as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or other contractual protections regarding infringement claims or the quality of the code. Some open source licenses contain requirements that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon the type of open source software we use. If we combine our proprietary software with open source software in a certain manner, we could, under certain open source licenses, be required to release the source code of our proprietary software to the public. This would allow our competitors to create similar products with lower development effort and time and ultimately could result in a loss of sales for us.\nAlthough we monitor our use of open source software to try to avoid subjecting our products and subscriptions to conditions, the terms of many open source licenses have not been interpreted by U.S. courts, and there is a risk that these licenses could be construed in ways that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize products and subscriptions incorporating such software. Moreover, we cannot assure you that our processes for controlling our use of open source software in our products and subscriptions will be effective. From time to time, we may face claims from third parties asserting ownership of, or demanding release of, the open source software or derivative works that we developed using such software (which could include our proprietary source code), or otherwise seeking to enforce the terms of the applicable open source license. These claims could result in litigation. If we are held to have breached the terms of an open source software license, we could be required to seek licenses from third parties to continue offering our products on terms that are not economically feasible, to re-engineer our products, to discontinue the sale of our products if re-engineering could not be accomplished on a timely or cost-effective basis, or to make generally available, in source code form, our proprietary code, any of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Our Supply Chain\nBecause we depend on a limited number of manufacturers to build our appliance products, we are susceptible to manufacturing delays and pricing fluctuations that could prevent us from shipping customer orders on time, or on a cost-effective basis, which may result in the loss of sales and customers.\nWe depend on a limited number of third-party manufacturers, primarily Flextronics Telecom Systems, Ltd., as sole source manufacturers for our appliance products. Our reliance on third-party manufacturers reduces our control over the manufacturing process and exposes us to risks, including reduced control over quality assurance, product costs, product supply, upgrades and expansions and timing. Any manufacturing disruption by these third-party manufacturers could severely impair our ability to fulfill orders on time. If we are unable to manage our relationships with these third-party manufacturers effectively, or if these manufacturers suffer delays or disruptions for any reason, experience increased manufacturing lead-times, capacity constraints or quality control problems in their manufacturing operations, or fail to meet our future requirements for timely delivery, our ability to ship products to our customers would be severely impaired, and our business and results of operations would be harmed.\nFurther, the portion of our appliances that are sourced outside the United States may be subject to additional logistical risks or risks associated with complying with local rules and regulations in foreign countries. Significant changes to existing international trade agreements could lead to sourcing or logistics disruption resulting from import delays or the imposition of increased tariffs on our sourcing partners. For example, the United States and Chinese governments have each enacted, and discussed more potential, import tariffs. These tariffs, depending on their ultimate scope and how they are implemented, could negatively impact our business by increasing our costs and impair our ability to fulfill orders.\nIn addition, our reliance on third-party manufacturers exposes us to the risk that certain minerals, known as \u201cconflict minerals,\u201d that are contained in our products have originated in the Democratic Republic of the Congo or an adjoining country. As a result of the passage of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, the SEC adopted disclosure requirements for public companies whose products contain conflict minerals that are necessary to the functionality or production of such products. Although the SEC has provided guidance with respect to a portion of the conflict minerals filing requirements that somewhat reduced the reporting required, we have incurred and expect to incur additional costs to comply with the disclosure requirements, including costs related to determining the source of the conflict minerals used in our products. Moreover, the implementation of these requirements could adversely affect the sourcing, availability and pricing of materials used in the manufacture of our products to the extent that there may be only a limited number of suppliers offering \u201cconflict free\u201d minerals that can be used in our products. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such minerals in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices. We may also encounter customers who require that all of the components of our products be certified as conflict free. If we are not able to meet customer requirements, such customers may choose to not purchase our products, which could impact our sales.\nOur third-party manufacturers typically fulfill our supply requirements on the basis of individual orders. We are subject to a risk of supply shortages and changes in pricing terms because we do not have long-term contracts with our third-party manufacturers that guarantee capacity, the continuation of particular pricing terms or the extension of credit limits. Our contract with our primary\nmanufacturer permits it to terminate such contract at its convenience, subject to prior notice requirements. Any production interruptions for any reason, such as a natural disaster, epidemic, capacity shortages, or quality problems at one of our manufacturing partners would negatively affect sales of our products and adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nManaging the supply of our appliance products and their components is complex. Insufficient supply and inventory may result in lost sales opportunities or delayed revenue, while excess inventory may harm our gross margins.\nOur third-party manufacturers procure components and build our appliance products based on our forecasts, and we generally do not hold inventory for a prolonged period of time. These forecasts are based on estimates of future demand for our products, which are in turn based on historical trends and analyses from our sales and marketing organizations, adjusted for overall market conditions. In order to reduce manufacturing lead times and plan for adequate component supply, from time to time we may issue forecasts for components and products that are non-cancelable and non-returnable.\nOur inventory management systems and related supply chain visibility tools may be inadequate to enable us to make accurate forecasts and effectively manage the supply of our products and product components. Supply management remains an area of increasing focus as we balance the need to maintain supply levels that are sufficient to ensure competitive lead times against the risk of obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements. If we ultimately determine that we have excess supply, we may have to reduce our prices and write-down inventory, which in turn could result in lower gross margins. Alternatively, insufficient supply levels may lead to shortages that result in delayed revenue or loss of sales opportunities altogether as potential customers turn to competitors\u2019 products that may be readily available. Additionally, any increases in the time required to manufacture or ship our products could result in supply shortfalls. If we are unable to effectively manage our supply and inventory, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nBecause some of the key components in our appliance products come from limited sources of supply, we are susceptible to supply shortages or supply changes, which could disrupt or delay our scheduled product deliveries to our customers and may result in the loss of sales and customers.\nOur appliance products rely on key components, including a motherboard and chassis, which our third-party manufacturers purchase on our behalf from a sole source provider. The manufacturing operations of some of our component suppliers are geographically concentrated in Asia, which makes our supply chain vulnerable to regional disruptions. A localized health risk affecting employees at these facilities, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic, or the spread of a pandemic influenza, could impair the total volume of components that we are able to obtain, which could result in substantial harm to our results of operations. Similarly, a fire, flood, earthquake, tsunami or other disaster, condition or event such as political instability, terrorist act, civil unrest or a power outage that adversely affects any of these component suppliers\u2019 facilities could significantly affect our ability to obtain the components needed for our products, which could result in a substantial loss of sales and revenue and a substantial harm to our results of operations.\nWe do not have volume purchase contracts with any of our component suppliers, and they could cease selling to us at any time. In addition, our component suppliers change their selling prices frequently in response to market trends, including industry-wide increases in demand, and because we do not have contracts with these suppliers, we are susceptible to price fluctuations related to raw materials and components. If we are unable to pass component price increases along to our customers or maintain stable pricing, our gross margins and results of operations could be negatively impacted. If we are unable to obtain a sufficient quantity of these components in a timely manner for any reason, sales of our products could be delayed or halted or we could be forced to expedite shipment of such components or our products at dramatically increased costs, which would negatively impact our revenue and gross margins. Additionally, poor quality in any of the sole-sourced components in our products could result in lost sales or lost sales opportunities. If the quality of the components does not meet our or our customers\u2019 requirements, if we are unable to obtain components from our existing suppliers on commercially reasonable terms, or if any of our sole source providers cease to remain in business or continue to manufacture such components, we could be forced to redesign our products and qualify new components from alternate suppliers. The resulting stoppage or delay in selling our products and the expense of redesigning our products could result in lost sales opportunities and damage to customer relationships, which would adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nReliance on shipments at the end of each quarter could cause our revenue for the applicable period to fall below expected levels.\nAs a result of customer buying patterns and the efforts of our sales force and channel partners to meet or exceed their sales objectives, we have historically received a substantial portion of sales orders and generated a substantial portion of revenue during the last few weeks and days of each quarter. A significant interruption in our IT systems, which manage critical functions such as order processing, revenue recognition, financial forecasts, inventory and supply chain management, and trade compliance reviews, or our supply chain could result in delayed order fulfillment and decreased revenue for that quarter. If expected revenue at the end of any quarter is delayed for any reason, including the failure of anticipated purchase orders to materialize, our logistics or channel partners\u2019 inability to ship products prior to quarter-end to fulfill purchase orders received near the end of the quarter, our failure to manage\ninventory to meet demand, our inability to release new products on schedule, any failure of our systems related to order review, processing and licensing, or any delays in shipments based on trade compliance requirements (including new compliance requirements imposed by new or renegotiated trade agreements), our revenue for that quarter could fall below our expectations and the estimates of market analysts, which could adversely impact our business and results of operations and cause a decline in the trading price of our common stock.\nRisks Related to Operations Outside the United States\nWe generate a significant amount of revenue from sales through resellers, distributors and end customers outside of the United States, and we are therefore subject to a number of risks associated with international sales and operations.\nWe have a limited history of marketing, selling, and supporting our platform internationally. As a result, we must hire and train experienced personnel to staff and manage our foreign operations. To the extent that we experience difficulties in recruiting, training, managing, and retaining international employees, particularly managers and other members of our international sales team, we may experience difficulties in sales productivity in, or market penetration of, foreign markets. We also enter into strategic distributor and reseller relationships with companies in certain international markets where we do not have a local presence. If we are not able to maintain successful strategic distributor relationships with our international channel partners or recruit additional channel partners, our future success in these international markets could be limited. Business practices in the international markets that we serve may differ from those in the United States and may require us to include non-standard terms in customer contracts, such as extended payment or warranty terms. To the extent that we enter into customer contracts in the future that include non-standard terms related to payment, warranties, or performance obligations, our results of operations may be adversely impacted.\nAdditionally, our international sales and operations are subject to a number of risks, including the following:\n\u2022greater difficulty in enforcing contracts and managing collections, as well as longer collection periods;\n\u2022higher costs of doing business internationally, including costs incurred in establishing and maintaining office space and equipment for our international operations;\n\u2022fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies in markets where we do business, such as the British Pound Sterling, which experienced a sharp decline in value compared to the U.S. dollar and other currencies;\n\u2022management communication and integration problems resulting from cultural and geographic dispersion;\n\u2022risks associated with trade restrictions and foreign legal requirements, including any importation, certification, and localization of our platform that may be required in foreign countries and any changes in trade relations and restrictions;\n\u2022greater risk of unexpected changes in foreign and domestic regulatory practices, tariffs and tax laws and treaties, including regulatory and trade policy changes;\n\u2022compliance with anti-bribery laws, including, without limitation, compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, the U.S. Travel Act and the U.K. Bribery Act 2010, violations of which could lead to significant fines, penalties and collateral consequences for our Company;\n\u2022heightened risk of unfair or corrupt business practices in certain geographies and of improper or fraudulent sales arrangements that may impact financial results and result in restatements of, or irregularities in, financial statements;\n\u2022the uncertainty of protection for intellectual property rights in some countries;\n\u2022foreign exchange controls or tax regulations that might prevent us from repatriating cash earned outside the United States;\n\u2022general economic, political and social conditions in these foreign markets, including the perception of doing business with U.S. based companies and changes in regulatory requirements that impact our operating strategies, access to global markets or hiring;\n\u2022political and economic instability in some countries, such as those caused by the 2016 U.S. presidential election and the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union, commonly referred to as \"Brexit\";\n\u2022increased exposure to public health issues such as the current COVID-19 pandemic, and related industry and governmental actions to address these issues; and\n\u2022double taxation of our international earnings and potentially adverse tax consequences due to changes in the tax laws of the United States or the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate.\nFurther, the interpretation and application of international laws and regulations in many cases is uncertain, and our legal and regulatory obligations in foreign jurisdictions are subject to frequent and unexpected changes, including the potential for various regulatory or other governmental bodies to enact new or additional laws or regulations or to issue rulings that invalidate prior laws or regulations.\nFor example, Brexit could also lead to further legislative and regulatory changes. A Data Protection Act that substantially implements the GDPR has been implemented in the United Kingdom, effective in May 2018 and subject to additional statutory amendments in 2019 to further align such Data Protection Act with the GDPR. It is unclear, however, how United Kingdom data protection laws or regulations will develop in the medium to longer term, and how data transfers to and from the United Kingdom will be regulated. In particular, the United Kingdom\u2019s exit from the EU to effectuate Brexit could require us to make additional changes to the way we conduct our business and transmit data from the EU into the United Kingdom.\nThese and other factors could harm our ability to generate future international revenue and, consequently, materially impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur sales contracts are denominated in U.S. dollars, and therefore our revenue is not subject to foreign currency risk. However, strengthening of the U.S. dollar increases the real cost of our products, subscriptions and services to our customers outside of the United States, which could lead to delays in the purchase of our products and services and the lengthening of our sales cycle. In addition, we are incurring an increasing portion of our operating expenses outside the United States. These expenses are denominated in foreign currencies and are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates.\nAdditionally, Brexit resulted in an adverse impact to currency exchange rates, notably the British Pound Sterling which experienced a sharp decline in value compared to the U.S. dollar and other currencies. A significantly weaker British Pound Sterling compared to the U.S. dollar could have a significantly negative effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe do not currently hedge against the risks associated with currency fluctuations but may do so in the future.\nWe are subject to governmental export and import controls that could subject us to liability or impair our ability to compete in international markets.\nOur products are subject to U.S. export controls, specifically the Export Administration Regulations and economic sanctions enforced by the Office of Foreign Assets Control. We incorporate standard encryption algorithms into our products, which, along with the underlying technology, may be exported outside of the U.S. only with the required export authorizations, including by license, license exception or other appropriate government authorizations, which may require the filing of an encryption registration and classification request. Furthermore, U.S. export control laws and economic sanctions prohibit the shipment of certain products and services to countries, governments, and persons targeted by U.S. sanctions. While we have taken precautions to prevent our products and services from being exported in violation of these laws, in certain instances in the past we shipped our encryption products prior to obtaining the required export authorizations and/or submitting the required requests, including a classification request and request for an encryption registration number, resulting in an inadvertent violation of U.S. export control laws. As a result, in February 2013, we filed a Voluntary Self Disclosure with the U.S. Department of Commerce\u2019s Bureau of Industry and Security, or BIS, concerning these potential violations. In June 2013, BIS notified us that it had completed its review of this matter and closed its review with the issuance of a warning letter. No monetary penalties were assessed. Even though we take precautions to ensure that our channel partners comply with all relevant regulations, any failure by our channel partners to comply with such regulations could have negative consequences, including reputational harm, government investigations and penalties.\nIn addition, various countries regulate the import of certain encryption technology, including through import permit and license requirements, and have enacted laws that could limit our ability to distribute our products or could limit our customers\u2019 ability to\nimplement our products in those countries. Changes in our products or changes in export and import regulations may create delays in the introduction of our products into international markets, prevent our customers with international operations from deploying our products globally or, in some cases, prevent the export or import of our products to certain countries, governments or persons altogether. Any change in export or import regulations, economic sanctions or related legislation, shift in the enforcement or scope of existing regulations, or change in the countries, governments, persons or technologies targeted by such regulations, could result in decreased use of our products by, or in our decreased ability to export or sell our products to, existing or potential customers with international operations. Any decreased use of our products or limitation on our ability to export to or sell our products in international markets would likely adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Convertible Senior Notes\nWe are leveraged financially, which could adversely affect our ability to adjust our business to respond to competitive pressures and to obtain sufficient funds to satisfy our future growth, business needs and development plans.\nWe have substantial existing indebtedness. In June 2015, we issued $460.0 million principal amount of 1.000% Convertible Senior Notes due 2035 (the \"Series A Notes\") and $460.0 million principal amount of 1.625% Convertible Senior Notes due 2035 (the \"Series B Notes\" and, together with the Series A Notes, the \"2035 Notes\"). During the three months ended June 30, 2018, we issued $600.0 million aggregate principal amount of 0.875% Convertible Senior Notes due 2024 (the \"2024 Notes\" and, together with the 2035 Notes, the \"convertible notes\") and repurchased approximately $340.2 million aggregate principal amount of certain of the 2035 Notes. As a result, as of December 31, 2020, we had approximately $1.1 billion aggregate principal amount of convertible notes outstanding.\nThe degree to which we are leveraged could have negative consequences, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u2022we may be more vulnerable to economic downturns, less able to withstand competitive pressures and less flexible in responding to changing business and economic conditions;\n\u2022our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, general corporate or other purposes may be limited;\n\u2022a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations in the future may be required for the payment of the principal amount of our existing indebtedness when it becomes due; and\n\u2022we may elect to make cash payments upon any conversion of the convertible notes, which would reduce our cash on hand.\nOur ability to meet our payment obligations under our convertible notes depends on our ability to generate significant cash flow in the future. This, to some extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, and regulatory factors as well as other factors that are beyond our control. There can be no assurance that our business will generate cash flow from operations, or that additional capital will be available to us, in an amount sufficient to enable us to meet our debt payment obligations and to fund other liquidity needs. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt obligations, we may need to refinance or restructure our debt, sell assets, reduce or delay capital investments, or seek to raise additional capital. If we were unable to implement one or more of these alternatives, we may be unable to meet our debt payment obligations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nIf holders of the 2035 Notes require us to repurchase their notes on any repurchase date, our financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected.\nHolders of the Series A Notes have the right to require us to repurchase their notes on each of June 1, 2025 and June 1, 2030, and holders of the Series B Notes will have the right to require us to repurchase their notes on each of June 1, 2022, June 1, 2025 and June 1, 2030 at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes of the relevant series to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the relevant repurchase date pursuant to the applicable indenture governing such series of notes. If holders require us to repurchase their notes of an applicable series on an applicable repurchase date, our financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected.\nThe conditional conversion feature of each series of convertible notes, if triggered, may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nIn the event the conditional conversion feature of a series of convertible notes is triggered, holders of such series of convertible notes will be entitled to convert their convertible notes at any time during specified periods at their option. If one or more holders of such convertible notes elect to convert their convertible notes, unless we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering solely shares of our common stock (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we would be required to settle a portion or all of our conversion obligation through the payment of cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity. In addition, even if holders of such series of convertible notes do not elect to convert their convertible notes, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of such series of convertible notes as a current rather than long-term liability, which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital.\nThe accounting method for convertible debt securities that may be settled in cash, such as the convertible notes, is subject to changes that could have a material effect on our reported financial results.\nIn May 2008, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, which we refer to as FASB, issued FASB Staff Position No. APB 14-1, Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash Upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement), which has subsequently been codified as Accounting Standards Codification 470-20, Debt with Conversion and Other Options, which we refer to as ASC 470-20. Under ASC 470-20, an entity must separately account for the liability and equity components of the convertible debt instruments (such as the convertible notes) that may be settled entirely or partially in cash upon conversion in a manner that reflects the issuer\u2019s economic interest cost. The effect of ASC 470-20 on the accounting for each series of convertible notes is that the equity component is required to be included in the additional paid-in capital section of stockholders\u2019 equity on our consolidated balance sheet and the value of the equity component would be treated as original issue discount for purposes of accounting for the debt component of such series of convertible notes. As a result, we will be required to record a greater amount of non-cash interest expense in current periods presented as a result of the amortization of the discounted carrying value of the convertible notes to their face amount over the term of the convertible notes. We will report lower net income in our financial results because ASC 470-20 will require interest to include both the current period\u2019s amortization of the debt discount and the instrument\u2019s non-convertible coupon interest for such series of convertible notes, which could adversely affect our reported or future financial results and the trading price of our common stock.\nIn August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments (a consensus of the Emerging Issues Task Force). This standard clarifies how certain cash receipts and payments should be classified in the statement of cash flows, including the cash settlement for each series of our convertible notes. Upon cash settlement, repayment of the principal amount will be bifurcated between cash outflows for operating activities for the portion related to accreted interest attributable to debt discounts arising from the difference between the coupon interest rate and the effective interest rate, and financing activities for the remainder. This will require us to classify the $310.4 million of accreted interest as cash used in operating activities in our consolidated financial statements upon cash settlement, which could adversely affect our future cash flow from operations.\nIn addition, under certain circumstances, convertible debt instruments (such as the convertible notes) that may be settled entirely or partly in cash are currently accounted for utilizing the treasury stock method, the effect of which is that any shares issuable upon conversion of any series of convertible notes are not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share except to the extent that the conversion value of such series of convertible notes exceeds their principal amount of such series of convertible notes. Under the treasury stock method, for diluted earnings per share purposes, the transaction is accounted for as if the number of shares of common stock that would be necessary to settle such excess conversion value, if we elected to settle such excess in shares, are issued. We cannot be sure that the accounting standards in the future will continue to permit the use of the treasury stock method. If we are unable to use the treasury stock method in accounting for the shares issuable upon conversion of the convertible notes, then our diluted earnings per share would be adversely affected.\nTransactions related to our convertible notes may affect the market price of our common stock.\nThe conversion of any of our series of convertible notes, if such conversion occurs, will dilute the ownership interests of then-existing stockholders to the extent we deliver shares upon conversion of any of the convertible notes. Any sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock. In addition, the existence of the convertible notes may encourage short selling by market participants because any conversion of the convertible notes could be used to satisfy short positions, or anticipated conversion of the convertible notes into shares of our common stock could depress the price of our common stock.\nIn addition, in connection with our issuance of the 2024 Notes, we entered into capped call transactions (the \u201ccapped call transactions\u201d) with certain financial institutions (the \u201coption counterparties\u201d). The capped call transactions are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution to our common stock upon any conversion of the 2024 Notes and/or offset any cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of such 2024 Notes converted, as the case may be, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap. From time to time, the option counterparties or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by\nentering into or unwinding various derivative transactions with respect to our common stock and/or purchasing or selling our common stock or other securities of ours in secondary market transactions prior to the maturity of the 2024 Notes. This activity could cause a decrease in the market price of our common stock.\nWe are subject to counterparty risk with respect to the capped call transactions.\nThe option counterparties to our capped call transactions are financial institutions, and we will be subject to the risk that one or more of the counterparties may default or otherwise fail to perform, or may exercise certain rights to terminate, their obligations under the capped call transactions. Our exposure to the credit risk of the option counterparties will not be secured by any collateral. Adverse global economic conditions may result in the actual or perceived failure or financial difficulties for financial institutions, including one or more of our option counterparties. If an option counterparty becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure at that time under our transactions with that option counterparty. Our exposure will depend on many factors but, generally, our exposure will increase if the market price or the volatility of our common stock increases. In addition, upon a default or other failure to perform, or a termination of obligations, by an option counterparty, we may suffer adverse tax consequences and more dilution than we currently anticipate with respect to our common stock. We can provide no assurances as to the financial stability or viability of the option counterparties.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock\nThe holders of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock may exercise influence over us, including through their ability to designate a member of our board of directors\nThe holders of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock are generally entitled to vote with the holders of the shares of common stock on all matters submitted for a vote of holders of shares of common stock (voting together with the holders of shares of common stock as one class) on an as-converted basis, subject to certain Nasdaq voting limitations, if applicable. Additionally, the consent of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock is required for so long as any shares of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock remain outstanding for (i) amendments to our organizational documents that have an adverse effect on the holders of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock and (ii) issuances by us of securities that are senior to, or equal in priority with, the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock. In addition, for so long as 25% of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock issued in connection with the Securities Purchase Agreement with BTO Delta Holdings DE L.P., an investment vehicle of funds affiliated with The Blackstone Group Inc. (\u201cBlackstone\u201d), and the Securities Purchase Agreement with ClearSky Security Fund I LLC and ClearSky Power & Technology Fund II LLC (together, the \u201cSeries A Securities Financing Agreements\u201d) remains outstanding, consent of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock will be required for (A) any change to the size of our board of directors, (B) any voluntary dissolution, liquidation, bankruptcy, winding up or deregistration or delisting, and (C) incurrence by us of net debt in excess of $350,000,000.\nAdditionally, pursuant to the applicable Series A Securities Financing Agreement, Blackstone has the right to nominate for election one member to our board of directors for so long as Blackstone holds 65% of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock. The director designated by Blackstone is entitled to serve on committees of our board of directors, subject to applicable law and Nasdaq rules. Notwithstanding the fact that all directors will be subject to fiduciary duties to us and to applicable law, the interests of the director designated by Blackstone may differ from the interests of our security holders as a whole or of our other directors.\nAs a result, the holders of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock have the ability to influence the outcome of certain matters affecting our governance and capitalization. The sponsors of the holders of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock are in the business of making or advising on investments in companies, including businesses that may directly or indirectly compete with certain portions of our business, and they may have interests that diverge from, or even conflict with, those of our other shareholders. They may also pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business, and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us. Our obligations to the holders of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock could also limit our ability to obtain additional financing or increase our borrowing costs, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition.\nOur Series A Convertible Preferred Stock has rights, preferences, and privileges that are not held by, and are preferential to, the rights of holders of our Common Stock, which could adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition.\nThe holders have the right under the Series A Certificate of Designation to receive a liquidation preference entitling them to be paid an amount per share equal to the greater of (i) $1,000 per share, plus all accrued and unpaid dividends and (ii) the amount that the holder of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock would have been entitled to receive at such time if the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock were converted into common stock. In addition, the holders are entitled to dividends on the original purchase price of $1,000 per share at a rate of 4.5% per annum, that (i) for the first three years after December 11, 2020, or the Series A closing date, will be paid in-kind, and (ii) after the third anniversary of the Series A closing date, will, at the Company\u2019s election either be paid in cash, or, if not, will accrue and accumulate, in each case, accruing daily and paid quarterly in arrears. The holders are also entitled to participate in dividends declared or paid on the common stock on an as-converted basis.\nThe Series A Convertible Preferred Stock will rank junior to all of our liabilities in the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation or winding-up.\nIn the event of bankruptcy, liquidation or winding-up, our assets will be available to pay obligations on the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock only after all of our liabilities have been paid. In addition, the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock effectively ranks junior to all existing and future liabilities of our subsidiaries. In the event of bankruptcy, liquidation or winding-up, there may not be sufficient assets remaining, after paying our liabilities, to pay amounts due on the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock.\nAn active trading market for the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock does not exist and may not develop.\nThe Series A Convertible Preferred Stock has no established trading market and is not listed on any securities exchange. Since the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock has no stated maturity date, investors seeking liquidity will be limited to selling their shares in the secondary market. We cannot assure you that an active trading market in the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock will develop and, even if it develops, we cannot assure you that it will last. In either case, the trading price of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock could be adversely affected and holders\u2019 ability to transfer shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock will be limited.\nThe market price of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock will be directly affected by the market price of our common stock, which may be volatile.\nTo the extent that a secondary market for the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock develops, we believe that the market price of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock will be significantly affected by the market price of our common stock. We cannot predict how shares of our common stock will trade in the future. This may result in greater volatility in the market price of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock than would be expected for nonconvertible preferred stock.\nThe market price of our common stock will likely fluctuate in response to a number of factors, including the following:\n\u2022actual or anticipated quarterly fluctuations in our operating and financial results;\n\u2022developments related to investigations, proceedings or litigation that involves us;\n\u2022changes in financial estimates and recommendations by financial analysts;\n\u2022dispositions, acquisitions and financings;\n\u2022additional issuances by us of common stock;\n\u2022additional issuances by us of other series or classes of preferred stock;\n\u2022actions of our common stockholders, including sales of common stock by stockholders and our directors and executive officers;\n\u2022changes in the ratings of other of our securities;\n\u2022fluctuations in the stock price and operating results of our competitors;\n\u2022government reactions to current economic and market conditions; and\n\u2022regional, national and global political and economic conditions and other factors.\nThe market price of our common stock may also be affected by market conditions affecting the stock markets in general, including price and trading fluctuations on Nasdaq. These conditions may result in (i) volatility in the level of, and fluctuations in, the market prices of stocks generally and, in turn, the common stock and (ii) sales of substantial amounts of the common stock in the market, in each case that could be unrelated or disproportionate to changes in our operating performance.\nThese broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market prices of our common stock, and, in turn, the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock.\nIn addition, we expect that the market price of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock will be influenced by yield and interest rates in the capital markets and our perceived creditworthiness.\nThere may be future sales or other dilution of our equity, which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock or the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock and may negatively impact the holders\u2019 investment.\nExcept in certain circumstances, we are not restricted from issuing additional shares of common stock or preferred stock, including any securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for, or that represent the right to receive, common stock or preferred\nstock or any substantially similar securities. The market price of our common stock or Series A Convertible Preferred Stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of common stock or Series A Convertible Preferred Stock or similar securities in the market or the perception that such sales could occur. For example, if we issue preferred stock in the future that has a preference over our common stock with respect to the payment of dividends or upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding-up, or if we issue preferred stock with voting rights that dilute the voting power of our common stock, the rights of holders of our common stock or the market price of our common stock could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, each share of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock will initially be convertible at the option of the holder thereof into shares of our common stock. The conversion of some or all of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock will dilute the ownership interest of our existing common stockholders. Any sales in the public market of our common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of the outstanding shares of our common stock and Series A Convertible Preferred Stock. In addition, the existence of our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock may encourage short selling or arbitrage trading activity by market participants because the conversion of our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock could depress the price of our equity securities. As noted above, a decline in the market price of the common stock may negatively impact the market price for the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock.\nThe Series A Convertible Preferred Stock is subject to conversion at our option in certain circumstances after December 11, 2023 based on the trading price of our common stock.\nAt any time after the third anniversary of the Series A closing date, if the closing price of the common stock is at least 175% of the conversion price for at least 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading days immediately preceding the date we notify the holders of our election to convert, we will be entitled, but not required, to convert the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, in whole but not in part, into common stock. Following any such conversion, a holder will no longer be entitled to the dividend or other rights associated with the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock.\nThe Series A Convertible Preferred Stock has not been rated.\nThe Series A Convertible Preferred Stock has not been rated by any nationally recognized statistical rating organization. This may affect the market price of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock.\nThe Series A Convertible Preferred Stock may only be redeemed at the option of the holder in limited circumstances.\nThe shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, unlike indebtedness, will not give rise to a claim for payment of a principal amount at a particular date. As a result, holders of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock may be required to bear the financial risks of an investment in the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock for an extended period of time. Holders have limited rights to require us to redeem the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock. Therefore, holders should be aware that they may be required to bear the financial risks of an investment in the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock for an extended period of time.\nThe conversion rate of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock may not be adjusted for all dilutive events that may adversely affect the market price of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock or the common stock issuable upon conversion of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock.\nThe number of shares of our common stock that holders are entitled to receive upon conversion of a share of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock is subject to adjustment for certain events arising from increases in dividends or distributions in common stock, subdivisions, splits, and combinations of the common stock, certain issuances of stock purchase rights, options or warrants distributed in connection with a stockholder rights plan, self-tender offers and exchange offers, cash dividends or distributions, and certain other actions by us that modify our capital structure. See \u201cDescription of Capital Stock - Series A Convertible Preferred Stock.\u201d We will not adjust the conversion rate for other events, including the issuance of common stock pursuant to plans for reinvestment of dividends or interest, options or rights to purchase such shares pursuant to benefit plans or employee agreements, any option, warrant, right, or exercisable, exchangeable or convertible security or for a change in the par value of the common stock. There can be no assurance that an event that adversely affects the value of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, but does not result in an adjustment to the conversion rate, will not occur. Further, if any of these other events adversely affects the market price of our common stock, it may also adversely affect the market price of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock. In addition, we are not restricted from offering common stock in the future or engaging in other transactions that may dilute our common stock.\nIf our common stock is delisted, your ability to transfer or sell your shares of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, or common stock upon conversion, may be limited and the market value of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock will be materially adversely affected.\nThe terms of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock do not protect you if our common stock is delisted. Because the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock has no stated maturity date, holders may be forced to elect between converting their shares of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock into illiquid shares of our common stock or holding their shares of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock and receiving stated dividends on the stock when, as and if authorized by the board of directors and declared by us with no assurance as to ever receiving the liquidation preference. Accordingly, if the common stock is delisted, the holders\u2019 ability to transfer\nor sell their shares of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, or common stock upon conversion, may be limited and the market value of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock will be materially adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research reports about our business, our share price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock, to some extent, depends on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. We do not have any control over these analysts. If one or more of the analysts who cover us should downgrade our shares or change their opinion of our shares, industry sector or products, our share price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of our Company or fails to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause our share price or trading volume to decline.\nWe may fail to meet our publicly announced guidance or other expectations about our business and future operating results, which would cause our stock price to decline.\nWe have provided and may continue to provide guidance about our business and future operating results. In developing this guidance, our management must make certain assumptions and judgments about our future performance. Furthermore, analysts and investors may develop and publish their own projections of our business, which may form a consensus about our future performance. Our business results may vary significantly from such guidance or that consensus due to a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control, and which could adversely affect our operations and operating results. Such factors may include the possibility that interpretation, industry practice, and accounting guidance may continue to evolve during the early stages of adoption of Accounting Standard Update 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). Furthermore, if we make downward revisions of our previously announced guidance, or if our publicly announced guidance of future operating results fails to meet expectations of securities analysts, investors or other interested parties, the price of our common stock would decline.\nThe price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile, and the value of your investment could decline.\nThe trading price of our common stock has been volatile since our initial public offering, and is likely to continue to be volatile. The trading price of our common stock may fluctuate widely in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. These factors include:\n\u2022whether our results of operations, and in particular, our revenue growth rates, meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors;\n\u2022actual or anticipated changes in the expectations of investors or securities analysts, whether as a result of our forward-looking statements, our failure to meet such expectation or otherwise;\n\u2022announcements of new products, services or technologies, commercial relationships, acquisitions or other events by us or our competitors;\n\u2022changes in how customers perceive the effectiveness of our platform in protecting against advanced cyber attacks or other reputational harm;\n\u2022publicity concerning cyber attacks in general or high profile cyber attacks against specific organizations;\n\u2022price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to time;\n\u2022significant volatility in the market price and trading volume of technology and/or growth companies in general and of companies in the IT security industry in particular;\n\u2022fluctuations in the trading volume of our shares or the size of our public float;\n\u2022actual or anticipated changes or fluctuations in our results of operations;\n\u2022litigation involving us, our industry, or both;\n\u2022regulatory developments in the United States, foreign countries or both;\n\u2022general economic conditions and trends;\n\u2022natural disasters or other catastrophic events;\n\u2022public health crises and related measures to protect the public health, such as the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022actual or perceived security breaches that we or our service providers may suffer;\n\u2022sales of large blocks of our common stock or substantial future sales by our directors, executive officers, employees and significant stockholders; and\n\u2022departures of key personnel.\nIn addition, if the market for technology stocks or the stock market in general experiences a loss of investor confidence, the trading price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business, results of operations or financial condition. The trading price of our common stock might also decline in reaction to events that affect other companies in our industry even if these events do not directly affect us. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company. The price of our common stock has been highly volatile since our IPO in September 2013, and beginning in June 2014, several lawsuits alleging violations of securities laws were filed against us and certain of our current and former directors and executive officers. Any securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our management\u2019s attention and resources from our business. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nSales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public markets, or sales of our common stock by our executive officers and directors under Rule 10b5-1 plans, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales could occur, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and may make it more difficult for you to sell your common stock at a time and price that you deem appropriate. In addition, certain of our executive officers and directors have adopted, and other executive officers and directors may in the future adopt, written plans, known as \u201cRule 10b5-1 Plans,\u201d under which they have contracted, or may in the future contract, with a broker to sell shares of our common stock on a periodic basis to diversify their assets and investments. Sales made by our executive officers and directors pursuant to Rule 10b5-1, regardless of the amount of such sales, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nThe issuance of additional stock in connection with financings, acquisitions, investments, our stock incentive plans, conversion of our convertible notes, conversion of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock or otherwise will dilute all other stockholders.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue up to 1,000,000,000 shares of common stock and up to 100,000,000 shares of preferred stock with such rights and preferences as may be determined by our board of directors. Subject to compliance with applicable rules and regulations, we may issue shares of common stock or securities convertible into our common stock from time to time in connection with a financing, acquisition, investment, our stock incentive plans, the conversion of our convertible notes or otherwise. For example, in October 2017, we issued 259,425 shares of common stock in connection with our acquisition of The Email Laundry; in January 2018, we issued 1,016,334 shares of common stock in connection with our acquisition of X15; in May 2019, we issued 8,404,609 shares of common stock in connection with our acquisition of Verodin, in November 2020, we issued 4,931,862 shares of common stock in connection with our acquisition of Respond Software. In addition, we issued $920.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2035 Notes, of which approximately $483.4 million aggregate principal remains outstanding, and we issued $600.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 2024 Notes during the three months ended June 30, 2018. In December 2020, we issued 400,000 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock. Any future issuances could result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders and cause the trading price of our common stock to decline.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared or paid any dividends on our common stock. We intend to retain any earnings to finance the operation and expansion of our business, and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the future. As a result, you may only receive a return on your investment in our common stock if the market price of our common stock increases.\nOur charter documents and Delaware law, as well as certain provisions of our convertible notes, could discourage takeover attempts and lead to management entrenchment, which could also reduce the market price of our common stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control of our Company. These provisions could also make it difficult for stockholders to elect directors who are not nominated by the current members of our board of directors or take other corporate actions, including effecting changes in our management. These provisions include:\n\u2022a classified board of directors with three-year staggered terms, which could delay the ability of stockholders to change the membership of a majority of our board of directors;\n\u2022the ability of our board of directors to issue shares of preferred stock and to determine the price and other terms of those shares, including preferences and voting rights, without stockholder approval, which could be used to significantly dilute the ownership of a hostile acquiror;\n\u2022the exclusive right of our board of directors to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of our board of directors or the resignation, death or removal of a director, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our board of directors;\n\u2022a prohibition on stockholder action by written consent, which forces stockholder action to be taken at an annual or special meeting of our stockholders;\n\u2022the requirement that a special meeting of stockholders may be called only by our board of directors, the chairperson of our board of directors, our Chief Executive Officer or our President (in the absence of a Chief Executive Officer), which could delay the ability of our stockholders to force consideration of a proposal or to take action, including the removal of directors;\n\u2022the requirement for the affirmative vote of holders of at least 66 2/3% of the voting power of all of the then outstanding shares of the voting stock, voting together as a single class, to amend the provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation relating to the management of our business (including our classified board structure) or certain provisions of our amended and restated bylaws, which may inhibit the ability of an acquiror to effect such amendments to facilitate an unsolicited takeover attempt;\n\u2022the ability of our board of directors to amend the bylaws, which may allow our board of directors to take additional actions to prevent an unsolicited takeover and inhibit the ability of an acquiror to amend the bylaws to facilitate an unsolicited takeover attempt; and\n\u2022advance notice procedures with which stockholders must comply to nominate candidates to our board of directors or to propose matters to be acted upon at a stockholders\u2019 meeting, which may discourage or deter a potential acquiror from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquiror\u2019s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us.\nIn addition, as a Delaware corporation, we are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which may prohibit large stockholders, in particular those owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock, from merging or combining with us for a specified period of time. Additionally, certain provisions of our convertible notes could make it more difficult or more expensive for a third party to acquire us. The application of Section 203 or certain provisions of our convertible notes also could have the effect of discouraging, delaying or preventing a transaction involving a change in control of us. Any of these provisions could, under certain circumstances, depress the market price of our common stock.\nRisks Related to Potential Catastrophic Events\nThe global COVID-19 pandemic could harm our business and results of operations.\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic. This contagious disease outbreak has continued to spread across the globe and is impacting worldwide economic activity and financial markets. In light of the uncertain and\nrapidly evolving situation relating to the spread of COVID-19, we have taken precautionary measures intended to minimize the risk of the virus to our employees, our customers, and the communities in which we operate, which could negatively impact our business. Although we continue to monitor the situation and may adjust our current policies as more information and public health guidance become available, precautionary measures that have been adopted could negatively affect our customer success efforts, sales and marketing efforts, delay and lengthen our sales cycles, or create operational or other challenges, any of which could harm our business and results of operations. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic may disrupt the operations of our customers and partners for an indefinite period of time, including as a result of travel restrictions and/or business shutdowns, all of which could negatively impact our business and results of operations, including cash flows. More generally, the COVID-19 pandemic could adversely affect economies and financial markets globally, potentially leading to an economic downturn, which could decrease technology spending and adversely affect demand for our offerings and harm our business and results of operations. It is not possible at this time to estimate the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic could have on our business, as the impact will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted.\nOur business is subject to the risks of earthquakes, fire, power outages, floods and other catastrophic events, and to interruption by man-made problems such as terrorism or armed conflicts.\nNatural disasters or other catastrophic events, including earthquakes, fires, floods, significant power outages, telecommunications failures, outbreak of pandemic or contagious diseases (including, but not limited to, the current COVID-19 pandemic) and cyber attacks, may cause damage or disruption to our operations, international commerce and the global economy, and thus could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Our corporate headquarters and some of our servers hosting our cloud services are located in California, a region known for seismic activity. Customer data could be lost, significant recovery time could be required to resume operations and our financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected in the event of a natural disaster or other catastrophic event. In addition, natural disasters and other catastrophic events could affect our supply chain, manufacturing vendors, or logistics providers\u2019 ability to provide materials and perform services such as manufacturing products or assisting with shipments on a timely basis. In the event that our or our service providers\u2019 information technology systems or manufacturing or logistics abilities are hindered by any of the events discussed above, shipments could be delayed, resulting in missed financial targets, such as revenue and shipment targets, for a particular quarter. In addition, acts of terrorism, armed conflicts and other geo-political unrest could cause disruptions in our business or the business of our supply chain, manufacturers, logistics providers, partners, or customers or the economy as a whole. Any disruption in the business of our supply chain, manufacturers, logistics providers, partners or end-customers that impacts sales at the end of a fiscal quarter could have a significant adverse impact on our financial results. All of the aforementioned risks may be further increased if the disaster recovery plans for us and our suppliers prove to be inadequate. To the extent that any of the above should result in delays or cancellations of customer orders, the loss of customers or the delay in the manufacture, deployment or shipment of our products, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nFluctuating economic conditions make it difficult to predict revenue for a particular period, and a shortfall in revenue may harm our business and operating results.\nOur revenue depends significantly on general economic conditions and the demand for products in the IT security market. Economic weakness, customer financial difficulties, and constrained spending on IT security may result in decreased revenue and earnings. Such factors could make it difficult to accurately forecast our sales and operating results and could negatively affect our ability to provide accurate forecasts to our contract manufacturers and manage our inventory purchases, contract manufacturer relationships and other costs and expenses.\nIn addition, concerns regarding the effects of the U.K.'s decision to exit the EU, commonly referred to as \"Brexit\", uncertainties related to changes in public policies such as domestic and international regulations, taxes, or international trade agreements, international trade disputes, government shutdowns, geopolitical turmoil and other disruptions to global and regional economies and markets in many parts of the world, have and may continue to put pressure on global economic conditions and overall spending on IT security. General economic weakness may also lead to longer collection cycles for payments due from our customers, an increase in customer bad debt, restructuring initiatives and associated expenses, and impairment of investments. Furthermore, the continued uncertainty in worldwide credit markets, including the sovereign debt situation in certain countries in the EU may adversely impact the ability of our customers to adequately fund their expected capital expenditures, which could lead to delays or cancellations of planned purchases of our platform.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has created significant uncertainty in the global economy. The COVID-19 pandemic and health measures taken by governments and private industry in response to the pandemic, including stay-at-home orders and travel restrictions, have had significant negative effects on the economy. Continued uncertainty about the pandemic, associated economic\nconsequences, and potential relief measures may have a long-term adverse effect on the economy, our customers, partners, suppliers, and our business.\nUncertainty about future economic conditions also makes it difficult to forecast operating results and to make decisions about future investments. Future or continued economic weakness for us or our customers, failure of our customers and markets to recover from such weakness, customer financial difficulties, and reductions in spending on IT security could have a material adverse effect on demand for our platform and consequently on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf our estimates or judgments relating to our critical accounting policies are based on assumptions that change or prove to be incorrect, our results of operations could fall below our publicly announced guidance or the expectations of securities analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in our stock price.\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, as provided in the section entitled \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\u201d the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets, liabilities, equity, revenue and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. In general, if our estimates, judgments or assumptions related to our critical accounting policies change or if actual circumstances differ from our estimates, judgments or assumptions, our results of operations may be adversely affected and could fall below our publicly announced guidance or the expectations of securities analysts and investors, which may result in a decline in our stock price. Significant assumptions and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements include those related to assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and related disclosures.\nOur ability to use our net operating losses to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations.\nIn general, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \"Code\"), a corporation that undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its pre-change net operating losses, or NOLs, to offset future taxable income. Our existing NOLs may be subject to limitations arising from previous ownership changes. Future changes in our stock ownership, some of which are outside of our control, could result in an ownership change under Section 382 of the Code and adversely affect our ability to utilize our NOLs in the future. Furthermore, our ability to utilize NOLs of companies that we may acquire in the future may be subject to limitations. There is also a risk that due to regulatory changes, such as suspensions on the use of NOLs, or other unforeseen reasons, our existing NOLs could expire or otherwise be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities. For example, the Tax Act, as modified by the CARES Act, changed certain limitations on our ability to use our federal NOLs, and California recently enacted legislation limiting our ability to use our state NOLs for taxable years 2020, 2021, and 2022. For these reasons, we may not be able to utilize a material portion of the NOLs reflected on our balance sheet, even if we attain profitability.\nThe requirements of being a public company may strain our resources, divert management\u2019s attention and affect our ability to attract and retain qualified board members.\nAs a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act\"), the listing requirements of the NASDAQ Stock Market and other applicable securities rules and regulations. Compliance with these rules and regulations has increased and will continue to increase our legal and financial compliance costs, has made and will continue to make some activities more difficult, time-consuming or costly, and has increased and will continue to increase demand on our systems and resources. Among other things, the Exchange Act requires that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and results of operations and maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. In order to maintain and, if required, improve our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting to meet this standard, significant resources and management oversight may be required. As a result, management\u2019s attention may be diverted from other business concerns, which could harm our business and results of operations. Although we have already hired additional employees to comply with these requirements, we may need to hire even more employees in the future, which will increase our costs and expenses.\nWe are subject to the independent auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (\"Section 404\"), enhanced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. While we were able to determine in our management's report for fiscal 2020 that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, as well as provide an unqualified attestation report from our independent registered public accounting firm to that effect, we have and will continue to consume management resources and incur significant expenses for Section 404 compliance on an ongoing basis. In the event that our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, or independent registered public accounting firm determines in the future that our internal control over financial reporting is not effective as defined under Section 404, we could be subject to one or more investigations or enforcement actions by state or federal regulatory agencies,\nstockholder lawsuits or other adverse actions requiring us to incur defense costs, pay fines, settlements or judgments and causing investor perceptions to be adversely affected and potentially resulting in a decline in the market price of our stock.\nIn addition, changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure are creating uncertainty for public companies, increasing legal and financial compliance costs, and making some activities more time consuming. These laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. We intend to invest resources to comply with evolving laws, regulations, and standards, and this investment will increase our general and administrative expense and a diversion of management\u2019s time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. If our efforts to comply with new laws, regulations, and standards are unsuccessful, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us and our business may be harmed.\nWe also expect that these new rules and regulations will make it more expensive for us to obtain and maintain director and officer liability insurance, and in the future, we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage. These factors could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified executive officers and members of our board of directors, particularly to serve on our audit committee and compensation committee.\nIn addition, as a result of our disclosure obligations as a public company, we have reduced strategic flexibility and are under pressure to focus on short-term results, which may adversely impact our ability to achieve long-term profitability.\nWe are obligated to maintain proper and effective internal control over financial reporting. We may not complete our analysis of our internal control over financial reporting in a timely manner, or this internal control may not be determined to be effective, which may adversely affect investor confidence in our Company and, as a result, the value of our common stock.\nWe are required, pursuant to the Exchange Act, to furnish a report by management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. This assessment will need to include disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our management in our internal control over financial reporting, as well as a statement that our auditors have issued an attestation report on our internal controls.\nWhile we were able to determine in our management's report for fiscal 2020 that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, as well as provide an unqualified attestation report from our independent registered public accounting firm to that effect, we may not be able to complete our evaluation, testing, and any required remediation in a timely fashion or our independent registered public accounting firm may not be able to formally attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in the future. During the evaluation and testing process, if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting that we are unable to remediate before the end of the same fiscal year in which the material weakness is identified, we will be unable to assert that our internal controls are effective. If we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to attest to the effectiveness of our internal controls or determine we have a material weakness in our internal controls, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which would cause the price of our common stock to decline.",

    "item_7": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following discussion focuses on our 2020 and 2019 financial condition and results of operations, including comparisons of the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. For discussion and analysis related to our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal year 2018, including comparisons of the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, refer to Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal year 2019, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 21, 2020.\nIn addition to historical financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those contained in or implied by any forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those under \u201cRisk Factors\u201d included in Part I, Item 1A or in other parts of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nWe provide a broad portfolio of cybersecurity products, SaaS solutions and services that allow organizations to prepare for, prevent, respond to, investigate and remediate cyber attacks. Our product, subscription and support solutions include security controls for network, email, endpoint and cloud security, forensics solutions, our extended detection and response (XDR) SaaS solution, our security validation SaaS solution, threat intelligence and analytics solutions, our Helix security operations platform, and managed services. Our products, SaaS solutions and managed services are complemented by our technology-enabled Mandiant consulting services, including incident response, security assessment and transformation services, training and education services and expertise on demand.\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) a global pandemic. We operate in geographic locations that have been impacted by COVID-19. The pandemic has impacted, and could further impact, our operations and the operations of our customers as a result of quarantines, various local, state and federal government public health orders, facility and business closures, and travel and logistics restrictions. While we instituted a global work-from-home policy and restricted employee travel to essential, business-critical trips toward the end of the first quarter of 2020, we were able to maintain strong customer relationships and deliver our technology-enabled managed and professional services to customers without interruption. As a result, we did not incur significant disruptions to our operations during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nWe anticipate governments and businesses may take additional actions or extend existing actions to respond to the risks of the COVID-19 pandemic. We continue to actively monitor the impacts and potential impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic in all aspects of our business. Although we are unable to predict the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, results of operations, liquidity or capital resources at this time, we expect we may be negatively affected if the pandemic and related public health measures result in substantial manufacturing or supply chain problems, disruptions in local and global economies, volatility in the global financial markets, overall reductions in demand, delays in payment, restrictions on the shipment of our products, or other ramifications from the COVID-19 pandemic. For a further discussion of the uncertainties and business risks associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, see the section entitled \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOn April 23, 2020, the Board of Directors of the Company approved a restructuring plan to streamline the Company\u2019s operations to more closely align expenses to the Company\u2019s projected revenue, position the Company for improved operating performance and allow the Company to increase investment in strategic growth areas of the business. This April 2020 restructuring plan resulted in the reduction of 6% of the Company\u2019s workforce as well as the exiting and downsizing of certain real estate facilities and the impairment of certain assets and consisted of severance, other one-time termination benefits and other restructuring related costs. These charges are primarily cash-based and have been recognized in the second quarter of 2020. This restructuring reduced total non-GAAP operating expenses by more than $26 million in 2020 compared to 2019. In August 2020 and in December 2020, we implemented additional restructuring plans, predominantly related to facilities and obsolete assets in order to position the Company for improved operating performance. These August and December 2020 restructuring plans resulted in the reduction of approximately 1% of the Company\u2019s workforce. The actions associated with the April 2020 restructuring plan were completed by the end of the second quarter of 2020 and the actions associated with the August 2020 and December 2020 restructuring plans were completed by the end of the third and fourth quarters of 2020, respectively.\nOur Business Model\nWe generate revenue from sales of FireEye products, our Mandiant SaaS and managed services and our Mandiant professional services. We disaggregate our revenue into two main categories: (i) product, subscription, and support and (ii) professional services. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, product, subscription and support revenue as a percentage of total revenue was 77%, 80% and 83%, respectively. Revenue from professional services was 23%, 20% and 17% of total revenue for December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. We further disaggregate revenue in the Product, subscription and support category into the Product and related subscription and support sub-category and Platform, cloud subscription and managed services sub-category.\nProduct, subscription and support\nWithin the product, subscription and support category, we provide supplemental data to distinguish between sales of our security control product solutions that are deployed on-premise (or in hybrid on-premise/private cloud configurations), and sales of our platform, cloud-based subscriptions and managed detection and response services. Security control product solutions deployed on-premise (or in hybrid on-premise/private cloud configurations) are included in the product and related subscription and support sub-category. Our security validation, Helix security operations platform, cloud-based security control products and cloud visibility solutions, detection-on-demand, threat intelligence subscriptions and detection and response managed services are included in the platform, cloud subscription and managed services sub-category. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, product and related subscription and support revenue as a percentage of total revenue was 45%, 53% and 60%, respectively. Revenue from platform, cloud subscription and managed services as a percent of total revenue was 32%, 27% and 23% for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nSales of our products, SaaS solutions and managed services initially increase our deferred revenue. Deferred revenue from our product, subscription and support sales totaled $845.3 million and $878.2 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The decrease in deferred revenue from our product, subscription and support sales was due primarily to a decrease in sales of our appliance hardware and attached DTI cloud and support subscriptions compared with prior periods.\nProduct and related subscription and support sub-category\nRevenue in the product and related subscription and support sub-category consists primarily of revenue from sales of our network, email and endpoint security solutions that are deployed on the customer's premise, either as an integrated security appliance or in distributed hybrid on-premise/private cloud configurations. Both deployment options are available on pre-configured appliance hardware or as virtual (software) sensors and include our detection and MVX analysis technologies, our DTI cloud updates and support services.\nIntegrated and distributed solutions deployed on virtual sensors are offered as an \u201call inclusive\u201d subscription that includes our detection and MVX analysis technologies, DTI cloud updates, and support services. There is no limit to the number of virtual sensors a customer can deploy, and capacity can be distributed throughout the customer\u2019s IT environment as needed. Subscription revenue is recognized ratably over the contractual term, typically one to three years. Customers purchasing our network and email security subscriptions have the option of purchasing our appliance hardware at additional cost, but are not required to do so.\nOur network and email security solutions can also be deployed on pre-configured appliance hardware purpose-built for our solutions. Integrated security appliance hardware is delivered with our detection and MVX analysis technologies pre-installed and require subscriptions to our DTI cloud updates and support services, which are priced as a percentage of the appliance price per year. Subscription terms are typically one to three years and include a material right of renewal. Historically, the majority of on-premise network and email security customers have purchased our security control products under this pricing model.\nSince our network, email and endpoint security solutions require regular DTI cloud and software updates to maintain detection efficacy, physical appliances and virtual sensors, together with the related DTI cloud and support subscriptions are considered a single performance obligation, whether deployed as an integrated appliance, virtual sensor or in a distributed hybrid on-premise/cloud configuration.\nAs a single performance obligation, revenue from sales of appliance hardware and related subscriptions is recognized ratably over the contractual term, typically one to three years. Such contracts typically contain a material right of renewal option that allows the customer to renew their DTI cloud and support subscriptions for an additional term at a discount to the original purchase price of the single performance obligation. For contracts that contain a material right of renewal option, the value of the performance obligation allocated to the renewal is recognized ratably over the period between the end of the initial contractual term and end of the estimated useful life of the related appliance and license. A small portion of our revenue in the product and related subscription and support revenue is derived from the sale of our network forensics appliances and our central management system appliances. These appliances are not dependent on regular security intelligence updates, and revenue from these appliances is therefore recognized when ownership is transferred to our customer, typically at shipment.\nPlatform, cloud subscriptions and managed services sub-category\nRevenue in the platform, cloud subscription and managed services sub-category consists primarily of revenue from sales of our cloud-based network, email and endpoint security, our detection-on-demand service, our security validation platform, our threat analytics platform (either standalone or within the Helix security platform), our Helix security operations platform, our standalone threat intelligence subscriptions and our managed services. The majority of revenue from our platform, cloud subscription and managed services category is recognized ratably over the contractual term, generally one to three years. A small portion of our revenue in the platform, cloud subscription and managed services category is derived from term licenses of our security validation platform, and revenue from these sales is recognized when the license key is issued to the customer.\nProfessional Services\nIn addition to our product, subscription and support solutions, we offer professional services, including incident response and other strategic security consulting services, to our customers who have experienced a cybersecurity breach or desire assistance assessing and increasing the resilience of their IT environments to cyber attack. The majority our professional services are offered on a time and materials basis, through a fixed fee arrangement, or on a retainer basis. Revenue from professional services is recognized as services are delivered. Revenue from our Expertise-on-Demand subscription and some pre-paid professional services is deferred, and revenue is recognized when services are delivered. Deferred revenue from professional services as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $111.2 million and $96.4 million, respectively.\nKey Business Metrics\nWe monitor our key business metrics set forth below to help us evaluate growth trends, establish budgets, measure the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts, and assess operational efficiencies. We discuss revenue and gross margin below under \u201cComponents of Operating Results.\u201d Deferred revenue, annualized recurring revenue, billings (a non-GAAP metric), net cash flow provided by (used in) operating activities, and free cash flow (a non-GAAP metric) are discussed immediately below the following table (in thousands, except percentages).\nYear Ended or as of December 31,\n2020 2019 2018\nProduct, subscription and support revenue\n$ 724,945 $ 708,836 $ 687,382\nProfessional services revenue\n215,639 180,316 143,568\nTotal revenue\n$ 940,584 $ 889,152 $ 830,950\nYear-over-year percentage increase\n6 % 7 % 7 %\nGross margin percentage\n64 % 65 % 67 %\nDeferred revenue (current and non-current)\n$ 956,457 $ 974,567 $ 934,828\nAnnualized recurring revenue\n$ 637,610 $ 591,923 $ 553,918\nBillings (non-GAAP)\n$ 919,810 $ 926,141 $ 855,678\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$ 94,895 $ 67,537 $ 17,381\nFree cash flow (non-GAAP)\n$ 68,569 $ 21,932 $ 10,125\nDeferred revenue. Our deferred revenue consists of amounts that we have the right to invoice but have not yet been recognized into revenue as of the end of the respective period. We monitor our deferred revenue balance because it represents a significant portion of revenue to be recognized in future periods. The majority of our deferred revenue consists of the unamortized balance of deferred revenue from previously invoiced sales of our security appliance hardware and non-cancelable contracts for subscriptions to our network, email and endpoint security solutions, Helix and security validation platforms, threat intelligence, managed detection and response services and support and maintenance contracts. Invoiced amounts for such contracts can be for multiple years, and we classify our deferred revenue as current or non-current depending on when we expect to recognize the related revenue. If the deferred revenue is expected to be recognized within 12 months it is classified as current, otherwise, the deferred revenue is classified as non-current. A table for our deferred revenue is provided below (in thousands):\nAs of December 31,\n2020 2019 2018\nDeferred revenue, current\n$ 613,709 $ 603,944 $ 556,815\nDeferred revenue, non-current\n342,748 370,623 378,013\nTotal deferred revenue\n$ 956,457 $ 974,567 $ 934,828\nAnnualized recurring revenue. Annualized recurring revenue (\"ARR\") is an operating metric and represents the annualized revenue run-rate of active term licenses, subscriptions, and support contracts at the end of a reporting period. ARR should be viewed independently of revenue and deferred revenue as ARR is an operating metric and is not intended to be combined with or replace these items. ARR is not a forecast of future revenue, which can be impacted by contract start and end dates and renewal rates, and does not include revenue from appliance hardware, perpetual software, consumption-based contracts or professional services except for service level agreement payments. We consider ARR a useful measure of the value of the recurring components of our business because it reflects both our ability to attract new customers for our solutions and our success at retaining and expanding our relationships with existing customers. Further, ARR is not impacted by variations in contract length, enabling more meaningful comparison to prior periods as we align our invoicing practices to growing customer preference for annual billing on multi-year contracts. We started including ARR from service level agreement payments in our ARR calculation starting in 2020 once they became material. ARR calculations for 2019 and 2018 have been updated for comparative purposes.\nWe disaggregate ARR by the same sub-categories we use for disaggregation of billings and revenue in the table below (in thousands):\nAs of December 31,\n2020 2019 2018\nProduct and related subscription and support\n$ 297,530 $ 307,718 $ 340,480\nPlatform, cloud subscription and managed services\n340,080 284,205 213,438\nTotal annualized recurring revenue\n$ 637,610 $ 591,923 $ 553,918\nBillings. Billings are a non-GAAP financial metric that we define as revenue recognized in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\") plus the change in deferred revenue from the beginning to the end of the period, excluding deferred revenue assumed through acquisitions. We monitor billings as a supplement to revenue (the corresponding GAAP measure), because billings impact our deferred revenue, which is an important indicator of the health and visibility of trends in our business and represents a significant percentage of future revenue. However, it is important to note that other companies, including companies in our industry, may not use billings, may define billings differently, may have different billing frequencies, or may use other financial measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of billings as a comparative measure. Additionally, the calculated billings metric represents the total contract value we have the right to invoice, which includes multi-year subscriptions to our solutions. Calculated billings are impacted by changes in average contract length, thereby reducing the usefulness of comparisons to prior periods.\nA reconciliation of billings to revenue, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, is provided below (in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2019 2018\nRevenue $ 940,584 $ 889,152 $ 830,950\nAdd: Deferred revenue, end of period 956,457 974,567 934,828\nLess: Deferred revenue, beginning of period (974,567) (934,828) (910,100)\nLess: Deferred revenue assumed through acquisitions (2,664) (2,750) -\nBillings (non-GAAP) $ 919,810 $ 926,141 $ 855,678\nWe have provided disaggregation of billings below (in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2019 2018\nProduct and related subscription and support $ 358,429 $ 434,533 $ 451,973\nPlatform, cloud subscription and managed services 330,965 282,238 243,903\nProduct, subscription and support 689,394 716,771 695,876\nProfessional services 230,416 209,370 159,802\nBillings (non-GAAP) $ 919,810 $ 926,141 $ 855,678\nNet cash provided by operating activities. We monitor net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our overall business performance. Our net cash provided by operating activities performance is driven in large part by sales of our products and from up-front payments for both subscriptions and support and maintenance services. Monitoring net cash provided by operating activities enables us to analyze our financial performance without the non-cash effects of certain items, such as depreciation, amortization and stock-based compensation costs, thereby allowing us to better understand and manage the cash needs of our business.\nFree cash flow. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure we define as net cash provided by operating activities, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, less purchases of property and equipment and demonstration units. We consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by our business that, after the purchases of property and equipment and demonstration units, can be used by us for strategic opportunities, including investing in our business, making strategic acquisitions and strengthening our balance sheet. However, it is important to note that other companies, including companies in our industry, may not use free cash flow, may calculate free cash flow differently, or may use other financial measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of free cash flow as a comparative measure. A reconciliation of free cash flow to cash flow provided by operating activities is provided below (in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2019 2018\nCash flow provided by operating activities\n$ 94,895 $ 67,537 $ 17,381\nAdd: deemed repayment of convertible senior notes attributable to accreted debt discount\n- - $ 43,575\nLess: purchase of property and equipment and demonstration units\n(26,326) (45,605) (50,831)\nFree cash flow (non-GAAP)\n$ 68,569 $ 21,932 $ 10,125\nNet cash used in investing activities $ (72,158) $ (169,036) $ (48,517)\nNet cash provided by financing activities\n$ 319,114 $ 26,273 $ 260,074\nFactors Affecting our Performance\nMarket Adoption. We rely on market education to raise awareness of today\u2019s cyber attacks and articulate the need for our products, solutions and services. Our prospective customers often do not have a specific portion of their IT budgets allocated for our advanced security solutions. Additionally, the markets for security validation software such as our Mandiant security validation platform (formerly Verodin Security Instrumentation Platform), security operations platforms such as FireEye Helix, and our Mandiant Defense extended detection and response solution (formerly Respond Analyst) are in the early stages of development.\nWe invest heavily in sales and marketing efforts to increase market awareness, educate prospective customers and drive adoption of our products, solutions and services. This market education is critical to creating new IT budget dollars or allocating more of existing IT budget dollars to advanced threat protection, security validation, security operations management solutions, and extended detection and response. The degree to which prospective customers recognize the mission critical need for our solutions will drive our ability to acquire new customers and increase renewals and follow-on sales opportunities, which, in turn, will affect our future financial performance.\nSales Productivity. Our sales organization consists of in-house sales teams who work in collaboration with external channel partners to identify new sales prospects, sell additional products, subscriptions and services, and provide post-sale support. Our direct sales teams are organized by territory to target large enterprise and government customers who typically have sales cycles that can last several months or more. We have also expanded our inside sales teams to work with channel partners to expand our customer base of small and medium enterprises, or SMEs, as well as manage renewals of subscription and support contracts.\nNewly hired sales and marketing employees typically require several months to establish prospect relationships and achieve full sales productivity. In addition, although we believe our investments in market education have increased awareness of us and our solutions globally, sales teams in certain international markets may face local markets with limited awareness of us and our solutions, or have specific requirements that are not available with our solutions. These factors will influence the timing and overall levels of sales productivity, impacting the rate at which we will be able to convert prospects to sales and drive revenue growth.\nCustomer Acquisition and Retention. Since we expect that our existing customers are likely to expand their deployments and purchase additional solutions from us over time, we believe new customer acquisition and retention of existing customers is important to expanding the value of our installed base, which we monitor through our key business metrics, including annualized recurring revenue. We believe our ability to maintain strong customer retention and drive new customer acquisition will have a material impact on future sales of our security solutions and services and therefore our future financial performance.\nFollow-On Sales. To grow our revenue, it is important that our customers make additional purchases of our products, subscriptions and services. After the initial sale to a new customer, we focus on expanding our relationship with the customer to sell additional products, subscriptions and services. Sales to our existing customer base can take the form of incremental sales of our solutions, managed services, and professional services either to expand their deployment of our technologies, to extend their internal security resources with our managed and professional security services, or continuously measure the effectiveness of their security controls. Our opportunity to expand our customer relationships through follow-on sales will increase as we add new customers, broaden our security solutions portfolio with additional subscriptions and services and enhance the functionality of our existing solutions. Follow-on sales lead to increased revenue over the lifecycle of a customer relationship and can significantly increase the return on our sales and marketing investments. With many of our large enterprise and government customers, we have realized follow-on sales that were multiples of the value of their initial purchases.\nComponents of Operating Results\nRevenue\nWe generate revenue from the sales of our products, subscriptions and services. Revenue is recognized when a contract has been entered into with a customer, the performance obligation(s) is (are) identified, the transaction price is determined and has been allocated to the performance obligation(s) and only then for each performance obligation after we have satisfied that performance obligation.\n\u2022Product, subscription and support revenue. Our product, subscription and support revenue is generated from sales of our network, email, and endpoint security solutions deployed on the customer's premise (or in a hybrid on-premise/private cloud deployment), as well as our cloud-based security solutions, threat intelligence subscriptions, security validation and Helix security platforms, and managed detection and response services.\nWe combine our virtual sensors and physical appliances and software licenses with mandatory subscriptions to our DTI cloud updates and support services as a single performance obligation. As a result, we recognize revenue for this single performance obligation ratably over the contractual term. Contracts containing this single performance obligation typically contain a material right of renewal option. For contracts that contain a material right of renewal option, the allocated value of the performance obligation is recognized ratably over the period between the end of the initial contractual term and the end of the estimated useful life of the related appliance and license. Significant judgment is required in estimating the useful life of our intelligence dependent appliances and assessing the material rights associated with such products.\nRevenue from our security validation and platform solutions, subscriptions to our cloud-based security and intelligence solutions, and our managed detection and response services is recognized ratably over the contractual term, typically one to three years.\n\u2022Professional services revenue. Professional services, which includes incident response, security assessments, and other strategic security consulting services, are offered on a time-and-material basis, through a fixed fee arrangement, or on a retainer basis. We recognize the associated revenue as the services are delivered. Some professional services and our Expertise-on-Demand subscription are prepaid, and revenue is deferred until services are delivered.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2020, we experienced an attack from a highly sophisticated threat actor that targeted and accessed certain Red Team assessment tools that we use to test our customers' security. This security incident did not have a material impact to our revenues in the fourth quarter or for the year ended December 31, 2020. In addition, we do not expect the incident to materially impact our revenues going forward.\nCost of Revenue\nOur total cost of revenue consists of cost of product, subscription and support revenue and cost of professional services revenue.\n\u2022Cost of product, subscription and support revenue. Cost of product, subscription and support revenue primarily consists of costs paid to our third-party contract manufacturers for our appliances, other costs in our manufacturing operations department, personnel costs associated with maintaining our threat intelligence, managed detection and response services, and global customer support operations, and hosting costs paid to third party cloud platform providers. Personnel costs associated with our manufacturing operations department, our threat intelligence, our managed detection and response services and our global customer support organization consist of salaries, benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation. Overhead costs consist of certain facilities, depreciation and information technology costs. Our cost of product, subscription and support revenue also includes product testing costs, shipping costs and allocated overhead costs. If revenue from sales of product, subscriptions and support declines, the cost of product, subscription and support revenue may increase as a percentage of product, subscription and support revenue due to the fixed nature of a portion of these costs. Additionally, our appliance related cost of goods sold is capitalized and amortized on a systematic basis that is consistent with the pattern of transfer to which the asset relates.\n\u2022Cost of professional services revenue. Cost of professional services revenue primarily consists of personnel costs for our services organization and allocated overhead costs. If sales of our professional services decline or we are unable to maintain our chargeability rates, our cost of professional services revenue may increase as a percentage of professional services revenue.\nGross Margin\nGross margin, or gross profit as a percentage of revenue, has been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors, including our average selling prices, the mix between products, subscription and support and services sold, the mix of revenue among products, subscriptions and services and manufacturing costs. We expect our gross margins to fluctuate slightly over time depending on these factors.\nOperating Expenses\nOur operating expenses consist of research and development, sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses. Personnel costs are the most significant component of operating expenses and consist of salaries, benefits, bonuses, stock-based compensation and, with regard to sales and marketing expense, sales commissions. Operating expenses also include allocated overhead costs consisting of certain facilities, depreciation and information technology costs.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2020, we experienced an attack from a highly sophisticated threat actor that targeted and accessed certain Red Team assessment tools that we use to test our customers' security. This security incident did not have a material impact to our operating expenses in the fourth quarter or for the year ended December 31, 2020. In addition, we do not expect the incident to materially impact our operating expenses in future periods.\n\u2022Research and development. Research and development expense consists primarily of personnel costs and allocated overhead. Research and development expense also includes prototype related expenses. We expect research and development expense to increase in terms of absolute dollars and remain relatively flat or decrease slightly as a percentage of total revenue.\n\u2022Sales and marketing. Sales and marketing expense consists primarily of personnel costs, incentive commission costs and allocated overhead. Commission costs are capitalized and amortized based on the useful life amortization period, taking into consideration the pattern of transfer to which the asset relates and the expected renewal periods during which renewal commissions are not commensurate with the initial commissions paid. When initial commissions are higher than (not-commensurate with) renewal commissions, we recognize the incremental portion of initial commissions over an estimated renewal period. The commensurate portion will be recognized over the same period as the initial revenue arrangement to which it relates.\nSales and marketing expense also includes costs for market development programs, promotional and other marketing activities, travel, depreciation of proof-of-concept evaluation units and outside consulting costs. These costs are recognized as incurred. We expect sales and marketing expense to increase in absolute dollars and remain relatively flat or decrease slightly as a percentage of total revenue.\n\u2022General and administrative. General and administrative expense consists of personnel costs, professional service costs and allocated overhead. General and administrative personnel include our executive, finance, human resources, facilities and legal organizations. Professional service costs consist primarily of legal, auditing, accounting and other consulting costs. We expect general and administrative expense to stay relatively flat in terms of absolute dollars and remain relatively flat or decrease slightly as a percentage of total revenue.\n\u2022Restructuring Charges. In April 2020, August 2020 and December 2020, we implemented restructuring plans designed to align our resources with the strategic initiatives of the business. These restructuring plans resulted in a reduction of 7% of our total workforce as well as the exiting and downsizing of certain real estate facilities and the impairment of certain assets. The expenses incurred primarily consisted of employee severance charges and other termination benefits, as well as real estate and related fixed asset charges for the consolidation or exiting of certain leased facilities.\nInterest Income\nInterest income consists of interest earned on our cash and cash equivalent and investment balances. We have historically invested our cash in money-market funds and other short-term, high quality securities. We expect interest income to vary each reporting period depending on our average cash and cash equivalent and investment balances during the respective reporting periods, types and mix of investments and market interest rates.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense consists primarily of interest at the stated rate (coupon) and amortization of discounts and issuance costs relating to our convertible notes. We expect interest expense to decrease slightly as a result of the repurchase of Series A Notes in June of 2020.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther income (expense), net includes gains or losses on the disposal of fixed assets, gains or losses from our equity-method investment, gains or losses on the extinguishment of convertible notes, foreign currency re-measurement gains and losses and foreign currency transaction gains and losses. We expect other income (expense), net to fluctuate primarily as a result of foreign exchange rate movements.\nProvision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes\nProvision for income taxes relates primarily to income taxes payable in foreign jurisdictions where we conduct business, withholding taxes, and state income taxes in the United States. The provision is offset by tax benefits primarily related to the reversal of valuation allowances previously established against our deferred tax assets. Should the tax benefits exceed the provision, then a net tax benefit from income taxes is reflected for the period. Income in certain countries may be taxed at statutory tax rates that are lower than the U.S. statutory tax rate. As a result, our overall effective tax rate over the long-term may be lower than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate due to net income being subject to foreign income tax rates that are lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate.\nResults of Operations\nThe following tables summarize our results of operations for the periods presented and as a percentage of our total revenue for those periods. The period-to-period comparison of results is not necessarily indicative of results for future periods.\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2019 2018\n(In thousands)\nRevenue:\nProduct, subscription and support $ 724,945 $ 708,836 $ 687,382\nProfessional services 215,639 180,316 143,568\nTotal revenue 940,584 889,152 830,950\nCost of revenue:\nProduct, subscription and support 217,255 210,432 188,301\nProfessional services 116,772 98,460 84,174\nTotal cost of revenue 334,027 308,892 272,475\nTotal gross profit 606,557 580,260 558,475\nOperating expenses:\nResearch and development 252,771 271,326 254,142\nSales and marketing 380,998 396,822 380,962\nGeneral and administrative 101,452 111,881 105,773\nRestructuring charges 26,507 10,265 -\nTotal operating expenses 761,728 790,294 740,877\nOperating loss (155,171) (210,034) (182,402)\nInterest income 11,325 22,017 16,033\nInterest expense (60,066) (61,927) (56,426)\nOther expense, net (497) (1,775) (14,804)\nLoss before income taxes (204,409) (251,719) (237,599)\nProvision for income taxes 2,894 5,690 5,524\nNet loss $ (207,303) $ (257,409) $ (243,123)\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2019 2018\n(Percent of total revenue)\nRevenue:\nProduct, subscription and support 77 % 80 % 83 %\nProfessional services 23 20 17\nTotal revenue 100 100 100\nCost of revenue:\nProduct, subscription and support 23 24 23\nProfessional services 12 11 10\nTotal cost of revenue 36 35 33\nTotal gross profit 64 65 67\nOperating expenses:\nResearch and development 27 31 31\nSales and marketing 41 45 46\nGeneral and administrative 11 13 13\nRestructuring charges 3 1 -\nTotal operating expenses 81 89 89\nOperating loss (16) (24) (22)\nInterest income 1 2 2\nInterest expense (6) (7) (7)\nOther expense, net - - (2)\nLoss before income taxes (22) (29) (29)\nProvision for income taxes - 1 1\nNet loss (22) % (29) % (29) %\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019\nRevenue\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2019 Change\nAmount % of Total Revenue Amount % of Total Revenue Amount %\n(Dollars in thousands)\nRevenue:\nProduct, subscription and support $ 724,945 77 % $ 708,836 80 % $ 16,109 2 %\nProfessional services 215,639 23 180,316 20 35,323 20\nTotal revenue $ 940,584 100 % $ 889,152 100 % $ 51,432 6 %\nProduct, subscription and services by type:\nProduct and related subscription and support $ 422,812 45 % $ 467,823 53 % $ (45,011) (10) %\nPlatform, cloud subscription and managed services 302,133 32 241,013 27 61,120 25\nTotal product, subscription and support $ 724,945 77 % $ 708,836 80 % $ 16,109 2 %\nRevenue by geographic region:\nUnited States $ 584,696 62 % $ 554,856 63 % $ 29,840 5 %\nEMEA 158,560 17 155,357 17 3,203 2\nAPAC 140,492 15 131,361 15 9,131 7\nOther 56,836 6 47,578 5 9,258 19\nTotal revenue $ 940,584 100 % $ 889,152 100 % $ 51,432 6 %\nProduct, subscription and support revenue increased by $16.1 million, or 2%, during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was comprised of platform, cloud subscription and managed services of $61.1 million offset by a decrease in product and related subscription and support revenue of $45.0 million. The increase in platform, cloud subscription and managed services reflected increased amortization of deferred revenue associated with increased sales of our threat intelligence subscriptions, our cloud-based email and endpoint security, our validation platform solutions, our Helix platform, and our Managed Defense managed security service. The decrease in product and related subscription and support revenue was primarily due to a decrease in the product and related subscription and support deferred revenue, from which revenue is recognized. The decrease in deferred revenue reflected a decrease in sales of our on-premise solutions as customers migrate to cloud-based solutions.\nProfessional services revenue increased by $35.3 million, or 20%, during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in number of engagements enabled by an increase in professional services personnel as compared to the same period in 2019.\nOur international revenue increased $21.6 million, or 6%, during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase reflects growth in sales from certain international regions compared to prior periods as a result of an increase in revenue recognized from a build-up of deferred revenue from prior periods.\nCost of Revenue and Gross Margin\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2019 Change\nAmount Gross\nMargin Amount Gross\nMargin Amount %\n(Dollars in thousands)\nCost of revenue:\nProduct, subscription and support $ 217,255 $ 210,432 $ 6,823 3 %\nProfessional services 116,772 98,460 18,312 19\nTotal cost of revenue $ 334,027 $ 308,892 $ 25,135 8 %\nGross margin:\nProduct, subscription and support 70 % 70 %\nProfessional services 46 % 45 %\nTotal gross margin 64 % 65 %\nThe cost of product, subscription and support revenue increased $6.8 million, or 3%, during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in cost of product, subscription and support revenue was primarily driven by a $14.0 million increase in personnel costs due to increased headcount and an $11.0 million increase in third-party hosting costs associated with higher sales of cloud-based solutions which were partially offset by a $9.1 million decrease in intangible amortization, a $4.0 million decrease in depreciation and a $1.6 million decrease in travel and entertainment expense which we attribute to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe cost of professional services revenue increased $18.3 million, or 19%, during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in cost of professional services revenue was primarily driven by an $18.6 million increase in personnel costs due to increased headcount, and a $4.7 million increase in stock-based compensation expense which were partially offset by a $7.2 million decrease in travel and entertainment expense which we attribute to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nGross margin was lower for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.\nOperating Expenses\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2019 Change\nAmount % of Total Revenue Amount % of Total Revenue Amount %\n(Dollars in thousands)\nOperating expenses:\nResearch and development $ 252,771 27 % $ 271,326 31 % $ (18,555) (7) %\nSales and marketing 380,998 41 396,822 45 (15,824) (4)\nGeneral and administrative 101,452 11 111,881 13 (10,429) (9)\nRestructuring 26,507 3 10,265 1 16,242 158\nTotal operating expenses $ 761,728 81 % $ 790,294 89 % $ (28,566) (4) %\nIncludes stock-based compensation expense of:\nResearch and development $ 45,867 $ 45,476\nSales and marketing 49,662 49,198\nGeneral and administrative 25,176 29,966\nRestructuring 314 -\nTotal $ 121,019 $ 124,640\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expense decreased $18.6 million, or 7%, during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily due to a $9.0 million decrease in personnel costs due to lower headcount, a $2.9 million decrease in travel and entertainment expense which we attribute to the COVID-19 pandemic, a $2.6 million decrease in\nthird party hosting services, a $1.0 million decrease in professional services and a $1.1 million decrease in telecommunication and software costs.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expense decreased by $15.8 million, or 4%, during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in personnel costs of $13.0 million due to lower headcount, a $15.0 million decrease in travel and entertainment expense which we attribute to the COVID-19 pandemic, a $5.0 million decrease in marketing programs, partially offset by a $1.0 million increase in intangible amortization and a $14.0 million increase in commissions.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expense decreased $10 million, or 9%, during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily due to a $2.0 million decrease in personnel costs due to lower headcount, a $1.0 million decrease in travel and entertainment expense which we attribute to the COVID-19 pandemic, a $2.0 million decrease in professional services costs and a $5.0 million decrease in stock-based compensation.\nInterest Income\nYear Ended December 31,\nChange\n2020 2019 Amount %\n(Dollars in thousands)\nInterest income\n$ 11,325 $ 22,017 $ (10,692) (49) %\nInterest income decreased for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to a lower rate of return on balances in our cash and cash equivalents and investments and overall decrease in our investment balance.\nInterest Expense\nYear Ended December 31,\nChange\n2020 2019 Amount %\n(Dollars in thousands)\nInterest expense\n(60,066) (61,927) $ 1,861 (3) %\nInterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 as a portion of our convertible senior notes were repurchased in June 2020.

The decrease in the provision for income taxes for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 was primarily due to lower foreign\ntaxes and reversal of a valuation allowance in connection with the acquisitions. Due to cumulative losses, we maintain a full valuation allowance on all of our U.S. and certain foreign deferred tax assets. The tax expense for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was primarily comprised of income taxes in foreign jurisdictions and withholding taxes.\nQuarterly Results of Operations\nThe following unaudited quarterly statements of operations data for each of the eight quarters in the period ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 have been prepared on a basis consistent with our audited annual financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and include, in our opinion, all normal recurring adjustments necessary for the fair presentation of the financial information contained in those statements. Our historical results are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected in the future. The following quarterly financial data should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements and the related notes included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31, 2020 September 30, 2020 June 30, 2020 March 31, 2020 December 31, 2019 September 30, 2019 June 30, 2019 March 31, 2019\n(Dollars in thousands)\nRevenue:\nProduct, subscription and support $ 189,721 $ 183,836 $ 177,305 $ 174,083 $ 185,008 $ 179,823 $ 174,102 $ 169,903\nProfessional services 57,781 54,624 52,595 50,639 50,078 46,091 43,506 40,641\nTotal revenue 247,502 238,460 229,900 224,722 235,086 225,914 217,608 210,544\nCost of revenue:\nProduct, subscription and support 55,160 54,933 54,026 53,136 54,494 54,272 53,198 48,468\nProfessional Services 31,883 29,473 26,967 28,450 26,217 24,948 24,195 23,100\nTotal cost of revenue 87,043 84,406 80,993 81,586 80,711 79,220 77,393 71,568\nTotal gross profit 160,459 154,054 148,907 143,136 154,375 146,694 140,215 138,976\nOperating expenses:\nResearch and development 63,009 61,662 60,596 67,503 67,537 68,857 67,538 67,394\nSales and marketing 96,796 93,961 90,042 100,200 93,077 98,355 101,494 103,896\nGeneral and administrative 25,646 23,096 25,281 27,429 28,862 27,717 27,926 27,376\nRestructuring charges 1,487 1,488 12,558 10,974 (15) 6,481 - 3,799\nTotal operating expenses 186,938 180,207 188,477 206,106 189,461 201,410 196,958 202,465\nOperating loss (26,479) (26,153) (39,570) (62,970) (35,086) (54,716) (56,743) (63,489)\nInterest income 1,875 2,164 2,863 4,424 4,758 5,275 6,137 5,848\nInterest expense (14,511) (14,353) (15,356) (15,846) (15,703) (15,554) (15,407) (15,263)\nOther income (expense), net 454 157 (119) (989) (757) 40 (770) (288)\nLoss before income taxes (38,661) (38,185) (52,182) (75,381) (46,788) (64,955) (66,783) (73,192)\nProvision for income taxes (58) 933 1,094 925 2,428 541 540 2,182\nNet loss $ (38,603) $ (39,118) $ (53,276) $ (76,306) $ (49,216) $ (65,496) $ (67,323) $ (75,374)\nDividend on series A convertible preferred stock (1,050) - - - - - - -\nAccretion of series A convertible preferred stock (4,653) - - - - - - -\nNet loss attributable to common stockholders, basic and diluted $ (44,306) $ (39,118) $ (53,276) $ (76,306) $ (49,216) $ (65,496) $ (67,323) $ (75,374)\nNet loss per share attributable to common stockholders, basic and diluted $ (0.19) $ (0.17) $ (0.24) $ (0.35) $ (0.23) $ (0.31) $ (0.33) $ (0.38)\nWeighted average shares used to compute net loss per share, basic and diluted 229,203 224,807 221,352 217,789 214,565 212,207 204,109 197,819\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31, 2020 September 30, 2020 June 30, 2020 March 31, 2020 December 31, 2019 September 30, 2019 June 30, 2019 March 31, 2019\n(Percent of total revenue)\nRevenue:\nProduct, subscription and support 77% 77 % 77 % 77 % 79 % 80 % 80 % 81\nProfessional services 23 23 23 23 21 20 20 19\nTotal revenue 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100\nCost of revenue:\nProduct, subscription and support 22 23 23 24 23 24 24 23\nProfessional services 13 12 12 13 11 11 11 11\nTotal cost of revenue 35 35 35 37 34 35 35 34\nTotal gross profit 65 65 65 63 66 65 65 66\nOperating expenses:\nResearch and development 25 26 26 30 29 30 31 32\nSales and marketing 39 39 39 45 40 44 47 49\nGeneral and administrative 10 10 11 12 12 12 13 13\nRestructuring charges 1 1 5 5 - 3 - 2\nTotal operating expenses 75 76 81 92 81 89 91 96\nOperating loss (11) (11) (16) (29) (15) (24) (26) (30)\nInterest income 1 1 1 2 2 2 3 3\nInterest expense (6) (6) (7) (7) (7) (7) (7) (7)\nOther income (expense), net - - - - - - - -\nLoss before income taxes (16) (16) (22) (34) (20) (29) (30) (34)\nProvision for income taxes - - - - 1 - - 1\nNet loss (16)% (16) % (22) % (34) % (21) % (29) % (30) % (35)\nQuarterly Revenue Trends\nOur quarterly revenue increased year-over-year for all periods presented, reflecting increased amortization of revenue from higher deferred revenue compared with the year-ago period, as well as increased capacity in professional services. The increase in deferred revenue was due to increased sales of our cloud-based security solutions, as well as our threat intelligence and managed detection and response services, partially offset by decreases in deferred revenue related to prior sales of appliance-based security solutions with attached subscriptions.\nSequentially, our subscription and services revenues continued to increase each quarter presented. The sequential growth was due to increased amortization of deferred revenue associated with higher deferred revenue, which was primarily due to growth in sales of cloud-based security solutions, threat intelligence, and managed detection and response services, as well as increased professional services revenue.\nWe expect the decline in deferred revenue associated with on-premise appliance-based solutions (and the related attached subscriptions and support) to continue, with the decrease offset by increases in deferred revenue from sales of new \u201call-inclusive\u201d subscriptions to our network, email and endpoint security solutions (with or without appliance hardware), as well as from increases in sales of our platform, cloud subscriptions and managed services and professional services.\nQuarterly Gross Margin Trends\nConsistent with increases in our quarterly revenue, quarterly gross profit increased year-over-year for all periods presented. Total gross margin, or gross profit as a percentage of revenue, decreased year-over-year in the first and fourth quarters of 2020, however remained flat for the second and third quarters of 2020. Gross margin increased year-over-year in the first quarter of 2019. Gross margin declined year-over-year in the second, third and fourth quarters of 2019 due to an increase in professional services revenue as a percentage of total revenue and increased public cloud hosting costs associated with higher sales of cloud-based solutions and the transition of in-house data centers to a third party cloud platform. We expect the cost of hosting our solutions on third-party cloud platforms will increase in absolute dollars as revenue from our cloud-based solutions increases, which could result in fluctuations in our quarterly gross margins in the future.\nQuarterly Expense Trends\nFor 2019 and 2020, total operating expenses were highest in the first quarter and trended down sequentially as employee-related payroll costs declined.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of December 31,\n2020 2019\n(In thousands)\nCash and cash equivalents\n$ 676,454 $ 334,603\nShort-term investments\n$ 624,824 $ 704,955\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2019 2018\n(In thousands)\nCash provided by operating activities\n$ 94,895 $ 67,537 $ 17,381\nCash used in investing activities\n(72,158) (169,036) (48,517)\nCash provided by financing activities\n319,114 26,273 260,074\nNet increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents\n$ 341,851 $ (75,226) $ 228,938\nAs of December 31, 2020, our cash and cash equivalents of $676.5 million were held for working capital, capital expenditures, investment in technology, debt servicing and business acquisition purposes, of which approximately $100.7 million was held outside of the United States. We consider the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as of December 31, 2020 to be indefinitely reinvested outside the United States on the basis of estimates that future domestic cash generation will be sufficient to meet future domestic cash needs and our plan for reinvestment of our foreign subsidiaries\u2019 undistributed earnings.\nDuring the three months ended June 30, 2018, we issued $600.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 2024 Notes and received net proceeds of $584.4 million after deducting the initial purchasers' discount and the issuance costs. In conjunction with the issuance of the 2024 Notes, we used approximately $65.2 million of the net proceeds to enter into the capped call transactions. In addition, we used approximately $330.4 million of the net proceeds to repurchase a portion of the principal amount outstanding of the Series A Notes. Refer to Note 10 contained in the \"Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\" included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information on the 2024 Notes, the capped call transactions and the Series A Notes.\nIn December 2020, we issued and sold 400,000 shares of a newly designated 4.5% Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.0001 per share, at a price of $1,000 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of $400.0 million.\nIn November 2020, we acquired Respond Software, a cybersecurity investigation automation company. In connection with this acquisition, we paid cash consideration of $116.1 million and assumed $5.0 million in net tangible liabilities.\nIn January 2020, we acquired Cloudvisory, a provider of cloud visibility and control solutions. Total consideration for the acquisition was $13.2 million in cash. We also assumed $0.3 million in net tangible liabilities.\nIn May 2019, we acquired Verodin, a security instrumentation platform company. As consideration for the acquisition, we paid $143.7 million in cash, issued 8,404,609 shares of our common stock with an estimated fair value of $119.7 million and recognized $1.5 million of the fair value of assumed stock options attributable to pre-combination services.\nOur principal sources of liquidity are existing cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments and any cash inflow from operations, which we believe will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next 12 months. While we have experienced delays in collections which we attribute to the COVID-19 pandemic, we believe we will be able to manage liquidity to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next 12 months. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our growth rate, the timing and extent of spending to support development efforts, the efficiency of our marketing and sales activities, the introduction of new and enhanced product and service offerings, the cost of any future acquisitions of technology or businesses, and the continuing market acceptance of our products. In the event that additional financing is required from outside sources, we may not be able to raise such financing on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired, our business, operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected.\nOperating Activities\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, our operating activities provided cash of $94.9 million. We incurred a net loss of $207.3 million, which included net non-cash expenses of $305.4 million, primarily consisting of stock-based compensation charges and depreciation, amortization expense and non-cash interest expense related to convertible senior notes. Our net change in operating\nassets and liabilities provided cash of $3.2 million, primarily related to a decrease in deferred revenue of $20.8 million, a decrease in accounts payable of $18.9 million, an increase in prepaid expenses of $3.6 million, an increase in accounts receivable of $16.7 million, a decrease in accrued liabilities of $6.7 million, a decrease in long term liabilities of $16.5 million, an increase in inventories of $3.3 million and an increase in accrued compensation of $36.2 million.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, our operating activities provided cash of $67.5 million. We incurred a net loss of $257.4 million, which included net non-cash expenses of $305.5 million, primarily consisting of stock-based compensation charges, depreciation and amortization expense. Our net change in operating assets and liabilities used cash of $19.5 million, primarily related to reductions in deferred revenue of $37.0 million, an increase in accounts payables of $4.7 million, an increase in prepaid expenses of $7.0 million, which was partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable of $12.1 million, a decrease in accrued liabilities of $3.1 million, a decrease in long term liabilities of $9.8 million and a decrease in accrued compensation of $4.3 million.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, our operating activities provided cash of $17.4 million. We incurred a net loss of $243.1 million, which included net non-cash expenses of $298.0 million, primarily consisting of stock-based compensation charges, depreciation, amortization expense and loss on the repurchase of our Series A Notes. As required under ASU 2016-15, we classified $43.6 million of the $330.4 million Series A Notes cash repayment as an amount deemed repayment of Series A Notes accreted debt discount as a cash outflow for operating activities. Our net change in operating assets and liabilities provided cash of $6.1 million, primarily related to reductions in deferred revenue of $24.7 million, due to amortization, an increase in prepaid expenses of $13.8 million due to prepayment of commissions, an increase in accounts receivable of $11.6 million due to increased sales and a decrease in accounts payables of $8.2 million.\nInvesting Activities\nCash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2020 was $72.2 million, primarily for capital expenditures to purchase property and equipment and demonstration units of $26.3 million, $123.7 million net of cash acquired for the acquisition of Cloudvisory and Respond Software and $1.0 million used for the purchase of an investment in a privately held company offset by $29.2 million provided by the sale of short term investments and net maturities of short-term investments of $50.0 million.\nCash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2019 was $169.0 million, primarily for capital expenditures to purchase property and equipment and demonstration units of $45.6 million, net maturities of short-term investments of $3.4 million and cash used in the acquisition of Verodin.\nCash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2018 was $48.5 million, primarily for capital expenditures to purchase property and equipment and demonstration units, net purchases of short-term investments and cash used to acquire The Email Laundry.\nFinancing Activities\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, financing activities provided $319.1 million in cash, primarily from proceeds of $395.3 million received from the issuance of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, proceeds of $22.2 million from employee purchases of shares under our 2013 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (\"ESPP\") and $7.3 million from exercises of employee stock options primarily offset by the repurchase of convertible senior notes of $96.4 million and payments related to shares withheld for taxes.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, financing activities provided $26.3 million in cash, primarily from proceeds of $22.1 million from employee purchases of shares under our ESPP and $4.2 million from exercises of employee stock options.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, financing activities provided $260.1 million in cash, primarily from proceeds of $584.4 million received from the issuance of our 2024 Notes, $20.8 million from employee purchases of shares under our ESPP and $6.9 million from exercises of employee stock options. These proceeds were partially offset by the $286.8 million cash outflow attributable to the aggregate principal of the Series A Notes repurchased and $65.2 million for the purchase of the privately negotiated capped calls that cap the dilutive effects related to our 2024 Notes if the stock price exceeds the conversion price of the 2024 Notes.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nThe following summarizes our contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2020:\nPayments Due by Period\nTotal\nLess Than\n1 Year 1 - 3 Years\n3 - 5 Years More Than\n5 Years\n(In thousands)\nConvertible Notes $ 1,134,278 $ 12,959 $ 25,919 $ 1,095,400 $ -\nOperating leases 70,609 16,537 22,647 17,054 14,371\nPurchase obligations 16,227 6,858 9,342 27 -\nContract manufacturer commitments 5,996 5,996 - - -\nTotal $ 1,227,110 $ 42,350 $ 57,908 $ 1,112,481 $ 14,371\nTotal future payments related to our Convertible Notes of $1,134 million shown in the table above is composed of $23.4 million principal amount of Series A Notes, $460 million principal amount of Series B Notes, $600 million principal amount of 2024 Notes and future interest payments of $50.8 million. Although the 2035 Notes have a stated maturity of June 1, 2035, they have been reflected in the table above assuming repurchase on June 1, 2020 in the case of the Series A Notes and June 1, 2022 in the case of the Series B Notes (the first date holders have the right to require us to repurchase all or any portion of their Convertible Senior Notes) at 100% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest as of these dates.\nDue to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2020, we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities. Therefore, approximately $2.0 million of unrecognized tax benefits classified as \u201cOther long-term liabilities\u201d in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2020, have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2020, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as structured finance or special purpose entities, which were established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other purposes.\nSegment Information\nWe have one primary business activity and operate in one reportable segment.\nConcentration\nFor the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, one distributor represented 13% and 20%, respectively, of the Company's total revenue, but did not represent 10% or greater of the Company's total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020, and one reseller represented 15%, 14% and 15%, respectively, of the Company's total revenue. Additionally, another distributor represented 12% and 10%, respectively, of the Company's total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, but did not represent 10% or greater of the Company's total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nOur agreements with the distributors and reseller were made in the ordinary course of our business and may be terminated with or without cause by either party with advance notice. Although we believe we would experience some short-term disruption in the distribution of our products and subscriptions and services if these agreements were terminated, we believe such termination would not have a long-term material adverse effect on our financial results and that alternative resellers and other channel partners exist who would be able to deliver our products to our end-customers.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Actual results may differ from these estimates. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and our actual results, our future financial statements will be affected.\nThe critical accounting policies requiring estimates, assumptions, and judgments that we believe have the most significant impact on our consolidated financial statements are described below.\nRevenue from Contracts with Customers\nRevenue is recognized when all of the following criteria are met:\n\u2022Identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer - A contract with a customer exists when (i) we enter into an enforceable contract with a customer that defines each party\u2019s rights regarding the goods or services to be transferred and identifies the payment terms related to these goods or services, (ii) the contract has commercial substance and the parties are committed to perform, and (iii) we determine that collection of substantially all consideration to which it will be entitled in exchange for goods or services that will be transferred is probable based on the customer\u2019s intent and ability to pay the promised consideration.\n\u2022Identification of the performance obligations in the contract - Performance obligations promised in a contract are identified based on the goods or services that will be transferred to the customer that are both capable of being distinct, whereby the customer can benefit from the goods or service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available from third parties or from us, and are distinct in the context of the contract, whereby the transfer of the goods or services is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. To the extent a contract includes multiple promised goods or services, we apply judgment to determine whether promised goods or services are capable of being distinct and distinct in the context of the contract. If these criteria are not met the promised goods or services are accounted for as a combined performance obligation.\n\u2022Determination of the transaction price - The transaction price is determined based on the consideration to which we will be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to the customer adjusted for estimated variable consideration, if any. We typically estimate the transaction price impact of discounts offered to the customers for early payments on receivables or rebates based on channel partner sales achievements. Constraints are applied when estimating variable considerations based on historical experience where applicable.\n\u2022Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract - If the contract contains a single performance obligation, the entire transaction price is allocated to the single performance obligation. Contracts that contain multiple performance obligations require an allocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation based on a relative standalone selling price (\"SSP\") basis. Determination of SSP requires judgment. We determine standalone selling price taking into account available information such as historical selling prices of the performance obligation, geographic location, overall strategic pricing objective, market conditions and internally approved pricing guidelines related to the performance obligations.\n\u2022Recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy performance obligations - We satisfy performance obligations either over time or at a point in time as discussed in further detail below. Revenue is recognized at or over the time the related performance obligation is satisfied by transferring a promised good or service to a customer.\nNature of Products and Services\nWe generate revenue from the sales of physical and virtual security appliances (products), software, subscriptions, support and maintenance contracts and professional services to end-customers, primarily through our indirect relationships through our partners or direct relationships through our direct sales-force. We account for our performance obligations in accordance with ASC 606 and all related interpretations.\nOur security appliance deliverables include proprietary operating system software, which together with regular security intelligence updates and support and maintenance, deliver the essential functionality of our appliance-based security products. We deliver our appliances and software licenses with the related intelligence subscription and support as a single performance obligation. As a result, we recognize revenue for this single performance obligation ratably over the contractual term. Contracts containing this single performance obligation typically contain a material right of renewal option. For contracts that contain a material right of renewal option, the allocated value of the performance obligation is recognized ratably over the period between the end of the initial contractual term and the end of the estimated useful life of the related appliance and license.\nRevenue from subscriptions to our cloud-based solutions, which allow customers to use our hosted security software over a contracted period without taking possession of the software, and managed services where we provide managed detection and response services for our customers, are recognized over the contractual term. We also recognize a small portion of our revenue from appliances and software that are not dependent on regular threat intelligence updates. Revenue from these solutions is therefore recognized when ownership is transferred to our customers, typically upon shipment.\nProfessional services, which include incident response, security assessments, and other strategic security consulting services are offered on a time-and-materials basis or through fixed fee arrangements, and we recognize the associated revenue as the services are delivered.\nStock-Based Compensation\nCompensation expense related to stock-based transactions, including employee and non-employee director stock options, is measured and recognized in the financial statements based on the fair value of the awards granted. The fair value of each option award is estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model and a single option award approach. The fair value of\nstock options granted to non-employees is remeasured as the stock options vest, and the resulting change in value, if any, is recognized in the statement of operations during the period the related services are rendered. Stock-based compensation expense is recognized over the requisite service periods of the awards, which is generally four years.\nOur use of the Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the fair value of the underlying common stock prior to our IPO in September 2013, the expected term of the option, the expected volatility of the price of our common stock, risk-free interest rates, and the expected dividend yield of our common stock. The assumptions used in our option-pricing model represent management\u2019s best estimates. These estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management\u2019s judgment. If factors change and different assumptions are used, our stock-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future. These assumptions and estimates are as follows:\n\u2022Fair Value of Common Stock. Because our common stock was not publicly traded until September 20, 2013, we were required to estimate the fair value of common stock for grants made prior to that date, as discussed in \u201cCommon Stock Valuations\u201d below.\n\u2022Risk-Free Interest Rate. We base the risk-free interest rate used in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model on the implied yield available on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term equivalent to that of the options for each option group.\n\u2022Expected Term. The expected term represents the period that our stock-based awards are expected to be outstanding. We base the expected term assumption on our historical exercise behavior combined with estimates of the post-vesting holding period.\n\u2022Volatility. We determine the price volatility factor based on the historical volatilities of our publicly traded peer group as we do not have a significant trading history for our common stock. Industry peers consist of several public companies in the technology industry that are similar to us in size, stage of life cycle, and financial leverage. We used the same set of peer group companies in all the relevant valuation estimates. We did not rely on implied volatilities of traded options in our industry peers\u2019 common stock because the volume of activity was relatively low. We intend to continue to consistently apply this process using the same or similar public companies until a sufficient amount of historical information regarding the volatility of our own common stock share price becomes available, or unless circumstances change such that the identified companies are no longer similar to us, in which case, more suitable companies whose share prices are publicly available would be utilized in the calculation.\n\u2022Dividend Yield. The expected dividend assumption is based on our current expectations about our anticipated dividend policy. Consequently, we used an expected dividend yield of zero.\nIn addition to the assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, we also estimated a forfeiture rate to calculate the stock-based compensation expense for our awards prior to January 1, 2016. Beginning January 1, 2016, we began recognizing forfeitures as they occur with the adoption of ASU 2016-09.\nWe estimate the fair value of the rights to acquire stock under our ESPP using the Black-Scholes option pricing formula. Our ESPP typically provides for consecutive twelve-month offering periods and we use our peer group volatility data in the valuation of ESPP shares. We recognize such compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period.\nWe account for the fair value of restricted stock units (\u201cRSUs\u201d) using the closing market price of our common stock on the date of grant. For new-hire grants, RSUs generally vest ratably on an annual basis over four years. For annual refresh grants, RSUs generally vest ratably on an annual, or combination of annual and quarterly, basis over two to four years.\nWe account for the fair value of performance stock units (\"PSUs\") using the closing market price of our common stock on the date of grant. We begin recognizing compensation expense when we conclude that it is probable that the performance conditions will be achieved. We reassess the probability of vesting at each reporting period and adjust our compensation cost based on this probability assessment.\nWe will continue to use judgment in evaluating the assumptions related to our stock-based compensation on a prospective basis. As we continue to accumulate additional data related to our common stock, we may have refinements to our estimates which could materially impact our future stock-based compensation expense.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes using the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. In addition, deferred tax assets are recorded for the future benefit of utilizing net operating losses and research and development credit carryforwards. Valuation allowances are provided when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. We recognize taxes on Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (\u201cGILTI\u201d) as a current period expense when incurred.\nWe apply the authoritative accounting guidance prescribing a threshold and measurement attribute for the financial recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. We recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions\nbased on a two-step process. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement.\nSignificant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. Although we believe our reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences may impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made.\nSignificant judgment is also required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider all available evidence, including scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, past operating results, the feasibility of tax planning strategies and estimates of future taxable income. Estimates of future taxable income are based on assumptions that are consistent with our plans. Assumptions represent management\u2019s best estimates and involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management\u2019s judgment. Should actual amounts differ from our estimates, the amount of our tax expense and liabilities could be materially impacted.\nWe do not provide for a U.S. income tax liability and foreign withholding taxes on undistributed foreign earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as a result of cumulative and current overall foreign loss. The earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries are currently expected to be indefinitely reinvested in non-U.S. operations.\nContract Manufacturer Liabilities\nWe outsource most of our manufacturing, repair, and supply chain management operations to our independent contract manufacturers and payments to them are a significant portion of our product, subscription and support cost of revenue. Although we could be contractually obligated to purchase manufactured products, we generally do not own the manufactured products. Product title transfers from our independent contract manufacturers to us and immediately to our partners or customers upon shipment. Our independent contract manufacturers assemble our products using design specifications, quality assurance programs, and standards that we establish, and they procure components and assemble our products based on our demand forecasts. These forecasts represent our estimates of future demand for our products based upon historical trends and analysis from our sales and product management functions, as adjusted for overall market conditions. If the actual component usage and product demand are significantly lower than forecast, we accrue for costs for contractual manufacturing commitments in excess of our forecasted demand, including costs for excess components or for carrying costs incurred by our contract manufacturers. To date, we have not incurred nor accrued any significant costs associated with this exposure.\nLoss Contingencies\nWe are subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business. We consider the likelihood of loss or impairment of an asset, or the incurrence of a liability, as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss, in determining loss contingencies. An estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired, or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. If we determine that a loss is possible, and the range of the loss can be reasonably determined, then we disclose the range of the possible loss. We regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether an accrual is required, an accrual should be adjusted, or a range of possible loss should be disclosed.\nWarranties\nWe generally provide a one-year warranty on hardware. We do not accrue for potential warranty claims as a component of cost of product, subscription and support revenue as all product warranty claims are satisfied under our support and maintenance contracts.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill is the excess of the aggregate purchase price paid over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized and is tested for impairment at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. We have determined that we operate as one reporting unit and have selected December 1 as the date to perform our annual impairment test. In the valuation of our goodwill, we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows to be derived from our business. If these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record impairment for these assets. The first step of the impairment test involves comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its net book value, including goodwill. If the net book value exceeds its fair value, then we would perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the amount of the impairment loss. The impairment loss would be calculated by comparing implied fair value of goodwill to its net book value. In calculating our implied fair value of goodwill, our fair value would be allocated to all of the other assets and liabilities based on their fair values. The excess of our fair value over the amount assigned to our other assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill. An impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying\namount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value. There was no impairment of goodwill recorded for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 or 2018, and our reporting unit was not at risk of failing the first step of the impairment test for any of these periods.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe account for all of our acquisitions using the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations. The fair value of purchase consideration is allocated to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and intangible assets acquired, based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill.\nWhen determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, management makes significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to identifiable intangible assets. Significant assumptions in valuing certain identifiable intangible assets include, but are not limited to, expected long-term market growth, customer retention, future expected operating expenses, costs of capital, and appropriate discount rates. Management\u2019s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 1 Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies contained in the \"Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\" in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a full description of the recent accounting pronouncements and our expectation of their impact, if any, on our results of operations and financial conditions.",
    "item_7A": "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk\nOur sales contracts are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. A portion of our operating expenses are incurred outside the United States and are denominated in foreign currencies and are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly changes in the Indian Rupee, British Pound Sterling, Japanese Yen and Euro. Additionally, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may cause us to recognize transaction gains and losses in our statement of operations. On June 23, 2016, the United Kingdom (\"U.K.\") held a referendum in which British voters approved an exit from the European Union (\"EU\"), commonly referred to as \"Brexit.\" This resulted in an adverse impact to currency exchange rates, notably the British Pound Sterling which experienced a sharp decline in value compared to the U.S. dollar and other currencies. Continued volatility in currency exchange rates is expected as the U.K. negotiates its exit from the EU, which could result in greater transaction gains or losses in our statement of operations.\nThe effect of a hypothetical 10% adverse change in foreign exchange rates on monetary assets and liabilities at December 31, 2020 would not be material to our financial condition or results of operations. To date, foreign currency transaction gains and losses and exchange rate fluctuations have not been material to our financial statements, and we have not engaged in any foreign currency hedging transactions.\nAs our international operations continue to grow, our risks associated with fluctuations in currency rates will become greater, and we will continue to reassess our approach to managing this risk. In addition, currency fluctuations or a weakening U.S. dollar can increase the costs of our international expansion, and a strengthening U.S. dollar could slow international demand as products and services priced in U.S. dollars become more expensive.\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe had cash and cash equivalents and investments of $1,301.3 million and $1,039.6 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, consisting of bank deposits, money market funds, certificates of deposit, commercial paper and bonds issued by corporate institutions, U.S. Treasury notes and U.S. government agencies. Such interest-earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk, but the risk is limited due to our investment policies which limit the duration of our short term investments. To date, fluctuations in interest income have not been significant.\nWe do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes and have not used any derivative financial instruments to manage our interest rate risk exposure. We have not been exposed to, nor do we anticipate being exposed to, material risks due to changes in interest rates.\nOur cash flow exposure due to changes in interest rates related to our debt is limited as our Series A Notes, Series B Notes and 2024 Notes have fixed interest rates of 1.000%, 1.625% and 0.875%, respectively. The fair value of the Convertible Notes may increase or decrease for various reasons, including fluctuations in the market price of our common stock, fluctuations in market interest rates and fluctuations in general economic conditions. Based upon the quoted market price as of December 31, 2020, the fair value of our Convertible Notes was approximately $1.0 billion.\nA hypothetical 10% change in interest rates during any of the periods presented would not have had a material impact on our financial statements.",

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 26, 2021, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company\u2019s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the US federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relates.\nRevenue Recognition and Contract Balances - Appliance and License Useful Life - Refer to Notes 1, 7, and 9 to the financial statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nThe Company recognizes revenue for contracts that contain a renewal option, which is a material right over the contractual term with the allocated value of the renewal option recognized over the period between the end of the initial contractual term and the end of the estimated useful life of the related appliance and license. The costs of revenue and commissions for such contracts are also recognized based on this estimated useful life.\nWe identified appliance and license useful life as a critical audit matter because the determination of this estimated useful life of the appliance and license requires significant judgment based on the Company\u2019s evaluation of historical renewals, technology refresh cycle, and management\u2019s expectation of future trends. This required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort to perform qualitative evaluations of these assumptions.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to the estimated appliance and license useful life included the following, among others:\n\u2022We tested the effectiveness of controls over the Company\u2019s determination of the estimated appliance and license useful life.\n\u2022We evaluated the methods and assumptions used by management to determine the estimated useful life by:\n\u25e6Testing the underlying data that served as the basis for the analysis, including information regarding actual historical renewals.\n\u25e6Recalculating the quantitative historical renewal information in the Company\u2019s analysis.\n\u25e6Assessing qualitative factors, including product refresh cycle; technology life; and evaluating whether historical renewal of the license and hardware is indicative of the estimated useful life based on internal or external information available, including interviews with Company personnel and reviews of Company product road maps and industry publications.\n\u25e6Evaluating the reasonableness of management\u2019s overall conclusion\nBusiness Combinations - Acquisition of Respond - Forecast of Future Revenue - Refer to Note 5 to the financial statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nThe Company completed the acquisition of Respond Software, Inc. for $177.6 million on November 18, 2020. The Company accounted for the acquisition under the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations. Accordingly, the purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values, including total intangible assets of $31.9 million, which consists primarily of $22.3 million of developed technology and $6.8 million of customer relationships. Management estimated the fair value of the developed technology using the multiperiod excess earnings method, and the customer relationships intangible assets using the with and without version of the income approach, which are both specific discounted cash flow valuation methods.\nWe identified forecasted revenue, specifically projected annual growth rate, used in the valuation as a critical audit matter because it requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions based on expectations of synergies, future operations, and trends. This required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our fair value specialists, when performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management\u2019s estimates and assumptions related to forecasted revenue.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to the forecasts of future revenue included the following, among others:\n\u2022We tested the effectiveness of controls over the valuation of the intangible assets, including management\u2019s controls over forecasts of revenue.\n\u2022We assessed the reasonableness of management\u2019s forecasts by inquiring with management to understand how revenue forecasts were developed, comparing revenue forecasts to those presented to the Board of Directors, and comparing the projections to historical results and external sources including industry trends and peer companies\u2019 historical data.\n\u2022We evaluated whether the estimated future revenue was consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit.\n/s/ DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP\nSan Jose, California\nFebruary 26, 2021\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2010.\nFIREEYE, INC.\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\n(In thousands, except per share data)\nAs of December 31,\n2020 2019\nASSETS\nCurrent assets:\nCash and cash equivalents $ 676,454 $ 334,603\nShort-term investments 624,824 704,955\nAccounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts of $2,559 and $2,263 at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively\n153,575 171,459\nInventories 4,023 5,892\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets 103,368 96,827\nTotal current assets 1,562,244 1,313,736\nProperty and equipment, net 79,770 93,812\nOperating lease right-of-use assets, net 38,251 58,758\nGoodwill 1,364,886 1,205,292\nIntangible assets, net 126,067 134,420\nDeposits and other long-term assets 74,664 84,468\nTOTAL ASSETS $ 3,245,882 $ 2,890,486\nLIABILITIES, CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK AND STOCKHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY\nCURRENT LIABILITIES:\nAccounts payable $ 5,107 $ 26,271\nOperating lease liabilities, current 16,024 18,437\nAccrued and other current liabilities 23,239 24,496\nAccrued compensation 95,664 59,513\nConvertible senior notes, current, net -

Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nDescription of Business\nFireEye, Inc., with principal executive offices located in Milpitas, California, was incorporated as NetForts, Inc. on February 18, 2004, under the laws of the State of Delaware, and changed its name to FireEye, Inc. on September 7, 2005.\nFireEye, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries (collectively, the \u201cCompany\u201d, \u201cwe\u201d, \u201cus\u201d or \u201cour\u201d) provide comprehensive intelligence-based cybersecurity solutions that allow organizations to prepare for, prevent, investigate, respond to and remediate cyber attacks, including attacks that target on-premise, cloud and critical infrastructure environments. Our portfolio of cybersecurity products and services helps customers minimize the risk of costly cybersecurity breaches by:\n\u2022validating the effectiveness of existing cybersecurity controls before an attack occurs,\n\u2022detecting and preventing advanced, targeted and other evasive attacks missed by other security controls,\n\u2022enabling more efficient management of security operations, including alert management, investigations and response when a breach occurs, and\n\u2022providing assessment, training and other strategic security consulting services that help organizations improve their resilience to attack.\nOur portfolio of cybersecurity solutions includes threat detection and prevention products that include appliance-based, virtual and cloud solutions for web security, email security and endpoint security. These products are complemented by our cloud-based threat intelligence, security analytics and security automation and orchestration technologies, as well as our managed security services, cybersecurity consulting and incident response offerings. In combination, our solutions and services enable a proactive approach to cybersecurity that extends across the threat management lifecycle to minimize the risk of costly cybersecurity breaches.\nWe have organized our cybersecurity solutions in a hub and spokes model designed to integrate machine-generated threat data from our detection and prevention products with our analytics, response and orchestration technologies delivered through our Helix cybersecurity operations platform. Helix is designed to enable more efficient security operations by correlating security and event data across an organization\u2019s environment to determine which threats present the greatest risk, automate repetitive security processes, and provide tools and workflows to investigate and respond to attacks. The Helix cloud-based interface presents a unified view of an organization\u2019s attack surface, including on-premise and cloud environments, and provides the contextual threat intelligence and threat management tools to enable a rapid response.\nThe majority of our products, subscriptions and services are sold to end-customers through distributors, resellers, and strategic partners, with a lesser percentage of sales directly to our end-customers.\nIn November 2020, we acquired Respond Software, Inc. (\"Respond Software\"), a cybersecurity investigation automation company. In connection with this acquisition, we paid cash consideration of $116.1 million, and issued 4,931,862 shares of our common stock of which 694,768 shares are subject to vesting conditions. The estimated fair value of the common stock issued and not subject to vesting conditions was $60.3 million. We also assumed unvested stock options, which are now exercisable for our common stock, of which $1.2 million of the fair value has been accounted for as consideration for assumed awards pertaining to pre-combination service prior to acquisition. Based on the above, total purchase consideration for Respond Software was $177.6 million. We are currently in the process of completing the preliminary purchase price allocation.\nIn January 2020, we acquired Cloudvisory LLC (\"Cloudvisory\"), a provider of cloud visibility and control solutions. As consideration for the acquisition, we paid approximately $13.2 million in cash and assumed $0.3 million in net tangible liabilities.\nIn May 2019, we acquired Verodin, Inc. (\"Verodin\"), a security instrumentation platform company. As consideration for the acquisition, we paid $143.7 million in cash, issued 8,404,609 shares of our common stock with an estimated fair value of $119.7 million and recognized $1.5 million of the fair value of assumed stock options attributable to pre-combination services.\nIn November 2020, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with BTO Delta Holdings DE L.P., an investment vehicle of funds affiliated with The Blackstone Group Inc., and a Securities Purchase Agreement with ClearSky Security Fund I LLC and ClearSky Power & Technology Fund II LLC (together, the \u201cSeries A Securities Financing Agreements\u201d). Pursuant to the Series A Securities Financing Agreements, in December 2020 we issued and sold 400,000 shares of a newly designated 4.5% Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.0001 per share, at a price of $1,000 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of $400.0 million. We intend to use the net proceeds from the issuance and sale to fund acquisitions, buybacks of our common stock, and for working capital purposes.\nIn the three months ended June 30, 2018, we issued $600 million aggregate principal amount of 0.875% Convertible Senior Notes due 2024 (the \"2024 Notes\"), in a private placement to qualified institutional purchasers pursuant to an exemption from registration provided by Section 4(a)(2) and Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"Securities Act\"). We recognized total\nnet proceeds after the initial purchasers' discount and issuance costs of $584.4 million. In connection with the issuance of the 2024 Notes, we also entered into capped call transactions (the \"Capped Calls\") with certain parties affiliated with the initial purchasers of the 2024 Notes. We paid approximately $65.2 million for the Capped Calls, which have an initial strike price of $23.17 per share, which corresponds to the initial conversion price of the 2024 Notes. The Capped Calls have an initial cap price of $34.32 per share subject to certain adjustments as set forth in the confirmations for the Capped Calls.\nIn May 2018, in a separate transaction, we repurchased $340.2 million aggregate principal of existing 1.000% Convertible Senior Notes due 2035 (the \"Series A Notes\"). We used $330.4 million of the net proceeds from the 2024 Notes offering to repurchase such portion of the Series A Notes.\nIn January 2018, we completed the acquisition of privately-held X15 Software, Inc. (\"X15\"), a data management company. As consideration for the acquisition, we paid cash consideration of $5.3 million and issued 1,016,334 shares of our common stock with an estimated fair value of $15.4 million.\nThe majority of our products, subscriptions and services are sold to end-customers through distributors, resellers, and strategic partners, with a lesser percentage of sales directly to our end-customers.\nBasis of Presentation and Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of FireEye, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries and have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d). All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Such management estimates include, but are not limited to, determining the nature and timing of satisfaction of performance obligations, useful life of our security appliances that are dependent on intelligence and assessing the material rights associated with it, determining the standalone selling price (\"SSP\") of performance obligations, subscriptions and services, commissions expense including the period of benefit of customer acquisition cost, bonus expense, future taxable income, contract manufacturer liabilities, litigation and settlement costs and other loss contingencies, fair value of our equity awards, achievement of targets for performance stock units, fair value of the liability and equity components of the Convertible Senior Notes (as defined in Note 10) and the purchase price allocation of acquired businesses. We base our estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe are reasonable. Changes in facts or circumstances may cause us to change our assumptions and estimates in future periods, and it is possible that actual results could differ from current or revised future estimates.\nConcentrations\nFinancial instruments that subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and accounts receivable. We maintain a substantial portion of our cash and cash equivalents in money market funds invested in U.S. Treasury related obligations. Management believes that these financial institutions are financially sound and, accordingly, are subject to minimal credit risk. Deposits held with banks may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits.\nOur short-term investments primarily consist of notes and bonds issued by corporate institutions and U.S. Government agencies. All of our investments are highly-rated by credit rating agencies and are issued by organizations with reputable credit, and therefore bear minimal credit risk.\nOur accounts receivables are primarily derived from a diverse set of customers across various geographical locations. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and generally do not require collateral on accounts receivable. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated potential credit losses. See Note 18 for information on major customers.\nWe rely primarily on a single contract manufacturer to assemble our products. In some cases, we rely on sole suppliers for certain components.\nForeign Currency Translation and Transactions\nThe functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar. We translate all monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies into U.S. dollars using the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet dates and other assets and liabilities using historical exchange rates.\nForeign currency denominated revenue and expenses have been re-measured using the average exchange rates in effect during each period. Foreign currency translation and transaction gains and losses have been included in other income (expense) and have not\nbeen significant for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, we recognized a gain of $0.6 million, a loss of $0.7 million and a loss of $1.5 million, respectively.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nWe consider all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at date of purchase to be cash equivalents. We determine the appropriate classification of our investments at the time of purchase, and evaluate such designation at each balance sheet date.\nShort-term Investments\nWe classify our investments in debt and equity securities as available-for-sale and record these investments at fair value. Investments with an original maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase are considered cash equivalents, while all other investments are classified as short-term or long-term based on the nature of the investments, their maturities, and their availability for use in current operations. Unrealized gains and losses are reported as a component of other comprehensive loss. Realized gains and losses are determined based on the specific identification method, and are reflected in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. We regularly review our investment portfolio to identify and evaluate investments that have indicators of possible impairment. Factors considered in determining whether a loss is other-than-temporary include, but are not limited to: the length of time and extent a security\u2019s fair value has been below its cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the investee, the credit quality of the security\u2019s issuer, likelihood of recovery and our intent and ability to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in value. For our debt instruments, we also evaluate whether we have the intent to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its cost basis.\nInvestments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value is judged to be other-than-temporary. Fair value is calculated based on publicly available market information or other estimates determined by management. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost and whether we have plans to sell the security, or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security, before recovery. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded to other income (expense) and a new cost basis in the investment is established.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nWe define fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset, or paid to transfer a liability, in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities which are required to be recorded at fair value, we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which to transact and the market-based risk. We apply fair value accounting for all financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. The carrying amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements approximate the fair value for cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities due to their short-term nature.\nInventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Provisions have been made to reduce all slow-moving, obsolete or unusable inventories to their net realizable values. We purchase completed units from contract manufacturers and substantially all of our inventories are finished goods held for use as service replacements. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the reserves for excess and obsolete inventories were $8.9 million and $5.9 million, respectively.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally two to five years.\nThe estimated useful lives of property and equipment are described below:\nProperty and Equipment Useful Life\nComputer equipment and software 2 to 5 years\nLeasehold improvements Shorter of estimated useful life or remaining lease term\nFurniture and fixtures 5 years\nMachinery and equipment 2 to 5 years\nDemonstration Units\nProduct demonstration units are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets on the consolidated balance sheets. Demonstration units are recorded at cost and are amortized over the estimated useful life from the date of transfer from inventory, generally 12 months. We generally do not resell units that have been used for demonstration purposes.\nLeases\nWe determine if an arrangement is a lease and classification of that lease, if applicable, at inception based on: (1) whether the contract involves the use of a distinct identified asset, (2) whether we obtain the right to substantially all the economic benefits from the use of the asset throughout the period, and (3) whether we have a right to direct the use of the asset. We currently do not have any finance leases. We have elected to not recognize a lease liability or right-of-use (\"ROU\") asset for short-term leases (leases with a term of twelve months or less and do not include an option we are reasonably certain to exercise to purchase the underlying asset).\nROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make minimum lease payments arising from the lease. ROU assets are initially measured at amounts, which represents the present value of the lease payments over the lease, plus any initial direct costs incurred and less any lease incentives received. Annually, all ROU assets are reviewed for impairment. The lease liability is initially measured at lease commencement date based on the present value of minimum lease payments over the lease term. As the rates implicit in the leases are not readily available, we use our Incremental Borrowing Rate (\"IBR\") based on the information available at commencement date of a lease in determining the present value of lease payments. The determination of our IBR requires judgment. We took into consideration our recent debt offerings as well as external credit rating factors when determining our current IBR. Our lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease. We do not include these options in our minimum lease terms unless we believe they are reasonably certain to be exercised. We have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, which are generally accounted for separately. Non-lease components (i.e. common area maintenance) are separate from the lease components and are paid on actual usage. Therefore, the non-lease components are not included in the determination of the ROU asset or lease liability and are reflected as an expense in the period incurred. Our operating lease costs for operating lease payments are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nWe also sublease certain office space to third-parties. Our subleases consist of office space which was vacated as part of restructuring activities in 2016. We do not recognize ROU assets or lease liabilities associated with subleased office spaces in which we are the sublessor. Sublease income is recognized ratably over the term of the agreement.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nWe evaluate events and changes in circumstances that could indicate carrying amounts of long-lived assets may not be recoverable. When such events or changes in circumstances occur, we assess the recoverability of long-lived assets by determining whether or not the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through undiscounted expected future cash flows. If the total of the future undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of an asset, we record an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the asset. Through December 31, 2020 we have not written down any of our long-lived assets as a result of impairment.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe have accounted for all of our acquisitions using the acquisition method. The Company allocates the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed and intangible assets acquired, based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill.\nWhen determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, management makes significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to identifiable intangible assets. Significant assumptions used in valuing certain identifiable intangible assets include, but are not limited to, expected long-term market growth, future expected operating expenses, costs of capital, and appropriate discount rates. Management\u2019s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates.\nGoodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets\nGoodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price paid over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized and is tested for impairment at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. The Company has determined that it operates as one reporting unit and has selected December 1 as the date to perform its annual impairment test.\nIn the valuation of its goodwill, the Company must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows to be derived from the Company. If these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future, the Company may be required to record impairment for these assets. The first step of the impairment test involves comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its net book value, including goodwill. If the net book value exceeds its fair value, then the Company would perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the amount of the impairment loss. The impairment loss would be calculated by comparing the implied\nfair value of the Company to its net book value. In calculating the implied fair value of the Company\u2019s goodwill, the fair value of the Company would be allocated to all of the other assets and liabilities based on their fair values. The excess of the fair value of the Company over the amount assigned to its other assets and liabilities represents the implied fair value of goodwill. An impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value. There was no impairment of goodwill recorded for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 or 2018.\nPurchased intangible assets with finite lives are carried at cost, less accumulated amortization. Amortization is computed over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets. Purchased intangible assets with indefinite lives are assessed for potential impairment annually, or when events or circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts might be impaired.\nWarranties\nWe generally provide a one-year warranty on hardware. We do not accrue for potential warranty claims as a component of cost of product revenue as all product warranty claims are satisfied under our support and maintenance contracts.\nContract Manufacturer Liabilities\nWe outsource most of our manufacturing, repair, and supply chain management operations to our independent contract manufacturers and payments to such manufacturers are a significant portion of our product cost of revenue. Although we could be contractually obligated to purchase manufactured products, we generally do not own the manufactured products. Product title transfers from our independent contract manufacturers to us and to our partners upon shipment. Our independent contract manufacturers assemble our products using design specifications, quality assurance programs, and standards that we establish, and they procure components and assemble our products based on our demand forecasts. These forecasts represent our estimates of future demand for our products based upon historical trends and analysis from our sales and product management functions as adjusted for overall market conditions. If the actual component usage and product demand are significantly lower than forecast, we may accrue for costs for contractual manufacturing commitments in excess of our forecasted demand, including costs for excess components or for carrying costs incurred by our contract manufacturers. To date, we have not accrued any significant costs associated with this exposure.\nContract Balances\nAccounts Receivable\nTrade accounts receivable are recorded at the billable amount where we have the unconditional right to bill, net of allowances for doubtful accounts. The allowance for doubtful accounts is based on our assessment of the collectability of accounts. Management regularly reviews the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts by considering the age of each outstanding invoice, each customer's expected ability to pay and collection history, when applicable, to determine whether a specific allowance is appropriate. Accounts receivable deemed uncollectible are charged against the allowance for doubtful accounts when identified.\nDeferred Revenue (Contract Liabilities) and Contract Assets\nDeferred revenue consists of amounts for which we have the unconditional right to bill, but have not been recognized as revenue because the related goods or services have not been transferred. These amounts include non-refundable customer deposits that are prepaid for future performance obligations, such as delivery of our Expertise on Demand units and pre-paid retainers. Deferred revenue that will be realized during the succeeding 12-month period is recorded as current, and the remaining deferred revenue is recorded as non-current. Our contract assets consist of assets typically resulting when revenue recognized but for which we do not have the right to bill the customer due to allocation of transaction price, and such amounts have been included in prepaid expenses and other current assets. Our contract assets were immaterial as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nIn instances where the timing of revenue recognition differs from the timing of invoicing, we have determined our contracts generally do not include a significant financing component. The primary purpose of our invoicing terms is to provide customers with simplified and predictable ways of purchasing our products and services, not to receive financing from our customers or to provide customers with financing. Examples include invoicing at the beginning of a subscription term with revenue recognized ratably over the contract period.\nAssets Recognized from Costs to Obtain a Contract with a Customer\nDeferred Commissions\nOur customer acquisition costs are primarily related to sales commissions and related payroll taxes earned by our sales force and such costs are considered incremental costs to obtain a contract. Sales commissions for initial contracts are deferred and then amortized taking into consideration the pattern of transfer to which the asset relates and may include expected renewal periods where renewal commissions are not commensurate with the initial commissions period. We typically recognize the initial commissions over the longer of the customer relationship (generally estimated to be four years) or over the same period as the initial revenue arrangement to which these costs relate. Renewal commissions not commensurate with the initial commissions paid are generally amortized over the renewal period. Deferred commissions that will amortize within the succeeding twelve month period are classified\nas current, and included in prepaid expenses and other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The remaining balance is classified as non-current, and included in deposits and other long-term assets. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the amount of deferred commissions included in prepaid expenses and other current assets was $58.2 million and $53.0 million, respectively. The amount of deferred commissions included in deposits and other long-term assets as of December 31, 2020 2019 was $45.9 million and $49.8 million, respectively.\nDeferred Costs of Revenue\nDeferred costs of revenue consists of appliance related direct and incremental costs that are capitalized and will be amortized on a systematic basis that is consistent with the pattern of transfer to which the asset relates. Deferred costs of revenue that will be realized within the succeeding twelve month period are classified as current, and included in prepaid expenses and other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The remaining balance is classified as non-current, and included in deposits and other long-term assets. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the amount of deferred costs of revenue classified as current and included in prepaid expenses and other current assets was $16.4 million and $17.2 million, respectively. The amount of deferred costs of revenue classified as non-current and included in deposits and other long-term assets as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $18.9 million and $21.9 million, respectively.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue from Contracts with Customers\nRevenue is recognized when all of the following criteria are met:\n\u2022Identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer - A contract with a customer exists when (i) we enter into an enforceable contract with a customer that defines each party\u2019s rights regarding the goods or services to be transferred and identifies the payment terms related to these goods or services, (ii) the contract has commercial substance and the parties are committed to perform, and (iii) we determine that collection of substantially all consideration to which it will be entitled in exchange for goods or services that will be transferred is probable based on the customer\u2019s intent and ability to pay the promised consideration.\n\u2022Identification of the performance obligations in the contract - Performance obligations promised in a contract are identified based on the goods or services that will be transferred to the customer that are both capable of being distinct, whereby the customer can benefit from the goods or service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available from third parties or from us, and are distinct in the context of the contract, whereby the transfer of the goods or services is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. To the extent a contract includes multiple promised goods or services, we apply judgment to determine whether promised goods or services are capable of being distinct and distinct in the context of the contract. If these criteria are not met the promised goods or services are accounted for as a combined performance obligation.\n\u2022Determination of the transaction price - The transaction price is determined based on the consideration to which we will be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to the customer adjusted for estimated variable consideration, if any. We typically estimate the transaction price impact of discounts offered to the customers for early payments on receivables or rebates based on channel partner sales achievements. Constraints are applied when estimating variable considerations based on historical experience where applicable.\n\u2022Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract - If the contract contains a single performance obligation, the entire transaction price is allocated to the single performance obligation. Contracts that contain multiple performance obligations require an allocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation based on a relative SSP basis. Determination of SSP requires judgment. We determine standalone selling price taking into account available information such as historical selling prices of the performance obligation, geographic location, overall strategic pricing objective, market conditions and internally approved pricing guidelines related to the performance obligations.\n\u2022Recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy performance obligation - We satisfy performance obligations either over time or at a point in time as discussed in further detail below. Revenue is recognized at or over the time the related performance obligation is satisfied by transferring a promised good or service to a customer.\nNature of Products and Services\nWe generate revenue from the sales of physical and virtual security appliances (products), subscriptions, support and maintenance and professional services, primarily through our indirect relationships with our partners or direct relationships with end customers through our direct sales force. We account for our performance obligations in accordance with ASC 606, and all related interpretations.\nOur security appliance deliverables include proprietary operating system software, which together with regular security intelligence updates and support and maintenance, deliver the essential functionality of our appliance-based security products. We combine appliances and software licenses with the related intelligence subscription and support as a single performance obligation. As\na result, we recognize revenue for this single performance obligation ratably over the contractual term. Contracts containing this single performance obligation typically contain a material right of renewal option. For contracts that contain a material right of renewal option, the allocated value of the performance obligation is recognized ratably over the period between the end of the initial contractual term and the end of the estimated useful life of the related appliance and license.\nRevenue from subscriptions to our cloud-based solutions, which allow customers to use our hosted security software over a contracted period without taking possession of the software and managed services where we provide managed detection and response services for customers, are recognized over the contractual term. A small portion of our revenue is from appliances and software that are not dependent on regular threat intelligence updates. Revenue from these appliances and software is therefore recognized when ownership is transferred to our customers, typically upon shipment.\nProfessional services, which include incident response, security assessments, and other strategic security consulting services are offered on a time-and-materials basis or through fixed fee arrangements, and we recognize the associated revenue as the services are delivered.\nAdvertising Costs\nAdvertising costs, which are expensed and included in sales and marketing expense when incurred, were $4.2 million, $3.2 million and $3.4 million during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nSoftware Development Costs\nThe costs to develop internal-use software are subject to capitalization and begin amortizing once the software is substantially ready for use. These costs are included in property and equipment and are generally amortized over 3 years. All other software development costs are expensed as incurred and included in research and development expense on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nStock-Based Compensation\nCompensation expense related to stock-based transactions, including employee and non-employee director awards and our 2013 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the \"ESPP\"), is measured and recognized in the financial statements based on fair value. The fair value of each option award is estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model and a single option award approach. This model requires that at the date of grant we determine the fair value of the underlying common stock, the expected term of the award, the expected volatility of the price of our common stock, risk-free interest rates, and expected dividend yield of our common stock. The fair value of restricted stock awards and restricted stock units is based on the closing market price of our common stock on the date of grant. The stock-based compensation expense is recognized using a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the entire awards, which is generally four years. Performance-based awards are subject to performance conditions. We recognize compensation expense over the requisite service period of each vesting tranche, when it becomes probable that the performance criteria set by our Board of Directors will be achieved.\nWe recognize forfeitures as they occur, and no longer estimate a forfeiture rate when calculating the stock-based compensation for our equity awards.\nWe account for stock options issued to non-employees based on the fair value of the awards determined using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The fair value of stock options granted to non-employees is remeasured as the stock options vest, and the resulting change in value, if any, is recognized in the statement of operations during the period the related services are rendered.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes using the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. In addition, deferred tax assets are recorded to reflect the future benefit of utilizing net operating losses and research and development credit carry forwards. Valuation allowances are provided when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. We recognize taxes on Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (\u201cGILTI\u201d) as a current period expense when incurred.\nWe apply the authoritative accounting guidance prescribing a threshold and measurement attribute for the financial recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. We recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two-step process. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation settlement. The second step is to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. We recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the income tax expense line in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Accrued interest and penalties are included within other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.\nNet Loss Per Share\nWe calculate our basic and diluted net loss per share in conformity with the two-class method required for companies with participating securities. Under the two-class method, net income (loss) is determined by allocating undistributed earnings, calculated as net income (loss) less current period convertible preferred stock cumulative dividends, between common stock and the convertible preferred stock. In computing diluted net income, undistributed earnings are re-allocated to reflect the potential impact of dilutive securities. Our basic net loss per share attributable to common stockholders is calculated by dividing the net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period. The diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders is computed by giving effect to all potential dilutive common stock equivalents outstanding for the period. For purposes of this calculation, convertible preferred stock, options to purchase common stock and convertible senior notes are considered common stock equivalents, but have been excluded from the calculation of diluted net loss per share as their effect is anti-dilutive.\nConvertible Senior Notes\nWe allocated the principal amount of the Convertible Senior Notes between its liability and equity components. The carrying amount of the liability component was determined by measuring the fair value of a similar debt instrument of similar credit quality and maturity that did not have the conversion feature. The carrying amount of the equity component, representing the embedded conversion option, was determined by deducting the fair value of the liability component from the principal amount of the Convertible Senior Notes as a whole. The equity component is included in additional paid-in-capital in consolidated balance sheets and is not remeasured as long as it continues to meet the conditions for equity classification. The excess of the principal amount of the Convertible Senior Notes over the carrying amount of the liability component was recorded as a debt discount, and is being amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method through the first date holders have the right to require us to repurchase all or any portion of their Convertible Senior Notes; the first put date (see Note 10). We allocate the total amount of transaction costs incurred to the liability and equity components using the same proportions as the proceeds from the Convertible Senior Notes. Transaction costs attributable to the liability component were recorded as a direct deduction from the liability component of the Convertible Senior Notes, and are being amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method through the first put date. Transaction costs attributable to the equity component were netted with the equity component of the Convertible Senior Notes in additional paid-in capital.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nCustomer\u2019s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That Is a Service Contract\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-15, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer's Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That Is a Service Contract. This standard requires capitalization of the implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software. Further, the standard also requires the Company to expense the capitalized implementation costs of a hosting arrangement over the term of the hosting arrangement. We adopted the standard effective January 1, 2020. The standard did not have a significant impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements.\nSimplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment. This standard eliminates the requirement to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill to measure a goodwill impairment charge, instead measuring the impairment charge as the excess of the reporting unit's carrying amount over its fair value (i.e. Step 1 of the current guidance). The guidance was effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of 2020, and will be applied prospectively. We adopted the standard effective January 1, 2020. The standard did not have a significant impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements.\nMeasurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. This standard changes the impairment model for most financial assets and certain other instruments by introducing a current expected credit loss (\"CECL\") model. The CECL model is a more forward-looking approach based on expected losses rather than incurred losses, requiring entities to estimate and record losses expected over the remaining contractual life of an asset. The guidance was effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of 2020. We adopted the standard effective January 1, 2020. The standard did not have a significant impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements.\nSimplifying Accounting for Income Taxes\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes. This standard simplifies the accounting for income taxes by eliminating certain exceptions to the guidance in Topic 740 related to the approach for intra-period tax allocation, the methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period and the recognition of deferred tax liabilities for outside basis differences. The new guidance also simplifies aspects of the accounting for franchise taxes and enacted changes in tax laws or rates and clarifies the accounting for transactions that result in a step-up in the tax basis of goodwill and allocating consolidated income taxes to separate financial statements of entities not subject to income tax. ASU 2019-12 is effective for annual and interim periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020. Early adoption is permitted, and we adopted ASU 2019-12 as of January 1, 2020. The adoption did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nRecent Legislation\nOn March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act was enacted and signed into U.S. law to provide economic relief to individuals and businesses facing economic hardship as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Changes in tax laws or rates are accounted for in the period of enactment. The income tax provisions of the CARES Act do not have a significant impact on our current taxes, deferred taxes, or uncertain tax positions.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nIn August 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-06, Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity\u2019s Own Equity (ASU 2020-06). This standard simplifies the accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of liabilities and equity, including convertible instruments and contracts in an entity\u2019s own equity. Among other changes, ASU 2020-06 removes from U.S. GAAP the liability and equity separation model for convertible instruments with a cash conversion feature, and as a result, after adoption, entities will no longer separately present in equity an embedded conversion feature for such debt. Similarly, the embedded conversion feature will no longer be amortized into income as interest expense over the life of the instrument. Instead, entities will account for a convertible debt instrument wholly as debt unless (1) a convertible instrument contains features that require bifurcation as a derivative under ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, or (2) a convertible debt instrument was issued at a substantial premium. Among other potential impacts, this change is expected to reduce reported interest expense, increase reported net income, and result in a reclassification of certain conversion feature balance sheet amounts from stockholders\u2019 equity to liabilities as it relates to the Company\u2019s convertible senior notes. Additionally, ASU 2020-06 requires the application of the if-converted method to calculate the impact of convertible instruments on diluted earnings per share (EPS). ASU 2020-06 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, with early adoption permitted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, and can be adopted on either a fully retrospective or modified retrospective basis. We are currently evaluating the timing, method of adoption and overall impact of this standard on our consolidated financial statements.\n2. Fair Value Measurements\nThe accounting guidance for fair value measurements provides a framework for measuring fair value on either a recurring or nonrecurring basis, whereby the inputs used in our valuation techniques are assigned a hierarchical level. The following are the three levels of inputs to measure fair value:\n\u2022Level 1: Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.\n\u2022Level 2: Inputs that reflect quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in less active markets; quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the assets or liabilities; or inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means.\n\u2022Level 3: Unobservable inputs that reflect our own assumptions incorporated in valuation techniques used to measure fair value. These assumptions are required to be consistent with market participant assumptions that are reasonably available.\nWe consider an active market to be one in which transactions for the asset or liability occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis, and consider an inactive market to be one in which there are infrequent or few transactions for the asset or liability, the prices are not current, or price quotations vary substantially either over time or among market makers. Where appropriate, our own or the counterparty\u2019s non-performance risk is considered in measuring the fair values of assets.\nThe following table presents our assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis using the above input categories (in thousands):\nAs of December 31, 2020 As of December 31, 2019\nDescription Level 1\nLevel 2 Level 3\nTotal Level 1\nLevel 2 Level 3\nTotal\nAssets\nCash equivalents:\nMoney market funds\n$ 32,954 $ - $ - $ 32,954 $ 24,246 $ - $ - $ 24,246\nU.S. Treasuries\n- - - - - - - -\nTotal cash equivalents\n$ 32,954 $ - $ - $ 32,954 $ 24,246 $ - $ - $ 24,246\nShort-term investments:\nCertificates of deposit\n- 2,752 - 2,752 - 5,145 - 5,145\nCommercial paper\n- 19,994 - 19,994 - - - -\nCorporate notes and bonds\n- 437,652 - 437,652 - 472,908 - 472,908\nU.S. Treasuries\n- 74,934 - 74,934 - 48,069 - 48,069\nU.S. Government agencies\n- 89,492 - 89,492 - 178,833 - 178,833\nTotal short-term investments\n$ - $ 624,824 $ - $ 624,824 $ - $ 704,955 $ - $ 704,955\nTotal assets measured at fair value\n$ 32,954 $ 624,824 $ - $ 657,778 $ 24,246 $ 704,955 $ - $ 729,201\nAdditionally, we have a restructuring liability related to certain real estate facilities which was calculated based on the present value of future lease payments, less estimated sublease income, discounted at a rate commensurate with our current cost of financing. This non-recurring fair value measurement is considered to be a Level 3 measurement due to the use of significant unobservable inputs. To the extent that actual sublease income or the timing of subleasing these facilities is different than initial estimates, we will adjust the restructuring liability in the period during which such information becomes known. See Note 6 Restructuring Charges for a reconciliation of this liability.\nWe measure certain assets, including goodwill, intangible assets and our equity-method investment in a privately held company at fair value on a nonrecurring basis when there are identifiable events or changes in circumstances that may have a significant adverse impact on the fair value of these assets. In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, we performed an analysis of impairment indicators of these assets and noted no adverse impact to their fair values as of December 31, 2020.\nThe estimated fair value of the Convertible Senior Notes as of December 31, 2020 was determined to be $1.0 billion, based on quoted market prices. We consider the fair value of the Convertible Senior Notes to be a Level 2 measurement as they are not actively traded.\n3.

In addition, we do not intend to sell, and it is not more likely than not that we would be required to sell, these investments before recovery of their cost basis. As a result, there is no other-than-temporary impairment for these investments as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nThe following table summarizes the contractual maturities of our investments at December 31, 2020 (in thousands):\nAmortized Cost Fair Value\nDue within one year $ 335,061 $ 336,217\nDue within one to three years 285,422 288,607\nTotal $ 620,483 $ 624,824\nAll available-for-sale securities have been classified as current, based on management's intent and ability to use the funds in current operations.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we held an 11% ownership interest in a privately held company which is accounted for under the equity method based on our ability to exercise significant influence over the company's operating and financial policies. Our investments in this company are classified within deposits and other long-term assets on our consolidated balance sheets. The carrying value of our investments was zero as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.\n4. Property and Equipment\nProperty and equipment, net consisted of the following (in thousands):\nAs of December 31,\n2020 2019\nComputer equipment and software\n$ 220,870 $ 203,242\nLeasehold improvements\n62,249 64,180\nFurniture and fixtures\n15,203 15,496\nMachinery and equipment\n465 465\nTotal property and equipment\n$ 298,787 $ 283,383\nLess: accumulated depreciation\n(219,017) (189,571)\nTotal property and equipment, net\n$ 79,770 $ 93,812\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 we capitalized $20.2 million, $22.5 million and $22.5 million, respectively, of software development costs related to our cloud subscription offerings. Amortization expense related to capitalized software development costs during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $18.9 million, $16.7 million and $10.2 million, respectively.\nDepreciation and amortization expense related to property and equipment and demonstration units during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $36.8 million, $38.2 million and $36.7 million, respectively.\n5. Business Combinations\nAcquisition of Verodin\nOn May 28, 2019, we acquired all outstanding shares of privately held Verodin, a security instrumentation platform company. We have incorporated Verodin technology into our platform and analytics capabilities. In connection with this acquisition, we paid cash consideration of $143.7 million and issued 8,404,609 shares of our common stock with an estimated fair value of $119.7 million. We also assumed unvested stock options, which are now exercisable for our common stock, of which $1.5 million of the fair value has been accounted for as consideration for assumed awards pertaining to pre-combination service prior to acquisition. Based on the above, total purchase consideration for Verodin was $264.9 million.\nThe acquisition of Verodin was accounted for in accordance with the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations with FireEye as the accounting acquirer. We expensed the related acquisition costs of $0.6 million in general and administrative expenses. Under the acquisition method of accounting, the total purchase consideration is allocated to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. The total purchase price of $264.9 million was allocated using information currently available to us. Pro forma financial information has not been presented for this acquisition as the impact to our consolidated financial statements was not material. Allocation of the purchase price is as follows (in thousands):\nAmount\nNet tangible assets assumed $ 15,036\nIntangible assets 45,200\nDeferred tax liability (1,152)\nGoodwill 205,798\nTotal purchase price allocation $ 264,882\nThe purchase price exceeded the fair value of the net tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired, resulting in the recognition of goodwill. Goodwill is primarily attributable to expected synergies in our subscription offerings and cross-selling opportunities. None of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nIntangible assets consist primarily of developed technology, customer relationships, trade name and contract backlog. Intangible assets attributable to developed technology include a combination of patented and unpatented technology, trade secrets, computer software and research processes that represent the foundation for the existing and planned new products to facilitate the generation of new content. Customer relationship intangibles relate to Verodin's ability to sell current and future content, as well as products built\naround this content, to its existing customers. Trade name is attributable to marketing goods and services under the Verodin brand. Contract backlog pertains to unbilled and unrecognized contracts yet to be fulfilled.\nThe estimated useful life and fair values of the identifiable intangible assets are as follows (dollars in thousands):\nUseful Life (in years) Amount\nDeveloped technology 5 $ 38,300\nCustomer relationships 5 4,600\nTrade name 5 1,600\nContract backlog 2 700\nTotal identifiable intangible assets $ 45,200\nThe value of developed technology was estimated using the excess earnings method, an income approach (Level 3), which converts projected revenues and costs into cash flows. To reflect the fact that certain other assets contribute to the cash flows generated, the returns for these contributory assets were removed to arrive at estimated cash flows solely attributable to the acquired technology, which were discounted at a rate of 12% to determine the fair value.\nThe value of customer relationships was estimated using the cost savings method, an income level approach (Level 3), which estimates the value of an asset based upon costs avoided through ownership of the asset. Estimated costs on projected revenues, excluding acquired contract backlog, were made using historical data pertaining to sales to new and existing customers. The cash flow impact of projected cost savings, primarily avoidance of legal costs pertaining to new customers and lower commission rates applicable to existing customers than new customers, were discounted at a rate of 11% to determine the fair value.\nThe value of the trade name was estimated using the relief-from-royalty method, an income approach (Level 3), which estimates the cost savings that accrue to the owner of the intangibles asset that would otherwise be payable as royalties or license fees on revenues earned through the use of the asset. A royalty rate was applied to the projected revenues associated with the intangible asset to determine the amount of savings, which was at a rate of 12% to determine the fair value.\nThe value of the contract backlog was estimated by discounting estimated cash flows from existing orders, an income level approach (Level 3). Using expected timing of backlog revenue realization by quarter, the cash flow estimates resulting therefrom were reduced by estimated fulfillment costs associated with completing the backlog obligations, and the net cash flows were then discounted at a rate of 8% to determine fair value.\nDiscount rates for each respective intangible asset were determined by accounting for the risk associated with each asset, including required technology development and customer acquisition required to support respective projections, the uncertainty of market success and the risk inherent with projected financial results. The estimated useful lives were determined by evaluating the expected economic and useful lives of the assets and of similar intangible assets from previous business combinations and adjusting accordingly after taking into account circumstances that may be unique to Verodin.\nAcquisition of Cloudvisory LLC\nOn January 17, 2020, we acquired Cloudvisory, a provider of cloud visibility and control solutions. As consideration for the acquisition, we paid $13.2 million in cash. In addition, we assumed $0.3 million in net tangible liabilities.\nThe acquisition of Cloudvisory was accounted for in accordance with the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations with FireEye as the accounting acquirer. Under the acquisition method of accounting, the total purchase consideration is allocated to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. The total purchase price of $13.2 million was allocated using the information available to us. The results of operations of Cloudvisory have been included in our consolidated statements of operations from the acquisition date, though revenue and net income from Cloudvisory were not material for the year ended December 31, 2020. Transaction costs were immaterial and expensed as incurred. Pro forma financial information has not been presented for this acquisition as the impact to our consolidated financial statements was not material. Allocation of the purchase price is as follows (in thousands):\nAmount\nNet tangible liabilities assumed $ (288)\nIntangible assets 5,650\nGoodwill 7,846\nTotal purchase price allocation $ 13,208\nThe purchase price exceeded the fair value of the net tangible liabilities and identifiable intangible assets acquired, resulting in the recognition of goodwill. Goodwill is primarily attributable to expected synergies in our subscription offerings and cross-selling opportunities. The goodwill generated as a result of the Cloudvisory acquisition is deductible for tax purposes.\nIntangible assets consist primarily of developed technology and trade name. Intangible assets attributable to developed technology include a combination of patented and unpatented technology, trade secrets, computer software and research processes that represent the foundation for the existing and planned new products to facilitate the generation of new content. Trade name is attributable to marketing goods and services under the Cloudvisory brand.\nThe estimated useful life and fair values of the identifiable intangible assets are as follows (dollars in thousands):\nEstimated Useful Life (in years) Amount\nDeveloped technology 3 $ 5,500\nTrade name 1 150\nTotal identifiable intangible assets $ 5,650\nThe value of developed technology was estimated using the excess earnings method, an income approach (Level 3), which converts projected revenues and costs into cash flows. To reflect the fact that certain other assets contribute to the cash flows generated, the returns for these contributory assets were removed to arrive at estimated cash flows solely attributable to the acquired technology, which were discounted at a rate of 35% to determine the fair value.\nThe value of the trade name was estimated using the relief-from-royalty method, an income approach (Level 3), which estimates the cost savings that accrue to the owner of the intangibles asset that would otherwise be payable as royalties or license fees on revenues earned through the use of the asset. A royalty rate of 1% was applied to the projected revenues associated with the intangible asset to determine the amount of savings using a discount rate of 35% to determine the fair value.\nDiscount rates for each respective intangible asset were determined by accounting for the risk associated with each asset, including required technology development necessary to support respective projections, the uncertainty of market success and the risk inherent with projected financial results. The estimated useful lives were determined by evaluating the expected economic and useful lives of the assets and of similar intangible assets from previous business combinations and adjusting accordingly for circumstances that may be unique to Cloudvisory.\nAcquisition of Respond Software\nIn November 2020, we acquired all outstanding shares of privately held Respond Software, a cybersecurity investigation automation company. The acquisition of Respond Software, a leader in automation of XDR, is intended to add significant capabilities to the our Mandiant Advantage platform by automating threat detection and reducing the amount of analyst time necessary to investigate treats due to the reduction in false positives as well as to accelerate Respond Software's learning models with our unique expertise and Intel. In connection with this acquisition, we paid cash consideration of $116.1 million and issued 4,931,862 shares of our common stock of which 694,768 shares are subject to vesting conditions. The estimated fair value of the common stock issued and not subject to vesting conditions was $60.3 million. We also assumed unvested stock options, which are now exercisable for our common stock, of which $1.2 million of the fair value has been accounted for as consideration for assumed awards pertaining to pre-combination service prior to acquisition. Based on the above, total purchase consideration for Respond Software was $177.6 million.\nThe acquisition of Respond Software was accounted for in accordance with the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations with FireEye as the accounting acquirer. Under the acquisition method of accounting, the total purchase consideration is allocated to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. The total purchase price of $177.6 million was allocated using the information available to us. As a result, we may continue to adjust the preliminary purchase price allocation after obtaining more information regarding asset valuations, liabilities assumed, and revisions of preliminary estimates. The results of operations of Respond Software have been included in our consolidated statements of operations from the acquisition date, and revenue and net income from Respond Software were not material for the year ended December 31, 2020. Transaction costs were immaterial and expensed as incurred. Pro forma financial information has not been presented for this acquisition as the impact to our consolidated financial statements was not material. Allocation of the preliminary purchase price is as follows (in thousands):\nAmount\nNet tangible liabilities assumed $ (4,551)\nIntangible assets 31,880\nDeferred tax liability (1,169)\nGoodwill 151,437\nTotal preliminary purchase price allocation $ 177,597\nThe preliminary purchase price exceeded the fair value of the net tangible liabilities and identifiable intangible assets acquired, resulting in the recognition of goodwill. Goodwill is primarily attributable to expected synergies in our subscription offerings and cross-selling opportunities. The goodwill is not expected to be deductible for U.S. income tax purposes.\nIntangible assets consist primarily of developed technology, in-process technology, customer relationships and trade name. Intangible assets attributable to developed technology include a combination of patented and unpatented technology, trade secrets, computer software and research processes that represent the foundation for the existing and planned new products to facilitate the generation of new content. Customer relationship intangibles relate to Respond Software's ability to sell current and future content, as well as products built around this content, to its existing customers. Trade name is attributable to marketing goods and services under the Respond Software brand.\nThe estimated useful life and fair values of the identifiable intangible assets are as follows (dollars in thousands):\nPreliminary Estimated Useful Life (in years) Amount\nDeveloped technology 5 $ 22,300\nIn-Process technology 4 2,200\nCustomer relationships 5 6,760\nTrade name 2 620\nTotal identifiable intangible assets $ 31,880\nThe value of developed technology was estimated using the excess earnings method, an income approach (Level 3), which converts projected revenues and costs into cash flows. To reflect the fact that certain other assets contribute to the cash flows generated, the returns for these contributory assets were removed to arrive at estimated cash flows solely attributable to the acquired technology, which were discounted at a rate of 12% to determine the fair value.\nThe value of in-process technology was estimated using the excess earnings method, an income approach (Level 3), which converts projected revenues and costs into cash flows. To reflect the fact that certain other assets contribute to the cash flows generated, the returns for these contributory assets were removed to arrive at estimated cash flows solely attributable to the acquired technology, which were discounted at a rate of 13% to determine the fair value.\nThe value of customer relationships was estimated using the \"with and without\" version of the Income Approach, which measures the difference between cash flows generated assuming the existence of the current customer relationships and the cash flows assuming those relationships do not exist and are replaced over time. Estimated costs on projected revenues, excluding acquired contract backlog, were made using historical data pertaining to sales to new and existing customers. The cash flow impact of projected cost savings, primarily avoidance of legal costs pertaining to new customers and lower commission rates applicable to existing customers than new customers, were discounted at a rate of 11% to determine the fair value.\nThe value of the trade name was estimated using the relief-from-royalty method, an income approach (Level 3), which estimates the cost savings that accrue to the owner of the intangibles asset that would otherwise be payable as royalties or license fees on revenues earned through the use of the asset. A royalty rate of 1% was applied to the projected revenues associated with the intangible asset to determine the amount of savings using a discount rate of 12% to determine the fair value.\nDiscount rates for each respective intangible asset were determined by accounting for the risk associated with each asset, including required technology development necessary to support respective projections, the uncertainty of market success and the risk inherent with projected financial results. The estimated useful lives were determined by evaluating the expected economic and useful lives of the assets and of similar intangible assets from previous business combinations and adjusting accordingly for circumstances that may be unique to Respond Software.\nGoodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets\nChanges in the carrying amount of goodwill for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were as follows (in thousands):\nAmount\nBalance as of December 31, 2018\n$ 999,804\nGoodwill acquired\n205,488\nBalance as of December 31, 2019\n$ 1,205,292\nGoodwill acquired\n159,594\nBalance as of December 31, 2020\n$ 1,364,886\nPurchased intangible assets consisted of the following (in thousands):\nAs of December 31,\n2020 2019\nDeveloped technology\n$ 178,303 $ 148,303\nContent\n158,700 158,700\nCustomer relationships\n122,450 115,690\nContract backlog\n13,200 13,200\nTrade names\n17,930 17,160\nNon-competition agreements\n1,400 1,400\nTotal intangible assets\n$ 491,983 454,453\nLess: accumulated amortization\n(365,916) (320,033)\nTotal net intangible assets\n$ 126,067 $ 134,420\nAmortization expense of intangible assets during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $45.9 million, $53.9 million and $50.3 million, respectively.\nThe expected future annual amortization expense of intangible assets as of December 31, 2020 is presented below (in thousands):\nYears Ending December 31, Amount\n2021 $ 46,891\n2022 35,575\n2023 28,444\n2024 9,985\n2025 5,172\n2026 and thereafter -\nTotal $ 126,067\n6. Restructuring Charges\nIn January 2019, we implemented a restructuring plan designed primarily to align our resources with the strategic growth initiatives of the business. This restructuring plan resulted in a reduction of less than 2% of our total workforce as of March 31, 2019, as well as exiting and downsizing of certain real estate facilities. In August 2019, we implemented an additional restructuring plan to further align our resources with the strategic growth initiatives of the business, which related primarily to employee severance charges and other termination benefits as well as costs associated with exiting certain real estate facilities.\nIn January 2020, we implemented a restructuring plan designed primarily to align our resources and investments with the strategic growth initiatives of the business. This restructuring plan resulted in a reduction of less than 2% of our total workforce as of March 31, 2020 as well as the impairment of certain long lived assets.\nIn April 2020, we implemented another restructuring plan to streamline the Company\u2019s operations to more closely align expenses to the Company\u2019s projected revenue, position the Company for improved operating performance and allow the Company to increase investment in strategic growth areas of the business. This restructuring plan resulted in the reduction of 6% of the Company\u2019s workforce.\nIn August and December 2020, we implemented additional restructuring plans, predominantly related to facilities and obsolete assets in order to position the Company for improved operating performance. These August and December 2020 restructuring plans resulted in the reduction of approximately 1% of the Company\u2019s workforce.\nThe total restructuring charges during the year ended December 31, 2020 of $26.5 million includes $19.0 million of cash charges which primarily consists of $15.4 million in provision for restructuring charges and $3.6 million in other adjustments, which was offset by a $0.7 million reduction in severance benefits that were not utilized. In addition, there are non-cash charges of $7.4 million related to fixed asset and right-of-use asset write-offs and stock-based compensation.\nThe following table sets forth the restructuring balance as of December 31, 2018 related to previous restructuring activities and a summary of restructuring activities during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 (in thousands):\nSeverance and related costs Facilities costs Total costs\nBalance at December 31, 2018 $ - $ 1,150 $ 1,150\nProvision for restructuring charges 7,586 731 8,317\nCash payments (7,636) (271) (7,907)\nOther adjustments 214 (1,140) (926)\nBalance at December 31, 2019 $ 164 $ 470 $ 634\nProvision for restructuring charges 15,148 276 15,424\nCash payments (17,678) (196) (17,874)\nOther adjustments 2,936 (72) 2,864\nBalance at December 31, 2020 $ 570 $ 478 $ 1,048\nOther adjustments of $2.9 million and negative $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 respectively, primarily represented relief of unused benefits, changes in fair value and foreign currency fluctuations.\nThe remaining restructuring balance of $1.0 million at December 31, 2020 is primarily composed of $0.5 million non-cancelable lease costs, which we expect to pay over the terms of the related obligations through the first quarter of 2022, net of sublease income and $0.6 million of severance costs.\n7. Deferred Commissions\nWe capitalize most of our commission expenses and related payroll taxes and amortize them on a systematic basis that is consistent with the transfer to the customer of the goods or services to which the asset relates. Changes in the balance of total deferred commissions for the periods presented are as follows (in thousands):\nDeferred Commissions\nBalance at December 31, 2018 $ 100,657\nCommissions capitalized 76,763\nCommissions recognized (74,621)\nBalance at December 31, 2019 102,799\nCommissions capitalized 82,874\nCommissions recognized (81,559)\nBalance at December 31, 2020 $ 104,114\n8. Leases\nWe have operating leases primarily for corporate offices. Our leases have remaining lease terms of one to nine years, some of which include options to extend the leases for up to five years, and some of which include options to terminate the leases within one year. We do not include renewal options in our lease terms for calculating our lease liability, as the renewal options allow us to maintain operational flexibility and we are not reasonably certain we will exercise these renewal options at the time of the lease commencement.\nThe components of lease expenses were as follows (in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31, 2020\nOperating lease costs $ 16,880\nShort-term lease costs 1,861\nSublease income (942)\nTotal net lease costs $ 17,799\nSupplemental balance sheet information related to leases is as follows (in thousands, except lease term and discount rate):\nAs of December 31, 2020\nOperating leases:\nOperating lease right-of-use assets, net $ 38,251\nOperating lease liabilities, current $ 16,024\nOperating lease liabilities, non-current 42,202\nTotal operating lease liabilities $ 58,226\nWeighted average remaining lease term (in years) 5.5\nWeighted average discount rate 6.7 %\nThe ROU assets and the short-term and long-term lease liabilities from our operating leases are included in other assets, accrued liabilities and other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets, respectively.\nSupplemental cash flow and other information related to leases is as follows (in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31, 2020\nCash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities:\nOperating cash flows from operating leases $ 20,228\nLease liabilities arising from obtaining right-of-use assets:\nOperating leases $ 478\nCash flows of operating lease liabilities are as follows (in thousands):\nYears Ending December 31,\nAmount\n2021 $ 16,537\n2022 12,363\n2023 10,284\n2024 8,863\n2025 8,191\n2026 and thereafter 14,371\nTotal lease payments\n$ 70,609\nLess: Imputed interest\n$ (12,383)\nTotal lease obligation\n$ 58,226\nLess: Current lease obligations\n(16,024)\nLong-term lease obligations\n$ 42,202\nAs of December 31, 2020, we have an additional operating lease commitment of $18.3 million for an office lease that has not yet commenced. The operating lease commitment will commence in the first quarter of 2021 with a lease term of 11.2 years.\n9. Deferred Revenue\nDeferred revenue as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 consisted of the following (in thousands):\nAs of December 31, 2020 As of December 31, 2019\nProduct, subscription and support, current\n$ 503,740 $ 508,580\nProfessional services, current\n109,969 95,364\nTotal deferred revenue, current\n$ 613,709 $ 603,944\nProduct, subscription and support, non-current\n341,541 369,589\nProfessional services, non-current\n1,207 1,034\nTotal deferred revenue, non-current\n$ 342,748 $ 370,623\nTotal deferred revenue\n$ 956,457 $ 974,567\nChanges in the balance of deferred revenue for the periods presented are as follows (in thousands):\nDeferred Revenue\nBalance at December 31, 2018 $ 934,828\nBillings for the period\n926,141\nRevenue recognized\n(889,152)\nAssumed in connection with acquisitions 2,750\nBalance at December 31, 2019 $ 974,567\nBillings for the period\n919,810\nRevenue recognized\n(940,584)\nAssumed in connection with acquisitions\n2,664\nBalance at December 31, 2020 $ 956,457\nRemaining Performance Obligations\nTransaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations represents contracted revenue that has not yet been recognized, which includes deferred revenue and non-cancelable contracts that will be invoiced and recognized as revenue in future periods (\"backlog\"). While deferred revenue is recorded on our balance sheet as a liability, backlog is not recorded in revenue, deferred revenue or elsewhere in our consolidated financial statements until we establish a contractual right to invoice, at which point it is recorded as revenue or deferred revenue as appropriate. As of December 31, 2020, the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations was $956.5 million in deferred revenue and $52.0 million in backlog. As of December 31, 2019, the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations was $974.6 million in deferred revenue and $15.1 million in backlog.\nWe expect that the amount of backlog relative to the total value of our contracts will change from year to year due to several factors, including the amount invoiced early in the contract term, the timing and duration of customer agreements, varying invoicing cycles of agreements and changes in customer financial circumstances. Accordingly, we believe that fluctuations in backlog are not always a reliable indicator of future revenues and we do not utilize backlog internally as a key management metric.\nWe expect to recognize these remaining performance obligations as follows (in percentages):\nTotal Less than 1 year 1-2 years 2-3 years More than 3 years\nDeferred revenue 100% 64% 22% 10% 4%\nBacklog 100% 56% 24% 15% 5%\n10. Convertible Senior Notes\nConvertible Senior Notes due 2024\nOn May 24, 2018, we issued $525.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 2024 Notes in a private placement to qualified institutional purchasers pursuant to an exemption from registration provided by Section 4(a)(2) and Rule 144A under the Securities Act. In addition, on June 5, 2018, we issued an additional $75.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 2024 Notes pursuant to the full exercise of the initial purchasers' option to purchase additional 2024 Notes, in a private placement exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act. The net proceeds from the offerings, after deducting the initial purchasers' discount of approximately $15.0 million and the issuance costs of approximately $0.6 million, were $584.4 million. We used (i) approximately $330.4 million of the net proceeds to repurchase approximately $340.2 million in aggregate principal amount outstanding of the Series\nA Notes in negotiated transactions with institutional investors and (ii) approximately $65.2 million of the net proceeds from the offering of the 2024 Notes to enter into the Capped Calls (as defined below).\nThe 2024 Notes are unsecured obligations and rank senior in right of payment to any of our indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the 2024 Notes. They rank equally in right of payment with all of our existing and future liabilities that are not expressly subordinated to the 2024 Notes including the Series A Notes and the Series B Notes (as defined below); and effectively rank junior in right of payment to any of our secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. The 2024 Notes are structurally junior to all indebtedness and other liabilities (including trade payables) of our subsidiaries.\nThe 2024 Notes do not contain any financial covenants and do not restrict us from paying dividends or issuing or repurchasing other securities.\nThe 2024 Notes bear interest at 0.875% per year, payable semiannually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year, beginning December 1, 2018. The 2024 Notes mature on June 1, 2024, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted.\nThe initial conversion rate of the 2024 Notes is 43.1667 shares of our common stock per $1,000 of principal amount of the 2024 Notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $23.17 per share of common stock. The conversion rate of the 2024 Notes may be adjusted pursuant to the terms of the indenture governing the 2024 Notes upon the occurrence of certain specified events, but not for accrued and unpaid interest.\nHolders may convert the 2024 Notes at their option in multiples of $1,000 principal amount prior to the business day preceding March 1, 2024, only under the following circumstances:\n\u2022during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ended on September 30, 2018 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price of the common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price of the 2024 Notes on each applicable trading day;\n\u2022during the five business day period after any five consecutive trading day period (the \"measurement period\") in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of the 2024 Notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of our common stock and the conversion rate for the notes on each such trading day;\n\u2022if we call any or all of the 2024 Notes for redemption, at any time prior to the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately preceding the relevant redemption date; or\n\u2022upon the occurrence of specified corporate events, as specified in each indenture governing the 2024 Notes.\nRegardless of the foregoing conditions, holders may convert their 2024 Notes at their option in multiples of $1,000 principal amount during the period from, and including, March 1, 2024 to the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date. Upon conversion, the 2024 Notes can be settled in cash, shares of our common stock or any combination of cash and shares of common stock at our option.\nHolders may also require us to repurchase the 2024 Notes if we undergo a \"fundamental change,\" as defined in each indenture governing the 2024 Notes, at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date.\nAdditionally, we may redeem for cash all or any portion of the 2024 Notes on or after June 5, 2021, if the last reported sale price of our common stock has been at least 130% of the conversion price of the 2024 Notes then in effect for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any 30 consecutive trading day period (including the last trading day of such period) immediately preceding the date on which we provide notice of redemption at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date.\nAs of December 31, 2020, none of the conditions permitting holders to convert their 2024 Notes had been satisfied and no shares of our common stock had been issued in connection with any conversions of the 2024 Notes. Based on the closing price of our common stock of $23.06 per share on December 31, 2020, the conversion value of the 2024 Notes was less than the principal amount of the 2024 Notes outstanding on a per 2024 Note basis.\nIn accordance with accounting for debt with conversions and other options, we bifurcated the principal amount of the 2024 Notes into liability and equity components. The initial liability component of the 2024 Notes was valued at $458.3 million based on the contractual cash flows discounted at an appropriate comparable market non-convertible debt borrowing rate at the date of issuance of 5.5% with the equity component representing the residual amount of the proceeds of $141.7 million, which was recorded as a debt discount. Issuance costs were allocated pro rata based on the relative initial carrying amounts of the liability and equity components. As a result, transaction costs of $0.5 million and $0.1 million and initial purchasers' discount of $11.5 million and $3.5 million were attributable to the liability component and equity component of the 2024 Notes, respectively. The debt discount and the issuance costs\nallocated to the liability component are amortized as additional interest expense over the term of the 2024 Notes using the effective interest method as noted in the table below.\nThe liability and equity components of the 2024 Notes consisted of the following (in thousands):\nAs of December 31,\n2020 2019\nLiability component:\nPrincipal $ 600,000 $ 600,000\nLess: 2024 Notes debt discounts and issuance costs, net of amortization (92,750) (117,078)\nNet carrying amount $ 507,250 $ 482,922\nEquity component, net of issuance costs $ 138,064 $ 138,064\nThe unamortized issuance costs as of December 31, 2020 will be amortized over a weighted-average remaining period of approximately 3.4 years.\nInterest expense for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 related to the 2024 Notes consisted of the following (dollars in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2019\nCoupon interest $ 5,250 $ 5,250\nAmortization of 2024 Notes debt discounts and issuance costs 24,328 23,161\nTotal interest expense recognized $ 29,578 $ 28,411\nEffective interest rate on the liability component 6.1 % 6.2 %\nIn connection with the 2024 Notes offering, the Company entered into capped call transactions (the \"Capped Calls\") with certain counterparties affiliated with the initial purchasers of the 2024 Notes. The Capped Calls are expected to reduce potential dilution of earnings per share upon conversion of the 2024 Notes, and have an initial strike price of $23.17 per share, which corresponds to the initial conversion price of the 2024 Notes and which have a cap price of $34.32 per share. The Capped Calls do not meet the criteria for separate accounting as a derivative as they are indexed to our own stock and are accounted for as freestanding financial instruments. The premiums paid for the purchase of the Capped Calls in the amount of $65.2 million have been recorded as a reduction of the Company's additional paid-in capital in stockholder's equity in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and fair values of the Capped Calls are not re-measured at each reporting period.\nConvertible Senior Notes due 2035\nIn June 2015, we issued $460.0 million principal amount of Series A Notes and $460.0 million principal amount of 1.625% Convertible Senior Notes due 2035 (the \u201cSeries B Notes\u201d and together with the Series A Notes, the \"2035 Notes\", and the 2035 Notes, together with the 2024 Notes, the \"Convertible Senior Notes\"), including the full exercise of the initial purchasers' over-allotment option, in a private placement to qualified institutional purchasers pursuant to an exemption from registration provided by Section 4(a)(2) and Rule 144A under the Securities Act. The net proceeds after the initial purchasers' discount of $23.0 million and issuance costs of $0.5 million from the 2035 Notes were $896.5 million. The Series A Notes and Series B Notes bear interest at 1.000% per year and 1.625% per year, respectively, payable semiannually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year, beginning December 1, 2015. The 2035 Notes mature on June 1, 2035, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted.\nThe 2035 Notes are unsecured obligations and rank senior in right of payment to any of our indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the 2035 Notes. They rank equally in right of payment with all of our existing and future liabilities that are not expressly subordinated to the 2035 Notes and effectively rank junior in right of payment to any of our secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. They are structurally junior to all indebtedness and other liabilities (including trade payables) of our subsidiaries.\nThe 2035 Notes do not contain any financial covenants and do not restrict us from paying dividends or issuing or repurchasing our other securities.\nThe initial conversion rate on each series of 2035 Notes is 16.4572 shares of our common stock per $1,000 principal amount of 2035 Notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $60.76 per share of common stock. The conversion rate of each series of 2035 Notes may be adjusted upon the occurrence of certain specified events, but not for accrued and unpaid interest.\nHolders may convert the 2035 Notes at their option in multiples of $1,000 principal amount prior to March 1, 2035, excluding the period from March 1, 2020 to June 1, 2020 in the case of the Series A Notes and March 1, 2022 to June 1, 2022 in the case of the Series B Notes, only under the following circumstances:\n\u2022during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ended on September 30, 2015 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price of the common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price for the 2035 Notes of the relevant series on each applicable trading day;\n\u2022during the five business day period after any five consecutive trading day period in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of Series A Notes or Series B Notes, as applicable, for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of our common stock and the conversion rate for the notes of the relevant series on each such trading day;\n\u2022if we call any or all of the 2035 Notes of a series for redemption, at any time prior to the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately preceding the relevant redemption date; or\n\u2022upon the occurrence of specified corporate events, as specified in each indenture governing the 2035 Notes.\nRegardless of the foregoing conditions, holders may convert their 2035 Notes at their option in multiples of $1,000 principal amount at any time during the period from March 1, 2020 to June 1, 2020 in the case of the Series A Notes and during the period from March 1, 2022 to June 1, 2022 in the case of the Series B Notes, or after March 1, 2035 until maturity for either series of 2035 Notes. Upon conversion, the 2035 Notes can be settled in cash, shares of our common stock or any combination thereof at our option.\nWe may be required by holders of the 2035 Notes to repurchase all or any portion of their 2035 Notes at 100% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, on each of June 1, 2020, June 1, 2025 and June 1, 2030, in the case of the Series A Notes, and each of June 1, 2022, June 1, 2025 and June 1, 2030 in the case of the Series B Notes. Holders may also require us to repurchase the 2035 Notes if we undergo a \"fundamental change,\" as defined in each indenture governing the 2035 Notes, at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest.\nAdditionally, we may redeem for cash all or any portion of the Series B Notes on or after June 1, 2020 until June 1, 2022 if the last reported sale price of our common stock has been at least 130% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any 30 consecutive trading day period (including the last trading day of such period) ending not more than three trading days immediately preceding the date we provide notice of redemption. We also may redeem for cash all or any portion of the Series A Notes on or after June 1, 2020 until maturity and all or any portion of the Series B Notes on or after June 1, 2022 until maturity, regardless of the foregoing sale price condition.\nIn accordance with accounting for debt with conversions and other options, we allocated the principal amount of the 2035 Notes into liability and equity components. We also allocated the total amount of initial purchasers' discount and transaction costs incurred to the liability and equity components using the same proportions as the proceeds from the 2035 Notes. Transaction costs of $0.4 million and $0.1 million and initial purchasers' discount of $17.6 million and $5.4 million were attributable to the liability component and equity component of the 2035 Notes, respectively.\nRepurchases of a portion of the Series A Notes\nIn May 2018, we used approximately $330.4 million of the net proceeds from the offering of the 2024 Notes to repurchase $340.2 million in aggregate principal amount of the Series A Notes. The repurchase was accounted for as a partial extinguishment of the Series A Notes. The consideration of approximately $330.4 million used to repurchase the Series A Notes was allocated between the liability and equity components of the amount extinguished by determining the fair value of the liability component immediately prior to the debt extinguishment and allocating that portion of the repurchase price to the liability component in the amount of $317.4 million. The residual of the repurchase price of $13.0 million was allocated to the equity component of the Series A Notes as a reduction of additional paid-in capital. The fair value of the debt extinguished was calculated using a discount rate of 4.5%, representing an estimate of the Company's borrowing rate at the date of repurchase with a remaining expected life of two years. As part of the repurchase, we wrote-off a portion of the unamortized debt issuance cost apportioned to the principal amount of Series A Notes repurchased. We also recorded a loss on partial extinguishment of the Series A Notes of $10.8 million in Other Expense, net, representing the difference between the consideration attributed to the liability component and the sum of the net carrying amount of the liability component and unamortized costs.\nIn June 2020, the Company delivered a notice to the holders of Series A Notes to notify such holders of their option to require the Company to repurchase their Series A Notes on June 1, 2020. Holders representing $96.4 million aggregate principal amount of Series A Notes chose to exercise their option to require the Company to repurchase their Series A Notes. The repurchase was accounted for as a partial extinguishment of the Series A Notes. The consideration of approximately $96.4 million was used to repurchase the Series A Notes. The fair value of the debt extinguished was deemed to be the same as the par value of $96.4 million and no gain or loss was recognized.\nAs of December 31, 2020, $23.4 million aggregate principal amount of the Series A Notes remains outstanding.\nThe liability and equity components of the 2035 Notes consisted of the following (in thousands):\nAs of December 31,\n2020 2019\nSeries A Notes Series B Notes Series A Notes Series B Notes\nLiability component:\nPrincipal $ 23,436 $ 460,000 $ 119,828 $ 460,000\nLess: 2035 Notes discounts and issuance costs, net of amortization - (29,790) (2,540) (49,650)\nNet carrying amount $ 23,436 $ 430,210 $ 117,288 $ 410,350\nEquity component, net of issuance costs $ 15,559 $ 117,834 $ 79,555 $ 117,834\nThe unamortized discounts and issuance costs as of December 31, 2020 will be amortized over a weighted-average remaining period of approximately 1.4 years.\nInterest expense for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 related to the 2035 Notes consisted of the following (in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2019 2018\nSeries A Notes Series B Notes Series A Notes Series B Notes Series A Notes Series B Notes\nCoupon interest $ 636 $ 7,475 $ 1,198 $ 7,454 $ 2,537 $ 7,454\nAmortization of 2035 Notes discounts and issuance costs 2,540 19,859 5,879 18,943 11,785 18,068\nTotal interest expense recognized $ 3,176 $ 27,334 $ 7,077 $ 26,397 $ 14,322 $ 25,522\nEffective interest rate on the liability component 2.7 % 6.7 % 6.4 % 6.7 % 6.4 % 6.8 %\nPrepaid Forward Stock Purchase\nIn connection with the issuance of the 2035 Notes, we also entered into privately negotiated prepaid forward transactions (the \"Prepaid Forwards\") with one of the initial purchasers of the 2035 Notes (the \u201cForward Counterparty\u201d), pursuant to which we paid approximately $150.0 million. The amount of the Prepaid Forward entered into in connection with the issuance of the Series A Notes\nwas equivalent to approximately 1.6 million shares which was settled on June 3, 2020. The amount of the Prepaid Forward entered into in connection with the issuance of the Series B Notes was equivalent to approximately 1.8 million shares which is to be settled on or around June 1, 2022, subject to any early settlement, in whole or in part, of such Prepaid Forward. Such Prepaid Forward is intended to facilitate privately negotiated derivative transactions by which investors in the Series B Notes will be able to hedge their investment in the Series B Notes. In the event we pay any cash dividends on our common stock, the Forward Counterparty will pay an equivalent amount back to us.\nThe related shares were accounted for as a repurchase of common stock, and are presented as Treasury Stock in the consolidated balance sheets. On June 3, 2020, we retired approximately 1.6 million shares delivered under the Prepaid Forward entered into in connection with the issuance of the Series A Notes. The remaining approximately 1.8 million shares of common stock purchased under the Prepaid Forward entered into in connection with the issuance of the Series B Notes are excluded from weighted-average shares outstanding for basic and diluted EPS purposes although they remain legally outstanding.\n11. Commitments and Contingencies\nLetters of Credit\nWe are party to letters of credit totaling $3.9 million and $3.6 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, issued primarily in support of operating leases for several of our facilities. These letters of credit are collateralized by a line with our bank. No amounts have been drawn against these letters of credit.\nContract Manufacturer Commitments\nOur independent contract manufacturers procure components and assemble our products based on our forecasts. These forecasts are based on estimates of future demand for our products, which are in turn based on historical trends and an analysis from our sales and product marketing organizations, adjusted for overall market conditions. In order to reduce manufacturing lead times and plan for adequate supply, we may issue forecasts and orders for components and products that are non-cancelable. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had non-cancelable open orders of $6.0 million and $5.0 million, respectively. We are required to record a liability for firm, non-cancelable and unconditional purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts. As of December 31, 2020, we have not incurred nor accrued any significant liabilities for such non-cancelable commitments.\nPurchase Obligations\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had approximately $16.2 million of non-cancelable firm purchase commitments primarily for purchases of software and services. In situations where we have received delivery of the goods or services as of December 31, 2020 under purchase orders outstanding as of the same date, such amounts are reflected in the consolidated balance sheet as accounts payable or accrued liabilities, and are excluded from the $16.2 million.\nLitigation\nFrom time to time, we are involved in claims and legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. Any claims or proceedings against us, whether meritorious or not, could be time consuming, result in costly litigation, require significant amounts of management time, result in the diversion of significant operational resources, or require us to enter into agreements which may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all.\nTo the extent there is a reasonable possibility that a loss exceeding amounts already recognized may be incurred, and the amount of such additional loss would be material, we will either disclose the estimated additional loss or state that such an estimate cannot be made. We do not currently believe that it is reasonably possible that additional losses in connection with litigation arising in the ordinary course of business would be material.\nIndemnification\nUnder the indemnification provisions of our standard sales related contracts, we agree to defend our customers against third-party claims asserting infringement of certain intellectual property rights, which may include patents, copyrights, trademarks, or trade secrets, and to pay judgments entered on such claims. Our exposure under these indemnification provisions is generally limited to the total amount paid by our customer under the agreement. However, certain agreements include indemnification provisions that could potentially expose us to losses in excess of the amount received under the agreement. In addition, we indemnify our officers, directors, and certain key employees for actions taken while they are or were serving in good faith in such capacities. Through December 31, 2020, there have been no claims under any indemnification provisions.\n12. Redeemable Preferred Stock\nOn November 18, 2020, we entered into the Series A Securities Financing Agreements. Pursuant to the Series A Securities Financing Agreements, on December 11, 2020 we issued and sold 400,000 shares of a newly designated 4.5% Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (\u201cSeries A Preferred Stock\u201d), at a price of $1,000 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of $400.0 million. We\nintend to use the net proceeds from the issuance and sale to fund acquisitions, buybacks of our common stock, and for working capital purposes.\nEach share of Series A Preferred Stock has the powers, designations, preferences, and other rights of the shares of such series as are set forth in the Certificate of Designations of the Series A Preferred Stock filed by the Company with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on December 11, 2020 (the \u201cCertificate of Designations\u201d).\nThe Series A Preferred Stock ranks senior to the Company\u2019s common stock (\u201cCommon Stock\u201d), with respect to dividend rights and rights upon the voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the affairs of the Company (a \u201cLiquidation\u201d). Upon a Liquidation, each share of Series A Preferred Stock is entitled to receive an amount per share equal to the greater of (i) the purchase price paid by the Purchaser, plus all accrued and unpaid dividends and (ii) the amount that the holder of Series A Preferred Stock (each, a \u201cHolder\u201d and collectively, the \u201cHolders\u201d) would have been entitled to receive at such time if the Series A Preferred Stock were converted into Common Stock (the \u201cLiquidation Preference\u201d). The initial purchase price of the Series A Preferred Stock is $1,000 per share (the \u201cOriginal Purchase Price\u201d). The Holders are entitled to dividends on the Original Purchase Price paid by the Purchaser at the rate of 4.5%, cumulatively, per annum that (i) for the first three years after December 11, 2020 will be paid in-kind, and (ii) after the third anniversary of December 11, 2020, will, at the Company\u2019s election either be paid in cash, or, if not, will accrue and accumulate, in each case, accruing daily and paid quarterly in arrears. The Holders are also entitled to participate in dividends declared or paid on the Common Stock on an as-converted basis.\nThe Holder has the right, at its option, to convert its Series A Preferred Stock, in whole or in part, into fully paid and non-assessable shares of Common Stock at a conversion price equal to $17.25 per share subject to certain customary adjustments in the event of certain adjustments to the Common Stock. As of December 31, 2020, the conversion price was equal to $17.25 per share. After the third anniversary of December 11, 2020, subject to certain conditions, the Company may, at its option, require conversion of all of the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock to Common Stock if, for at least 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading days immediately preceding the date the Company notifies the Holders of the election to convert, the closing price of the Common Stock is at least 175% of the conversion price.\nAfter the seventh anniversary of December 11, 2020, each Holder shall have the right to require the Company to redeem all or any part of the Holder\u2019s Series A Preferred Stock for cash at a price equal to the Original Purchase Price paid by the Purchaser plus any accrued and unpaid dividends. Upon a \u201cFundamental Change\u201d (involving a change of control, bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation or de-listing of the Company as further described in the Certificate of Designations), each Holder shall have the right to require the Company to redeem all or any part of the Holder\u2019s Series A Preferred Stock for an amount equal to the Liquidation Preference at a repurchase price calculated in accordance with the Certificate of Designations plus any accrued and unpaid dividends.\nThe Holders are generally entitled to vote with the holders of the shares of Common Stock on all matters submitted for a vote of holders of shares of Common Stock (voting together with the holders of shares of Common Stock as one class) on an as-converted basis, subject to certain Nasdaq voting limitations, if applicable. Additionally, the consent of the Holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock is required for so long as any shares of the Series A Preferred Stock remain outstanding for (i) amendments to the Company\u2019s organizational documents that have an adverse effect on the holders of Series A Preferred Stock and (ii) issuances by the Company of securities that are senior to, or equal in priority with, the Series A Preferred Stock. In addition, for so long as 25% of the Series A Preferred Stock issued in connection with the Financing Agreements remains outstanding, consent of the Holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock is required for (i) any change to the size of the Board of Directors of the Company, (ii) any voluntary dissolution, liquidation, bankruptcy, winding up or deregistration or delisting and (iii) incurrence by the Company of net debt in excess of $350,000,000.\nWe have applied the guidance in ASC 480-10-S99-3A, SEC Staff Announcement: Classification and Measurement of Redeemable Securities and have therefore classified the Series A Preferred Stock as mezzanine equity. The Series A Preferred Stock was recorded outside of stockholders\u2019 deficit because it is probable that the shares will be redeemed at the option of the Holders and that redemption option is not solely within the Company's control. Upon issuance, we elected to record the Series A Preferred Stock at redemption value. As such, we recognized $4.7 million of accretion as of December 31, 2020.\nAs of December 31, 2020 we had accrued dividends of $1.0 million on the Series A Preferred Stock. Accrued dividends are recorded against additional paid-in capital due to the Company being in an accumulated deficit position.\n13. Common Shares Reserved for Issuance\nUnder our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, we are authorized to issue 100,000,000 shares of convertible preferred stock with a par value of $0.0001 per share, of which 400,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock were outstanding as of December 31, 2020. No shares of convertible preferred stock were outstanding as of December 31, 2019.\nUnder our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, we are authorized to issue 1,000,000,000 shares of common stock with a par value of $0.0001 per share as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. Each share of common stock outstanding is entitled to one vote. The holders of common stock are also entitled to receive dividends whenever funds are legally available and when declared by our Board of Directors, subject to the prior rights of holders of all classes of convertible preferred stock outstanding.\nWe had reserved shares of common stock for issuance as follows (in thousands):\nAs of December 31,\n2020 2019\nReserved under stock award plans\n38,745 37,982\nConvertible senior notes\n33,856 35,442\nConvertible preferred stock 23,249 -\nESPP\n3,425 3,428\nTotal\n99,275 76,852\n14. Equity Award Plans\nWe have operated under our 2013 Equity Incentive Plan (\"2013 Plan\") since our initial public offering (\"IPO\") in September 2013. Our 2013 Plan provides for the issuance of restricted stock and the granting of options, stock appreciation rights, performance shares, performance units and restricted stock units to our employees, officers, directors and consultants. Our 2013 Plan provides for annual increases in the number of shares available for issuance on the first day of each fiscal year. Awards granted under the 2013 Plan vest over the periods determined by our Board of Directors or compensation committee of our Board of Directors, generally four years, and stock options granted under the 2013 Plan expire no more than ten years after the date of grant. In the case of an incentive stock option granted to an employee who at the time of grant owns stock representing more than 10% of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock, the exercise price shall be no less than 110% of the fair value per share on the date of grant, and the award shall expire five years from the date of grant. For options granted to any other employee, the per share exercise price shall be no less than 100% of the fair value per share on the date of grant. In the case of non-statutory stock options and options granted to consultants, the per share exercise price shall be no less than 100% of the fair value per share on the date of grant. Stock that is purchased prior to vesting is subject to our right of repurchase at any time following termination of the participant's service for so long as such stock remains unvested. Approximately 14.9 million shares and 11.9 million shares of our common stock were reserved for future grants as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, under the 2013 Plan. As of January 1, 2021, an additional 11,784,453 shares of common stock became available for future grants under our 2013 Plan pursuant to provisions thereof that automatically increase the share reserve under such plan each year.\nOur ESPP allows eligible employees to acquire shares of our common stock at 85% of the lower of the fair market value of our common stock on the first trading day of each offering period or on the exercise date. Our ESPP provides for annual increases in the number of shares available for issuance on the first day of each fiscal year. An aggregate of 3,425,303 shares and 3,427,955 shares of common stock were available for future issuance as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, under our ESPP. As of January 1, 2021, an additional 2,356,890 shares of common stock became available for future issuance under our ESPP pursuant to the provisions thereof that automatically increase the share reserve under such plan each year.\nFrom time to time, we also grant restricted common stock or restricted stock awards outside of our equity incentive plans to certain employees in connection with acquisitions.\nStock Option Activity\nA summary of the activity for our stock option changes during the reporting periods and a summary of information related to options outstanding and options exercisable are presented below (in thousands, except per share amounts and contractual life years):\nOptions Outstanding\nNumber of\nShares Weighted-\nAverage\nExercise\nPrice Weighted-\nAverage\nContractual\nLife (years) Aggregate\nIntrinsic\nValue\nBalance - December 31, 2017 4,433 $ 12.31\nGranted\n- -\nExercised\n(946) 7.28 $ 9,588\nCancelled\n(178) 35.78\nBalance - December 31, 2018 3,309 $ 12.49\nGranted\n- -\nExercised\n(731) 5.73 7,537\nCancelled\n(140) 22.65\nAssumed in connection with acquisition\n1,953 3.00\nBalance - December 31, 2019 4,391 $ 9.07\nGranted\n- -\nExercised\n(1,414) 5.19 12,849\nCancelled\n(334) 13.85\nAssumed in connection with acquisition\n842 1.39\nBalance - December 31, 2020 3,485 $ 8.33 5.3 $ 60,679\nOptions exercisable - December 31, 2020\n2,076 $ 12.43 3.3 $ 31,426\nThe aggregate intrinsic value above represents the pre-tax difference between the exercise price of stock options and the quoted market price of our stock on that day for all in-the-money stock options.\nRestricted Stock Award (RSA) and Restricted Stock Unit (RSU) Activity\nA summary of the activity for our restricted common stock, RSAs and RSUs during the reporting periods and a summary of information related to unvested restricted common stock, RSAs and RSUs and those expected to vest based on the achievement of a performance condition are presented below (in thousands, except per share amounts and contractual life years):\nNumber of\nShares Weighted-\nAverage\nGrant Date\nFair Value\n(per share) Weighted-\nAverage\nContractual\nLife (years) Aggregate\nIntrinsic\nValue\nUnvested balance - December 31, 2017 20,017 $ 17.09\nGranted\n12,209 15.42\nVested\n(8,828) 18.11\nCancelled\n(3,117) 16.81\nUnvested balance - December 31, 2018 20,281 $ 15.53\nGranted\n13,302 16.82\nVested\n(8,894) 16.03\nCancelled\n(2,992) 16.10\nUnvested balance - December 31, 2019 21,697 $ 16.07\nGranted\n15,838 15.03\nVested\n(10,077) 15.23\nCancelled\n(7,058) 16.41\nUnvested balance - December 31, 2020 20,400 $ 15.35 1.4 $ 470,424\nUnvested awards for which the requisite service period has not been rendered and vesting is subject to the achievement of a performance condition - December 31, 2020 1,631 $ 17.27 1.5 $ 37,601\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, we issued 1.2 million, 1.4 million and 1.3 million shares, respectively, of restricted common stock, restricted stock awards or restricted stock units to certain employees which vest upon the achievement of certain performance conditions in addition to a continued service relationship with the Company.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe record stock-based compensation based on the fair value as determined on the date granted. We determine the fair value of stock options and shares of common stock to be issued under the ESPP using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The fair value of restricted stock units and restricted stock awards equals the market value of the underlying stock on the date of grant. We grant performance-based restricted stock units and restricted stock awards to certain employees which vest upon the achievement of certain performance conditions, subject to the employees\u2019 continued service relationship with us. With respect to performance-based restricted stock units, we assess the probability of vesting at each reporting period and adjust our compensation cost based on this probability assessment. We recognize such compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the service provider\u2019s requisite service period. We determined valuation assumptions as follows:\nFair Value of Common Stock\nWe use the listed stock price on the date of grant as the fair value of our common stock.\nRisk-Free Interest Rate\nWe base the risk-free interest rate used in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model on the implied yield available on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with an equivalent expected term of the options for each option group.\nExpected Term\nThe expected term represents the period that our stock-based awards are expected to be outstanding. We base the expected term assumption on our historical experience combined with estimates of post-vesting holding periods.\nVolatility\nWe determine the price volatility factor based on the historical volatilities of our peer group as we do not have sufficient trading history for our common stock.\nDividend Yield\nThe expected dividend assumption is based on our current expectations about our anticipated dividend policy.\nThe following table summarizes the assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to determine the fair value of our common shares under the ESPP:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2019 2018\nFair value of common stock\n$13.06 - $15.03\n$14.59 - $16.35\n$16.69 - $20.01\nRisk-free interest rate\n0.09% - 0.18%\n1.60% - 2.35%\n2.08% - 2.70%\nExpected term (in years)\n0.5 - 1.0\n0.5 - 1.0\n0.5 - 1.0\nVolatility\n48% - 68%\n29% - 39%\n32% - 38%\nDividend yield\n-% -% -%\nStock-based compensation expense related to stock options, ESPP and restricted stock units and awards is included in the consolidated statements of operations as follows (in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2019 2018\nCost of product, subscription and support revenue\n$ 16,393 $ 14,905 $ 14,178\nCost of professional services revenue\n18,695 13,972 14,184\nResearch and development\n45,867 45,476 49,503\nSales and marketing\n49,662 49,198 47,592\nGeneral and administrative\n25,176 29,966 28,218\nRestructuring\n314 - -\nTotal\n$ 156,107 $ 153,517 $ 153,675\nAs of December 31, 2020, total compensation cost related to stock-based awards not yet recognized was $298.6 million, which is expected to be amortized on a straight-line basis over the weighted-average remaining vesting period of approximately 2.5 years.\n15.

The transfer resulted in a step-up in the tax basis of the transferred intellectual property rights and a correlated increase in foreign deferred tax assets. As of December 31, 2020, we believe it is more likely than not that these additional foreign deferred tax assets will not be realized and therefore, are offset by a full valuation allowance. Due to our history of losses we believe it is more likely than not that our U.S. deferred tax assets will not be realized as of December 31, 2020. Accordingly, we have established a full valuation allowance on our U.S. deferred tax assets. Our valuation allowance increased by approximately $38.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2020. This change is primarily attributable to an increase in deferred tax assets related to deferred revenue and research and development credits and, a decrease in deferred tax liability related to convertible debt.\nIn July 2015, the U.S. Tax Court issued an opinion in Altera Corp. v. Commissioner related to the treatment of stock-based compensation expense in an intercompany cost-sharing arrangement (CSAs). The opinion invalidated part of a treasury regulation requiring stock-based compensation to be included in any qualified intercompany cost-sharing arrangement. On June 7, 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed the U.S. Tax Court\u2019s decision. On July 22, 2019, Altera Corp. filed a petition for an en banc rehearing before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which was denied on November 12, 2019. On February 10, 2020, Altera Corp. filed a petition to the U.S. Supreme Court for review of the decision. On June 22, 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to issue a writ of certiorari, thus leaving intact the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit\u2019s 2019 decision upholding the validity of the Treasury regulations that require related parties to share the costs of stock-based compensation as a component of their intangible development costs in CSAs. We previously recorded a tax benefit based on the Tax Court\u2019s opinion issued in 2015, which was offset by a corresponding increase in the valuation allowance against U.S. deferred tax assets. In 2019, we recorded a reduction of $9.4 million to our deferred tax asset for U.S. net operating loss carryforwards, which are subject to a valuation allowance. In 2020, as a result of the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s decision, we reversed the reduction of $9.4 million to our deferred tax assets for U.S. net operating loss carryforwards, which is fully offset by valuation allowance.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had federal, state and foreign net operating loss carry forwards of approximately $431.5 million, $473.6 million and $52.9 million, respectively, available to reduce future taxable income, if any. If not utilized, the federal net operating loss carry forwards will expire from the years ending December 31, 2034 through 2037 while state net operating loss carry forwards will expire from the years ending December 31, 2021 through 2037. All of the foreign net operating loss can be carried forward indefinitely.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we also had federal and state income tax credit carry forwards of approximately $46.4 million and $25.6 million, respectively. If not utilized, the federal credit carry forwards will expire in various amounts from the years ended December 31, 2024 through 2040. Most of the state tax credits can be carried forward indefinitely.\nUtilization of the net operating loss carry forwards and credits may be subject to an annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations provided by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and similar state provisions. The annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses and credits before utilization.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had $50.2 million of unrecognized tax benefits, of which if recognized, $2.0 million would affect our effective tax rate. We file income tax returns in U.S. federal, state and foreign jurisdictions. As we have net operating loss carry forwards for U.S. federal and state jurisdictions, the statute of limitations is open for all tax years. For material foreign jurisdictions, the tax years open to examination include the years 2016 and forward. We recognize both interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized interest and penalties of $96,000. During the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we recognized a $113,000 and $151,000 increase to interest and penalties, respectively. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, our total accrual for interest and penalties was $764,000 and $668,000, respectively. The ultimate amount and timing of any future cash settlements cannot be predicted with reasonable certainty.\nA reconciliation of gross unrecognized tax benefits is as follows (in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2019 2018\nUnrecognized tax benefits at the beginning of the period $ 56,134 $ 42,490 $ 39,387\nIncreases related to current year tax positions 3,401 7,076 2,651\nIncreases related to prior year tax positions 281 6,654 501\nDecreases related to prior year tax positions (9,389) - -\nDecreases related to settlements with taxing authorities (227) (29) -\nDecreases related to lapse of statute of limitations (9) (57) (49)\nUnrecognized tax benefits at the end of the period $ 50,191 $ 56,134 $ 42,490\nAs of December 31, 2020, we have not provided for state income taxes or foreign withholding taxes on the undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries which are considered indefinitely invested outside of the U.S. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability related to these earnings is not practicable.\n16. Net Loss per Share\nBasic net loss per share is calculated by dividing net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period, less shares subject to repurchase, and excludes any dilutive effects of employee share based awards and options. Diluted net income per common share is computed giving effect to all potentially dilutive common shares, including common stock issuable upon exercise of stock options, convertible preferred stock, conversion of the Convertible Senior Notes and unvested restricted common stock and stock units. As we had net losses for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, all potential common shares were excluded as they were determined to be anti-dilutive.\nThe following table sets forth the computation of net loss per common share (in thousands, except per share amounts):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2019 2018\nNumerator:\nNet loss\n(207,303) (257,409) (243,123)\nDividend on series A convertible preferred stock (1,050) - -\nAccretion of series A convertible preferred stock $ (4,653) $ - $ -\nNet loss attributable to common stockholders, basic and diluted $ (213,006) $ (257,409) $ (243,123)\nDenominator:\nWeighted average number of shares outstanding-basic and diluted\n$ 223,308 $ 207,234 $ 190,803\nNet loss per share attributable to common stockholders, basic and diluted\n$ (0.95) $ (1.24) $ (1.27)\nThe following outstanding options, unvested shares and units, ESPP shares, shares issuable upon the conversion of our Convertible Senior Notes, convertible preferred stock and shares contingently issuable were excluded (as common stock equivalents) from the computation of diluted net loss per common share for the periods presented as their effect would have been anti-dilutive (in thousands):\nAs of December 31,\n2020 2019 2018\nOptions to purchase common stock\n3,485 4,391 3,309\nUnvested restricted stock awards and units\n20,400 21,697 20,281\nConvertible preferred stock 23,249 - -\nConvertible senior notes\n33,856 35,442 35,442\nESPP shares\n197 166 160\n17. Employee Benefit Plan\n401(k) Plan\nWe have established a 401(k) tax-deferred savings plan (the \u201c401(k) Plan\u201d) which permits participants to make contributions by salary deduction pursuant to Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. All participants\u2019 interests in their deferrals are 100% vested when contributed. We are responsible for administrative costs of the 401(k) Plan and have made no matching contributions into our 401(k) Plan since inception. Under the 401(k) Plan, pre-tax contributions are allocated to each participant\u2019s individual account and are then invested in selected investment alternatives according to the participants\u2019 directions. The 401(k) Plan is intended to qualify under Sections 401(a) and 501(a) of the Code. As a tax-qualified retirement plan, contributions to the 401(k) Plan and earnings on those contributions are not taxable to the employees until distributed, and all contributions are deductible by us when and if made.\n18. Segment and Major Customers Information\nDisaggregation of revenue by geography\nWe conduct business globally and are primarily managed on a geographic basis. Our Chief Executive Officer, who is our chief operating decision maker, reviews financial information presented on a consolidated basis accompanied by information about revenue by geographic region for purposes of allocating resources and evaluating financial performance. We define our regions as United States (\"U.S.\"), Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (\"EMEA\"), Asia Pacific and Japan (\"APAC\"), and all remaining geographies (primarily Latin America and Canada) included in Others. There are no segment managers who are held accountable for operations, operating results, and plans for levels, components, or types of products or services below the consolidated unit level. Accordingly, we are considered to be a single reportable segment and operating unit structure.\nRevenue by geographic region based on the billing address is as follows (in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2019 2018\nU.S. $ 584,696 $ 554,856 $ 523,150\nEMEA 158,560 155,357 135,736\nAPAC 140,492 131,361 122,516\nOther 56,836 47,578 49,548\nTotal revenue $ 940,584 $ 889,152 $ 830,950\nDisaggregation of revenue by product category\nWe generate revenue from sales of our network, email and endpoint security solutions, network forensics appliances, cloud threat intelligence and analytics subscriptions, managed security, our Mandiant professional services, our Helix security operations platform, and our Mandiant security validation platform (formerly Verodin security instrumentation platform). We disaggregate our revenue into two main categories: (i) product, subscription, and support and (ii) professional services.\nWithin the product, subscription and support category, we provide supplemental data to distinguish between solutions that are deployed on-premise on physical or virtual appliances, and solutions and managed services that are not dependent on appliances. These solutions include security delivered entirely through the cloud or delivered through hybrid on premise/cloud platform. Security solutions that are dependent on appliances are included in the product and related subscription and support sub-category, and solutions\nand managed services without dependency on appliances are included in the platform, cloud subscription and managed services sub-category.\nIn addition to our product, subscription and support solutions, we offer professional services, including incident response and other security consulting services, to our customers who have experienced a cybersecurity breach or desire assistance assessing the resilience of their information systems infrastructure. The majority of our professional services are offered on a time and materials basis, through a fixed fee arrangement, or on a retainer basis. Revenue from professional services is recognized as services are delivered. Revenue from our Expertise-on-Demand micro-services and some pre-paid professional services is deferred, and revenue is recognized when services are delivered.\nThe following table depicts the disaggregation of revenue according to revenue type and is consistent with how we evaluate our financial performance (in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2019 2018\nRevenue by Category\nProduct and related subscription and support\n$ 422,812 $ 467,823 $ 498,992\nPlatform, cloud subscription and managed services\n302,133 $ 241,013 188,390\nProfessional services\n215,639 $ 180,316 143,568\nTotal revenue\n$ 940,584 $ 889,152 $ 830,950\nLong lived assets by geography\nLong lived assets by geographic region based on physical location is as follows (in thousands):\nAs of December 31,\n2020 2019\nProperty and Equipment, net:\nUnited States $ 73,699 $ 85,287\nInternational 6,071 8,525\nTotal property and equipment, net $ 79,770 $ 93,812\nFor the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, one distributor represented 13% and 20%, respectively, of the Company's total revenue, but did not represent 10% or greater of the Company's total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020, and one reseller represented 15%, 14% and 15%, respectively, of the Company's total revenue. Additionally, another distributor represented 12% and 10%, respectively, of the Company's total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, but did not represent 10% or greater of the Company's total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, no customer represented 10% or more of the Company's net accounts receivable balance.",

Controls and Procedures\nLimitations on Effectiveness of Controls\nIn designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2020. The term \"disclosure controls and procedures,\" as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (or the \u201cExchange Act\u201d), means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC\u2019s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nBased on our evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that, as of December 31, 2020, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.\nManagement\u2019s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020 based on the criteria related to internal control over financial reporting described in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2020.\nDeloitte & Touche LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K, has issued a report, included herein, on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rule 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2020 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of FireEye, Inc.\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the internal control over financial reporting of FireEye, Inc. and subsidiaries (the \u201cCompany\u201d) as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020, of the Company and our report dated February 26, 2021, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company\u2019s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management\u2019s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP\nSan Jose, California\nFebruary 26, 2021",
