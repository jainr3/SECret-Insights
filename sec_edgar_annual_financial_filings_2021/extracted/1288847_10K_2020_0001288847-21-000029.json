    "item_1": "ITEM 1. Business\nOverview\nFive9 is a pioneer and leading provider of intelligent cloud software for contact centers. We were \u201cborn in the cloud,\u201d and since our inception, we have exclusively focused on delivering our platform in the cloud and are disrupting a significantly large market by replacing legacy on-premise contact center systems. Contact centers are vital hubs of interaction between organizations and their customers and, therefore, are essential to delivering successful customer service, sales and marketing strategies. Our mission is to empower organizations to transform their contact centers into customer engagement centers of excellence, while improving business agility and significantly lowering the cost and complexity of their contact center operations. Our purpose-built, highly scalable and secure Virtual Contact Center, or VCC, cloud platform delivers a comprehensive suite of easy-to-use applications that enable the breadth of contact center-related customer service, sales and marketing functions. We have become an established leader in the cloud contact center market, facilitating more than seven billion call minutes between our more than 2,000 clients and their customers per year. We believe our ability to combine software and telephony into a single unified platform that is delivered in the cloud creates a significant advantage.\nWe believe there are two key industry trends driving growth in the cloud contact center market.\nFirst is the rapid increase in adoption of cloud contact center software solutions as a result of several distinct factors. The increasing adoption of cloud computing, especially within customer relationship management, or CRM, is creating strong demand for integrated cloud contact center software solutions. In addition, cloud contact center software solutions now offer the functionality required by large, complex enterprise contact centers. Furthermore, we believe organizations typically refresh their on-premise contact center systems every eight to 10 years, which provides an opportunity for cloud solutions to replace legacy on-premise contact center systems when these replacement decisions arise. On-premise systems require large up-front investments, long deployment cycles, and are burdensome to maintain. These systems are also often inflexible, complex, and require significant duplication of effort and integration across multiple sites. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has increased the prevalence of agents working remotely which presents a challenge to premise-based systems that, by design, are focused on a particular physical location. This creates substantial challenges for clients with on-premise contact center systems. As a result, cloud contact center software solutions are continuing to replace legacy on-premise contact center systems.\nSecond is digital transformation. Consumers have the ability to easily and quickly switch brands after experiencing poor customer service. Therefore, it is more critical than ever to provide the tools and technologies to meet consumer demands for a seamless experience across digital channels of their choice. Cloud contact center software solutions provide organizations with the agility to adapt to a rapidly evolving environment and innovative functionalities to reimagine the way they engage with customers.\nAdditionally, with the advent of real-time, accurate and increasingly economical automatic speech recognition and natural language processing, or NLP, previously analog voice conversations with consumers can now be digitized. This newly-digitized data along with text channels such as WhatsApp, SMS, chat and social are increasingly allowing mundane contact center tasks to be handled economically and efficiently by virtual agents and making live agents more efficient.\nOur solution, comprised of our VCC cloud platform and various associated applications such as Workforce Optimization, or WFO, Workforce Automation, or WFA, and interactive virtual agent, or IVA, allows simultaneous management and optimization of customer interactions across voice, chat, email, web, social media and mobile channels, either directly or through our application programming interfaces, or APIs. Our VCC cloud platform matches each customer interaction with an appropriate agent resource and delivers relevant customer data to the agent in real-time through integrations with adjacent enterprise applications, such as CRM software, to optimize the customer experience and improve agent productivity. Our solution ensures our clients always have the latest version of our software. Delivered on-demand, our solution enables our clients to quickly deploy agent seats in any geographic location with only a computer, headset and broadband internet connection, and rapidly adjust the number of contact center agent seats in response to changing business requirements. Unlike legacy on-premise contact center systems, our solution requires minimal up-front investment, can be rapidly deployed and are maintained by us in the cloud.\nOur sales model consists of a field sales team that sells our solution into larger opportunities and a telesales team that sells our solution into smaller opportunities. We have developed a proven, high velocity, metrics-driven sales and marketing strategy, designed to effectively identify, qualify and close sales opportunities. To complement this go-to-market strategy, we have developed a large ecosystem of technology and system integrator partners and independent software vendors to help increase awareness of our solution in the market and drive additional sales opportunities with new and existing clients. We have also established, and are continuing to increase, our network of master sales agents, which provide sales leads and resellers that sell our solution to new clients. This network has helped us attract additional clients. Our resellers have assisted us in expanding in both domestic and international markets.\nWe provide our solution through a software-as-a-service, or SaaS, business model with recurring subscriptions based primarily on the number of agent seats and minutes of usage, as well as the specific functionalities and applications our clients deploy.\nWe have achieved significant growth in recent periods. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, our revenues were $434.9 million, $328.0 million and $257.7 million, respectively, representing year-over-year growth of 33% and 27%, respectively. We incurred net losses of $42.1 million, $4.6 million and $0.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, as a result of increased investment in our growth, along with higher stock-based compensation and interest expense. As of December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, our total assets were $1,063.7 million, $482.4 million and $394.7 million, respectively. Our recurring revenue model combined with our Annual Dollar-Based Retention Rate, which was 110% under our prior calculation based on Net Invoicing and 117% under our new calculation based on Net Revenue, both as of December 31, 2020, have enhanced our ability to forecast our financial performance and plan future investments. For a description of how our Annual Dollar-Based Retention Rate is calculated, please refer to ITEM 7 \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe operate in a single reportable segment. Please refer to the geographical information for each of the last three years in Note 11 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements. Please refer to the discussion of risks related to our foreign operations in the section entitled \u201c",
    "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. Risk Factors\nOur operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties. You should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in this report. If any of the following risks or other risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and future prospects could be materially harmed, and the price of our common stock could decline.\nRisk Factors Summary\nThe following is a summary of the principal risks that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and future prospects.\n\u2022Our quarterly and annual results may fluctuate significantly, may not fully reflect the underlying performance of our business and may result in decreases in the price of our common stock.\n\u2022If we are unable to attract new clients or sell additional services and functionality to our existing clients, our revenue and revenue growth will be harmed.\n\u2022Our recent rapid growth may not be indicative of our future growth, and if we continue to grow rapidly, we may fail to manage our growth effectively.\n\u2022Failure to adequately retain and expand our direct sales force will impede our growth.\n\u2022If we fail to manage our technical operations infrastructure, our existing clients may experience service outages, our new clients may experience delays in the deployment of our solution and we could be subject to, among other things, claims for credits or damages.\n\u2022Our growth depends in part on the success of our strategic relationships with third parties and our failure to successfully maintain, grow and manage these relationships could harm our business.\n\u2022We have established, and are continuing to increase, our network of master agents and resellers to sell our solution; our failure to effectively develop, manage, and maintain this network could materially harm our revenues.\n\u2022Adverse economic conditions may harm our business.\n\u2022The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have materially affected how we, our clients and business partners are operating, and the duration and extent to which this will impact our future results of operations and overall financial performance remains uncertain.\n\u2022Security breaches and improper access to or disclosure of our data or our clients\u2019 data, or other cyber attacks on our systems, could result in litigation and regulatory risk, harm our reputation and our business.\n\u2022We may acquire other companies, or technologies or be the target of strategic transactions, or be impacted by transactions by other companies, which could divert our management\u2019s attention, result in additional dilution to our stockholders and otherwise disrupt our operations and harm our operating results.\n\u2022The markets in which we participate involve numerous competitors and are highly competitive, and if we do not compete effectively, our operating results could be harmed.\n\u2022If our existing clients terminate their subscriptions or reduce their subscriptions and related usage, our revenues and gross margins will be harmed and we will be required to spend more money to grow our client base.\n\u2022We sell our solution to larger organizations that require longer sales and implementation cycles and often demand more configuration and integration services or customized features and functions that we may not offer, any of which could delay or prevent these sales and harm our growth rates, business and operating results.\n\u2022Because a significant percentage of our revenue is derived from existing clients, downturns or upturns in new sales will not be immediately reflected in our operating results and may be difficult to discern.\n\u2022We rely on third-party telecommunications and internet service providers to provide our clients and their customers with telecommunication services and connectivity to our cloud contact center software and any failure by these service providers to provide reliable services could cause us to lose clients and subject us to claims for credits or damages, among other things.\n\u2022We have a history of losses and we may be unable to achieve or sustain profitability.\n\u2022The contact center software solutions market is subject to rapid technological change, and we must develop and sell incremental and new products in order to maintain and grow our business.\n\u2022We may not be able to secure additional financing on favorable terms, or at all, to meet our future capital needs.\n\u2022Failure to comply with laws and regulations could harm our business and our reputation.\n\u2022We may not have sufficient cash to service our convertible senior notes and repay such notes, if required.\nRisks Related to COVID-19\nThe effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have materially affected how we, our clients and business partners are operating, and the duration and extent to which this will impact our future results of operations and overall financial performance remains uncertain.\nIn December 2019, a novel coronavirus disease known as COVID-19 was reported and on March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization, or WHO, characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic. This pandemic has resulted in a widespread health crisis that has continued to significantly harm the U.S. and global economies and has caused significant fluctuation in financial markets, including those on which our common stock and other securities trade, and may impact demand for our solution.\nIn accordance with the various social distancing and other office closure orders and recommendations of applicable government agencies, all of our employees have transitioned to work-from-home operations and we have canceled all business travel by our employees except where necessary and properly authorized, which has changed how we operate our business. Our clients and business partners are also subject to various and changing social distancing and office closure orders and recommendations and travel restrictions or prohibitions, which have changed the way we interact with our clients and business partners. Moreover, the conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the extent of which depends upon its prolonged impact, has or may:\n\u2022harm our ability to renew and maintain our relationships with our existing clients;\n\u2022cause our existing clients to reduce the number of seats to which they subscribe, seek price concessions, or go out of business, which would harm our revenue;\n\u2022result in some of our clients failing to comply with the terms of their agreements, including payment terms, due to economic uncertainty, financial hardship, and even failure of these businesses, which could result in us being required to take action to collect payments, terminate their subscriptions for our solution, increase accounts receivable, and reduce collections, any which would increase our expenses and harm our revenues and results of operations;\n\u2022make it more difficult for us to sell increased services or functionality to our existing clients;\n\u2022reduce the rate of spending on enterprise software solutions or cloud-based enterprise contact center systems generally;\n\u2022delay prospective clients\u2019 decisions to subscribe to our solution, increase the length of sales cycles, or slow the typical growth in the use of our solution once clients have initially deployed our solution;\n\u2022harm our ability to effectively market and sell our solution, particularly during social distancing and office closure orders;\n\u2022change the mix and sizes or types of organizations that purchase our solution;\n\u2022delay the introduction of enhancements to our solution and market acceptance of any new features and products;\n\u2022harm our ability to grow our international sales and operations;\n\u2022harm our ability to recruit, onboard and successfully integrate new employees, including members of our direct sales force, both domestically and internationally, as a result of not being able to interface in person;\n\u2022harm our ability to maintain our corporate culture with an employee base temporarily working remotely and facing unique personal and professional challenges;\n\u2022increase the burden on our technical operations infrastructure, which could harm the capacity, stability, security and performance of our operations infrastructure and potentially leave us more vulnerable to security breaches;\n\u2022increase the risk that we may experience cybersecurity-related events such as COVID-19 themed phishing attacks, exploitation of any cybersecurity flaws that may exist, an increase in the number of cybersecurity threats or attacks, and other security challenges as a result of our employees and service providers continuing to work remotely from non-corporate managed networks during the COVID-19 pandemic, and potentially beyond as remote work and resource access expand;\n\u2022limit our ability to efficiently provide professional services to our larger clients, as those services have typically been performed onsite, which could delay implementation of our solution at new clients;\n\u2022harm our ability to manage, maintain or increase our network of master agents and resellers to sell our solution, and make it more difficult for them to effectively assist us with their sales efforts;\n\u2022impact the health and safety of our employees, including our senior management team, and their ability to perform services;\n\u2022cause our management team to continue to commit significant time, attention and resources to monitor the COVID-19 pandemic and seek to mitigate its effect on our business and workforce;\n\u2022lead to the adoption of additional new laws and regulations that we are required to comply with and that could harm our results of operations, and we may be subject to COVID-19 related litigation; and\n\u2022cause the price per share of our common stock or the trading price of our convertible senior notes to continue to experience substantial volatility, and potentially decline, based on developments and announcements related to COVID-19 and its impact on the global and U.S. economy in general or our industry in particular, our failure to meet our guidance or analyst expectations or withdrawal or modification by us of previously issued guidance.\nAny of the foregoing factors could significantly harm our future sales, operating results, gross margins and overall financial performance, which could cause us to experience a decreased level of growth of our business and make our future financial results and prospects difficult to predict. The COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on us and the U.S. and global economies could limit our ability to forecast our future operating results, including our ability to predict revenue and expense levels, and plan for and model future results of operations. Moreover, because a significant portion of our revenue is derived from existing clients, downturns in new sales will not immediately be reflected in our operating results and may be difficult to discern until future periods. Our competitors could experience different impacts as a result of COVID-19, which could result in changes to our competitive landscape.\nThe duration and extent of the impact from the COVID-19 pandemic depends on future developments that cannot be accurately predicted at this time, such as the ongoing severity and transmission rate of the virus, the extent and effectiveness of vaccine programs and other containment actions, the duration of social distancing, office closure and other restrictions on businesses and society at large, and the specific impact of these and other factors on our business, employees, clients and partners. If we are not able to respond to and manage the impact of such events effectively, our business will be harmed. There are no comparable recent events that provide guidance as to the effect the COVID-19 pandemic may have and, as a result, the ultimate impact of the outbreak on our business and operations is highly uncertain and subject to change. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic could have a material impact on our results of operations and increase many of the other risks described herein.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Results\nOur quarterly and annual results may fluctuate significantly, may not fully reflect the underlying performance of our business and may result in decreases in the price of our common stock.\nOur quarterly and annual results of operations, including our revenues, profitability and cash flow have varied, and may vary significantly in the future, and period-to-period comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful. Accordingly, the results of any one quarter or period, or series of quarters or periods, should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. Our quarterly and annual financial results may fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are outside our control and, as a result, may not fully reflect the underlying performance of our business. Fluctuation in quarterly and annual results may harm the value of our common stock. Factors that may cause fluctuations in our quarterly and annual results include, without limitation:\n\u2022market acceptance of our solution, including new features that are added to our solution;\n\u2022our ability to attract new clients and grow our business with existing clients;\n\u2022client renewal rates;\n\u2022client attrition rates;\n\u2022network outages or security incidents, which may result in additional expenses or losses, legal or regulatory actions, the loss of clients, the provision of client credits, and harm to our reputation;\n\u2022our ability to make technological advancements and add more features to our solution;\n\u2022our ability to adequately expand our sales and service team;\n\u2022our ability to acquire and maintain strategic and client relationships;\n\u2022the timing and success of new product and feature introductions by us or our competitors or any other change in the competitive dynamics of our industry, including consolidation, partnership or collaboration among competitors, clients or strategic partners;\n\u2022our ability to successfully integrate companies, businesses and technology that we acquire and achieve a positive return on our investment;\n\u2022general economic, industry and market conditions;\n\u2022the amount and timing of costs and expenses related to the maintenance and expansion of our business, operations and infrastructure;\n\u2022seasonal factors that may cause our revenues in the first half of a year to be relatively lower than our revenues in the second half of a year;\n\u2022inaccessibility or failure of our cloud contact center software due to failures in the products or services provided by third parties;\n\u2022the amount and timing of costs and expenses related to our research and development efforts or in the acquisition of technologies or businesses and potential future charges for impairment of goodwill from acquired companies;\n\u2022our ability to expand, and effectively utilize, our network of master agents, resellers and systems integrators;\n\u2022the timing of recognition of revenues under current and future GAAP;\n\u2022changes in our pricing policies or those of our competitors;\n\u2022increases or decreases in the costs to provide our solution or pricing changes upon any renewals of client agreements;\n\u2022the level of professional services and support we provide our clients;\n\u2022fluctuations or changes in the components of our revenue;\n\u2022the addition or loss of key clients, including through acquisitions or consolidations;\n\u2022compliance with, or changes in, the current and future domestic and international regulatory environment;\n\u2022the hiring, training and retention of key employees;\n\u2022the outcome of litigation or other claims against us;\n\u2022the ability to expand internationally, and to do so profitability;\n\u2022our ability to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms if and when needed; and\n\u2022advances and trends in new technologies and industry standards.\nBecause a significant percentage of our revenue is derived from existing clients, downturns or upturns in new sales will not be immediately reflected in our operating results and may be difficult to discern.\nWe generally recognize subscription revenue from clients monthly as services are delivered. As a result, the vast majority of the subscription revenue we report in each quarter is derived from existing clients. Consequently, a decline in new subscriptions in any single quarter will likely have only a small impact on our revenue results for that quarter. However, the cumulative impact of such declines could negatively impact our business and results of operations in future quarters. Accordingly, the effect of significant downturns in sales and market acceptance of our solution, and potential changes in our pricing policies or renewal rates, will typically not be reflected in our results of operations until future periods. We also may be unable to adjust our cost structure to reflect the changes in revenue, resulting in lower margins and earnings. In addition, our subscription model makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue through additional sales in any period, as revenue from new clients will be recognized over time as services are delivered. Moreover, many of our clients initially deploy our solution to support only a portion of their contact center agents and, therefore, we may not generate significant revenue from these new clients at the outset of our relationship, if at all. Any increase to our revenue and the value of these existing client relationships will only be reflected in our results of operations as subscription revenue is recognized, and if and when these clients increase the number of agent seats and the number of components of our solution they deploy over time.\nShifts over time or from quarter-to-quarter in the mix of sizes or types of organizations that purchase our solution or changes in the components of our solution purchased by our clients could affect our gross margins and operating results.\nOur strategy is to sell our solution to both smaller and larger organizations. Our gross margins can vary depending on numerous factors related to the implementation and use of our solution, including the features and number of agent seats purchased by our clients and the level of usage and professional services and support required by our clients. For example, our larger clients typically require more professional services and because our professional services offerings typically have lower margins, any increase in sales of professional services could harm our gross margins and operating results. We also have lower margins on our usage revenues. Sales to larger organizations may also entail longer sales cycles and more significant selling efforts and expense. Selling to smaller clients may involve smaller contract sizes, fewer opportunities to sell additional services, a higher likelihood of contract terminations, lower returns on sales and marketing expense, fewer potential agent seats and greater credit risk and uncertainty. If the mix of organizations that purchase our solution, or the mix of solution components purchased by our clients, changes unfavorably, our revenues and gross margins could decrease and our operating results could be harmed.\nWe have a history of losses and we may be unable to achieve or sustain profitability.\nWe have incurred losses in each annual period since our inception in 2001. We incurred net losses of $42.1 million, $4.6 million and $0.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of $198.2 million. These losses and our accumulated deficit reflect the substantial investments we have made, and continue to make, to develop our solution and acquire new clients, among other expenses. We expect the dollar amount of our costs and expenses to increase in the future as revenue increases, although at a slower rate. We expect our losses to continue for the foreseeable future as we continue to invest in sales and marketing and research and development and expand our business. In addition, as a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses. Our historical or recent growth in\nrevenues is not necessarily indicative of our future performance. Accordingly, there is no assurance that we will achieve profitability in the future or that, if we do become profitable, we will sustain profitability.\nRisks Related to Our Growth\nOur recent rapid growth may not be indicative of our future growth, and if we continue to grow rapidly, we may fail to manage our growth effectively.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, our revenues were $434.9 million, $328.0 million and $257.7 million, respectively, representing year-over-year growth of 33% and 27%, respectively. In the future, as our revenue increases, our annual revenue growth rate may decline. We believe our revenue growth will depend on a number of factors, including our ability to:\n\u2022compete with other vendors of cloud-based enterprise contact center systems, including recent market entrants, and with providers of legacy on-premise systems;\n\u2022increase our existing clients\u2019 use of our solution, including additional and new features of our solution;\n\u2022further develop our partner ecosystem;\n\u2022strengthen and improve our solution through significant investments in research and development and the introduction of new and enhanced features and functionality;\n\u2022introduce our solution to new markets outside of the United States and increase global awareness of our brand;\n\u2022selectively pursue acquisitions that enhance our solution offerings; and\n\u2022respond to general macro economic factors and industry and market conditions, including the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIf we are not successful in achieving these objectives, our ability to grow our revenue may be harmed. In addition, we plan to continue to invest in future growth, including expending substantial financial and other resources on:\n\u2022sales and marketing, including a significant expansion of our sales and professional services organization;\n\u2022our technology infrastructure, including systems architecture, management tools, scalability, availability, performance and security, as well as disaster recovery measures;\n\u2022solution development, including investments in our solution development team, the development of new solutions and in the acquisition of companies and technologies to enhance our solution, as well as new applications and features for our existing solution;\n\u2022international expansion; and\n\u2022general administration, including legal, regulatory compliance and accounting expenses.\nMoreover, we continue to expand our headcount and operations. We grew from 983 employees as of December 31, 2018 to 1,210 employees as of December 31, 2019, and to 1,549 employees as of December 31, 2020. We anticipate that we will continue to expand our operations and headcount in the near term and beyond. This growth has placed, and future growth will place, a significant strain on our management, administrative, operational and financial resources, company culture and infrastructure. For example, in the fourth quarter of 2020, we acquired Inference Solutions Inc., or Inference, which will increase the complexity of our operations, administration and infrastructure. Our success will depend in part on our ability to manage this growth effectively while retaining personnel. To manage the expected growth of our operations and personnel, we will need to continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls and our reporting systems and procedures. Failure to effectively manage growth could result in difficulty or delays in adding new clients, declines in quality or client satisfaction, increases in costs, system failures, difficulties in introducing new features or solutions, the need for more capital than we anticipate or other operational difficulties, and any of these difficulties could harm our business performance and results of operations.\nThe expected addition of new employees and the capital investments that we anticipate will be necessary to help us grow and to manage that growth will make it more difficult for us to generate earnings or offset any future revenue shortfalls by reducing costs and expenses in the short term. If we fail to manage our anticipated growth, we will be unable to execute our business plan successfully.\nOur growth depends in part on the success of our strategic relationships with third parties and our failure to successfully maintain, grow and manage these relationships could harm our business.\nWe leverage strategic relationships with third parties, such as CRM providers, WFO providers, other technology providers, systems integrators, and telephony providers. For example, our relationship with CRM providers and systems integrators provide significant lead generation for new client opportunities. These relationships are typically not exclusive and our partners often also offer products of our competitors. As we grow our business, we will continue to depend on both existing and new strategic relationships. Our competitors may be more successful than we are in establishing or expanding relationships with third parties or may provide incentives to third parties to favor their products over our solution. Our competitors may also have deeper or broader relationships with third parties, including products that we do not offer or that are outside our core markets, that could give these competitors an advantage in establishing and maintaining relationships with these third parties. These strategic partners may cease to recommend our solution to prospective clients due to actual or perceived lack of features, technological or security issues or failures, reputational concerns, economic incentives, or other factors, which would harm our business, financial condition and operations. Furthermore, there has and continues to be a significant amount of consolidation in our industry and adjacent industries, and if our partners are acquired, fail to work effectively with us or go out of business, they may no longer support or promote our solution, or may be less effective in doing so, which could harm our business, financial condition and operations. If we are unsuccessful in establishing or maintaining our strategic relationships with third parties, or these partners fail to recommend our solution, our ability to compete in the marketplace or to grow our revenues could be impaired and our operating results may suffer. Even if we are successful, we cannot assure you that these relationships will result in increased client usage of our solution or increased revenue.\nIn addition, identifying new partners, and negotiating and documenting relationships with them, requires significant time and resources. As the complexity of our solution and our third-party relationships increases, the management of those relationships and the negotiation of contractual terms sufficient to protect our rights and limit our potential liabilities will become more complicated. We also license technology from certain third parties, including through OEM relationships. Certain of these agreements permit either party to terminate all or a portion of the relationship without cause at any time and for any reason. If one of these agreements is terminated by the other party, we would have to find an alternative source or develop new technology ourselves, which preclude, limit or delay our ability to offer our solution or certain product features to our clients, result in increased expense and harm our business. Our inability to successfully manage and maintain these complex relationships or negotiate sufficient and favorable contractual terms could harm our business.\nOur recent growth makes it difficult to evaluate and predict our current business and future prospects.\nWhile we have been in existence since 2001, much of our employee, revenue and operations growth has occurred in recent years. Our recent growth may make it difficult for investors to evaluate our current business and our future prospects. We have encountered and will continue to encounter risks and difficulties frequently experienced by growing companies in rapidly changing industries, including increasing and unforeseen expenses as we continue to grow our business.\nOur ability to forecast our future operating results is limited and subject to a number of uncertainties, including our ability to predict revenue and expense levels, and plan for and model future growth. These uncertainties may be exacerbated by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. We have encountered and will continue to encounter risks and uncertainties frequently experienced by growing companies in rapidly changing industries, such as the risks and uncertainties described in this annual report. If our assumptions regarding these risks and uncertainties, which we use to plan our business, are incorrect or change due to adjustments in our markets or our competitors and their product offerings, or if we do not address these risks successfully, our operating and financial results could differ materially from our expectations and our business could suffer.\nRisks Related to Our Clients\nIf we are unable to attract new clients or sell additional seats, functionality and services to our existing clients, our revenue and revenue growth will be harmed.\nTo increase our revenue, we must add new clients, add additional agent seats and sell additional seats, functionality and services to existing clients, and encourage existing clients to renew their subscriptions on terms favorable to us. As our industry matures, as our clients experience seasonal trends in their business, or as\ncompetitors introduce lower cost or differentiated products or services that are perceived to compete favorably with ours, our ability to add new clients and renew, maintain or sell additional services to existing clients based on pricing, cost of ownership, technology and functionality could be harmed. As a result, our existing clients may not renew our agreements or may decrease their number of agent seats, and we may be unable to attract new clients or grow or maintain our business with existing clients, which could harm our revenue and growth.\nFurthermore, a portion of our revenue is generated by acquiring domestic and international telecommunications minutes from wholesale telecommunication service providers and reselling those minutes to our clients. As telecommunications rates continue to decrease, we may not be able to resell more minutes to maintain our level of usage revenue.\nIf our existing clients terminate their subscriptions or reduce their subscriptions and related usage, our revenues and gross margins will be harmed and we will be required to spend more money to grow our client base.\nWe expect to continue to derive a significant portion of our revenues from existing clients. As a result, retaining our existing clients is critical to our future operating results. We offer monthly, annual and multiple-year contracts to our clients, generally with 30 days\u2019 notice required for reductions in the number of agent seats. Increases in the number of agent seats can be provisioned almost immediately. Our clients, therefore, are able to adjust the number of agent seats used to meet their changing contact center volume needs. Subscriptions and related usage by our existing clients may decrease if:\n\u2022clients are not satisfied with our services, prices or the functionality of our solution;\n\u2022the stability, performance or security of our solution are not satisfactory;\n\u2022the U.S. or global economy declines;\n\u2022our clients\u2019 business or demand for our services declines due to industry cycles, seasonality, business difficulties or other reasons, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022clients favor products offered by other contact center providers, particularly as competition continues to increase;\n\u2022fewer clients purchase usage from us;\n\u2022alternative technologies, products or features emerge or gain popularity that we do not provide; or\n\u2022our clients or potential clients experience financial difficulties, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIf our existing clients\u2019 subscriptions and related usage decrease or are terminated, we will need to spend more money to acquire new clients and still may not be able to maintain our existing level of revenues. We incur significant costs and expenses, including sales and marketing expenses, to acquire new clients, and those costs and expenses are an important factor in determining our profitability. There can be no assurance that our efforts to acquire new clients will be successful.\nThe loss of one or more of our key clients, or a failure to renew our subscription agreements with one or more of our key clients, could harm our ability to market our solution.\nWe rely on our reputation and recommendations from key clients in order to market and sell our solution. The loss of any of our key clients, or a failure of some of them to renew or to continue to recommend our solution, could have a significant impact on our revenues, reputation and our ability to obtain new clients. In addition, acquisitions of our clients could lead to cancellation of our contracts with those clients, thereby reducing the number of our existing and potential clients and key reference clients.\nOur clients may fail to comply with the terms of their agreements, necessitating action by us to collect payment, or may terminate their subscriptions for our solution.\nIf clients fail to pay us under the terms of our agreements or fail to comply with the terms of our agreements, including compliance with regulatory requirements and intellectual property terms, we may terminate clients, lose revenue, be unable to collect amounts due to us, be subject to legal or regulatory action and incur costs in enforcing the terms of our contracts, including litigation. Some of our clients may seek bankruptcy protection or other similar relief and fail to pay amounts due to us, seek reimbursement for amounts already paid, or pay those amounts more slowly, all of which risks may be exacerbated by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, and any of which could harm our operating results, financial position and cash flow.\nOur business could be harmed if our clients are not satisfied with the professional services and technical support provided by us or our partners.\nOur business depends on our ability to satisfy our clients, not only with respect to our solution, but also with the professional services and technical support that are required for our clients to implement and use our solution to address their business needs. Professional services and technical support may be performed by our own staff or, in a select subset of cases, by third parties. Our professional services offerings typically have lower margins. Accordingly, any increase in sales of professional services could harm our gross margins and operating results. We will need to continue to expand and optimize our professional services and technical support in order to keep up with new client installations and ongoing service, which takes time and expense to implement. Identifying and recruiting qualified service personnel and training them in our solution is difficult and competitive and requires significant time, expense and attention. We may be unable to respond quickly enough to accommodate short-term increases in client demand for support services. We also may be unable to modify the format of our support services or change our pricing to compete with changes in support services provided by our competitors. Increased client demand for these services, without corresponding revenues, could increase our costs and harm our operating results. If a client is not satisfied with the deployment and ongoing services performed by us or a third party, we could lose clients, miss opportunities to expand our business with these clients, incur additional costs, or suffer reduced (including negative) margins on our service revenue, any of which could damage our ability to grow our business. In addition, negative publicity related to our professional services and technical support, regardless of its accuracy, may damage our business by affecting our ability to compete for new business with current and prospective clients.\nRisks Related to the Sale of our Solution\nFailure to adequately retain and expand our direct sales force will impede our growth.\nKey to our success is the continuity and growth of our direct sales force. We need to continue to retain key members of our direct sales force while expanding and optimizing our sales infrastructure and headcount in order to grow our client base and business. We plan to continue to expand our direct sales force, both domestically and internationally. Identifying and recruiting qualified personnel and training them in the use and sale of our solution requires significant time, expense and attention. It can take several months before our sales representatives are fully trained and productive. Our business may be harmed if we fail to retain key members of our direct sales force or if our efforts, and the expense incurred, to expand and train our direct sales force do not generate a corresponding increase in revenues. In particular, if we are unable to hire, develop and retain talented sales personnel or if new sales personnel, including those joining our company as a result of an acquisition, are unable to achieve desired productivity levels in a reasonable period of time, we may not be able to realize the expected benefits of this investment or increase our revenues.\nWe have established, and are continuing to increase, our network of master agents and resellers to sell our solution; our failure to effectively develop, manage, and maintain this network could materially harm our revenues.\nWe have established, and are continuing to increase, our network of master sales agents, which provide sales leads, and resellers, which sell our solution to new clients. This network has helped us attract additional clients. Our resellers have assisted us in expanding in both domestic and international markets. These master agents and resellers sell, or may in the future decide to sell, solutions for our competitors. Our competitors may be able to cause our current or potential master agents or resellers to favor their services over ours, either through financial incentives, technological innovation, solution features or performance, by offering a broader array of services to these service providers or otherwise, which could reduce the effectiveness of our use of these third parties. If we fail to maintain relationships with current master agents and resellers, fail to develop relationships with new master agents and resellers in new and existing markets, if we fail to manage, train, or provide appropriate incentives to our existing master agents and resellers, or if our master agents and resellers are not successful in their sales efforts, sales of our subscriptions may decrease or not grow at an appropriate rate and our operating results could be harmed. Additionally, in order to effectively utilize our resellers, we must enhance our systems, develop specialized marketing materials and invest in educating resellers regarding our systems, product offerings and services. Our failure to accomplish these objectives could limit our success in marketing and selling our products.\nIn addition, identifying new resellers, and negotiating and documenting relationships with them, requires significant time and resources. As the complexity of our solution and our reseller relationships increases, the\nmanagement of those relationships and the negotiation of contractual terms sufficient to protect our rights and limit our potential liabilities will become more complicated. Our inability to successfully manage these complex relationships or negotiate sufficient contractual terms could harm our business.\nWe sell our solution to larger organizations that require longer sales and implementation cycles and often demand more configuration and integration services or customized features and functions that we may not offer, any of which could delay or prevent these sales and harm our growth rates, business and operating results.\nAs we continue to target our sales efforts at larger organizations, we face greater costs, longer sales and implementation cycles and less predictability in closing sales. These larger organizations typically require more configuration and integration services, which increases our upfront investment in sales and deployment efforts, with no guarantee that these clients will subscribe to our solution or increase the scope of their subscription. Furthermore, with larger organizations, we must provide greater levels of education regarding the use and benefits of our solution to a broader group of people in order to generate a sale. As a result of these factors, we must devote a significant amount of sales support and professional services resources to individual clients and prospective clients, thereby increasing the cost and time required to complete sales. Our typical sales cycle for larger organizations is four to six months, but can be significantly longer, and we expect that our average sales cycle may increase as sales to larger organizations continue to grow as a percentage of our business. Longer sales cycles could cause our operating and financial results to be less predictable and to fluctuate from period to period. In addition, many of our clients that are larger organizations initially deploy our solution to support only a portion of their contact center agents. Our success depends on our ability to increase the number of agent seats and the number of applications utilized by these larger organizations over time and additional sales and marketing expenses we incur in these efforts. There is no guarantee that these clients will increase their subscriptions for our solution. If we do not expand our initial relationships with larger organizations, the return on our investments in sales and deployment efforts for these clients will decrease and our business may suffer.\nFurthermore, we may not be able to provide the configuration and integration services that larger organizations typically require. For example, our solution does not currently permit clients to modify our software code, but instead requires them to use our set of APIs. If prospective clients require customized features or functions that we do not offer, and that would be difficult for them to deploy themselves, they will need to use our services or third-party service providers or we may lose sales opportunities with larger organizations and our business could suffer.\nThe markets in which we participate involve numerous competitors and are highly competitive, and if we do not compete effectively, our operating results could be harmed.\nThe market for contact center solutions is highly competitive. Generally, we do not have long-term contracts with our clients and our clients can terminate our service and switch to competitors\u2019 offerings on short notice.\nWe currently compete with large legacy technology vendors that offer on-premise contact center systems, such as Avaya and Cisco. These legacy technology and software companies are increasingly supplementing their traditional on-premise contact center systems with competing cloud offerings, through a combination of acquisitions, partnerships and in-house development. Additionally, we compete with vendors that historically provided other contact center services and technologies and expanded to offer cloud contact center software such as NICE and Genesys. We also face competition from many smaller contact center service providers such as Talkdesk and Seranova, as well as vendors offering unified communications and contact center solutions. In addition, Amazon and Twilio have introduced solutions aimed at companies who wish to build their own contact centers with in-house developers. In addition, CRM vendors are increasingly offering features and functionality that were traditionally provided by contact center providers. CRM vendors also continue to partner with contact center service providers to provide integrated solutions and may, in the future, acquire competitive contact center service providers. These factors could cause CRM vendors to reduce or terminate their partnerships with us, and could result in increased competition. Because CRM integration and partnerships are critical to the success of our solution, these factors could harm our revenue and results of operations.\nSome of our competitors can devote significantly greater resources than we can to the development, promotion and sale of their products and services and many have the ability to initiate or withstand substantial price competition. Current or potential competitors may also be acquired by third parties with significantly greater resources. Many of our competitors have stronger name recognition, longer operating histories, larger marketing budgets, greater financial or technical resources, better established relationships with clients, more comprehensive\nproduct offerings, larger installed bases and major distribution agreements with consultants, system integrators and resellers. Our competitors may also establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties that may further enhance their product offerings or resources and ability to compete. With the introduction of new technologies and market entrants, we expect competition to continue to intensify in the future. Our recent, and any future, acquisitions will subject us to new competitors and cause us to face additional and different competition in the markets served by these businesses. If our competitors\u2019 products, services or technologies become more accepted than our solution, if they are successful in bringing their products or services to market earlier than ours, or if their products or services are less expensive or more technologically capable than ours, our revenues could be harmed. Pricing pressures and increased competition could result in reduced sales and revenues, reduced margins and loss of, or a failure to maintain or improve, our competitive market position, any of which could harm our business.\nIf we fail to grow our marketing capabilities and develop widespread brand awareness cost effectively, our business may suffer.\nOur ability to increase our client base and achieve broader market acceptance of our cloud contact center software solution will depend to a significant extent on our ability to expand our marketing operations. We plan to continue to dedicate significant resources to our marketing programs, including internet advertising, digital marketing campaigns, social media, trade shows, industry events, co-marketing with strategic partners, telemarketing and out of home campaigns. In addition, we have shifted certain events, such as our user group meetings, from in-person to virtual in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The effectiveness of our internet advertising has varied over time and may vary in the future due to competition for key search terms, changes in search engine use and changes in the search algorithms used by major search engines. All of these efforts will continue to require us to invest significant financial and other resources in our marketing efforts. Our business will be seriously harmed if our efforts and expenditures do not generate a proportionate increase in revenue.\nIn addition, we believe that developing and maintaining widespread awareness of our brand in a cost-effective manner, both in the United States and internationally, is critical to achieving widespread acceptance of our solution and attracting new clients. Brand promotion activities may not generate client awareness or increase revenues, and even if they do, any increase in revenues typically occurs after the expense has been incurred, and may not offset the costs and expenses of building our brand. If we fail to successfully promote, maintain and protect our brand, or incur substantial costs and expenses, we may fail to attract or retain clients necessary to realize a sufficient return on our brand-building efforts, or to achieve the widespread brand awareness that is critical to increasing client adoption of our solution.\nRisks Related to Our Solution\nIf we fail to manage our technical operations infrastructure, our existing clients may experience service outages, our new clients may delay or decide against deployment of our solution, existing clients may decide to move to another vendor, and we could be subject to, among other things, claims for credits or damage.\nOur success depends in large part upon the capacity, stability, security and performance of our technical operations infrastructure, which currently primarily relies upon external data centers and, increasingly, public cloud providers. From time-to-time, we have experienced interruptions in service, and may experience such interruptions in the future. These service interruptions may be caused by a variety of factors, including infrastructure changes, human or software errors, telecom network outages, viruses, security attacks, fraud, spikes in client usage and denial of service issues. In some instances, we may not be able to identify the cause or causes of these performance problems, and remediate them within an acceptable period of time. Our failure to achieve or maintain expected performance levels, stability and security, particularly as we increase the number of users of our service and the product applications that run on our system, could harm our relationships with our clients, result in claims for credits or damages, damage our reputation, significantly reduce client demand for our solution, cause us to incur significant expense and personnel time replacing and upgrading our infrastructure, cause customer attrition, and harm our business.\nWe have experienced significant growth in the number of agent seats and interactions that our infrastructure supports. As the number of agent seats within our client base grows and our clients\u2019 use of our service increases, we need to continue to make additional investments in our capacity to maintain adequate and reliable stability and performance, the availability of which may be limited or the cost of which may be prohibitive, and any failure may cause interruptions in service that may harm our business. In addition, we need to properly manage our operations infrastructure in order to support version control, changes in hardware and software parameters and the evolution of\nour solution. If we do not accurately predict our infrastructure requirements or efficiently improve our infrastructure, our business could be harmed.\nWe host our solution at geographically redundant data centers in the United States, the United Kingdom, Europe and Australia and from a public cloud location in Canada. Any failure or downtime in one of our data center facilities could affect a significant percentage of our clients. While we control and have access to our servers and all of the components of our network that are located in our external data centers, we do not control the operation of these facilities. The owners of our data center facilities have no obligation to renew their agreements with us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. If we are unable to renew these agreements on commercially reasonable terms, or if one of our data center operators is acquired, closes, suffers financial difficulty or is unable to meet our growing capacity needs, we may be required to transfer our servers and other infrastructure to new data center facilities, and we may incur significant costs and service interruptions in connection with doing so. While our data centers have redundant power, cooling and infrastructure, they are subject to various points of failure. Problems with cooling equipment, generators, uninterruptible power supply, routers, switches, or other equipment, whether or not within our control, could result in service interruptions for our clients as well as equipment damage. Our data centers are subject to disasters such as earthquakes, floods, fires, hurricanes, acts of terrorism, sabotage, break-ins, acts of vandalism and other events, which could cause service interruptions or the operators of these data centers to close their facilities for an extended period of time or permanently. The destruction or impairment of any of our data center facilities could result in significant downtime for our solution and the loss of client data. Because our ability to attract and retain clients depends on our providing clients with highly reliable service, even minor interruptions in our service could harm our business, revenues and reputation. Additionally, in connection with the continuing expansion of our existing data center facilities, there is a risk that service interruptions may occur as a result of server addition, relocation or other issues.\nWe also host some of our voice services on the public cloud in Europe, Asia, South America and Australia. We are also in the process of establishing new public cloud deployments of our platform in certain additional international markets. We have partnered with a third-party to develop, test and deploy our technology to offer a full stack of services on the public cloud in certain international markets. If we are successful in deployment of our technology to the public cloud, we will likely introduce our public cloud deployments in the U.S. and in additional international markets. Our public cloud-based platform offering is critical to developing and providing our solution to our clients, scaling our business for future growth, accurately maintaining data and otherwise operating our business. Even once we implement public cloud-based data centers, we may discover deficiencies in the design, implementation or maintenance of the system that could materially harm our business. We have little or no control over public cloud providers. Any disruption of the public cloud, migration from one public cloud provider to another, or any failure of the public cloud providers to effectively design and implement sufficient security systems or plan for increases in capacity could, in turn, cause delays or disruptions in our services. In addition, using the public cloud presents a variety of additional risks, including risks related to sharing the same computing resources with others, reliance on public cloud providers\u2019 authentication, security, authorization and access control mechanisms, a lack of control over the public cloud\u2019s redundancy and security systems and fault tolerances, and a reduced ability to control data security and privacy.\nDevelopment of our AI solutions to make agents more efficient and improve customer experience may not be successful and may result in reputational harm and our future operating results could be materially harmed.\nWe plan to continue to increase and provide our customers with AI-powered applications, including conversational virtual agents, agent assistance and business insights. In the fourth quarter of 2020, we enhanced our AI-powered applications with the acquisition of Inference, and now offer an integrated IVA platform with AI-enabled omni-channel service solutions. While we aim for our AI-powered applications to make agents more efficient and improve customer experience, our AI models may not achieve sufficient levels of accuracy. In addition, we may not be able to acquire sufficient training data or our training data may contain biased or otherwise inaccurate information. Furthermore, the costs of AI technologies, such as speech recognition and natural language processing, may currently be too high for broad market adoption. Our competitors or other organizations may incorporate AI features into their products more quickly or more successfully and their AI features may achieve higher market acceptance than ours, which may result in us failing to recoup our investments in developing AI-powered applications. Should any of these items or others occur, our ability to compete, our reputation and operating results may be materially and adversely affected.\nIf our solution fails, or is perceived to fail, to perform properly or if it contains technical defects, our reputation could be harmed, our market share may decline and we could be subject to product liability claims.\nOur solution may contain undetected errors or defects that may result in failures or otherwise cause our solution to fail to perform in accordance with client expectations and contractual obligations. Moreover, our clients could incorrectly implement or inadvertently misuse our products, which could result in client dissatisfaction and harm the perceived utility of our products and our brand. Because our clients use our solution for mission-critical aspects of their business, any real or perceived errors or defects in, or other performance problems with, our solution may damage our clients\u2019 businesses and could significantly harm our reputation. If that occurs, we could lose future sales, or our existing clients could cancel our solution, seek payment credits, seek damages against us, or delay or withhold payment to us, which could result in reduced revenues, an increase in our provision for uncollectible accounts and service credits, an increase in collection cycles for accounts receivable, and harm our financial results. In addition, since telecommunications billing and associated telecom taxes and the related calculations and billing of telecom taxes are inherently complex and require highly sophisticated information systems to administer, our billing system may experience errors or we may improperly operate the system, which could result in the system incorrectly calculating the fees owed by our clients or related taxes and administrative fees. Clients also may make indemnification or warranty claims against us, which could result in significant expense and risk of litigation. Product performance problems could result in loss of market share, reputational harm, failure to achieve market acceptance and the diversion of development resources.\nAny product liability, intellectual property, warranty or other claims against us could damage our reputation and relationships with our clients, and could require us to spend significant time and money in litigation or pay significant settlements or damages. Although we maintain general liability insurance, including coverage for errors and omissions, this coverage may not be sufficient to cover liabilities resulting from such claims. Also, our insurers may disclaim coverage. Our liability insurance also may not continue to be available to us on reasonable terms, in sufficient amounts, or at all. Any contract or product liability claims successfully brought against us would harm our business.\nThe contact center software solutions market is subject to rapid technological change, and we must develop and sell incremental and new features and products in order to maintain and grow our business.\nThe contact center software solutions market is characterized by rapid changes in client requirements, frequent introductions of new and enhanced products and features and continuing and rapid technological advancement. To compete successfully, we must continue to devote significant resources to design, develop, deploy and sell new and enhanced contact center products, applications and features that provide increasingly higher capabilities, performance and stability at lower cost. If we are unable to develop or acquire new features for our existing solution or new applications that achieve market acceptance or that keep pace with technological developments, our business would be harmed. For example, we are focused on enhancing the reliability, features and functionality of our contact center solution to enhance its utility to our clients, particularly larger clients, with complex, dynamic and global operations. The success of these enhancements depends on many factors, including timely development, introduction and market acceptance, as well as our ability to transition our existing clients to these new products, applications and features. To the extent that these enhancements are made as a result of acquisitions, our success also depends on our ability to integrate the acquired technology with our existing solution. Any failure may significantly impair our revenue growth. In addition, because our solution is designed to operate on a variety of systems, we need to continuously modify and enhance our solution to keep pace with changes in hardware, operating systems, the increasing trend toward multi-channel communications and other changes to software technologies. We may not be successful in developing or acquiring these modifications and enhancements or bringing them to market in a timely fashion. Furthermore, uncertainties about the timing and nature of new network platforms or technologies, or modifications to existing platforms or technologies, could delay introduction of changes and updates to our solution and increase our research and development expenses. Any failure of our solution to operate effectively, including with future network platforms and technologies, could reduce the demand for our solution, result in client dissatisfaction and harm our business.\nOur ability to continue to enhance our solution is dependent on adequate research and development resources. If we are not able to adequately fund our research and development efforts, we may not be able to compete effectively and our business and operating results may be harmed.\nIn order to remain competitive, we must devote significant and increasing resources to develop new solution offerings, features and enhancements to our existing cloud contact center software, which will increase our research\nand development and operating expenses. Our research and development expenses totaled $68.7 million, $45.2 million and $34.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Maintaining adequate research and development personnel and resources to meet the demands of the market is essential. If we are unable to develop products, applications or features internally due to constraints, such as high employee turnover, insufficient cash, inability to hire sufficient research and development personnel or a lack of other research and development resources, we may miss market opportunities. Furthermore, many of our competitors have greater financial resources and expend considerably greater amounts on their research and development programs than we do, and those that do not may be acquired by larger companies that would allocate greater resources to our competitors\u2019 research and development programs. Our failure to devote adequate research and development resources or compete effectively with the research and development programs of our competitors could harm our business.\nIf we are unable to maintain the compatibility of our software with other products and technologies, our business would be harmed.\nOur clients often integrate our solution with their business applications, particularly third-party CRM solutions. These third-party providers or their partners could alter their products so that our solution no longer integrate well with them, or they could delay or deny our access to technology releases that allow us to adapt our solution to integrate with their products in a timely fashion. Such third-party providers could also favor integration of our competitors\u2019 products over our solution, making our solution less attractive to our clients. If we cannot adapt our solution to changes in complementary technology deployed by our clients, it may significantly impair our ability to compete effectively.\nWe are subject to many hazards and operational risks that can disrupt our business, some of which may not be insured or fully covered by insurance.\nOur operations are subject to many hazards inherent in the cloud contact center software business, including:\n\u2022damage to third-party and our infrastructure and data centers, related equipment and surrounding properties caused by earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, fires and other natural disasters, explosions and acts of terrorism;\n\u2022security breaches resulting in loss or disclosure of confidential client and customer data and potential liability to clients and non-client third parties for such losses on disclosures; and\n\u2022other hazards that could also result in suspension of operations, personal injury and even loss of life.\nThese risks could result in substantial losses and the curtailment or suspension of our operations. For example, in the event of a major earthquake along the West Coast of the United States (where our corporate headquarters and one of our data centers are located), hurricane, tropical storm, flooding or severe weather in the southeastern United States (where our other U.S. data center is located) or catastrophic events such as fire, power loss, telecommunications failure, cyber-attack, global pandemic, war or terrorist attack, we may be unable to continue our operations and may endure system and service interruptions, reputational harm, delays in product development, breaches of data security and loss of critical data, any of which could harm our business and operating results.\nWe are not insured against all claims, events or accidents that might occur. If a significant accident or event occurs that is not fully insured, if we fail to recover all anticipated insurance proceeds for significant accidents or events for which we are insured, or if we or our data center providers fail to reopen facilities damaged by such accidents or events, our operations and financial condition could be harmed. In addition to being denied coverage under existing insurance policies, we may not be able to maintain or obtain insurance of the type and amount we desire at reasonable rates.\nRisks Related to Third-Party Technology Providers\nWe rely on third-party telecommunications and internet service providers to provide our clients and their customers with telecommunication services and connectivity to our cloud contact center software and any failure by these service providers to provide reliable services could cause us to lose clients and subject us to claims for credits or damages, among other things.\nWe rely on third-party telecommunication service providers to provide our clients and their customers with telecommunication services. These telephony services include the public switched telephone network, or PSTN,\ntelephone numbers, call termination and origination services, and local number portability for our clients. In addition, we depend on our internet bandwidth suppliers to provide uninterrupted and error-free service through their telecommunications networks. We exercise little control over these third-party providers, which increases our vulnerability to problems with the services they provide.\nWhen problems occur, it may be difficult to identify the source of the problem. Service disruption or outages, whether caused by our service, the products or services of our third party service providers, or our clients\u2019 or their customers\u2019 equipment and systems, may result in loss of market acceptance of our solution and any necessary repairs or other remedial actions may force us to incur significant costs and expenses.\nIf any of these service providers fail to provide reliable services, suffer outages, degrade, disrupt, increase the cost of or terminate the services that we and our clients depend on, we may be required to switch to another service provider. Delays caused by switching our technology to another service provider, if available, and qualifying this new service provider could materially harm our client relationships, business, financial condition and operating results. Further, any failure on the part of third party service providers to achieve or maintain expected performance levels, stability and security could harm our relationships with our clients, cause us to lose clients, result in claims for credits or damages, increase our costs or the costs incurred by our customers, damage our reputation, significantly reduce client demand for our solution and seriously harm our financial condition and operating results.\nOur clients and their customers rely on internet service providers to provide them with access and connectivity to our cloud contact center software and changes in how internet service providers handle and charge for access to the internet could materially harm our client relationships, business, financial condition and operations results.\nIn 2015, the FCC released an order, commonly referred to as network neutrality, that, among other things, prohibited (i) the impairment or degradation of lawful internet traffic on the basis of content, application or service and (ii) the practice of favoring some internet traffic over other internet traffic based on the payment of higher fees. In June 2018, the FCC repealed the network neutrality regulations imposed by the 2015 order. Internet service providers in the U.S. may now be able to impair or degrade the use of, or increase the cost of using, our solution. The FCC\u2019s 2018 repeal was largely upheld by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals in a decision issued in October 2019. That same court rejected the FCC\u2019s attempt to preempt states from adopting their own network neutrality requirements. As a result, network neutrality regulations vary widely among both the domestic and international jurisdictions in which we operate. While certain jurisdictions have strong protections for services such as ours, others either lack a network neutrality framework or otherwise do not enforce network neutrality regulations. The impairment, degradation or prioritization of lawful internet traffic by internet service providers could materially harm the performance of our solution, our client relationships, business, financial condition and operating results.\nRisks Related to Our International Operations\nWe continue to expand our international operations, which exposes us to significant risks.\nTo date, we have not generated significant revenues outside of the U.S., Canada, the U.K. and Latin America. However, we already have significant operations outside these countries and regions, and we expect to grow our international presence in the future. Our international employees are primarily located in the Philippines, where technical support, training and other professional services are performed, Russia, where portions of engineering and operations are performed, and Australia, after our acquisition of Inference, where portions of engineering and operations are now performed. The future success of our business will depend, in part, on our ability to expand our operations and customer base to other countries. Operating in international markets requires significant resources and management attention and will subject us to regulatory, economic, and political risks that are different from those in the U.S. In addition, in order to effectively market and sell our solution in international markets, we will be required to localize our solution, including the language in which our solution is offered, which will increase our costs, could result in delays in offering our solution in these markets and may decrease the effectiveness of our sales efforts. Due to our limited experience with international operations and developing and managing sales and distribution channels in international markets, our international expansion efforts may not be successful.\nIn addition, if the relationship between Russia and the United States significantly worsens, or if either Russia or the United States imposes or implements new or augmented economic sanctions, supply chain restrictions, or other restrictions on doing business, and we are restricted or precluded from continuing our software development operations in Russia, our costs could increase, and our product development efforts, business and results of operations could be significantly harmed.\nIn addition, compliance with laws and regulations applicable to our international operations increases our cost of doing business outside the United States. We may be unaware or unable to keep current with changes in foreign government requirements and laws as they change from time to time, which often occurs with minimal or no advance notice. Failure to comply with these regulations could harm our business. In many countries outside the United States, it is common for others to engage in business practices that are prohibited by our internal policies and procedures or United States or international regulations applicable to us. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and policies, there can be no assurance that all of our employees, contractors, strategic partners and agents will comply with these laws and policies. Violations of laws or key control policies by our employees, contractors, strategic partners or agents could result in delays in revenue recognition, financial reporting misstatements, fines, delays in filing financial reports required as a public company, penalties, or prohibitions on selling our solution, any of which could harm our business.\nSales to clients outside the United States or with international operations and our international sales efforts and operations support expose us to risks inherent in international sales and operations.\nA key element of our growth strategy is to expand our international sales efforts and develop a worldwide client base. Because of our limited experience with international sales, our international expansion may not be successful and may not produce the return on investment we expect. To date, we have realized only a small portion of our revenues from clients outside the United States, with approximately 92% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 derived from clients with billing addresses in the United States.\nWe have increased and are continuing to increase our sales, marketing and support personnel in both the U.K. and the European Union. We have enlarged our data centers in the U.K. and Amsterdam and are increasing our use of public cloud solutions in the European Union as well. Operating in international markets requires significant resources and management attention and subjects us to intellectual property, regulatory, economic and political risks that are different from those in the United States. As we increase our international sales efforts and continue our other international operations, we will face risks in doing business internationally that could harm our business, including:\n\u2022the need to establish and protect our brand in international markets;\n\u2022the need to localize and adapt our solution for specific countries, including translation into foreign languages and associated costs and expenses;\n\u2022difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations, particularly hiring and training qualified sales and service personnel;\n\u2022the need to implement and offer customer care, in various languages;\n\u2022different pricing environments, longer sales and accounts receivable payment cycles and collections issues;\n\u2022weaker protection for intellectual property and other legal rights than in the U.S. and practical difficulties in enforcing intellectual property and other rights outside of the U.S.;\n\u2022privacy and data protection laws and regulations that are complex, expensive to comply with and may require that client data be stored and processed in a designated territory;\n\u2022increased risk of piracy, counterfeiting and other misappropriation of our intellectual property in our locations outside the U.S.;\n\u2022new and different sources of competition;\n\u2022general economic conditions in international markets;\n\u2022fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies, which may make our solution more expensive in other countries or may increase our costs, impacting our operating results when translated into U.S. dollars;\n\u2022compliance challenges related to the complexity of multiple, conflicting and changing governmental laws and regulations, including employment, tax, telecommunications and telemarketing laws and regulations;\n\u2022increased risk of international telecom fraud;\n\u2022laws and business practices favoring local competitors;\n\u2022compliance with laws and regulations applicable to foreign operations and cross border transactions, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and other anti-corruption laws, supply chain restrictions, import and export control laws, tariffs, trade barriers, economic sanctions and other\nregulatory or contractual limitations on our ability to sell our solution in certain foreign markets, and the risks and costs of non-compliance;\n\u2022increased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities;\n\u2022restrictions or taxes on the transfer of funds;\n\u2022adverse tax consequences; and\n\u2022unstable economic and political conditions and potential accompanying shifts in laws and regulations.\nThese risks could harm our international operations, increase our operating costs and hinder our ability to grow our international business and, consequently, our overall business and results of operations.\nThe results of the U.K.\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union may have a negative effect on global economic conditions, financial markets and our business.\nIn June 2016, a majority of voters in the U.K. elected to withdraw from the European Union in a national referendum, referred to as Brexit. The U.K. withdrew from the European Union on January 31, 2020. Brexit has created significant uncertainty about the future relationship between the U.K. and the European Union, including with respect to the laws and regulations that will apply or continue to apply in the U.K. following Brexit as the U.K. and the European Union determine which European Union laws and regulations to replace, replicate, or amend after the effectiveness of Brexit.\nBrexit has harmed and may continue to harm global economic conditions, as well as the stability of global financial markets. For example, Brexit introduced significant volatility in global stock markets and currency exchange rate fluctuations that resulted in the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies in which we conduct business. As part of Brexit, the U.K. and the European Union entered into a withdrawal agreement that includes, among other things, an implementation and transition period lasting from January 31, 2020 until December 31, 2020, which is referred to herein as the Transition Period. During the Transition Period, the U.K. and the European Union negotiated post-withdrawal terms, including trading agreements and security cooperation, and an agreement was reached on December 24, 2020, which is referred to herein as the U.K.-E.U. Trade Agreement, and has since been ratified by the British Parliament and European Union governments. The U.K.-E.U. Trade Agreement provisionally came into effect on January 1, 2021 pending ratification by certain organs of the European Union. Brexit continues to create significant political, social and macroeconomic uncertainty. We continue to evaluate the risks associated with Brexit.\nEven though the U.K.-E.U. Trade Agreement has provisionally come into effect, there may be increased costs on regulatory compliance between the U.K. and other countries, including those in the European Union, as the U.K.-E.U. Trade Agreement only provides for limited market access with respect to services. The lack of a comprehensive trade deal that governs services, along with future unanticipated trade disputes between the U.K. and the European Union, including the equivalency of regulations and standards, may also disrupt the provision of services between the U.K. and member states of the European Union. In addition, the U.K. will also need to negotiate new trade and tax treaties with other countries, and such negotiations may not begin or complete for a number of years.\nIn addition, the potential strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies (including the British pound) would make our solution more expensive to international clients and may harm our international sales. Brexit could also cause disruptions to, and create uncertainty surrounding, the global economy, which could harm our ability to sell our solution and may harm our results of operation, financial condition and cash flows. Brexit could also affect our relationships with our existing and future clients, owners of our data center facilities in the U.K. and the Netherlands and our data center partners\u2019 ability to retain and hire qualified employees, which could harm our business, business opportunities, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOther Operational Risks\nAdverse economic conditions may harm our business.\nOur business depends on the overall demand for cloud contact center software solutions and on the economic health of our current and prospective clients. In addition to the United States, Canada, Europe and Latin America, we plan to market and sell our solution in Asia and other international markets. If economic conditions, including currency exchange rates, in these areas and other key potential markets for our solution remain uncertain or deteriorate, including as a result of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, clients may delay or reduce their contact center and overall information technology spending. If our clients or potential clients experience economic hardship, this could reduce the demand for our solution, delay and lengthen sales cycles, lower prices for our solution, and lead to slower growth or even a decline in our revenues, operating results and cash flows.\nSecurity breaches and improper access to or disclosure of our data or our clients\u2019 data, or other cyber attacks on our systems, could result in litigation and regulatory risk, harm our reputation and our business.\nOur solution involves the storage and transmission of our clients\u2019 information, including information about our clients\u2019 customers or other information treated by our clients as confidential. Unauthorized access, unauthorized use of our systems, security breaches or other cyber attacks could result in the loss of confidentiality, integrity and availability of such information, leading to litigation, governmental investigations and enforcements actions, indemnity obligations, increased expense, and other liability. Such incidents could also cause interruptions to the solutions we provide, degrade the user experience, or cause clients to lose confidence in our solution.\nWhile we have security measures in place to protect client information and minimize the probability of security breaches and other cyber attacks, if these measures fail as a result of a cyber-attack, other third-party action, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise, and someone obtains unauthorized access to our clients\u2019 information, our reputation could be damaged, our business may suffer and we could incur significant liability. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not identified until they are launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. In addition, third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or users to disclose information in order to gain access to our data or our users\u2019 data. Moreover, any failure on the part of third parties, including our clients, to maintain appropriate security measures for their own systems could harm our relationships with our clients, result in claims against us for credits or damages, damage our reputation and significantly reduce client demand for our solution. Any or all of these issues could harm our ability to attract new clients, cause existing clients to cancel, reduce or not renew their subscriptions, result in reputational damage or subject us to third-party lawsuits, governmental investigations and enforcement actions, regulatory fines or other action or liability, including orders or consent decrees forcing us to modify our business practices, all of which could materially harm our business, reputation or financial results.\nWe depend on our senior management team, and the loss of one or more key employees or an inability to attract and retain highly skilled executives and other employees could harm our business and results of operations.\nOur success depends, in part, upon the performance and continued services of our executive officers and senior management team. If our executive leadership team fails to perform effectively or if we fail to attract or retain our key executives or senior management, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be harmed. We also rely on our leadership team in the areas of research and development, marketing, sales, services and general and administrative functions, and on mission-critical individual contributors. The loss of one or more of our executive officers or key employees could seriously harm our business. We currently do not maintain key person life insurance policies on any of our employees.\nTo execute our growth plan, we must attract and retain highly qualified personnel and we may incur significant costs (including stock-based compensation expense) to do so. Competition for these personnel is intense, especially for senior executives, engineers highly experienced in designing and developing cloud software and for senior sales personnel. We have, from time to time, experienced, and we expect to continue to experience, difficulty in hiring and retaining employees with appropriate qualifications. We invest significant time and expense in training our employees, which increases their value to competitors who may seek to recruit them and increases our costs. We believe that our corporate culture is a critical component to our ability to attract and retain employees. As we grow, we will need to continually enhance our efforts to maintain our corporate culture, which is more difficult due to our work from home policies during the COVID-19 pandemic. If we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and\nmotivate our current personnel, particularly our executive officers and senior management team, our business and future growth prospects would be harmed. Many of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater resources than we have. If we hire employees from competitors or other companies, their former employers may attempt to assert that these employees or we have breached legal obligations, resulting in a diversion of our time and resources and, potentially, damages.\nVolatility or lack of performance in the trading price of our common stock may also affect our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel because job candidates and existing employees often emphasize the value of stock awards when considering whether to accept or continue employment. If the perceived value of our stock awards is low or declines, it may harm our ability to recruit and retain highly skilled employees.\nWe may acquire other companies, or technologies or be the target of strategic transactions, or be impacted by transactions by other companies, which could divert our management\u2019s attention, result in additional dilution to our stockholders and otherwise disrupt our operations and harm our operating results.\nWe may acquire or invest in businesses, applications or technologies that we believe could complement or expand our solution, enhance our technical capabilities or otherwise offer growth opportunities. For instance, in 2019, we acquired substantially all of the assets of Whendu LLC, or Whendu, including its iPaaS platform, and in 2020, we acquired both Virtual Observer and Inference. The pursuit of potential acquisitions may divert the attention of management, and cause us to incur various costs and expenses in identifying, investigating and pursuing acquisitions, whether or not they are consummated. We may not be able to identify desirable acquisition targets or be successful in entering into an agreement with any particular target. In addition, there has been a number of recent transactions in our industry and adjacent industries, which could have a negative impact on us.\nTo date, the growth in our business has been primarily organic, and we have limited experience in acquiring other businesses. With respect to our recent acquisitions and any future acquisitions, we may not be able to successfully integrate acquired personnel, operations, product features and technologies, or effectively manage the combined business following the acquisition. We also may not achieve the anticipated benefits from these or any future acquisitions due to a number of factors, including:\n\u2022inability to integrate or benefit from acquisitions in a profitable manner;\n\u2022unanticipated costs or liabilities associated with the acquisition, including legal claims arising from the activities of the companies or businesses we acquire;\n\u2022acquisition-related costs;\n\u2022difficulty converting the clients of the acquired business to our solution and contract terms, including due to disparities in the revenue, licensing, support or professional services model of the acquired company;\n\u2022difficulty integrating the accounting systems, operations and personnel of the acquired business;\n\u2022difficulties and additional costs and expenses associated with supporting legacy products and the hosting infrastructure of the acquired business;\n\u2022diversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns;\n\u2022harm to our existing relationships with our partners and clients as a result of the acquisition;\n\u2022the loss of our or the acquired business\u2019s key employees;\n\u2022diversion of resources that could have been more effectively deployed in other parts of our business; and\n\u2022use of substantial portions of our available cash to consummate the acquisition.\nIn addition, a significant portion of the purchase price of companies and businesses we acquire may be allocated to acquired goodwill and other intangible assets, which must be assessed for impairment at least annually. If our acquisitions do not yield expected returns, we may be required to take charges to our operating results based on this impairment assessment process, which could harm our results of operations.\nAcquisitions could also result in dilutive issuances of equity securities, the use of our available cash, or the incurrence of additional debt to fund such acquisitions, which could harm our operating results. If an acquired business fails to meet our expectations, our operating results, business and financial condition could suffer.\nIn addition, third parties may be interested in acquiring us. We will continue to consider, evaluate and negotiate any such transactions as we deem appropriate. Such potential transactions may divert the attention of management, and cause us to incur various costs and expenses in investigating, evaluating and negotiating such transactions, whether or not they are consummated.\nWe may not be able to secure additional financing on favorable terms, or at all, to meet our future capital needs.\nTo date, we have financed our operations, primarily through sales of our solution, lease facilities and the net proceeds from our equity and debt financings, including the sale of our convertible senior notes. We do not know when or if our operations will generate sufficient cash to fund our ongoing operations. We may require additional capital to respond to business opportunities, challenges, acquisitions, a decline in sales, increased regulatory obligations or unforeseen circumstances and may engage in equity or debt financings or enter into credit facilities.\nWe have a substantial amount of debt. As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately $806.4 million in principal amount outstanding under our convertible senior notes issued in May 2018 and in May and June 2020. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements.\nAny debt financing obtained by us in the future would cause us to incur additional debt service expenses and could include restrictive covenants relating to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and pursue business opportunities and could be secured by all of our assets. If we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution in their percentage ownership of our company, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when we require it, our ability to continue to grow and support our business and to respond to business challenges could be significantly limited.\nIf we are unable to maintain and further develop effective internal control over financial reporting, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the market price of our common stock may decrease.\nAs a public company, we are required to maintain internal control over financial reporting and to report any material weaknesses in such internal controls. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or Section 404, requires that we evaluate and determine the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and provide a management report and attestation from our independent registered public accountant on our internal control over financial reporting. This attestation has and will continue to increase our independent public accountant costs and expenses.\nIf we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we will be unable to assert that our internal controls are effective, which could cause our stock price to decline. A \u201cmaterial weakness\u201d is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nIf we have material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we may not detect errors on a timely basis and our financial statements may be materially misstated. If we identify material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, if we are unable to comply with the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner, if we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to attest that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the market price of our common stock could decrease. We could also become subject to stockholder or other third-party litigation as well as investigations by the stock exchange on which our securities are listed, the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which could require additional financial and management resources and could result in fines, penalties, trading suspensions or other remedies.\nChanges in financial accounting standards or practices may cause adverse, unexpected financial reporting fluctuations and affect our reported operating results.\nU.S. GAAP is subject to interpretation by the FASB, the SEC and various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles. A change in accounting standards or practices can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even affect our financial statements issued before the change is effective. New accounting pronouncements and varying interpretations of accounting pronouncements have occurred and will occur in the future. Changes to existing rules or the questioning of current practices may harm our reported financial results or the way we account for or conduct our business.\nFor example, in May 2014, the FASB issued new revenue recognition rules under Accounting Standard Codification 606 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers (\u201cASC 606\u201d), which included a single set of rules and criteria for revenue recognition to be used across all industries. We adopted this new standard in January 2018 using a modified retrospective method. With the adoption of this standard, the timing of our commission expense recognition changed, which caused fluctuations in our operating results.\nFurther, in February 2016, the FASB issued new rules for leases under the Accounting Standard Codification 842 - Leases (\u201cASC 842\u201d), which requires a lessee to recognize assets and liabilities for both finance, previously known as capital, and operating leases with lease terms of more than 12 months. We adopted this new standard in January 2019 using a modified retrospective method. With the adoption of this standard, we recognized right-of-use, or ROU, assets and lease liabilities for operating leases. See Note 1 and 13 to consolidated financial statements for more information.\nThe application of any new accounting guidance is, and will be, based on all information available to us as of the date of adoption and up through subsequent interim reporting, including transition guidance published by the standard setters. However, the interpretation of these new standards may continue to evolve as other public companies adopt the new guidance and the standard setters issue new interpretative guidance related to these rules. As a result, changes in the interpretation of these rules could result in material adjustments to our application of the new guidance, which could have a material effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, any difficulties in implementing these pronouncements could cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations, which could result in regulatory discipline, cessation or disruption of trading in our common stock and harm investors\u2019 confidence in us.\nIn addition, certain factors have in the past and may in the future cause us to defer recognition of revenues. For example, the inclusion in our client contracts of non-standard terms, such as acceptance criteria, could require the deferral of revenue. To the extent that such contracts become more prevalent in the future our revenue may be harmed.\nBecause of these factors and other specific requirements under U.S. GAAP for revenue recognition, we must have precise terms and conditions in our arrangements in order to recognize revenue when we deliver our solution or perform our professional services. Negotiation of mutually acceptable terms and conditions can extend our sales cycle, and we may accept terms and conditions that do not permit revenue recognition at the time of delivery.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nAny failure to protect our intellectual property rights could impair our ability to protect our proprietary technology and our brand.\nOur success and ability to compete depend in part upon our intellectual property. As of December 31, 2020, our intellectual property portfolio included three registered U.S. trademarks, 11 issued U.S. patents, four pending U.S. patent applications, and one registered U.S. copyright. As of December 31, 2020, we also had five issued patents and nine trademark registrations outside the U.S. The expiration dates of our issued patents range from 2030 to 2038. We primarily rely on copyright, trade secret and trademark laws, trade secret protection and confidentiality or license agreements with our employees, clients, partners and others to protect our intellectual property rights. However, the steps we take to secure, protect and enforce our intellectual property rights may be inadequate. We may not be able to obtain any further patents or trademarks, our current patents could be invalidated or our competitors could design their products around our patented technology, and our pending applications may not result in the issuance of patents or trademarks. We have pending patent applications and trademark registrations outside the U.S., and we may have to expend significant additional resources to obtain additional protection and maintain current registrations as we expand our international operations. Furthermore, legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights in other countries, including Russia, where we have significant research and development operations, and the Philippines, where we have significant technical support, training and other professional services operations, are uncertain and may afford little or no effective protection of our proprietary technology, and the risk of intellectual property misappropriation may be higher in these countries. Consequently, we may be unable to prevent our proprietary technology from being infringed or exploited abroad, which could affect our ability to expand into international markets or require costly efforts to protect our technology.\nIn order to protect our intellectual property rights, we may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect these rights. Litigation brought to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights could be\ncostly, time consuming and distracting to our management and could result in the impairment or loss of our intellectual property. Furthermore, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights may be met with defenses, counterclaims and countersuits attacking the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights. Accordingly, we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property. Our failure to secure, protect and enforce our intellectual property rights could substantially harm the value of our technology, solutions, brand and business.\nWe will likely continue to be subject to third-party intellectual property infringement claims.\nThere is considerable patent and other intellectual property development activity and litigation in our industry. Our success depends upon our not infringing upon the intellectual property rights of others. Our competitors, as well as a number of other entities and individuals, may own or claim to own intellectual property relating to our industry. From time to time, third parties have claimed that we are infringing upon their intellectual property rights.\nCertain technology necessary for us to provide our solution may be patented, copyrighted or otherwise protected by other parties either now or in the future. In such case, we would have to negotiate a license for the use of that technology. We may not be able to negotiate such a license at a price that is acceptable, or at all. The existence of such a patent, copyright or other protections, or our inability to negotiate a license for any such technology on acceptable terms, could force us to cease using such technology and offering solutions incorporating such technology.\nOthers have claimed, or in the future may claim, that our solution and underlying technology infringe or violate their intellectual property rights. However, we may be unaware of the intellectual property rights that others may claim cover some or all of our technology or solution. Any claims or litigation could cause us to incur significant costs and expenses and, if successfully asserted against us, could require that we pay substantial damages or ongoing royalty payments, require that we refrain from using, manufacturing or selling certain offerings or features or using certain processes, prevent us from offering our solution or certain features thereof, or require that we comply with other unfavorable terms, any of which could harm our business and operating results. We may also be obligated to indemnify our clients or business partners and pay substantial settlement costs, including royalty payments, in connection with any such claim or litigation and to obtain licenses, which could be costly. Even if we were to prevail in any such dispute, any litigation regarding our intellectual property could be costly and time consuming and divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations.\nIndemnity provisions in various agreements potentially expose us to substantial liability for intellectual property infringement and other losses.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we enter into agreements of varying scope and terms pursuant to which we agree to indemnify clients, vendors, lessors, business partners and other parties for third party claims with respect to certain matters, including, but not limited to, losses arising out of breach of such agreements, certain claims related to third-party privacy or cyber security breaches or from intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties. In addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with our directors, officers and certain employees that will require us, among other things, to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors, officers or employees. Large indemnity payments or damage claims from contractual breach could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. Although we typically contractually limit our liability with respect to such obligations, we may still incur substantial liability related to them. Any dispute with a client with respect to such obligations could be expensive, even if we ultimately prevail, and could harm on our relationship with that client and other current and prospective clients, reduce demand for our solution and harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe employ third-party licensed software for use in or with our solution, and the inability to maintain these licenses or errors in the software we license could result in increased costs, or reduced service levels, which could harm our business.\nOur solution incorporates certain third-party software obtained under licenses from other companies. We anticipate that we will continue to rely on such software from third parties in the future. Although we believe that there are commercially reasonable alternatives to the third-party software we currently license, this may not be the case, or it may be difficult or costly to transition to other providers. In addition, integration of the software used in our solution with new third-party software may require significant work and require substantial investment of our time and resources. To the extent that our solution depends upon the successful operation of third-party software in\nconjunction with our software, any undetected errors or defects in this third-party software could prevent the deployment or impair the functionality of our solution, delay new product or solution introductions, result in increased costs, or a failure of our solution and injure our reputation. Our use of additional or alternative third-party software would require us to enter into license agreements with third parties and to integrate such software to our solution.\nThere can be no assurance that the technology licensed by us will continue to provide competitive features and functionality or that licenses for technology currently utilized by us or other technology that we may seek to license in the future, including to replace current third-party software, will be available to us at a reasonable cost or on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Third-party licensors may also be acquired or go out of business, which could preclude us from continuing to use such technology. The loss of, or inability to maintain, existing licenses could result in lost product features and litigation. The loss of existing licenses could also result in implementation delays or reductions until equivalent technology or suitable alternative solutions could be developed, identified, licensed and integrated, and could increase our costs and harm our business.\nOur solution utilizes open source software, and any failure to comply with the terms of one or more of these open source licenses could negatively affect our business.\nOur solution includes software covered by open source licenses, which may include, for example, free general public use licenses, open source front-end libraries and open source applications. The terms of various open source licenses have not been interpreted by United States courts, and there is a risk that such licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to market our solution. By the terms of certain open source licenses, we could be required to release the source code of our proprietary software, and to make our proprietary software available under open source licenses, if we combine our proprietary software with open source software in a certain manner. In the event that portions of our proprietary software are determined to be subject to an open source license, we could be required to publicly release the affected portions of our source code, re-engineer all or a portion of our technologies, or otherwise be limited in the licensing of our technologies, each of which could reduce or eliminate the value of our technologies and solutions. In addition to risks related to license requirements, usage of open source software can lead to greater risks than use of third-party commercial software, as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on the origin of the software. Given the nature of open source software, there is also a risk that third parties may assert copyright and other intellectual property infringement claims against us based on our use of certain open source software programs. Many of the risks associated with the usage of open source software cannot be eliminated, and could harm our business.\nRisks Related to Regulatory and Tax Matters\nFailure to comply with laws and regulations could harm our business and our reputation.\nOur business is subject to regulation by various federal, state, local and foreign governmental agencies, including agencies responsible for monitoring and enforcing employment and labor laws, workplace safety, environmental laws, privacy or data security laws, consumer protection laws, anti-bribery laws, import/export controls, federal securities laws and tax laws and regulations. In certain jurisdictions, these regulatory requirements may be more stringent than those in the United States and in other circumstances these requirements may be more stringent in the United States. Noncompliance with applicable regulations or requirements could subject us to investigations, sanctions, mandatory recalls, notification obligations, enforcement actions, disgorgement of profits, fines, damages, civil and criminal penalties or injunctions. If any governmental sanctions, fines or penalties are imposed, or if we do not prevail in any civil or criminal litigation, our business, operating results, financial condition and reputation could be harmed. In addition, responding to any action will likely result in a significant diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources and an increase in professional fees. Enforcement actions and sanctions could further harm our business, operating results, financial condition and reputation.\nAlleged or actual failure to comply with the constantly evolving legal and contractual environment surrounding calling consumers and wireless phone numbers by other companies or our competitors or governmental or private enforcement actions related thereto, could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe legal and contractual environment surrounding calling consumers and wireless phone numbers is constantly evolving. In the United States, two federal agencies, the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, and the FCC, and various states have laws including, at the federal level, the TCPA that restrict the placing of certain\ntelephone calls and texts to residential and wireless telephone subscribers by means of automatic telephone dialing systems, prerecorded or artificial voice messages and fax machines. These laws require companies to institute processes and safeguards to comply with these restrictions. The legal interpretation of certain of the requirements of these laws has been in dispute before the courts and federal agencies and the FCC is expected to conduct further rulemaking proceedings that may further alter its interpretation of the legal requirements involved. Some of these laws, where a violation is established, can be enforced by the FTC, FCC, State Attorneys General, or private party litigants. In these types of actions, the plaintiff may seek damages, statutory penalties, costs and/or attorneys\u2019 fees.\nWe have designed our solution to comply with these laws. To the extent that our solution is viewed by clients or potential clients as less functional, or more difficult to deploy or use, because of our solution\u2019s compliance features, we may lose market share to competitors that do not include similar compliance safeguards. Our contractual arrangements with our clients who use our solution to place calls also expressly require them to comply with all such laws and to indemnify us for any failure to do so. We take numerous steps to reasonably confirm that the use of our services complies with applicable laws. Even with these efforts, it is possible that the FTC, FCC, private litigants or others may attempt to hold our clients, or us as a software solution provider, responsible for alleged violations of these laws. To the extent any court finds that the software solution violated a controlling legal standard, we could face indemnification demands from our clients for costs, fees and damages with respect to calls placed using that solution. It also is possible that we may not successfully enforce or collect upon our contractual indemnities from our clients. Defending such suits can be costly and time-consuming and could result in fines, damages, expenses and losses. Additionally, these laws, and any changes to them or the interpretation thereof, that further restrict calling consumers, including to wireless phone numbers, adverse publicity regarding the alleged or actual failure by companies, including our clients and competitors, to comply with such laws or governmental or private enforcement actions related thereto, could result in a reduction in the use of our solution by our clients and potential clients, which could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOn December 12, 2018, the FCC issued an order concluding that the Short Message Service, or SMS, or text messages, is an information service under federal law and not a telecommunications service. The regulatory significance to us is that the FCC\u2019s decision gives wireless carriers the flexibility to block SMS messages if the carriers identify the messages as unwanted by their wireless customers. Such blocking efforts by carriers may make it more difficult for our clients to use SMS messages that are provided by us as a part of our overall communications and outreach solution for our clients. Thus, although SMS comprises only a very small portion of our revenue base, its future availability as an effective tool for communication and outreach for our clients and their customers is uncertain and could cause our solution to be less valuable to clients and potential clients.\nIncreased taxes on our service may increase our clients\u2019 cost of using our service and/or increase our costs and reduce our profit margins to the extent the costs are not passed through to our clients, and we may be subject to liabilities for past sales and other taxes, surcharges and fees.\nBased on analysis of our activities, we have determined that we are obligated to collect and remit U.S. state or local sales, use, gross receipts, excise and utility user taxes, as well as fees or surcharges as a communications service provider in certain U.S. states, municipalities or local tax jurisdictions. We are registered for collecting and remitting applicable taxes where such a determination has been made. Prior to our making such determination, we neither collected nor remitted these taxes, fees or surcharges to applicable local, municipal or state jurisdictions. We continue to analyze our activities to determine if we are subject to these taxes in additional jurisdictions and based on our ongoing assessment of our U.S. state and local tax collection and remittance obligations, we register for tax and regulatory purposes in such jurisdictions and commence collecting and remitting applicable state and local taxes and surcharges to these jurisdictions.\nWe have accrued a contingent liability of $1.1 million for our best estimate of the probable amount of taxes and surcharges that may be imposed by various states and municipalities on our activities, including our usage-based and subscription services, prior to registration. This contingent liability is based on our analysis of a number of factors, including the source location of our usage-based fees, the taxability of our subscription services and the rules and regulations in each state. The actual amount of state and local taxes and surcharges paid may differ from our estimates. See Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements.\nWhile we have accrued for these potential liabilities in each period, such accruals are based on analyses of our business activities, the operation of our solution, applicable statutes, regulations and rules in each state and locality and estimates of sales subject to sales tax or other charges. State and local taxing and regulatory authorities may challenge our position and may decide to audit our business and operations with respect to state or local sales, use,\ngross receipts, excise and utility user taxes, fees or surcharges, which could result in our being liable for taxes, fees, or surcharges, as well as related penalties and interest, above our recorded accrued liability or additional liability for taxes, fees, or surcharges, as well as penalties and interest for our clients, which could harm our results of operations and our relationships with our clients. In addition, if our international sales grow, additional foreign countries may seek to impose sales or other tax collection obligations on us, which would increase our exposure to liability.\nThe applicability of state or local taxes, fees or surcharges relative to services such as ours is complex, ambiguous and subject to interpretation and change. If states enact new legislation or if taxing and regulatory authorities promulgate new rules or regulations or expand or otherwise alter their interpretations of existing rules and regulations, we could incur additional liabilities. The amount that we are required to pay under certain of these tax and regulatory structures also continues to increase as a percentage of our telecommunications revenues. The collection of additional taxes, fees or surcharges in the future could increase our prices or reduce our profit margins. Compliance with new or existing legislation, rules or regulations may also make us less competitive with those competitors who are not subject to, or choose not to comply with, such legislation, rules or regulations. We have incurred, and will continue to incur, substantial ongoing costs associated with complying with state or local tax, fee or surcharge requirements in the numerous markets in which we conduct or will conduct business.\nOur ability to offer services outside the United States is subject to different regulatory and taxation requirements, which may be complicated and uncertain.\nAs we continue to expand the sale and implementation of our solution internationally, we will be subject to additional regulations, taxes, surcharges and fees. Compliance with these new complex regulatory requirements differ from country to country, and are frequently changing and may impose substantial compliance burdens on our business. At times, it may be difficult to determine which laws and regulations apply and we may discover that we are required to comply with certain laws and regulations after having provided services for some time in that jurisdiction, which could subject us to retroactive taxes, fees and penalties, and we may be subject to conflicting requirements. Additionally, as we expand internationally, the risk that governments will regulate or impose new or increased taxes or fees on our services increases. Any such additional regulation or taxes could decrease the value of our international expansion, or impede our ability to expand internationally, and therefore harm our results of operations.\nWe are subject to assessments for unpaid USF contributions, as well as interest thereon and civil penalties, due to our late registration and past failure to recognize our obligation as a USF contributor and as an international carrier.\nWe are classified as a telecommunications service provider for regulatory purposes and we are required to make direct contributions to the USF based on revenue we receive from the resale of interstate and international telecommunications services. In order to comply with the obligation to make direct contributions, we are registered with the Universal Service Administrative Company, or USAC, which is charged by the FCC with administering the USF, and have been remitting the required contributions to USAC since our registration with USAC in April 2013.\nIn June 2015, in connection with our late registration with the USAC and past failure to make USF contributions prior to 2013, we entered into a consent decree with the FCC Enforcement Bureau. In the consent decree, we agreed to pay a civil penalty of $2.0 million to the U.S. Treasury, which was paid in installments ending on December 31, 2018. We also agreed to make USF contributions of $3.9 million based on our revenues for the period from 2008 to 2012. We are still in dispute with the FCC regarding whether we are liable for USF contributions related to the period from 2003 through 2007. As of December 31, 2020, we had accrued $0.9 million in respect of the remaining disputed assessments, including interest and penalties, for the period of 2003 through 2007. See Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements.\nAlthough the effective period of the FCC consent decree has terminated, the FCC routinely imposes a higher expectation of regulatory compliance on companies that were previously subject to consent decrees and any further violations of FCC rules could subject us to heightened enforcement action, including higher fines and penalties.\nOur ongoing obligations to pay federal, state and local telecommunications contributions and taxes may decrease our price advantage over, and ability to compete with our competitors who are not subject to, or choose not to comply with, those requirements. In addition, if we are unable to continue to pass some or all of the cost of these contributions and taxes to our clients, our profit margins on the minutes we resell will decrease. Our federal contributions and tax obligations may significantly increase in the future, due to new interpretations by governing authorities, governmental budget pressures, changes in our business model or solutions or other factors.\nIf we do not comply with FCC rules and regulations, we could be subject to further FCC enforcement actions, fines, loss of licenses and possibly restrictions on our ability to operate or offer certain of our services.\nSince our business is regulated by the FCC, we are subject to existing or potential FCC regulations relating to privacy, disability access, porting of numbers, USF contributions and other requirements. If we do not comply with FCC rules and regulations, we could be subject to further FCC enforcement actions, fines, loss of licenses and possibly restrictions on our ability to operate or offer certain of our services. Any further enforcement action by the FCC, which may be a public process, would hurt our reputation in the industry, could impair our ability to sell our services to clients and could harm our business and results of operations.\nThe regulations to which we are subject (in whole or in part) include:\n\u2022the TRACED Act and corresponding regulations from the FCC, which requires carriers to authenticate incoming calls using the STIR/SHAKEN caller ID framework and correspondingly compels providers of telecommunications services to implement capabilities to certify as authentic the traffic they provide to those carriers;\n\u2022the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act, or CALEA, which requires covered entities to assist law enforcement in undertaking electronic surveillance;\n\u2022KARI\u2019s Law and RAY BAUM\u2019s Act, which require telecommunications carriers to ensure their users can directly dial 911 emergency services and, if technically feasible, automatically convey dispatchable location information with the call;\n\u2022contributions to the USF which requires that we pay a percentage of our revenues resulting from the provision of interstate telecommunications services to support certain federal programs;\n\u2022payment of annual FCC regulatory fees based on our interstate and international revenues;\n\u2022rules pertaining to access to our services by people with disabilities and contributions to the Telecommunications Relay Services fund; and\n\u2022FCC rules regarding CPNI which prohibit us from using such information without client approval, subject to certain exceptions.\nIf we do not comply with any current or future rules or regulations that apply to our business, we could be subject to additional and substantial fines and penalties, we may have to restructure our solution, exit certain markets, accept lower margins or raise the price of our solution, any of which could harm our business and results of operations.\nReform of federal and state USF programs could increase the cost of our service to our clients, diminishing or eliminating our pricing advantage.\nThe FCC and a number of states are considering reform or other modifications to USF programs. The way we calculate our contribution may change if the FCC or certain states engage in reform or adopt other modifications.\nShould the FCC or certain states adopt new contribution mechanisms or otherwise modify contribution obligations that increase our contribution burden, we will either need to raise the amount we currently collect from our clients to cover this obligation or absorb the costs, which would reduce our profit margins. Furthermore, the FCC has ruled that states can require us to contribute to state USF programs. A number of states already require us to contribute, while others are actively considering extending their programs to include the solution we provide. Currently our USF contributions are borne by our clients, which could result in our solution becoming less competitive as compared to products provided by our competitors.\nWe may not be able to utilize a significant portion of our net operating loss or research tax credit carryforwards, and under recently enacted lower federal corporate tax rates such tax benefits will be of less value, which could harm our profitability and financial condition.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had federal, state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards due to prior period losses of $356.0 million, $201.6 million and $14.3 million, respectively, available to reduce future income subject to income taxes. If not utilized, the federal and state net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2024 and 2028, respectively, while the foreign net operating loss carryforwards do not expire. As of December 31, 2020, we also had gross research credit carryforwards for federal and California state tax purposes of $6.1 million and $4.5 million, respectively. If not utilized, the federal research credit carryforwards will begin to expire in 2024. The California research credit carryforwards do not expire. If we are unable to generate sufficient taxable income to utilize our net operating loss and research tax credit carryforwards, these carryforwards could expire unused and be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities, which could harm our profitability and financial condition in future periods.\nIn addition, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or IRC Section 382, our ability to utilize net operating loss carryforwards or other tax attributes, such as research tax credits, in any taxable year may be limited if we experience an \u201cownership change.\u201d An IRC Section 382 \u201cownership change\u201d generally occurs if one or more stockholders or groups of stockholders who own at least 5% of our stock increase their ownership by more than 50 percentage points over their lowest ownership percentage within a rolling three-year period. Similar rules may apply under state tax laws. We experienced an ownership change prior to 2014 and the disclosed amounts of our net operating losses and research credit carryforwards have been reduced for the resulting effect of the IRC Section 382 limitations. Subsequent or future issuances or sales of our stock (including certain transactions involving our stock that are outside of our control) could cause an \u201cownership change\u201d again, which would impose an annual limit on the amount of pre-ownership change net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes we can use to reduce our taxable income, potentially causing those tax attributes to expire unused or to be reduced, and increasing and accelerating our liability for income taxes. It is possible that such an ownership change could materially reduce our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards or other tax attributes to offset taxable income, which could require us to pay more income taxes than if we were able to fully utilize our net operating loss carryforwards and harm our profitability.\nIn December 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was enacted. The effect of the new tax law, and its regulations and interpretations, as well as any additional tax reform legislation in the United States or elsewhere, could harm our business and financial condition by, among other things, decreasing the value of our net operating loss carryforwards. If we are required to reduce the value of our net operating loss carryforwards, we may be required to record a corresponding charge to current earnings, which could harm our financial condition and results of operations in the period in which it is recorded.\nPrivacy concerns and domestic or foreign laws and regulations may reduce the demand for our solution, increase our costs and harm our business.\nOur clients use our solution to collect, transfer, use, and otherwise process, collectively, Process or Processing, personal data regarding their customers and potential customers. The Processing of personal data and other types of protected data subjects us and our customers to a number of domestic and international laws that govern and regulate the Processing of personal data and other types of protected data. These laws regulate and address a range of issues including data privacy (e.g., restrictions or technological or process requirements regarding the Processing of data), cybersecurity (e.g., requirements for the protection of personal data against compromise of the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of personal data), breach notification, data governance, and risk management and reporting. These laws can vary substantially from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and are rapidly evolving. Domestic and international government authorities are considering adopting, or may adopt, laws and regulations in the future, regarding the Processing of personal data obtained from consumers and individuals.\nMoreover, laws and regulations outside the United States, and particularly in the European Union, or EU, often are more restrictive than those in the United States. Such laws and regulations may have more stringent compliance obligations in regards to data protection. By way of example, under the EU General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, data subjects have the right to access, correct, and request deletion of personal data stored or maintained by companies subject to GDPR, such companies may have shorter timeframes and broader requirements for informing data protection authorities and individuals of security breaches that affect their personal data, and, in some cases, may be required to obtain individuals\u2019 consent to process personal data for certain purposes. We also\nmay be bound by additional, more stringent contractual obligations relating to our collection, use, and disclosure of personal, financial, and other data. It is possible that a governmental authority may implement a new law or interpret an existing law in a manner that limits our customers\u2019 ability to use our solution or that requires us to make costly or detrimental changes in our solution and services, whether on a one-time basis or as an ongoing increase in our operating costs and expenses. Further, some laws might require us to disclose proprietary or confidential aspects of our solution in a manner that compromises the effectiveness of our solution or that enables our competitors or bad actors to gain insight into the operation of our technology, enabling them to copy or circumvent our solution and thereby reducing the value of our technology.\nThe costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, such laws and regulations that are applicable to us and the businesses of our clients may limit the use and adoption of our solution and reduce overall demand for our solution. Also, failure to comply with such laws may lead to significant fines, penalties or other regulatory liabilities, such as orders or consent decrees forcing us or our clients to modify business practices, and reputational damage or third-party lawsuits for any noncompliance with such laws. Our business could be harmed if legislation or regulations are adopted, interpreted or implemented in a manner that is inconsistent from country to country and inconsistent with our current policies and practices, or those of our clients.\nFurthermore, privacy and data protection concerns may cause consumers to resist providing the personal data or other types of protected data that may be subject to laws and regulations that is necessary to allow our clients to use our solution effectively. Even the perception of privacy concerns, whether or not valid, may inhibit market adoption of our solution in certain industries or countries.\nThe European Union\u2019s GDPR may continue to increase our costs and the costs of our clients to operate, limit the use of our solution or change the way we operate, exposes us to substantial fines and penalties if we fail to comply, and has led to similar laws being enacted in other jurisdictions.\nOn May 25, 2018, the EU adopted the GDPR. The GDPR replaced the EU Data Protection Directive, also known as Directive 95/46/EC, and is intended to harmonize data protection laws throughout the EU by applying a single data protection law that is binding throughout each member state. We and many of our customers are subject to the GDPR based upon our processing of personal data collected from EU data subjects, such as our processing of personal data of our customers in the EU and our processing of our EU employees\u2019 personal data.\nThe GDPR enhances data protection obligations for processors and controllers of personal data, including, for example, expanded disclosures about how personal information is to be used, limitations on retention of information, mandatory data breach notification requirements and onerous new obligations on services providers. Non-compliance with the GDPR can trigger steep fines of up to \u20ac20 million or 4% of total worldwide annual turnover, whichever is higher. The member states of the EU were tasked under the GDPR to enact certain implementing legislation that would add to or further interpret the GDPR requirements and this additional implementing legislation potentially extends our obligations and potential liability for failing to meet such obligations.\nGiven the breadth and depth of changes in data protection obligations, our compliance with the GDPR\u2019s requirements will continue to require time, resources and review of the technology and systems we use to satisfy the GDPR\u2019s requirements. We have ongoing procedures to maintain GDPR compliance. We continue to deliver product features that enhance our data management and security in support of GDPR compliance.\nAmong the compliance obligations the GDPR raises for us and our customers are requirements regarding the transfer of personal data from the EU to other jurisdictions, including the United States. In order to comply with the data transfer obligations imposed by the GDPR, we rely on the use of standard contractual clauses issued by the European Commission. Where applicable, we also enter into data processing agreements including standard contractual clauses approved by the Article 29 Working Party (now the Data Protection Board) to authorize the transfer of personal data from the EU and in support of our data processing activities on behalf of our customers. Litigation challenging the adequacy of the standard contractual clauses could negatively impact the operation of our business. The invalidation of the standard contractual clauses may require us to adopt costly or burdensome alternatives. It may be necessary to establish additional systems and business operations in the EU to avoid the transfer of personal data out of the EU. Should a change in the conduct of our business be required, it may involve substantial expense and the diversion of resources from other aspects of our business, all of which may harm our business and results of operations.\nGiven the complexity of operationalizing the GDPR, the maturity level of proposed compliance frameworks and the relative lack of guidance in the interpretation of its numerous requirements, we and our customers are at risk\nof enforcement actions taken by EU data protection authorities or litigation from consumer advocacy groups acting on behalf of data subjects. This risk will likely remain until there is more guidance on the GDPR, including as to implementing legislation enacted by the member states and enforcement actions taken by various data protection authorities.\nThe implementation of the GDPR has led other jurisdictions to amend, or propose legislation to amend, their existing data protection laws to align with the requirements of the GDPR with the aim of obtaining an adequate level of data protection to facilitate the transfer of personal data from the EU. Accordingly, the challenges we face in the EU will likely also apply to other jurisdictions outside the EU that adopt laws similar in construction to the GDPR or regulatory frameworks of equivalent complexity.\nThe CCPA and the CPRA could increase our costs and the costs of our clients to operate, limit the use of our solution or change the way we operate, and expose us to substantial fines and class action risk if we fail to comply, and lead to similar laws being enacted in other states.\nIn 2018, the State of California adopted the CCPA. The CCPA applies to certain for-profit entities doing businesses in California. We and our qualifying customers were required to comply with the requirements of the CCPA on January 1, 2020.\nThe CCPA established a new privacy framework for covered businesses by creating an expanded definition of personal information and creating new data privacy rights for consumers in the State of California. As required by the statute, entities doing business in California have disclosure obligations to consumers for whom they hold or process personal data. Businesses must also provide consumers with the right to dictate how their personal information is used and shared. Complying with these obligations involves continued expenditures that could increase as more consumers exercise their rights under the statute.\nThe CCPA created a new and potentially severe statutory damages framework for violations of its provisions. The California Attorney General can enforce the CCPA by seeking statutory penalties for failure to comply with the act. For businesses that fail to implement reasonable security procedures, the CCPA also creates a private right of action for consumers whose personal data is subject to a data breach. This private right of action has the potential to create significant class action liability for businesses, like ours, that operate in California. To protect against these new risks, it may be necessary to change our insurance programs.\nThe CCPA has been amended on multiple occasions, and is the subject of the regulations of the California Attorney General, which could be subject to additional modifications. Additional CCPA amendments have been proposed. It is unclear how, if at all, it may be modified, or how it will be interpreted by the California Attorney General. In addition, voters in California approved the ballot initiative known as the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020, or CPRA. Pursuant to the CPRA, the CCPA will be amended by creating additional privacy rights for California consumers and additional obligations on businesses, which could subject us to additional compliance costs as well as potential fines, individual claims and commercial liabilities. The CPRA is expected to take effect on January 1, 2023. Additional modifications to the CCPA could create additional liability and require costly expenditures to ensure continued compliance.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Convertible Senior Notes\nServicing our debt may require a significant amount of cash. We may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our indebtedness, and we may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to settle for cash conversions of the convertible senior notes or to repurchase the convertible senior notes for cash upon a fundamental change, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nIn May 2018, we issued $258.8 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2023 convertible senior notes in a private offering. In May 2020, we repurchased or exchanged $181.0 in aggregate principal amount of the 2023 convertible senior notes through individually negotiated private transactions in the 2023 Note Repurchase Transactions. As of December 31, 2020, after giving effect to the 2023 Note Repurchase Transactions and other settlements, we had approximately $58.9 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2023 convertible senior notes outstanding. The 2023 convertible senior notes mature on May 1, 2023 and the interest rate of the 2023 convertible senior notes is fixed at 0.125% per annum, payable semiannually in arrears on May 1 and November 1 of each year.\nIn May and June 2020, we issued $747.5 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2025 convertible senior notes in a private offering, all of which were outstanding as of December 31, 2020. The 2025 convertible senior\nnotes mature on June 1, 2025, and the interest rate of the 2025 convertible senior notes is fixed at 0.500% per annum, payable semiannually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year, beginning on December 1, 2020.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments of principal and interest, or to refinance our indebtedness, including the convertible senior notes, depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not generate cash flows from operations in the future that are sufficient to service our debt and make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows, we may be required to pursue one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt or obtaining additional debt financing or equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive to existing holders of our common stock. Our ability to obtain additional financing or refinance either or both series of the convertible senior notes, or any future indebtedness, will depend on conditions in the capital markets and our financial condition at such time, among other factors. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities on favorable terms or at all, which could result in a default on our debt obligations or other material adverse effects on our business and financial condition.\nSubject to certain conditions, holders of both series of the convertible senior notes have the right to require us to repurchase for cash all or any portion of their convertible senior notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change (as defined in the indentures governing the convertible senior notes) at a fundamental change repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the applicable series of convertible senior notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the applicable fundamental change repurchase date.\nUpon conversion of either or both series of convertible senior notes in accordance with their terms, unless we elect to deliver solely shares of our common stock to settle such conversion (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we will be required to settle a portion or all of our conversion obligation through the payment of cash. We may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to make repurchases in connection with such conversion and our ability to pay may be further limited by law, regulatory authority or agreements governing our future indebtedness. Our failure to repurchase any convertible senior notes at a time when the repurchase is required by the applicable indenture or to pay any cash payable on any future conversions as required by the applicable indenture would constitute a default under such indenture. A default under either such indenture would lead to, and the occurrence of the fundamental change itself may also lead to, a default under agreements governing our future indebtedness. If the repayment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness or repurchase any convertible senior notes when required, or to make cash payments upon conversions thereof.\nThe conditional conversion feature of the 2023 convertible senior notes and, if triggered, the 2025 convertible senior notes, may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nIf and to the extent the conditional conversion features of either or both series of convertible senior notes are triggered, holders of such convertible senior notes will be entitled to convert their convertible senior notes at any time during specified periods at their option. During the three months ended December 31, 2020, one of the conversion features of the 2023 convertible senior notes was triggered, entitling the holders thereof to convert such convertible senior notes from January 1, 2021 to March 31, 2021. Whether the 2023 convertible senior notes will be convertible after March 31, 2021 will depend on the continued satisfaction of this condition or other conversion conditions.\nTo the extent that the respective conditional conversion features of either or both series of convertible senior notes are triggered in the future, holders of such convertible senior notes, as applicable, will be entitled to convert their convertible senior notes at any time during the specified periods at their option. If one or more holders elect to convert their convertible senior notes during any such specified period, we have the option to pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock, at our election. Any election to settle conversions of convertible senior notes with cash could adversely affect our liquidity.\nTransactions relating to the convertible senior notes may dilute the ownership interests of our existing stockholders or adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nThe conversion of some or all of either series of convertible senior notes would dilute the ownership interests of our existing stockholders to the extent we satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering shares of our common stock. In this regard, if holders of the convertible senior notes elect to convert their notes during one of the specified conversion periods referred to above, we may settle our conversion obligations by delivering to them cash,\nshares of our common stock or a combination thereof. In addition, we may issue shares of our common stock in connection with repurchases, exchanges or other transactions involving the convertible senior notes, such as the 2023 Note Repurchase Transactions, which involved the issuance of 2,723,581 shares of our common stock to certain holders of the 2023 convertible senior notes. We received elections to convert a limited number of 2023 convertible senior notes from the fourth quarter of 2019 through December 31, 2020. We have elected to satisfy our obligations through the payment of cash in certain circumstances, the issuance of shares of common stock in other circumstances, or a combination thereof, to such convertible senior note holders. See Part II, Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation-Liquidity and Capital Resources, for further discussion of our elections to satisfy our conversion obligations.\nIn addition, in connection with the issuance of the 2023 convertible senior notes and the 2025 convertible senior notes, we entered into capped call transactions with certain financial institutions, or the Option Counterparties. The capped call transactions are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution to holders of our common stock upon any conversion or settlement of either series of convertible notes and/or offset any cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of such convertible senior notes, as the case may be, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap under the terms of the capped call transactions. We expect that the Option Counterparties or their respective affiliates may from time to time purchase shares of our common stock and/or enter into various derivative transactions with respect to our common stock in connection with their hedging activities relating to the capped call transactions. The Option Counterparties or their respective affiliates also may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding such derivative transactions and/or purchasing or selling our common stock or other securities of ours in secondary market transactions prior to the applicable maturity of either series of convertible senior notes. These activities could negatively affect the market price of our common stock.\nThe accounting method for convertible debt securities that may be settled in cash, such as both series of convertible senior notes, could have a material effect on our reported financial results.\nUnder Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification 470-20, Debt with Conversion and Other Options (\u201cASC 470-20\u201d), an entity must separately account for the liability and equity components of convertible debt instruments (such as both series of convertible senior notes) that may be settled entirely or partially in cash upon conversion in a manner that reflects the issuer\u2019s economic interest cost. ASC 470-20 requires the value of the conversion option of the applicable series of convertible senior notes, representing the equity component, to be recorded as additional paid-in capital within stockholders\u2019 equity in our consolidated balance sheet and as a discount to the applicable series convertible senior notes, which reduces their initial carrying value. The carrying value of the applicable series of convertible senior notes, net of the discount recorded, will be accreted up to the principal amount of such series of convertible senior notes from the issuance date until the applicable maturity date, which will result in non-cash charges to interest expense in our consolidated statement of operations. Accordingly, we will report lower net income or higher net loss in our financial results because ASC 470-20 requires interest to include both the current period\u2019s accretion of the debt discount and the instrument\u2019s coupon interest, which could adversely affect our reported or future financial results, the trading price of our common stock and the trading price of either or both series of convertible senior notes.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nOur stock price has been volatile, may continue to be volatile and may decline, including due to factors beyond our control.\nThe market price of our common stock has been volatile in the past and may fluctuate significantly in the future in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, the sale price per share of our common stock ranged from a low of $52.51 to a high of $187.99. Factors that may contribute to continuing volatility in the price of our common stock include:\n\u2022actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results;\n\u2022the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and related matters on the equity capital markets and economy in general, or on us or our industry in particular;\n\u2022the financial projections we provide to the public, any changes in these projections, our failure to meet these projections, or our failure to exceed these projections by amounts or percentages expected by our investors and analysts;\n\u2022failure of securities analysts to initiate or maintain coverage of our company, changes in financial estimates by any securities analysts who follow our company, or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors;\n\u2022ratings changes by any securities analysts who follow our company;\n\u2022sales of our common stock (or securities that convert to our common stock) by us or our significant stockholders, or the public announcement of same;\n\u2022the assessment of our business or position in our market published in research and other reports;\n\u2022announcements by us or our competitors of significant product or technical innovations, financings, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n\u2022entry into the market by new competitors, or the introduction of new products or the generation of new sales by us or our competitors;\n\u2022changes in operating performance and stock market valuations of other technology companies generally, or those in the software as a service industry in particular;\n\u2022price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market, including as a result of trends in the U.S. or global economy;\n\u2022any major change in our board of directors or management;\n\u2022lawsuits threatened or filed against us;\n\u2022security breaches or incidents impacting our clients or their customers and security breaches of companies that provide solutions similar to our solution, which could negatively impact our industry as a whole;\n\u2022legislation or regulation of our business, the internet and/or contact centers;\n\u2022loss of key personnel;\n\u2022new entrants into the contact center market, including the transition by providers of legacy on-premise contact center systems to cloud solutions;\n\u2022acquisitions by us or our competitors, and our ability to effectively integrate and achieve the desired benefits from acquisitions by us;\n\u2022the perceived or real impact of events that harm our direct competitors;\n\u2022developments with respect to patents or proprietary rights;\n\u2022general market conditions; and\n\u2022other events or factors, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism or responses to these events, which would be unrelated to our business and industry, and outside of our control.\nIn addition, stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many technology companies, particularly in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic. Stock prices of many technology companies have fluctuated in a manner unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. These and other factors may disproportionately impact the trading price of our common stock. In the past, stockholders have instituted securities class action litigation following periods of market volatility. If we were to become involved in securities litigation, it could subject us to substantial costs, divert resources and the attention of management from our business and harm our business, results of operations, financial condition, reputation and cash flows.\nIf securities or industry analysts discontinue publishing research or reports about our business, or publish negative reports about our business, our share price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business, our market and our competitors. We do not have any control over these analysts. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our shares or change their opinion of our shares or our business, our share price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in financial markets or our industry market, which could cause our share price or trading volume to decline.\nSubstantial future sales of shares of our common stock could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nThe market price of shares of our common stock could decline as a result of substantial sales of our common stock, particularly sales by our directors, executive officers and significant stockholders or the perception in the market that holders of a large number of shares intend to sell their shares.\nThe future registration of shares of our common stock may cause our stock price to decline, even before such shares are actually sold in the market. We have registered shares of common stock that we may issue under our employee equity incentive plans. These shares can be sold freely in the public market upon issuance.\nWe are unable to predict the effect that sales, or the perception that our shares may be available for sale, will have on the prevailing market price of our common stock.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of our company more difficult, limit attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management and limit the market price of our common stock.\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control or changes in our management. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws:\n\u2022provide that our board of directors is classified into three classes of directors;\n\u2022provide that stockholders may remove directors only for cause and only with the approval of holders of at least 66 2\u20443% of our then outstanding capital stock;\n\u2022provide that the authorized number of directors may be changed only by resolution of the board of directors;\n\u2022provide that all vacancies, including newly created directorships, may, except as otherwise required by law, be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of directors then in office, even if less than a quorum;\n\u2022provide that our stockholders may not take action by written consent, and may only take action at annual or special meetings of our stockholders;\n\u2022provide that stockholders seeking to present proposals before a meeting of stockholders or to nominate candidates for election as directors at a meeting of stockholders must provide notice in writing in a timely manner, and also specify requirements as to the form and content of a stockholder\u2019s notice;\n\u2022restrict the forum for certain litigation against us to Delaware;\n\u2022restrict the forum for complaints asserting a cause of action under the Securities Act to the federal district courts;\n\u2022do not provide for cumulative voting rights (therefore allowing the holders of a majority of the shares of common stock entitled to vote in any election of directors to elect all of the directors standing for election);\n\u2022provide that special meetings of our stockholders may be called only by the chairman of the board, our chief executive officer or the board of directors pursuant to a resolution adopted by a majority of the total number of authorized directors; and\n\u2022provide that stockholders will be permitted to amend our amended and restated bylaws and certain parts of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation only upon receiving at least 662/3% of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of all outstanding shares then entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class.\nThese provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management. In addition, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which generally prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any of a broad range of business combinations with any \u201cinterested\u201d stockholder for a period of three years following the date on which the stockholder became an \u201cinterested\u201d stockholder.\nThe existence of these provisions could negatively affect the price of our common stock and limit opportunities for you to realize value in a corporate transaction.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the sole and exclusive forum for certain disputes between us and our stockholders, and our Bylaws provide that the federal district courts will be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action under the Securities Act, each of which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees, or agents.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that, unless we consent to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the sole and exclusive forum for (1) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (2) any action asserting a claim of breach of fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or other employees to us or to our stockholders, (3) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation Law or (4) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine. Furthermore, our Bylaws provide that, unless we consent in writing to an alternative forum, the federal district courts of the United States are the sole and exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action under the Securities Act.\nThese choice of forum provisions may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees, or agents, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers, employees and agents even though an action, if successful, might benefit our stockholders. Stockholders who do bring a claim in the Court of Chancery could face additional litigation costs in pursuing any such claim, particularly if they do not reside in or near the State of Delaware. The Court of Chancery or federal district courts may also reach different judgments or results than would other courts, including courts where a stockholder considering an action may be located or would otherwise choose to bring the action, and such judgments or results may be more favorable to us than to our stockholders. Alternatively, if a court were to find either of these choice of forum provisions to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe have never paid cash dividends and do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock. We currently intend to retain any future earnings and do not expect to pay any dividends in the foreseeable future. Any future determination to declare cash dividends will be made at the discretion of our board of directors, subject to applicable laws, and will depend on a number of factors, including our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, contractual restrictions, including under any future loan facilities, general business conditions and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant. While our convertible senior notes do not prohibit payment of dividends, any dividends declared and paid by our board of directors would result in an adjustment to the conversion rate of such notes such that additional shares would be issuable upon conversion. Accordingly, holders of our common stock must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investments.",

    "item_7": "ITEM 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nYou should read the following discussion in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report.\nOverview\nWe are a pioneer and leading provider of intelligent cloud software for contact centers, facilitating more than seven billion call minutes between our more than 2,000 clients and their customers per year. We believe we achieved this leadership position through our expertise and technology, which has empowered us to help organizations of all sizes transition from legacy on-premise contact center systems to our cloud solution. Our solution, comprised of our VCC cloud platform and applications, allows simultaneous management and optimization of customer interactions across voice, chat, email, web, social media and mobile channels, either directly or through our APIs. Our VCC cloud platform matches each customer interaction with an appropriate agent resource and delivers relevant customer data to the agent in real-time through integrations with adjacent enterprise applications, such as CRM software, to optimize the customer experience and improve agent productivity. Unlike legacy on-premise contact center systems, our solution requires minimal up-front investment, can be rapidly deployed and adjusted depending on our client\u2019s requirements.\nSince founding our business in 2001, we have focused exclusively on delivering cloud contact center software. We initially targeted smaller contact center opportunities with our telesales team and, over time, invested in expanding the breadth and depth of the functionality of our cloud platform to meet the evolving requirements of our clients. In 2009, we made a strategic decision to expand our market opportunity to include larger contact centers. This decision drove further investments in research and development and the establishment of our field sales team to meet the requirements of these larger contact centers. We believe this shift has helped us diversify our client base, while significantly enhancing our opportunity for future revenue growth. To complement these efforts, we have also focused on building client awareness and driving adoption of our solution through marketing activities, which include internet advertising, digital marketing campaigns, social media, trade shows, industry events, telemarketing and out of home campaigns.\nWe provide our solution through a SaaS business model with recurring subscriptions. We offer a comprehensive suite of applications delivered on our VCC cloud platform that are designed to enable our clients to\nmanage and optimize interactions across inbound and outbound contact centers. We primarily generate revenue by selling subscriptions and related usage of our VCC cloud platform. We charge our clients monthly subscription fees for access to our solution, primarily based on the number of agent seats, as well as the specific functionalities and applications our clients deploy. We define agent seats as the maximum number of named agents allowed to concurrently access our solution. Our clients typically have more named agents than agent seats, and multiple named agents may use an agent seat, though not simultaneously. Substantially all of our clients purchase both subscriptions and related telephony usage from us. A small percentage of our clients subscribe to our platform but purchase telephony usage directly from wholesale telecommunications service providers. We do not sell telephony usage on a stand-alone basis to any client. The related usage fees are based on the volume of minutes for inbound and outbound interactions. We also offer bundled plans, generally for smaller deployments, where the client is charged a single monthly fixed fee per agent seat that includes both subscription and unlimited usage in the contiguous 48 states and, in some cases, Canada. We offer monthly, annual and multiple-year contracts to our clients, generally with 30 days\u2019 notice required for reductions in the number of agent seats. Increases in the number of agent seats can be provisioned almost immediately. Our clients, therefore, are able to adjust the number of agent seats used to meet their changing contact center volume needs. Our larger clients typically choose annual contracts, which generally include an implementation and ramp period of several months. Fixed subscription fees, including bundled plans, are generally billed monthly in advance, while related usage fees are billed in arrears. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, subscription and related usage fees accounted for 92%, 92% and 93% of our revenue, respectively. The remainder was comprised of professional services revenue from the implementation and optimization of our solution.\nEffects of COVID-19\nIn December 2019, a novel coronavirus disease known as COVID-19 was reported and on March 11, 2020, the WHO characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic. This pandemic has resulted in a widespread health crisis that has significantly harmed the U.S. and global economies and caused significant fluctuation in financial markets, including those on which our common stock and our convertible senior notes trade, and may impact demand for our solution.\nIn accordance with the various social distancing and other office closure orders and recommendations of applicable government agencies, all of our employees have transitioned to work-from-home operations and we have canceled all business travel by our employees except where necessary and properly authorized, which has changed how we operate our business. Our clients and business partners are also subject to various and changing social distancing and office closure orders and recommendations and travel restrictions and prohibitions, which have changed the way we interact with our clients and business partners.\nCOVID-19 had a moderately positive impact on our 2020 financial results due to the shift from brick-and-mortar to virtual. The severity and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, and its impact on the U.S. and global economy, is uncertain, but we believe that there will be a continuing net benefit to us longer term.\nSee Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors, for further discussion of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and operations.\nKey GAAP Operating Results\nOur revenue increased to $434.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, from $328.0 million and $257.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Revenue growth was primarily attributable to our larger clients, driven by an increase in our sales and marketing activities and our improved brand awareness. For each of the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, no single client accounted for more than 10% of our total revenue. As of December 31, 2020, we had over 2,000 clients across multiple industries. Our clients\u2019 subscriptions generally range in size from fewer than 10 agent seats to approximately 9,000 agent seats. We had a net loss of $42.1 million, $4.6 million and $0.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nWe have continued to make significant expenditures and investments, including in sales and marketing, research and development and infrastructure. We primarily evaluate the success of our business based on revenue growth and the efficiency and effectiveness of our investments. The growth of our business and our future success depend on many factors, including our ability to continue to expand our base of larger clients, grow revenue from our existing client base, innovate and expand internationally. While these areas represent significant opportunities for us, they also pose risks and challenges that we must successfully address in order to sustain the growth of our business and improve our operating results, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nDue to our continuing investments to grow our business, increase our sales and marketing efforts, pursue new opportunities, enhance our solution and build our technology, we expect our cost of revenue and operating expenses to increase in absolute dollars in the long term. However, we expect cost of revenue and certain operating expenses to fluctuate as a percentage of revenue in the near term taking into consideration the impact of COVID-19 and the macroeconomic environment.\nKey Operating and Non-GAAP Financial Performance Metrics\nIn addition to measures of financial performance presented in our consolidated financial statements, we monitor the key metrics set forth below to help us evaluate growth trends, establish budgets, measure the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts and assess operational efficiencies.\nAnnual Dollar-Based Retention Rate\nWe believe that our Annual Dollar-Based Retention Rate provides insight into our ability to retain and grow revenue from our clients, and is a measure of the long-term value of our client relationships.\nPrior Calculation - Net Invoicing. Our Annual Dollar-Based Retention Rate is calculated by dividing our Retained Net Invoicing by our Retention Base Net Invoicing on a monthly basis, which we then average using the rates for the trailing twelve months for the period being presented. We define Retention Base Net Invoicing as recurring net invoicing from all clients in the comparable prior year period, and we define Retained Net Invoicing as recurring net invoicing from that same group of clients in the current period. We define recurring net invoicing as subscription and related usage revenue excluding the impact of service credits, reserves and deferrals. Historically, the difference between recurring net invoicing and our subscription and related usage revenue has been within 10%.\nThe following table shows our Annual Dollar-Based Retention Rate based on Net Invoicing for the periods presented:\nTwelve Months Ended December 31,\n2020 2019\nAnnual Dollar-Based Retention Rate 110% 105%\nOur Dollar-Based Retention Rate improved year over year primarily due to our larger clients increasing their number of agent seats.\nNew Calculation - Net Revenue. Starting from the fourth quarter of 2020, we revised our Annual Dollar-Based Retention Rate calculation to be based on Net Revenue, rather than Net Invoicing. We now have eight quarters of trended Annual Dollar-Based Retention Rates based on ASC 606 Net Revenue and, consistent with our peers, we are using Net Revenue rather than Net Invoicing and will no longer report the Net Invoicing calculation going forward.\nThe following table shows our Annual Dollar-Based Retention Rate based on Net Revenue for the periods presented:\nTwelve Months Ended December 31,\n2020 2019\nAnnual Dollar-Based Retention Rate 117% 112%\nOur Dollar-Based Retention Rate based on Net Revenue improved year-over-year primarily due to our larger clients increasing their number of agent seats.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nWe monitor adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, to analyze our financial results and believe that it is useful to investors, as a supplement to U.S. GAAP measures, in evaluating our ongoing operational performance and enhancing an overall understanding of our past financial performance. We believe that adjusted EBITDA helps illustrate underlying trends in our business that could otherwise be masked by the effect of the income or expenses that we exclude from adjusted EBITDA. Furthermore, we use this measure to establish budgets and operational goals for managing our business and evaluating our performance. We also believe that adjusted EBITDA provides an additional tool for investors to use in comparing our recurring core business operating results over multiple periods with other companies in our industry.\nAdjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and our calculation of adjusted EBITDA may differ from that of other companies in our industry. We compensate for the inherent limitations associated with using adjusted EBITDA through disclosure of these limitations, presentation of our financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP and reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure, net loss. We calculate adjusted EBITDA as net loss before (1) depreciation and amortization, (2) stock-based compensation, (3) interest income, expense and other, (4) loss on early extinguishment of debt, (5) acquisition-related transaction costs and one-time integration costs, (6) COVID-19 relief bonuses for employees, (7) provision for (benefit from) income taxes, and (8) other items that do not directly affect what we consider to be our core operating performance.\nThe following table shows a reconciliation of net loss to adjusted EBITDA for the periods presented (in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2019\nNet loss $ (42,130) $ (4,552)\nNon-GAAP adjustments:\nDepreciation and amortization (1)\n25,087 14,374\nStock-based compensation (2)\n64,747 42,065\nInterest expense 28,348 13,794\nInterest (income) and other (3,034) (6,079)\nLegal settlement (3)\n- 420\nLegal and indemnification fees related to settlement - 356\nAcquisition related transaction costs and one-time integration costs 6,335 338\nCOVID-19 relief bonuses for employees 1,817 -\nLoss on early extinguishment of debt 6,964 -\nProvision for (benefit from) income taxes (2,453) 104\nAdjusted EBITDA $ 85,681 $ 60,820\n(1) See ITEM 6 of this Form 10-K for depreciation and amortization expenses included in our results of operations for the periods presented.\n(2) See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for stock-based compensation expense included in our results of operations for the periods presented.\n(3) See \u201cLegal Matters\u201d in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nKey Components of Our Results of Operations\nRevenue\nOur revenue consists of subscription and related usage as well as professional services. We consider our subscription and related usage to be recurring revenue. This recurring revenue includes fixed subscription fees for the delivery and support of our VCC cloud platform, as well as related usage fees. The related usage fees are generally based on the volume of minutes for inbound and outbound client interactions. We also offer bundled plans, generally for smaller deployments, where the client is charged a single monthly fixed fee per agent seat that includes both subscription and unlimited usage in the contiguous 48 states and, in some cases, Canada. We offer monthly, annual and multiple-year contracts for our clients, generally with 30 days\u2019 notice required for reductions in the number of agent seats. Increases in the number of agent seats can be provisioned almost immediately. Our clients, therefore, are able to adjust the number of agent seats used to meet their changing contact center volume needs. Our larger clients typically choose annual contracts, which generally include an implementation and ramp period of several months.\nFixed subscription fees, including plans with bundled usage, are generally billed monthly in advance, while variable usage fees are billed in arrears. Fixed subscription fees are recognized on a straight-line basis over the\napplicable term, which is predominantly the monthly contractual billing period. Support activities include technical assistance for our solution and upgrades and enhancements on a when and if available basis, which are not billed separately. Variable subscription related usage fees for non-bundled plans are billed in arrears based on client-specific per minute rate plans and are recognized as actual usage occurs. We generally require advance deposits from clients based on estimated usage. All fees, except usage deposits, are non-refundable.\nIn addition, we generate professional services revenue from assisting clients in implementing our solution and optimizing use. These services include application configuration, system integration and education and training services. Professional services are primarily billed on a fixed-fee basis and are typically performed by us directly. In limited cases, our clients choose to perform these services themselves or engage their own third-party service providers to perform such services. Professional services are recognized as the services are performed using the proportional performance method, with performance measured based on labor hours, provided all other criteria for revenue recognition are met.\nCost of Revenue\nOur cost of revenue consists primarily of personnel costs, including stock-based compensation, fees that we pay to telecommunications providers for usage, USF costs which have been increasing, contributions and other regulatory costs, depreciation and related expenses of the servers and equipment, costs to build out and maintain co-location data centers, costs of public cloud-based data centers, allocated office and facility costs and amortization of acquired technology. Cost of revenue can fluctuate based on a number of factors, including the fees we pay to telecommunications providers, which vary depending on our clients\u2019 usage of our VCC cloud platform, the timing of capital expenditures and related depreciation charges and changes in headcount. We expect to continue investing in our network infrastructure and operations and client support function to maintain high quality and availability of service, resulting in absolute dollar increases in cost of revenue but percentage of revenue declines in the long-term through economies of scale. In the near-term, however, we expect cost of revenue to increase both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue, primarily due to increased investments in public cloud.\nOperating Expenses\nWe classify our operating expenses as research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses.\nResearch and Development. Our research and development expenses consist primarily of salary and related expenses, including stock-based compensation, for personnel related to the development of improvements and expanded features for our services, as well as quality assurance, testing, product management and allocated overhead. We expense research and development expenses as they are incurred except for internal use software development costs that qualify for capitalization. We believe that continued investment in our solution is important for our future growth, and we expect our research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue in the near term.\nSales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, including stock-based compensation, for personnel in sales and marketing, sales commissions, as well as advertising, marketing, corporate communications, travel costs and allocated overhead. We believe it is important to continue investing in sales and marketing to continue to generate revenue growth, and we expect sales and marketing expenses to increase in absolute dollars over the long term and fluctuate as a percentage of revenue as we continue to support our growth initiatives.\nGeneral and Administrative. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salary and related expenses, including stock-based compensation, for management, finance and accounting, legal, information systems and human resources personnel, professional fees, compliance costs, other corporate expenses and allocated overhead. We expect that general and administrative expenses will fluctuate in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue in the near term, due to among other things, the impact of COVID-19 and the resulting macroeconomic conditions, but to increase in absolute dollars and decline as a percentage of revenue over time.\nResults of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019\nBased on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss set forth in this annual report, the following table sets forth our operating results as a percentage of revenue for the periods indicated:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2019\nRevenue 100 % 100 %\nCost of revenue 41 % 41 %\nGross profit 59 % 59 %\nOperating expenses:\nResearch and development 16 % 14 %\nSales and marketing 30 % 29 %\nGeneral and administrative 15 % 15 %\nTotal operating expenses 61 % 58 %\nIncome (loss) from operations (2) % 1 %\nOther income (expense), net:\nInterest expense (7) % (4) %\nLoss on early extinguishment of debt (2) % - %\nInterest income and other 1 % 2 %\nTotal other income (expense), net (8) % (2) %\nIncome (loss) before income taxes (10) % (1) %\nProvision for income taxes - % - %\nNet loss (10) % (1) %\nYear-to-year comparisons between 2019 and 2018 have been omitted from this Form 10-K but may be found in \u201cManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition\u201d in Part II, Item 7 of our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, which specific discussion is incorporated herein by reference.\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019\nRevenue\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2019 $ Change % Change\n(in thousands, except percentages)\nRevenue $434,908 $328,006 $106,902 33%\nThe increase in revenue for 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily attributable to our larger clients, driven by an increase in our sales and marketing activities and our improved brand awareness.\nCost of Revenue\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2019 $ Change % Change\n(in thousands, except percentages)\nCost of revenue $180,284 $134,511 $45,773 34%\n% of Revenue 41% 41%\nThe increase in cost of revenue for 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily due to a $11.6 million increase in personnel costs, including stock-based compensation costs, driven mainly by increased headcount and a higher fair value of employee equity awards due primarily to our increased stock price, a $10.2 million increase in depreciation and data center costs driven by increased capital expenditures to support our growing capacity needs and continuing expansion of our existing data center facilities, a $6.8 million increase in third-party hosted software costs driven by increased client activities, a $6.0 million increase in amortization expense due to the acquisitions of Virtual Observer\nin April 2020 and Inference in November 2020 and the acquisition of certain intangible assets from Whendu in November 2019, a $4.5 million increase in USF contributions and other federal telecommunication service fees due primarily to increased client usage and an increase in the USF contribution rate, and a $1.9 million increase in office, facilities and related costs.\nGross Profit\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2019 $ Change % Change\n(in thousands, except percentages)\nGross profit $254,624 $193,495 $61,129 32%\n% of Revenue 59% 59%\nThe increase in gross profit for 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily due to increases in subscription and related revenues.

The remaining net increase in sales and marketing expenses was primarily due to the execution of our growth strategy to acquire new clients, increase the number of agent seats within our existing client base, and increased advertising and other marketing expenses to increase our brand awareness.\nGeneral and Administrative\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2019 $ Change % Change\n(in thousands, except percentages)\nGeneral and administrative $65,769 $49,446 $16,323 33%\n% of Revenue 15% 15%\nThe increase in general and administrative expenses for 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily due to a $11.6 million increase in personnel-related costs including stock-based compensation costs, driven mainly by increased headcount and a higher fair value of equity awards due primarily to our increased stock price, and a $5.0 million increase in legal and other professional service costs mainly related to our acquisitions.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2019 $ Change % Change\n(in thousands, except percentages)\nInterest expense $ (28,348) $ (13,794) $ (14,554) (106) %\nLoss on early extinguishment of debt (6,964) - (6,964) (100) %\nInterest income and other 3,034 6,079 (3,045) 50 %\nTotal other income (expense), net $ (32,278) $ (7,715) $ (24,563) (318) %\n% of Revenue (7) % (2) %\nThe increase in interest expense for 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily due to increased interest expense under our 2025 convertible senior notes issued in May and June 2020, offset in part by the decrease in interest expense as a result of the 2023 Note Repurchase Transactions and other 2023 convertible senior note settlements, which decreased the aggregate outstanding principal amount of our 2023 convertible senior notes. The $7.0 million of loss was from the early extinguishment of our 2023 convertible senior notes during 2020. The decrease in interest income and other for 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily from lower interest income on our marketable investments.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nTo date, we have financed our operations, primarily through sales of our solution, lease facilities and net proceeds from our equity and debt financings, including the issuance of our 2025 convertible senior notes in May and June 2020 and of our 2023 convertible senior notes in May 2018. As of December 31, 2020, we had $585.6 million in working capital, which included $220.4 million in cash and cash equivalents, $383.2 million in short-term marketable investments and $42.1 million in long-term marketable investments.\nIn May and June 2020, we issued $747.5 million aggregate principal amount of our 2025 convertible senior notes in a private offering. The 2025 convertible senior notes mature on June 1, 2025 and are our senior unsecured obligations. The 2025 convertible senior notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 0.50% per annum, payable semiannually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year, beginning December 1, 2020. The total net proceeds from the offering, after deducting initial purchasers\u2019 discounts and commissions and estimated debt issuance costs, were approximately $728.8 million. In May 2018, we issued $258.8 million aggregate principal amount of our 2023 convertible senior notes in a private offering. The 2023 convertible senior notes mature on May 1, 2023 and are our senior unsecured obligations. The 2023 convertible senior notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 0.125% per annum, payable semiannually in arrears on May 1 and November 1 of each year. The total net proceeds from the offering, after deducting the initial purchasers\u2019 discounts and estimated debt issuance costs, were approximately $250.8 million. As of December 31, 2020, after giving effect to the 2023 Note Repurchase Transactions and other settlements upon conversion requests, approximately $58.9 million aggregate principal amount of 2023 convertible senior notes remained outstanding. For additional information regarding the convertible senior notes and related transactions, see Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report.\nWe believe our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for at least the next 12 months. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including our growth rate, continuing market acceptance of our solution, client retention, our ability to gain new clients, the timing and extent of spending to support research and development efforts, the outcome of any pending or future litigation or other claims by third parties or governmental entities, the expansion of sales and marketing activities and personnel, the introduction of new and enhanced offerings, and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on these or other factors. We may also acquire or invest in complementary businesses, technologies and intellectual property rights, which may increase our use of cash and future capital requirements, either to pay acquisition costs or to support our combined operations. We may raise additional capital through equity or engage in debt financings at any time to fund these or other requirements. However, we may not be able to raise additional capital through equity or debt financings when needed on terms acceptable to us or at all, depending on our financial performance, market conditions and other factors, including the length and severity of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on general economic conditions and potential future impacts on the financial markets. If we are unable to raise additional capital as needed, our business, operating results and financial condition could be harmed. In addition, if our\noperating performance during the next twelve months is below our expectations, our liquidity and ability to operate our business also could be harmed.\nIf we raise additional funds by issuing equity or equity-linked securities, the ownership of our existing stockholders would be diluted. If we raise additional funds through the incurrence of additional indebtedness, we will be subject to increased debt service obligations and could also be subject to restrictive covenants and other operating restrictions that could negatively impact our ability to operate our business.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods presented (in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2019\nNet cash provided by operating activities $ 67,302 $ 51,221\nNet cash used in investing activities (382,330) (63,631)\nNet cash provided by financing activities 457,424 8,474\nNet increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 142,396 $ (3,936)\nYear-to-year comparisons between 2019 and 2018 have been omitted from this Form 10-K but may be found in \u201cManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition\u201d in Part II, Item 7 of our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, which specific discussion is incorporated herein by reference.\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nCash provided by operating activities is primarily influenced by our personnel-related expenditures, data center and telecommunications carrier costs, office and facility related costs, USF contributions and other regulatory costs and the amount and timing of client payments. If we continue to improve our financial results, we expect net cash provided by operating activities to increase. Our largest source of operating cash inflows is cash collections from our clients for subscription and related usage services. Payments from clients for these services are typically received monthly.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $67.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2020. Net cash provided by operating activities resulted from our net loss of $42.1 million adjusted for non-cash items of $128.8 million, primarily consisting of $64.7 million of stock-based compensation, $25.7 million of amortization of discount and issuance costs on our convertible senior notes, $25.1 million of depreciation and amortization and $7.0 million of loss from the early extinguishment of our 2023 convertible senior notes, offset by use of cash for operating assets and liabilities of $19.4 million primarily due to the timing of cash payments to vendors and cash receipts from customers.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities of $382.3 million in 2020 was comprised of $620.9 million related to purchases of marketable investments, $165.3 million, net of cash acquired, in connection with the acquisitions of Inference and Virtual Observer, and $30.4 million in capital expenditures, offset in part by $434.5 million related to cash proceeds from maturities of marketable investments.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities of $457.4 million in 2020 related to net cash proceeds of $728.8 million from the issuance of the 2025 convertible senior notes, net of initial purchasers' discounts and commissions and estimated debt issuance costs, cash proceeds of $11.7 million from exercise of stock options, and $11.5 million from the sale of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan, partially offset by $181.5 million of cash paid in connection with the 2023 Note Repurchase Transactions, $18.9 million of cash paid in connection with other 2023 convertible senior note settlements, $90.5 million of cash paid in connection with the 2025 Capped Call Transactions and $3.7 million of payments related to finance leases.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nOur significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue is recognized when control of the promised services is transferred to customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for those services. We generate all of our revenue from contracts with customers. In contracts with multiple performance obligations, we identify each performance obligation and evaluate whether the performance obligations are distinct within the context of the contract at contract inception. Performance obligations that are not distinct at contract inception are combined. We allocate the transaction price to each distinct performance obligation proportionately based on the estimated standalone selling price for each performance obligation. We then look to how services are transferred to the customer in order to determine the timing of revenue recognition. Most services provided under our agreements result in the transfer of control over time.\nOur revenue consists of subscription services and related usage as well as professional services. We charge clients subscription fees, usually billed on a monthly basis, for access to our VCC solution. The subscription fees are primarily based on the number of agent seats, as well as the specific VCC functionalities and applications deployed by the client. Agent seats are defined as the maximum number of named agents allowed to concurrently access the VCC cloud platform. Clients typically have more named agents than agent seats. Multiple named agents may use an agent seat, though not simultaneously. Substantially all of our clients purchase both subscriptions and related telephony usage. A small percentage of our clients subscribe to our platform but purchase telephony usage directly from a wholesale telecommunications service provider. We do not sell telephony usage on a stand-alone basis to any client. The related usage fees are based on the volume of minutes used for inbound and outbound client interactions. Revenue generated from telephony usage is presented in revenue and cost of sales on a gross basis, as we are the party that controls the service and are responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide the call service by diverting the calls to selected carriers. We also offer bundled plans, generally for smaller deployments, whereby the client is charged a single monthly fixed fee per agent seat that includes both subscription and unlimited usage in the contiguous 48 states and, in some cases, Canada. Professional services revenue is derived primarily from VCC implementations, including application configuration, system integration, optimization, education and training services. Clients are not permitted to take possession of our software.\nWe offer monthly, annual and multiple-year contracts to our clients, generally with 30 days\u2019 notice required for reductions in the number of agent seats. Increases in the number of agent seats can be provisioned almost immediately. Our clients, therefore, are able to adjust the number of agent seats used to meet their changing contact center volume needs. Our larger clients typically choose annual contracts, which generally include an implementation and ramp period of several months. Fixed subscription fees, including bundled plans, are generally billed monthly in advance, while related usage fees are billed in arrears. Support activities include technical assistance for our solution and upgrades and enhancements to our VCC cloud platform on a when-and-if-available basis, which are not billed separately.\nProfessional services are primarily billed on a fixed-fee basis and are performed by us directly or, alternatively, clients may also choose to perform these services themselves or engage their own third-party service providers. Revenue for professional services is recognized over time, as services are performed.\nThe estimation of variable consideration for each performance obligation requires us to make subjective judgments. In the early stages of our larger contracts, in order to allocate the overall transaction fee on a relative stand-alone selling price basis to our multiple performance obligations, we estimate variable consideration to be included in the transaction fee to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. When services are included in the contract with the customer and are not sold at their stand-alone selling price, this requires us to estimate the number of seats the customer will use, especially during the initial ramp period of the contract, during which we bill under an \u2018actual usage\u2019 model for subscription-related services.\nWe recognize revenue on fixed fee professional services performance obligations based on the proportion of labor hours expended compared to the total hours expected to complete the related performance obligation.\nThe revenue recognition standards include guidance relating to any tax assessed by a governmental authority that is directly imposed on a revenue-producing transaction between a seller and a customer and may include, but is not limited to, sales, use, value added and excise taxes. We record USF contributions and other regulatory costs on a gross basis in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss and record surcharges and sales, use and excise taxes billed to our clients on a net basis. The cost of gross USF contributions payable to the USAC and suppliers is presented as a cost of revenue in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\nBusiness Combinations, Goodwill, and Acquisition-Related Intangible Assets\nAccounting for business combinations requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions. We allocate the purchase consideration to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair value at the acquisition dates, with the excess recorded to goodwill. Critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows, expected asset lives, royalty rates, and discount rates. The amounts and useful lives assigned to acquisition-related intangible assets impact the amount and timing of future amortization expense.\nWe use estimates, assumptions, and judgments when performing a goodwill impairment test or assessing the recoverability of acquisition-related finite-lived intangible assets. We test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis in the fourth quarter and more frequently if a significant event or circumstance indicates impairment, and assess the recoverability of acquisition-related intangible assets whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of such assets may not be recoverable. We also evaluate the estimated remaining useful lives of acquisition-related intangible assets for changes in circumstances that warrant a revision to the remaining periods of amortization.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nRefer to Note 1 in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for information related to recent accounting pronouncements.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2020, we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K, such as the use of unconsolidated subsidiaries, structured finance, special purpose entities or variable interest entities.\nContractual Obligations\nCommitments\nOur principal contractual obligations consist of future payment obligations under our convertible senior notes, finance leases to finance data centers and other computer and networking equipment, operating leases for office facilities, and agreements with third parties to provide co-location hosting, telecommunication usage and equipment maintenance services.\nThe following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of December 31, 2020 (in thousands).\nPayment Due by Period\nLess Than More than\nTotal 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years 5 Years\nConvertible senior notes (1)\n$ 806,367 $ - $ 58,867 $ 747,500 $ -\nFinance lease obligations (2)\n628 628 - - -\nOperating lease obligations (3)\n9,800 4,138 4,986 676 -\nOperating lease not yet commenced (3)\n46,387 1,094 8,955 11,965 24,373\nCloud services (4)\n11,400 7,000 4,400 - -\nHosting services (5)\n1,975 792 1,183 - -\nTelecommunication usage (6)\n5,372 3,304 2,017 51 -\nEquipment maintenance (7)\n25 25 - - -\nTotal $ 881,954 $ 16,981 $ 80,408 $ 760,192 $ 24,373\n(1) Represents the outstanding principal balance under our 2025 convertible seniors and our 2023 convertible senior notes.

Obligations under contracts that we can cancel without a significant penalty are not included in the table above.\nIndemnification Agreements\nIn the ordinary course of business, we enter into agreements of varying scope and terms pursuant to which we agree to indemnify clients, vendors, lessors, business partners and other parties with respect to certain matters, including, but not limited to, losses arising out of breach of such agreements, services to be provided by us or from intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties. In addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with our directors, officers and certain employees that will require us, among other things, to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors, officers or employees. Other than as described below, there are no claims that we are aware of that could have a material effect on our consolidated balance sheet, consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss, or consolidated statements of cash flows.\nContingencies - Legal and Regulatory\nWe are subject to certain legal and regulatory proceedings, and from time to time may be involved in a variety of claims, lawsuits, investigations, and proceedings relating to contractual disputes, intellectual property rights, employment matters, regulatory compliance matters, and other litigation matters relating to various claims that arise in the normal course of business. We determine whether an estimated loss from a contingency should be accrued by assessing whether a loss is deemed probable and can be reasonably estimated. We assess our potential liability by analyzing specific litigation and regulatory matters using reasonably available information. We develop our views on estimated losses in consultation with inside and outside counsel, which involves a subjective analysis of potential results and outcomes, assuming various combinations of appropriate litigation and settlement strategies. Legal fees\nare expensed in the period in which they are incurred. See Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for more details.",
    "item_7A": "ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk\nWe are exposed to market risk in the ordinary course of our business. Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates. Our market risk exposure is primarily a result of fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. We do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes.\nInterest Rate Sensitivity\nWe had cash and cash equivalents, and marketable securities (short and long-term) totaling $645.7 million as of December 31, 2020. Cash equivalents and marketable securities were invested primarily in U.S. agency securities, U.S. treasury, municipal bonds, commercial paper, corporate bonds, certificates of deposit and money market funds. Our investment policy is focused on the preservation of capital and supporting our liquidity needs. Under the policy, we invest in highly rated securities, while limiting the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer other than the U.S. government. We do not invest in financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes, nor do we use leveraged financial instruments. We utilize external investment managers who adhere to the guidelines of our investment policy. A hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates would not have a material impact on the value of our cash and cash equivalents or marketable investments.\nAs of December 31, 2020, aggregate principal amount outstanding of our 2025 convertible senior notes and 2023 convertible senior notes was $747.5 million and $58.9 million, respectively. The fair value of the convertible senior notes are subject to interest rate risk, market risk and other factors due to their conversion features. The fair values of the convertible senior notes will generally increase as our common stock price increases and will generally decrease as our common stock price declines. The interest and market value changes affect the fair values of the convertible senior notes but do not impact our financial position, cash flows or results of operations due to the fixed nature of the debt obligations. Additionally, we carry the convertible senior notes at face value less unamortized discount on our consolidated balance sheets, and we present the fair value for required disclosure purposes only.\nOur convertible senior notes bear fixed interest rates, and therefore, are not subject to interest rate risk. We have not utilized derivative financial instruments, derivative commodity instruments or other market risk sensitive instruments, positions or transactions in any material fashion, except for the privately negotiated capped call transactions entered into in May and June 2020 and May 2018 related to the issuance of our 2025 convertible senior notes and our 2023 convertible senior notes, respectively.\nForeign Currency Risk\nThe functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar. Our sales are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars and, therefore, our revenue is not directly subject to foreign currency risk. However, we are indirectly exposed to foreign currency risk. A stronger U.S. dollar could make our solution more expensive in foreign countries and therefore reduce demand. A weaker U.S. dollar could have the opposite effect. Such economic exposure to currency fluctuations is difficult to measure or predict because our sales are influenced by many factors in addition to the impact of currency fluctuations.\nOur operating expenses are generally denominated in the currencies of the countries in which our operations are located, except for Russia where compensation of our employees is primarily denominated in the U.S. dollar. Our consolidated results of operations and cash flows are, therefore, subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and may be adversely affected in the future due to changes in foreign exchange rates. To date, we have not entered into any hedging arrangements with respect to foreign currency risk or other derivative financial instruments. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the effect of a hypothetical 10% change in foreign currency exchange rates applicable to our business would have a maximum impact of $1.8 million on our operating results.",

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\nConsolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss\nConsolidated Statements of Stockholders' Equity\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Stockholders and Board of Directors\nFive9, Inc.:\nOpinions on the Consolidated Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Five9, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, stockholders\u2019 equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). We also have audited the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria, established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2020, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020 based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\nChange in Accounting Principle\nAs discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has changed its method of accounting for leases as of January 1, 2019, due to the adoption of FASB ASC Topic 842, Leases.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company\u2019s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management\u2019s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nEvaluation of the sufficiency of audit evidence over revenues from subscription services and related usage\nAs discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company charges its clients subscription fees, usually billed on a monthly basis, for access to the Company\u2019s Virtual Contact Center (\u201cVCC\u201d) cloud platform. The subscription fees are primarily based on the number of agent seats as well as the specific VCC functionalities and applications deployed by the client. Agent seats are defined as the maximum number of named agents allowed to concurrently access the VCC cloud platform. Substantially all of the Company\u2019s clients purchase both subscriptions and related telephony usage. The related telephony usage fees are generally based on the volume of minutes used for inbound and outbound client interactions. There are high volumes of subscription and related usage transactions processed across multiple information technology (\u201cIT\u201d) systems.\nWe identified the evaluation of the sufficiency of audit evidence over subscription services and related usage as a critical audit matter. Revenues from subscription services and related usage involve a high volume of automated transactions dependent on the Company\u2019s IT systems. Therefore, our audit procedures required the involvement of IT professionals and auditor judgment was required to determine the nature and extent of audit evidence obtained and evaluate the results of the procedures.\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We involved IT professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in evaluating the design and testing the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the Company\u2019s revenue process. This included controls over the capture and flow of subscription and related usage transactional information through the Company\u2019s IT systems. We placed test calls and observed that call attributes such as duration and type of service were captured in the relevant IT systems. On a sample basis, we tested the Company\u2019s monthly client billing activity by comparing the client\u2019s billed agent seats or minutes to the quantities and service type provided as evidenced in the relevant IT systems. For each billing sample tested, we also compared the agent seats, service types and rates for consistency with underlying documentation, including client contracts. We evaluated the sufficiency of audit evidence obtained by assessing the results of procedures performed, including the appropriateness of the nature and extent of such evidence over revenue for subscription services and related usage.\nValuation of acquired technology intangible assets acquired through business combinations\nAs discussed in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements, during the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company consummated two business combinations for total consideration of $188.9 million. The preliminary fair values allocated to the acquired technology assets totaled $40.8 million.\nWe identified the valuation of the preliminary fair values allocated to acquired technology intangible assets as a critical audit matter. We performed sensitivity analyses to determine the significant assumptions used to value the acquired technology intangible assets, individually and in the aggregate. The fair value of these acquired technology intangible assets were sensitive to variation in the key assumptions including forecasted revenue growth rates and technology obsolescence, requiring a high degree of auditor judgment and the use of valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge.\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the Company\u2019s acquisition-date valuation processes, including controls related to the development of the key assumptions related to forecasted revenue growth rates and technology obsolescence. We evaluated the reasonableness of the Company\u2019s forecasted revenue growth rates and technology obsolescence by comparing them to historical actual results of the acquired entities and certain peer and market participant data. We involved valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in:\n\u2022 evaluating certain peer group and market participant data used in the assessment of forecasted revenue growth rates, by assessing the appropriateness of the guideline comparable companies identified by management\u2019s specialist and recalculating certain peer group and market participant data\n\u2022 assessing the reasonableness of the technology obsolescence by comparing to certain public companies.\n/s/ KPMG LLP\nWe have served as the Company\u2019s auditor since 2012.\nSan Francisco, California\nFebruary 26, 2021\nFIVE9, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(In thousands, except per share data)\nDecember 31,\n2020 2019\nASSETS\nCurrent assets:\nCash and cash equivalents $ 220,372 $ 77,976\nMarketable investments 383,171 241,973\nAccounts receivable, net 48,731 37,655\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets 16,149 10,656\nDeferred contract acquisition costs 20,695 13,014\nTotal current assets 689,118 381,274\nProperty and equipment, net 51,213 33,190\nOperating lease right-of-use assets 9,010 8,746\nIntangible assets, net 51,684 15,533\nGoodwill 165,420 11,798\nMarketable investments 42,127 -\nOther assets 3,236 1,184\nDeferred contract acquisition costs - less current portion 51,934 30,655\nTotal assets $ 1,063,742 $ 482,380\nLIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY\nCurrent liabilities:\nAccounts payable $ 17,145 $ 10,156\nAccrued and other current liabilities 44,450 18,385\nOperating lease liabilities 3,912 5,064\nAccrued federal fees 3,745 2,303\nSales tax liabilities 1,714 1,885\nFinance lease liabilities 612 3,518\nDeferred revenue 31,983 24,681\nTotal current liabilities 103,561 65,992\nConvertible senior notes 643,316 209,604\nSales tax liabilities - less current portion 857 838\nOperating lease liabilities - less current portion 5,379 4,329\nFinance lease liabilities - less current portion - 809\nOther long-term liabilities 31,465 4,350\nTotal liabilities 784,578 285,922\nCommitments and contingencies (Note 10)\nStockholders\u2019 equity:\nPreferred stock, $0.001 par value;

Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nFive9, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (the \u201cCompany\u201d) is a provider of cloud software for contact centers. The Company was incorporated in Delaware in 2001 and is headquartered in San Ramon, California. The Company has offices in Europe, Asia and Australia, which primarily provide research, development, sales, marketing, and client support services.\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (\u201cGAAP\u201d) and applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) regarding annual financial reporting. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. The significant estimates made by management affect revenue and related reserves, as well as the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed through business combinations. Management periodically evaluates such estimates and they are adjusted prospectively based upon such periodic evaluation. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nForeign Currency\nThe functional currency of the Company\u2019s foreign subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar. For these subsidiaries, the monetary assets and liabilities are re-measured into U.S. dollars at the current exchange rate as of the balance sheet date, and all non-monetary assets and liabilities are re-measured into U.S. dollars at historical exchange rates. Revenues are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. Expenses are converted using average rates in effect on a monthly basis. Exchange gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions were not significant in any period and are reported in \u201cOther income (expense), net\u201d in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe Company\u2019s cash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase. The Company\u2019s cash equivalents consist of investments in money market funds, U.S. treasury securities, U.S. agency securities and commercial paper.\nMarketable Investments\nThe Company\u2019s marketable investments consist of U.S agency securities and government sponsored securities, U.S. treasury securities, certificates of deposit, municipal bonds, corporate bonds and commercial paper. The Company determines the appropriate classification of its investments in marketable investments at the time of purchase and re-evaluates such designation at each balance sheet date. The Company\u2019s marketable investments have been classified and accounted for as available-for-sale. Marketable investments are carried at fair value.\nConcentration Risks\nFinancial instruments, which potentially subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk, consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, marketable investments and accounts receivable. A significant portion of the Company\u2019s cash and cash equivalents is held at three large reputable financial institutions. Total cash and cash equivalents in excess of insured limits were $218.3 million and $77.6 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts.\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, no single client represented more than 10% of accounts receivable. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, no single client represented more than 10% of revenue.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nThe Company's adoption of ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (\u201cASU 2016-13\u201d), on January 1, 2020 required it to shift from an incurred loss impairment model to an expected credit loss model, which requires it to consider historical loss rates and expectations of forward-looking losses to estimate its allowance for doubtful accounts on its trade accounts receivables, unbilled accounts receivables and contract assets. The adoption of this new standard did not have a material impact on the Company\u2019s financial position, operating results or cash flows.\nThe following table presents the changes in the allowance for doubtful accounts (in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2019 2018\nBalance, beginning of period $ 11 $ 12 $ 33\nAdd: bad debt expense 754 90 90\nLess: write-offs, net of recoveries (638) (91) (111)\nBalance, end of period $ 127 $ 11 $ 12\nProperty and Equipment, Net\nProperty and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization, and is depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows:\nAsset Category Estimated Useful Lives\nComputer and network equipment 3 to 5 years\nComputer software 3 years\nDevelopment costs 1 to 5 years\nFurniture and fixtures 7 years\nLeasehold improvements Shorter of useful life or lease term\nMaintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred, and improvements and betterments are capitalized. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from the consolidated balance sheet and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss in the period realized.\nThe Company evaluates the recoverability of property and equipment for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets or asset groups may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets or asset groups are expected to generate. If such evaluation indicates that the carrying amount of the assets or asset groups is not recoverable, the carrying amount of such assets or asset groups is reduced to fair value. No impairment losses have been recognized in any of the periods presented.\nBusiness Combinations\nThe Company uses its best estimates and assumptions to assign fair value to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date. The Company\u2019s estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. During the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, the Company may record adjustments to the fair value to these tangible and intangible assets and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. In addition, uncertain tax positions and tax-related valuation allowances are initially established in connection with a business combination as of the acquisition date. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the fair value of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to its consolidated statement of operations.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nThe Company records goodwill when the consideration paid in a business combination exceeds the fair value of the net tangible assets and the identified intangible assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized, but instead is required to be tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may exceed its fair value.\nThe Company performs testing for impairment of goodwill in its fourth quarter, or as events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the Company\u2019s single reporting unit below its carrying amount. A qualitative assessment is first made to determine whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test. This initial qualitative assessment includes, among other things, consideration of: (i) market capitalization of the Company; (ii) past, current and projected future earnings and equity; (iii) recent trends and market conditions; and (iv) valuation metrics involving similar companies that are publicly-traded and acquisitions of similar companies, if available. If this initial qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that impairment exists, a second quantitative assessment will be performed, involving a comparison between the estimated fair values of the Company\u2019s single reporting unit with its respective carrying amount including goodwill. If the carrying value exceeds estimated fair value, an impairment charge is recorded for the excess.\nIntangible assets, consisting of acquired developed technology, domain names and customer relationships, are carried at cost less accumulated amortization. All intangible assets have been determined to have definite lives and are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated remaining economic lives, ranging from three to six years. Amortization expense related to developed technology is included in cost of revenue. Amortization expense related to customer relationships is included in sales and marketing expense. Amortization expense related to domain names is included in general and administrative expense. Intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate an asset\u2019s carrying value may not be recoverable.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue is recognized when control of the promised services is transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that the Company expects to receive in exchange for those services. The Company generates all of its revenue from contracts with customers. In contracts with multiple performance obligations, it identifies each performance obligation and evaluates whether the performance obligations are distinct within the context of the contract at contract inception. Performance obligations that are not distinct at contract inception are combined. The Company allocates the transaction price to each distinct performance obligation proportionately based on the estimated standalone selling price for each performance obligation. The Company then looks to how services are transferred to the customer in order to determine the timing of revenue recognition. Most services provided under the Company\u2019s agreements result in the transfer of control over time.\nThe Company\u2019s revenue consists of subscription services and related usage as well as professional services. The Company charges clients subscription fees, usually billed on a monthly basis, for access to the Company\u2019s VCC solution. The subscription fees are primarily based on the number of agent seats, as well as the specific VCC functionalities and applications deployed by the client. Agent seats are defined as the maximum number of named agents allowed to concurrently access the VCC cloud platform. Clients typically have more named agents than agent seats. Multiple named agents may use an agent seat, though not simultaneously. Substantially all of the Company\u2019s clients purchase both subscriptions and related telephony usage. A small percentage of the Company\u2019s clients subscribe to its platform but purchase telephony usage directly from a wholesale telecommunications service provider. The Company does not sell telephony usage on a stand-alone basis to any client. The related usage fees are generally based on the volume of minutes used for inbound and outbound client interactions. Revenue generated\nfrom telephony usage is presented in revenue and cost of sales on a gross basis, as the Company is the party that controls the service and is responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide the call service by diverting the calls to selected carriers. The Company also offers bundled plans, generally for smaller deployments, whereby the client is charged a single monthly fixed fee per agent seat that includes both subscription and unlimited usage in the contiguous 48 states and, in some cases, Canada. Professional services revenue is derived primarily from VCC implementations, including application configuration, system integration, optimization, education and training services. Clients are not permitted to take possession of the Company\u2019s software.\nThe Company offers monthly, annual and multiple-year contracts to its clients, generally with 30 days\u2019 notice required for reductions in the number of agent seats. Increases in the number of agent seats can be provisioned almost immediately. The Company\u2019s clients, therefore, are able to adjust the number of agent seats used to meet their changing contact center needs. The Company\u2019s larger clients typically choose annual contracts, which generally include an implementation and ramp period of several months. Fixed subscription fees, including bundled plans, are generally billed monthly in advance, while related usage fees are billed in arrears. Support activities include technical assistance for the Company\u2019s solution and upgrades and enhancements to the VCC cloud platform on a when-and-if-available basis, which are not billed separately.\nThe Company generally requires advance deposits from its clients based on estimated usage when such usage is not billed as part of a bundled plan. Any unused portion of the deposit is refundable to the client upon termination of the arrangement, provided all amounts due have been paid. All fees, except usage deposits, are non-refundable.\nProfessional services are primarily billed on a fixed-fee basis. Revenue for professional services is recognized over time, as services are performed.\nThe estimation of variable consideration for each performance obligation requires the Company to make subjective judgments resulting in estimated variable consideration that is included in the transaction fee. This is done to the extent that it is probable, in the Company\u2019s judgment, that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized under the contract will not occur. The Company estimates the variable consideration in order to allocate the overall transaction fee on a relative stand-alone selling price basis to its multiple performance obligations. When services are included in the contract with the customer and are not sold at their stand-alone selling price, this requires the Company to estimate the number of seats the customer will use, especially during the initial ramp period of the contract, during which the Company bills under an \u2018actual usage\u2019 model for subscription-related services.\nThe Company recognizes revenue on fixed fee professional services performance obligations based on the proportion of labor hours expended compared to the total hours expected to complete the related performance obligation. The determination of the total labor hours expected to complete the performance obligations involves judgment, which influences the initial stand-alone selling price estimate as well as the timing of professional services revenue recognition, although this is typically resolved in a short time frame.\nWhen a contract with a customer is signed, the Company assesses whether collection of the fees under the arrangement is probable. The Company assesses collection based on a number of factors, including past transaction history and the creditworthiness of the client. The Company maintains a revenue reserve for potential credits to be issued in accordance with service level agreements or for other revenue adjustments.\nDeferred Revenue\nDeferred revenue consists of billings or payments received from clients for subscription service, usage and professional services in advance of revenue recognition and is recognized in accordance with the Company\u2019s revenue recognition policy discussed above. The Company generally invoices its clients monthly in advance for subscription services. Accordingly, the deferred revenue balance does not represent the total contract value of sales arrangements.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue consists primarily of personnel costs, including stock-based compensation, fees that the Company pays to telecommunications providers for usage, USF contributions and other regulatory costs, depreciation and related expenses of the servers and equipment, costs to build out and maintain co-location data centers, costs of public cloud-based data centers, allocated office and facility costs and amortization of acquired technology. Personnel costs include those associated with support of the Company\u2019s solution, clients and data center\noperations, as well as with providing professional services. Data center costs include costs to build out and setup, as well as co-location fees for the right to place the Company\u2019s servers in data centers owned by third parties.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of salary and related expenses, including stock-based compensation, for personnel related to the development of improvements and expanded features for the Company\u2019s services, as well as quality assurance, testing, product management and allocated overhead. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred except for internal use software development costs that qualify for capitalization. The Company reviews development costs incurred for internal-use software in the application development stage and assesses costs for capitalization.\nAdvertising Costs\nThe Company primarily advertises its services through the internet and in conjunction with partners. Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and were $15.6 million, $13.4 million and $12.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nCommissions\nCommissions consist of variable compensation earned by sales personnel and referral fees the Company pays to third parties. The Company defers all incremental commission costs to obtain the contract, and amortizes these costs over a period of benefit determined to be five years. Commission expense was $21.9 million, $15.0 million and $10.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nStock-Based Compensation\nAll stock-based compensation granted to employees and non-employee directors is measured at the grant date fair value of the award. The Company estimates the fair value of stock options and purchase rights under the Company\u2019s Equity Incentive Plans and the 2014 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (\u201c2014 ESPP Plan\u201d), respectively, using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The fair value of restricted stock awards is equal to the fair value of the Company\u2019s common stock on the date of grant. Compensation expense is recognized net of forfeitures using the straight-line method over the service period, which is generally the vesting period.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in operations in the period that includes the enactment date. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount of future tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company recorded a full valuation allowance against the U.S. net deferred tax assets because of its history of operating losses in the United States. However, starting in 2020, the Company recorded net foreign deferred tax liabilities associated with its U.K. and Australia operations totaling $4.4 million, which cannot reduce its U.S. valuation allowance. The Company classifies interest and penalties on unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense.\nComprehensive loss\nComprehensive loss consists of net income (loss), unrealized gains or losses on available-for-sale marketable investments and the effects of foreign currency translation adjustments. The Company presents comprehensive loss as part of the consolidated statements of operations. The changes in the accumulated balances of the components of other comprehensive income (loss) were not material for the periods presented.\nNet Income (Loss) Per Share\nBasic net income (loss) per share is calculated by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period, and excludes any dilutive effects of employee stock-based awards and warrants. Diluted net income (loss) per share is computed giving effect to all potentially dilutive\ncommon shares, including common stock issuable upon exercise of stock options and warrants, vesting of restricted stock units and purchases under the 2014 ESPP Plan. In periods of net loss, all potentially issuable shares of common stock are excluded from the diluted net loss per share computation because they are anti-dilutive. Therefore, basic and diluted net loss per share are the same for all years presented in the Company\u2019s consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\nIndemnification\nThe Company, in the ordinary course of business, enters into agreements of varying scope and terms pursuant to which it agrees to indemnify clients, vendors, lessors, business partners and other parties with respect to certain matters, including, but not limited to, losses arising out of breach of such agreements, including breach of security, services to be provided by the Company or from intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties. To date, the Company has not incurred any material costs as a result of such indemnification provisions and the Company has not accrued any liabilities related to such obligations in the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nSegment Information\nThe Company has determined that its Chief Executive Officer is its chief operating decision maker. The Company\u2019s Chief Executive Officer reviews financial information presented on a consolidated basis for purposes of assessing performance and making decisions on how to allocate resources. Accordingly, the Company has determined that it operates in a single reportable segment.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) and issued subsequent amendments to the initial guidance in 2017, 2018 and 2019 (collectively, \u201cASC 842\u201d). Under the new guidance, a lessee is required to recognize assets and liabilities for both finance, previously known as capital, and operating leases with lease terms of more than 12 months. ASC 842 also requires disclosures to help investors and other financial statement users better understand the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. Lessor accounting remained largely unchanged from previous GAAP. In transition, the Company was required to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the earliest period presented using a modified retrospective approach that included a number of optional practical expedients that the Company elected to apply. The Company adopted ASC 842 using the modified retrospective method on January 1, 2019. The Company elected the available practical expedients, implemented internal controls, and a lease accounting system to enable the preparation of financial information upon adoption. The adoption of ASC 842 resulted in the recognition of operating lease liabilities of $8.4 million and operating lease right-of-use (\u201cROU\u201d) assets of the same amount. Existing deferred rent of $0.6 million was recorded as an offset to ROU assets, resulting in net ROU assets of $7.8 million. The Company\u2019s accounting for finance leases remained substantially unchanged. The adoption of ASC 842 did not have any impact on the Company's operating results or cash flows.\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-15, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other-Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer\u2019s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That Is a Service Contract (\u201cASU 2018-15\u201d), which clarifies the accounting for implementation costs in cloud computing arrangements. The Company early adopted ASU 2018-15 prospectively on January 1, 2019 to align the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the requirements for capitalization costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software and hosting arrangements that include an internal-use software license. The adoption of ASU 2018-15 did not have a material impact on the Company\u2019s financial position and results of operations.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (\u201cASU 2016-13\u201d), which requires measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for financial assets held at amortized cost, including trade receivables. ASU 2016-13 replaces the existing incurred loss impairment model with an expected loss model that requires the forward-looking information to calculate credit loss estimates. It also eliminates the concept of other-than-temporary impairment and requires credit losses related to available-for-sale debt securities to be recorded through an allowance for credit losses rather than as a reduction in the amortized cost basis of the securities. These changes will result in more timely recognition of credit losses. The Company adopted ASU 2016-13 using the modified retrospective method on January 1, 2020. The adoption of ASU 2016-13 did not have a material impact on the\nCompany\u2019s consolidated financial position, operating results or cash flows. See Notes 1 for further information on the impact of this adoption.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Effective\nIn August 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-06, Debt-Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging-Contracts in Entity\u2019s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity\u2019s Own Equity (\"ASU 2020-06\"), which simplifies the accounting for convertible instruments by removing the separation models for (1) convertible debt with a cash conversion feature and (2) convertible instruments with a beneficial conversion feature. As a result, a convertible debt instrument will be accounted for as a single liability measured at its amortized cost. These changes will reduce reported interest expense and increase reported net income for entities that have issued a convertible instrument that was bifurcated according to previously existing rules. ASU 2020-06 also requires the application of the if-converted method for calculating diluted earnings per share and the treasury stock method will be no longer available. This standard will be effective for the Company\u2019s fiscal years beginning in the first quarter of 2022, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of ASU 2020-06 will have on its consolidated financial statements.\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes (\u201cASU 2019-12\u201d), which amends its guidance to simplify the accounting for income taxes by, among other provisions, removing exceptions to certain general principles in Topic 740, Income Taxes. The standard will be effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of 2021, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of ASU 2019-12 will have on its consolidated financial statements.\nThere are several other new accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB, which the Company will adopt. However, the Company does not believe any of those accounting pronouncements will have a material impact on its consolidated financial position, operating results or statements of cash flows.\n2. Revenue\nContract Balances\nThe following table provides information about accounts receivable, net, deferred contract acquisition costs, contract assets and contract liabilities from contracts with customers (in thousands):\nDecember 31, 2020 December 31, 2019\nAccounts receivable, net $ 48,731 $ 37,655\nDeferred contract acquisition costs:\nCurrent $ 20,695 $ 13,014\nNon-current 51,934 30,655\nTotal deferred contract acquisition costs $ 72,629 $ 43,669\nContract assets and contract liabilities:\nContract assets (included in prepaid expenses and other current assets) $ 1,297 $ 825\nContract liabilities (deferred revenue) 31,983 24,681\nContract liabilities (deferred revenue) (included in other long term liabilities) 3,373 1,550\nNet contract assets (liabilities) $ (34,059) $ (25,406)\nThe Company receives payments from customers based upon billing cycles. Invoice payment terms are usually 30 days or less. Accounts receivable are recorded when the right to consideration becomes unconditional.\nDeferred contract acquisition costs are recorded when incurred and are amortized over a customer benefit period of five years.\nThe Company\u2019s contract assets consist of unbilled amounts typically resulting from professional services revenue recognition when it exceeds the total amounts billed to the customer. The Company\u2019s contract liabilities consist of advance payments and billings in excess of revenue recognized.\nIn the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recognized revenue of $23.1 million related to its contract liabilities at December 31, 2019.\nRemaining Performance Obligations\nAs of December 31, 2020, the aggregate amount of the total transaction price allocated in contracts with original duration of greater than one year to the remaining performance obligations was $330.0 million. The Company expects to recognize revenue on approximately three-fourths of the remaining performance obligation over the next 24 months, with the balance recognized thereafter. The Company has elected the optional exemption, which allows for the exclusion of the amounts for remaining performance obligations that are part of contracts with an original expected duration of one year or less. Such remaining performance obligations represent unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied performance obligations pursuant to ASC 606.\n3. Investments and Fair Value Measurements\nMarketable Investments\nThe Company\u2019s marketable investments have been classified and accounted for as available-for-sale. The Company\u2019s marketable investments as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 were as follows (in thousands):\nDecember 31, 2020\nShort-Term Marketable Investments Cost Gross Unrealized Gains Gross Unrealized Losses Fair Value\nCertificates of deposit $ 3,479 $ 1 $ - $ 3,480\nU.S. treasury 287,315 41 (4) 287,352\nU.S. agency securities 67,227 12 (6) 67,233\nCommercial paper 5,093 - - 5,093\nMunicipal bonds 2,684 1 (1) 2,684\nCorporate bonds 17,323 6 - 17,329\nTotal $ 383,121 $ 61 $ (11) $ 383,171\nDecember 31, 2020\nLong-term Marketable Investments Cost Gross Unrealized Gains Gross Unrealized Losses Fair Value\nU.S. treasury $ 10,189 $ - $ - $ 10,189\nU.S. agency securities 31,469 9 (1) 31,477\nMunicipal bonds 461 - - 461\nTotal $ 42,119 $ 9 $ (1) $ 42,127\nDecember 31, 2019\nShort-Term Marketable Investments Cost Gross Unrealized Gains Gross Unrealized Losses Fair Value\nCertificates of deposit $ 161 $ 1 $ - $ 162\nU.S. treasury 31,933 8 (1) 31,940\nU.S. agency securities 177,629 110 (9) 177,730\nCommercial paper 15,240 - - 15,240\nMunicipal bonds 3,014 1 - 3,015\nCorporate bonds 13,876 10 - 13,886\nTotal $ 241,853 $ 130 $ (10) $ 241,973\nThe following table presents the gross unrealized losses and the fair value for those marketable investments that were in an unrealized loss position for less than 12 months as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 (in thousands):\nDecember 31, 2020 December 31, 2019\nGross Unrealized Losses Fair Value Gross Unrealized Losses Fair Value\nU.S. treasury $ (4) $ 78,549 $ (1) $ 12,926\nU.S. agency securities (7) 39,443 (9) 36,322\nMunicipal bonds (1) 1,201 - -\nCorporate bonds (1) 1,347 - 251\nTotal $ (13) $ 120,540 $ (10) $ 49,499\nAlthough the Company had certain available-for-sale debt securities in an unrealized loss position as of December 31, 2020, no impairment loss was recorded since it did not intend to sell them, did not anticipate a need to sell them, and the decline in fair value was not due to any credit-related factors, which it is now required to assess upon adoption of ASU 2016-13.\nThe amortized cost and fair value of the Company\u2019s marketable investments by contractual maturity as of December 31, 2020 were as follows:\nCost Fair Value\nDue within one year $ 383,121 $ 383,171\nDue after one year through two years 42,119 42,127\nTotal $ 425,240 $ 425,298\nFair Value Measurements\nThe Company carries cash equivalents and marketable investments at fair value. Fair value is based on the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value is estimated by applying the following hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three levels and bases the categorization within the hierarchy upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement:\nLevel 1 - Observable inputs, which include unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\nLevel 2 - Observable inputs other than Level 1 inputs, such as quoted prices in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.\nLevel 3 - Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are based on management\u2019s assumptions, including fair value measurements determined by using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques.\nThe Company determined the fair value of its Level 1 financial instruments, which are traded in active markets, using quoted market prices for identical instruments.\nMarketable investments classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy are valued based on other observable inputs, including broker or dealer quotations or alternative pricing sources. When quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities are not available, the Company relies on non-binding quotes from its investment managers, which are based on proprietary valuation models of independent pricing services. These models generally use inputs such as observable market data, quoted market prices for similar instruments, historical pricing trends of a security as relative to its peers. To validate the fair value determination provided by its investment managers, the Company reviews the pricing movement in the context of overall market trends and trading information from its investment managers. The Company performs routine procedures such as comparing prices obtained from independent source to ensure that appropriate fair values are recorded.\nThe following table sets forth the Company\u2019s assets measured at fair value by level within the fair value hierarchy (in thousands):\nDecember 31, 2020\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nAssets\nCash equivalents\nMoney market funds $ 89,888 $ - $ - $ 89,888\nU.S. treasury 39,997 - - 39,997\nTotal cash equivalents $ 129,885 $ - $ - $ 129,885\nMarketable investments (Short and Long-term)\nCertificates of deposit $ - $ 3,480 $ - $ 3,480\nU.S. Treasury 297,540 - - 297,540\nU.S. agency securities - 98,711 - 98,711\nCommercial paper - 5,093 - 5,093\nMunicipal bonds - 3,145 - 3,145\nCorporate bonds - 17,329 - 17,329\nTotal marketable investments $ 297,540 $ 127,758 $ - $ 425,298\nLiabilities\nContingent consideration $ - $ 18,100 $ 18,100\nDecember 31, 2019\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nAssets\nCash equivalents\nMoney market funds $ 2,179 $ - $ - $ 2,179\nCommercial paper - 2,697 - 2,697\nTotal cash equivalents $ 2,179 $ 2,697 $ - $ 4,876\nMarketable investments\nCertificates of deposit $ - $ 162 $ - $ 162\nU.S. Treasury 31,940 - - 31,940\nU.S. agency securities - 177,730 - 177,730\nCommercial paper - 15,240 - 15,240\nMunicipal bonds - 3,015 - 3,015\nCorporate bonds - 13,886 - 13,886\nTotal marketable investments $ 31,940 $ 210,033 $ - $ 241,973\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the estimated fair value of the Company\u2019s outstanding 0.125% convertible senior notes due 2023 (the \u201c2023 convertible senior notes\u201d) was $253.1 million and $437.0 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, the estimated fair value of the Company's outstanding 0.500% convertible senior notes due 2025 (the \"2025 convertible senior notes\" and, together with the 2023 convertible senior notes, the \"convertible senior notes\") was $1,098.5 million. The fair values were determined based on the quoted price of the convertible senior notes in an inactive market on the last trading day of the reporting period and have been classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. See Note 6 for further information on the Company\u2019s convertible senior notes.\nAs part of the agreement to acquire Inference in November 2020, the Company may be obligated to pay contingent earn out consideration of up to $24.0 million based upon achievement of certain milestones and relative thresholds during the earn out measurement period which ends on December 31, 2021. The fair value of the contingent consideration arrangement, estimated to be $18.1 million as of December 31, 2020, is classified within\nLevel 3 and is determined using a probability-based scenario analysis approach. The resulting probability-weighted contingent consideration amounts were discounted based on the Company\u2019s estimated cost of debt. Future changes in the achievement of certain milestones and relative thresholds could result in a material change to the amount of contingent consideration accrued, and such changes will be recorded in the Company's consolidated statements of operations.\nThere were no assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nThe Company\u2019s other financial instruments\u2019 fair value, including accounts receivable, accounts payable and other current liabilities, approximate its carrying value due to the relatively short maturity of those instruments. The carrying amounts of the Company\u2019s finance leases approximate their fair value, which is the present value of expected future cash payments based on assumptions about current interest rates and the creditworthiness of the Company.\n4.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets\nGoodwill\nGoodwill was recorded as a result of the Company\u2019s acquisition of Face It, Corp., which the Company also refers to as SoCoCare, in October 2013, Virtual Observer in April 2020, and Inference in November 2020. See Note 14 for further details of the Virtual Observer and Inference acquisitions.\nThe following table summarizes the activity in the Company's goodwill balances during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020 (in thousands):\nGoodwill\nBeginning of the period, January 1, 2019 $ 11,798\nAddition -\nEnd of the period, December 31, 2019 11,798\nAddition (Inference) 130,976\nAddition (Virtual Observer) 22,646\nEnd of the period, December 31, 2020 $ 165,420\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company completed its annual goodwill impairment test. Based on its assessment of the qualitative factors, the Company\u2019s management concluded that the fair value of the Company\u2019s goodwill was more likely than not greater than its carrying amount as of December 31, 2020. As such, it was not necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test. Subsequent to the 2020 annual impairment test, the Company believes there have been no significant events or circumstances negatively affecting the valuation of goodwill. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, there was no impairment to the carrying value of the Company\u2019s goodwill.\nIntangible Assets\nIntangible assets were acquired in connection with the Company\u2019s acquisitions of SoCoCare in October 2013, Whendu in November 2019, Virtual Observer in April 2020, and Inference in November 2020. See Note 14 for further details of the Whendu, Virtual Observer, and Inference acquisitions.\nThe following table summarizes the activity in the Company's intangible asset balances during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020 (in thousands):\nIntangible Assets\nBeginning of the period, January 1, 2019 $ 631\nAddition (Whendu) 15,784\nAmortization (882)\nEnd of the period, December 31, 2019 15,533\nAddition (Inference) 30,100\nAddition (Virtual Observer) 12,800\nAddition (Whendu) 100\nAmortization (6,849)\nEnd of the period, December 31, 2020 $ 51,684\nThe components of intangible assets were as follows (in thousands):\nDecember 31, 2020 December 31, 2019\nGross Carrying Amount Accumulated\nAmortization Net\nCarrying\nAmount Weighted Average Remaining Amortization Period (Years) Gross\nCarrying Amount Accumulated\nAmortization Net\nCarrying\nAmount Weighted Average Remaining Amortization Period (Years)\nDeveloped technology $ 56,214 $ (6,761) $ 49,453 4.9 $ 17,777 $ (2,690) $ 15,087 3.9\nAcquired workforce 470 (177) 293 1.9 467 (21) 446 2.9\nCustomer relationships 1,600 (101) 1,499 4.7 - - -\nTrademarks 500 (61) 439 1.8 - - -\nTotal $ 58,784 $ (7,100) $ 51,684 4.9 $ 18,244 $ (2,711) $ 15,533 3.8\nAmortization expense related to intangible assets was $6.8 million, $0.9 million and $0.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The increase in amortization expense during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2020 was due to the acquisition of intangible assets from Inference in November 2020, Virtual Observer in April 2020 and Whendu in November 2019.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the expected future amortization expense for intangible assets was as follows (in thousands):\nPeriod Expected Future\nAmortization Expense\n2021 $ 11,787\n2022 11,704\n2023 10,870\n2024 7,527\n2025 5,596\nThereafter 4,200\nTotal $ 51,684\nIntangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate an asset\u2019s carrying value may not be recoverable. The Company concluded that there was no impairment to the carrying value of its intangible assets as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.\n6. Debt\n0.500% Convertible Senior Notes and Related Capped Call Transactions\nIn May and June 2020, the Company issued $747.5 million aggregate principal amount of 2025 convertible senior notes in a private offering, which aggregate principal amount included the exercise in full of the initial purchasers\u2019 option to purchase up to an additional $97.5 million principal amount of the 2025 convertible senior notes. The 2025 convertible senior notes mature on June 1, 2025 and bear interest at a fixed rate of 0.500% per annum, payable semiannually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year, beginning on December 1, 2020. The total net proceeds from the issuance of the 2025 convertible senior notes, after deducting initial purchasers' discounts and commissions and estimated debt issuance costs, were approximately $728.8 million.\nEach $1,000 principal amount of the 2025 convertible senior notes is initially convertible into 7.4437 shares of the Company\u2019s common stock (the \u201c2025 Conversion Option\u201d), which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $134.34 per share of common stock, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events. The initial conversion price represents a premium of approximately 30% to the $103.34 per share closing price of the Company\u2019s common stock on The Nasdaq Global Market on May 21, 2020. The 2025 convertible senior notes are convertible, in multiples of $1,000 principal amount, at the option of the holders prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding March 1, 2025, only under the following circumstances: (1) during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending on September 30, 2020 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price of the Company\u2019s common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price on each applicable trading day; (2) during the five business day period after any five consecutive trading day period (the \u201c2025 Measurement Period\u201d) in which the trading price (as defined in the 2025 Indenture governing the 2025 convertible senior notes) per $1,000 principal amount of the 2025 convertible senior notes for each trading day of the 2025 Measurement Period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of the Company\u2019s common stock and the conversion rate in effect on each such trading day; (3) if the Company calls any or all of the 2025 convertible senior notes for redemption, at any time prior to the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the redemption date; or (4) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events. On or after March 1, 2025 until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders may convert all or any portion of their 2025 convertible senior notes, in multiples of $1,000 principal amount, at the option of the holder regardless of the foregoing circumstances.\nUpon conversion, the Company will pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of the Company\u2019s common stock or a combination of cash and shares of the Company\u2019s common stock, at the Company\u2019s election. If the Company undergoes a fundamental change (as defined in the indenture governing the 2025 convertible senior notes), subject to certain conditions, holders may require the Company to repurchase for cash all or any portion of\ntheir 2025 convertible senior notes, in principal amounts of $1,000 or a multiple thereof, at a fundamental change repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2025 convertible senior notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date. In addition, following certain corporate events or if the Company issues a notice of redemption, it will, under certain circumstances, increase the conversion rate for holders who elect to convert their notes in connection with such corporate event or during the relevant redemption period.\nThe closing market price of the Company's common stock of $174.40 per share as of December 31, 2020, the last trading day during the three months ended December 31, 2020, was below $174.64 per share, which represents 130% of the initial conversion price of $134.34 per share. Additionally, the last reported sale price of the Company\u2019s common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last trading day, December 31, 2020, was not greater than or equal to 130% of the initial conversion price. As such, during the three months ended December 31, 2020, the conditions allowing holders of the 2025 convertible senior notes to convert were not met. The 2025 convertible senior notes are therefore not convertible during the three months ended March 31, 2021.\nThe Company may not redeem the 2025 convertible senior notes prior to June 6, 2023. The Company may redeem for cash all or any portion of the 2025 convertible senior notes, at its option, on or after June 6, 2023 and prior to March 1, 2025 if the last reported sale price of its common stock has been at least 130% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any 30 consecutive trading day period (including the last trading day of such period) ending not more than two trading days immediately preceding the date on which the Company provides notice of redemption at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2025 convertible senior notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date. No sinking fund is provided for the 2025 convertible senior notes.\nThe 2025 convertible senior notes are the Company\u2019s senior unsecured obligations and rank senior in right of payment to any of the Company\u2019s indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the 2025 convertible senior notes; equal in right of payment to any of the Company\u2019s unsecured indebtedness that is not so subordinated (including the 2023 convertible senior notes); effectively junior in right of payment to any of the Company\u2019s secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and structurally junior to all indebtedness and other liabilities (including trade payables) of the Company\u2019s subsidiaries.\nIn accounting for the issuance of the 2025 convertible senior notes, the 2025 convertible senior notes were separated into liability and equity components. The carrying amount of the liability component was calculated by measuring the fair value of a similar debt instrument that does not have an associated conversion feature. The carrying amount of the equity component representing the 2025 Conversion Option was $158.3 million and was determined by deducting the fair value of the liability component from the par value of the 2025 convertible senior notes. The equity component was recorded in additional paid-in-capital and is not re-measured as long as it continues to meet the conditions for equity classification. The excess of the principal amount of the liability component over its carrying amount (the \u201cDebt Discount\u201d) is being amortized to interest expense over the contractual term of the notes at an effective interest rate of 5.76%. The debt component was classified as long term liabilities during the three months ended December 31, 2020.\nIn accounting for the debt issuance costs of $18.7 million related to the 2025 convertible senior notes, the Company allocated the total amount incurred to the liability and equity components of the 2025 convertible senior notes based on their relative values. Issuance costs attributable to the liability component were $14.7 million and are being amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the contractual term of the 2025 convertible senior notes. Issuance costs attributable to the equity component were netted with the equity component in additional paid-in-capital.\nThe net carrying amount of the liability component of the 2025 convertible senior notes was as follows (in thousands):\nDecember 31, 2020\nPrincipal $ 747,500\nUnamortized debt discount (141,792)\nUnamortized issuance costs (13,192)\nNet carrying amount $ 592,516\nThe net carrying amount of the equity component of the 2025 convertible senior notes was as follows (in thousands):\nDecember 31, 2020\nEquity component $ 158,321\nIssuance costs (3,958)\nNet carrying amount $ 154,363\nInterest expense related to the 2025 convertible senior notes was as follows (in thousands):\nYear Ended\nDecember 31, 2020\nContractual interest expense $ 2,230\nAmortization of debt discount 16,528\nAmortization of issuance costs 1,538\nTotal interest expense $ 20,296\nIn connection with the issuance of the 2025 convertible senior notes, the Company entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions (the \u201c2025 Capped Call Transactions\u201d) with certain financial institutions. The 2025 Capped Call Transactions are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution to the Company\u2019s common stock in connection with any conversion of the 2025 convertible senior notes and/or offset any cash payments the Company is required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted 2025 convertible senior notes, as the case may be, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap based on the cap price. The initial cap price of the 2025 Capped Call Transactions was $206.68 per share, and is subject to certain adjustments under the terms of the 2025 Capped Call Transactions. The 2025 Capped Call Transactions cover, subject to anti-dilution adjustments, approximately 5.6 million shares of the Company\u2019s common stock. For accounting purposes, the 2025 Capped Call Transactions are separate transactions, and not integrated with the issuance of the 2025 convertible senior notes. As these transactions meet certain accounting criteria, the 2025 Capped Call Transactions are recorded in stockholders\u2019 equity and are not accounted for as derivatives. The cost to the Company of the 2025 Capped Call Transactions was $90.5 million, which was recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital.\nThe net impact to the Company's stockholders' equity as of December 31, 2020, included in additional paid-in capital, relating to the issuance of the 2025 convertible senior notes was as follows (in thousands):\nDecember 31, 2020\nConversion option $ 158,321\nPayments for capped call transactions (90,448)\nIssuance costs (3,958)\nTotal $ 63,915\nMaturity of the Company\u2019s 2025 convertible senior notes as of December 31, 2020 was as follows (in thousands):\nPeriod Amount to Mature\n2025 (Maturity date of June 1, 2025) $ 747,500\nTotal $ 747,500\n0.125% Convertible Senior Notes and Related Capped Call Transactions\nIn May 2018, the Company issued $258.8 million aggregate principal amount of 2023 convertible senior notes in a private offering. The 2023 convertible senior notes mature on May 1, 2023 and bear interest at a fixed rate of 0.125% per annum, payable semiannually in arrears on May 1 and November 1 of each year. The total net proceeds from the offering, after deducting initial purchasers' discounts and commissions and estimated debt issuance costs, was approximately $250.8 million.\nIn May 2020, the Company used part of the net proceeds from the issuance of the 2025 convertible senior notes to repurchase, exchange or otherwise retire approximately $181.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 2023 convertible senior notes in privately-negotiated transactions for aggregate consideration of $449.6 million, consisting of $181.0 million in cash and 2,723,581 shares of the Company\u2019s common stock (the \"2023 Note Repurchase Transactions\").\nAs of December 31, 2020, after giving effect to the 2023 Note Repurchase Transactions and other settlements upon conversion requests, approximately $58.9 million aggregate principal amount of 2023 convertible senior notes remained outstanding.\nThe 2023 Note Repurchase Transactions were accounted for as a debt extinguishment. Pursuant to ASC Subtopic 470-20, total consideration for the 2023 Note Repurchase Transactions was separated into liability and equity components by estimating the fair value of a similar liability without a conversion option and assigning the residual value to the equity component. The gain or loss on extinguishment of the debt was subsequently determined by comparing the repurchase consideration allocated to the liability component to the sum of the carrying value of the liability component, net of the proportionate amounts of unamortized debt discount and the remaining unamortized debt issuance costs. Of the $449.6 million in aggregate consideration paid by the Company in connection with the 2023 Note Repurchase Transactions, $155.8 million and $293.8 million were allocated to the debt and equity components, respectively, using an effective interest rate of 5.32% to determine the fair value of the liability component. This interest rate was based on the income and market-based approaches used to determine the effective interest rate of the 2023 convertible senior notes, adjusted for the remaining term of the 2023 convertible senior notes. As of the settlement of the 2023 Note Repurchase Transactions, the carrying value of the 2023 convertible senior notes subject to the 2023 Note Repurchase Transactions, net of unamortized debt discount and issuance costs, was $150.4 million. The Company also incurred approximately $0.5 million in third party transaction costs related to the 2023 Note Repurchase Transactions. These costs were allocated to the liability and equity components in proportion to the allocation of consideration transferred at settlement and accounted for as debt extinguishment costs and equity reacquisition costs, respectively. The 2023 Note Repurchase Transactions resulted in a $5.8 million loss on early debt extinguishment in the second quarter of fiscal 2020, of which $2.7 million consisted of unamortized debt issuance costs.\nEach $1,000 principal amount of the 2023 convertible senior notes was initially convertible into 24.4978 shares of the Company\u2019s common stock (the \u201c2023 Conversion Option\u201d), which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $40.82 per share of common stock, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events. The 2023 convertible senior notes are convertible, in multiples of $1,000 principal amount, at the option of the holders at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding November 1, 2022, only under the following circumstances: (1) during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ended on September 30, 2018 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price of the Company\u2019s common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price on each applicable trading day; (2) during the five business day period after any five consecutive trading day period (the \u201c2023 Measurement Period\u201d) in which the trading price (as defined in the indenture governing the 2023 convertible senior notes) per $1,000 principal amount of the 2023 convertible senior notes for each trading day of the 2023 Measurement Period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of the Company\u2019s common stock and the conversion rate in effect on each such trading day; (3) if the Company calls any or all of the 2023 convertible senior notes for redemption, at any time prior to the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the redemption date; or (4) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events. On or after November 1, 2022 until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders may convert all or any portion of their 2023 convertible senior notes, in multiples of $1,000 principal amount, at the option of the holder regardless of the foregoing circumstances.\nUpon conversion, the Company will pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of the Company\u2019s common stock or a combination of cash and shares of the Company\u2019s common stock, at the Company\u2019s election. If\nthe Company undergoes a fundamental change (as defined in the indenture governing the 2023 convertible senior notes), subject to certain conditions, holders may require the Company to repurchase for cash all or any portion of their 2023 convertible senior notes, in principal amounts of $1,000 or a multiple thereof, at a fundamental change repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2023 convertible senior notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date. In addition, following certain corporate events that occur prior to the maturity date or if the Company issues a notice of redemption, it will, under certain circumstances, increase the conversion rate for holders who elect to convert their 2023 convertible senior notes in connection with such corporate event or during the relevant redemption period.\nDuring each of the quarters from the third quarter of 2019 through the fourth quarter of 2020, one of the triggers for convertibility of the 2023 convertible senior notes was triggered as the last reported sale price of the Company\u2019s common stock was greater than $53.07 per share, which represents 130% of the initial conversion price of $40.82 per share, for at least 20 trading days in the period of 30 consecutive trading days ended on, and including, the last trading day of the quarter for each quarter of 2020. As a result, the 2023 convertible senior notes were convertible, in multiples of $1,000 principal amount, at the option of the 2023 convertible senior note holders between October 1, 2019 to December 31, 2020, and are currently convertible between January 1, 2021 to March 31, 2021. Whether the 2023 convertible senior notes will be convertible after March 31, 2021 will depend on the continued satisfaction of this condition or other conversion conditions in the future. To date, the Company has paid $18.9 million in cash and issued 307,037 shares of its common stock to settle $18.9 million aggregate principal amount of its 2023 convertible senior notes that resulted in a $1.2 million loss on early debt extinguishment. During 2020, the Company also received 15,714 shares from the partial unwind of capped calls resulting from the settlement of its 2023 convertible senior notes. The receipt of the 15,714 shares reduced the number of shares outstanding, thus was recorded to treasury stock based on an aggregate fair value of $2.3 million at the time of the settlements. In addition, on or prior to December 31, 2020, the Company received elections to convert $7.8 million aggregate principal amount of its 2023 convertible senior notes that remained unsettled as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2020. From January 1, 2021 through the date of this filing, the Company received additional elections to convert aggregate principal amount of $5.8 million of the 2023 convertible senior notes. The Company has settled, or expects to settle, these conversions in cash or a combination of cash and shares during the first half of 2021. The Company has the option to settle any future election conversion notices in cash, shares, or a combination of cash and shares.\nThe Company may not redeem the 2023 convertible senior notes prior to May 5, 2021. The Company may redeem for cash all or any portion of the 2023 convertible senior notes, at its option, on or after May 5, 2021 if the last reported sale price of its common stock has been at least 130% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any 30 consecutive trading day period (including the last trading day of such period) ending not more than two trading days immediately preceding the date on which the Company provides notice of redemption at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2023 convertible senior notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date. No sinking fund is provided for the 2023 convertible senior notes.\nThe 2023 convertible senior notes are the Company\u2019s senior unsecured obligations and rank senior in right of payment to any of the Company\u2019s indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the 2023 convertible senior notes; equal in right of payment to any of the Company\u2019s unsecured indebtedness that is not so subordinated (including the 2025 convertible senior notes); effectively junior in right of payment to any of the Company\u2019s secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and structurally junior to all indebtedness and other liabilities (including trade payables) of the Company\u2019s subsidiaries.\nIn accounting for the issuance of the 2023 convertible senior notes, the 2023 convertible senior notes were separated into liability and equity components. The carrying amount of the liability component was calculated by measuring the fair value of a similar debt instrument that does not have an associated conversion feature. The carrying amount of the equity component representing the conversion option was $63.8 million and was determined by deducting the fair value of the liability component from the par value of the 2023 convertible senior notes. The equity component was recorded in additional paid-in-capital and is not re-measured as long as it continues to meet the conditions for equity classification. The Debt Discount is being amortized to interest expense over the contractual term of the 2023 convertible senior notes at an effective interest rate of 6.39%.\nIn accounting for the debt issuance costs of $8.0 million related to the 2023 convertible senior notes, the Company allocated the total amount incurred to the liability and equity components of the 2023 convertible senior notes based on their relative values. Issuance costs attributable to the liability component were $6.0 million and are\nbeing amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the contractual term of the 2023 convertible senior notes. Issuance costs attributable to the equity component were netted with the equity component in additional paid-in-capital.\nThe net carrying amount of the liability component of the 2023 convertible senior notes was as follows (in thousands):\nDecember 31, 2020 December 31, 2019\nPrincipal $ 58,867 $ 258,750\nUnamortized debt discount (7,367) (44,881)\nUnamortized issuance costs (700) (4,265)\nNet carrying amount $ 50,800 $ 209,604\nThe net carrying amount of the equity component of the 2023 convertible senior notes continued to meet the conditions for equity classification as presented below (in thousands):\nDecember 31, 2020 December 31, 2019\nEquity component $ 14,505 $ 63,756\nIssuance costs (455) (1,998)\nNet carrying amount $ 14,050 $ 61,758\nInterest expense related to the 2023 convertible senior notes was as follows (in thousands):\nYear Ended\nDecember 31, 2020 December 31, 2019 December 31, 2018\nContractual interest expense $ 184 $ 324 $ 209\nAmortization of debt discount 7,006 11,683 7,192\nAmortization of issuance costs 666 1,105 689\nTotal interest expense $ 7,856 $ 13,112 $ 8,090\nIn connection with the issuance of the 2023 convertible senior notes, the Company entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions (the \u201c2023 Capped Call Transactions\u201d) with certain financial institutions. The 2023 Capped Call Transactions are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution to the Company\u2019s common stock upon any conversion of the 2023 convertible senior notes and/or offset any cash payments the Company is required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted 2023 convertible senior notes, as the case may be, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap based on the cap price. The initial cap price of the 2023 Capped Call Transactions is $62.80 per share, and is subject to certain adjustments under the terms of the 2023 Capped Call Transactions. The 2023 Capped Call Transactions cover, subject to anti-dilution adjustments, approximately 6.3 million shares of the Company\u2019s common stock. For accounting purposes, the 2023 Capped Call Transactions are separate transactions, and not integrated with the issuance of the 2023 convertible senior notes. As these transactions meet certain accounting criteria, the 2023 Capped Call Transactions are recorded in stockholders\u2019 equity and are not accounted for as derivatives. The cost of $31.4 million incurred in connection with the 2023 Capped Call Transactions was recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital.\nIn connection with the 2023 Note Repurchase Transactions, the Company amended the 2023 Capped Call Transactions such that the portion associated with the 2023 convertible senior notes subject to the 2023 Note Repurchase Transactions would remain outstanding notwithstanding the retirement of $181.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2023 convertible senior notes. Following such amendment, the 2023 Capped Call Transactions continue to meet the accounting criteria to be recorded in stockholders\u2019 equity and are not accounted for as derivatives.\nThe net impact to the Company\u2019s stockholders\u2019 equity, included in additional paid-in capital, relating to the issuance of the 2023 convertible senior notes issued in May 2018 was as follows (in thousands):\nDecember 31, 2018\nConversion option $ 63,756\nPayments for capped call transactions (31,412)\nIssuance costs (1,998)\nTotal $ 30,346\nMaturity of the Company\u2019s 2023 convertible senior notes as of December 31, 2020 was as follows (in thousands):\nPeriod Amount to Mature\n2023 $ 58,867\nTotal $ 58,867\n7. Stockholders\u2019 Equity\nCapital Structure\nCommon Stock\nThe Company is authorized to issue 450,000,000 shares of common stock with a par value of $0.001 per share. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company had 66,496,060 and 61,543,634 shares of common stock issued and outstanding, respectively.\nDuring 2020, the Company issued 3,030,618 shares of common stock in connection with 2023 convertible senior note settlements. During 2020, the Company also received 15,714 shares from the partial unwind of capped calls resulting from the settlement of its 2023 convertible senior notes. The receipt of the 15,714 shares reduced the number of shares outstanding, thus was recorded to treasury stock based on an aggregate fair value of $2.3 million at the time of the settlements. See Note 6 for further details.\nHolders of the Company\u2019s common stock are entitled to dividends, if and when declared by the board of directors. In the event of liquidation, dissolution or winding up, subject to the rights of the holders of any then outstanding shares of preferred stock, holders of common stock will be entitled to receive the assets and funds of the Company that are legally available for distribution.\nPreferred Stock\nThe Company is authorized to designate and issue up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock with a par value of $0.001 per share in one or more series without stockholder approval and to fix the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions thereof. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, there were no shares of preferred stock issued and outstanding.\nCommon Stock Reserved for Future Issuance\nShares of common stock reserved for future issuance related to outstanding equity awards and employee equity incentive plans as of December 31, 2020, were as follows (in thousands):\nCommon Stock Reserved\nStock options outstanding 2,255\nRestricted stock units outstanding 2,267\nShares available for future grant under 2014 Plan 11,562\nShares available for future issuance under ESPP 2,532\nTotal shares of common stock reserved 18,616\nEquity Incentive Plans\nPrior to the Company\u2019s initial public offering (\u201cIPO\u201d) in April 2014, the Company granted stock options under its Amended and Restated 2004 Equity Incentive Plan, as amended (\u201c 2004 Plan\u201d).\nUnder the terms of the 2004 Plan, the Company had the ability to grant incentive and nonstatutory stock options. Incentive stock options could only be granted to Company employees. Nonstatutory stock options could be granted to Company employees, directors and consultants. Such options are exercisable at prices, as determined by the board of directors, generally equal to the fair value of the Company\u2019s common stock at the date of grant. Options granted to employees generally vest over a four-year period, with an initial vesting period of 12 months for 25% of the shares, and the remaining 75% of the shares vesting monthly on a ratable basis over the remaining 36 months. Options generally expire 10 years after the grant date and are generally exercisable upon vesting. Vested options generally expire 90 days after termination of the optionee\u2019s employment or relationship as a consultant or director, unless otherwise extended by the terms of the stock option agreement.\nIn March 2014, the Company\u2019s board of directors and stockholders approved the 2014 Equity Incentive Plan (\u201c2014 Plan\u201d) and 5,300,000 shares of common stock were authorized for issuance under the 2014 Plan. In addition, on the first day of each year beginning in 2015 and ending in 2024, the 2014 Plan provides for an annual automatic increase to the shares reserved for issuance in an amount equal to 5% of the total number of shares outstanding on December 31st of the preceding calendar year or a lesser number as determined by the Company\u2019s board of directors. Pursuant to the automatic annual increase, 3,324,803 additional shares were reserved under the 2014 Plan on January 1, 2021. No further grants were made under the 2004 Plan once the 2014 Plan became effective on April 3, 2014. Upon the effectiveness of the 2014 Plan, all shares reserved for future issuance under the 2004 Plan became available for issuance under the 2014 Plan. Additionally, any forfeited or expired shares that would have otherwise returned to the 2004 Plan instead return to the 2014 Plan. The 2014 Plan allows the Company to grant stock options, restricted stock units (\u201cRSUs\u201d), restricted stock awards, performance stock awards, stock appreciation rights, performance cash awards, and other stock awards. To date, the Company has granted stock options and RSUs under the 2014 Plan. Stock options granted under the 2014 Plan are in general at a price equal to the fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant and vest over four years. The Company\u2019s stock options expire 10 years from the date of grant. Each RSU granted under the 2014 Plan represents a right to receive one share of the Company\u2019s common stock when the RSU vests. RSUs generally vest over one to four years. Vested options generally expire three months after termination of the optionee\u2019s employment or relationship as a consultant or director, unless otherwise extended by the terms of the stock option agreement.\nIn connection with the Company\u2019s acquisition of Inference, the Company assumed unvested stock options that had been granted under the Inference Technologies Group Inc. 2018 Equity Incentive Plan. Each of the assumed stock options are subject to substantially the same terms and conditions as applied to the assumed stock options immediately prior to the acquisition date, except that the number of shares of the Company\u2019s common stock subject to each assumed stock option and the exercise price has been adjusted in accordance with the terms of the acquisition agreement. If these assumed stock options are cancelled, forfeited or expire unexercised, the underlying shares do not become available for future grant. As of the acquisition date, the estimated fair value of the assumed unvested options was $7.6 million, of which $0.2 million was recognized as goodwill and the balance of $7.4 million is being recognized as stock-based compensation expense over the remaining service period of the assumed unvested stock options.\nStock Options\nA summary of the Company\u2019s stock option activity during the year ended December 31, 2020 is as follows (in thousands, except years and per share data):\nNumber of Shares Weighted\nAverage\nExercise\nPrice Weighted\nAverage\nRemaining\nContractual\nLife\n(Years) Aggregate\nIntrinsic\nValue (1)\nOutstanding as of December 31, 2019 2,530 $ 19.38\nOptions granted 271 85.68\nOptions assumed (2)\n60 14.33\nOptions exercised (560) 20.86\nOptions forfeited or expired (46) 43.60\nOutstanding as of December 31, 2020 2,255 26.33 5.4 $ 333,959\nVested and expected to vest as of December 31, 2020 2,255 26.33 5.4 333,959\nExercisable as of December 31, 2020 1,607 14.24 4.3 257,447\n(1) The aggregate intrinsic value amounts are computed based on the difference between the exercise price of the\nstock options and the fair market value of the Company\u2019s common stock of $174.40 per share as of December 31, 2020 for all in-the-money stock options outstanding.\n(2) The Company assumed stock options outstanding through the Inference acquisition.\nFollowing is additional information pertaining to the Company\u2019s stock option activity (in thousands, except per share data):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2019 2018\nWeighted average grant date fair value per share of options granted, excluding assumed stock options $ 38.80 $ 24.06 $ 16.33\nWeighted average grant date fair value per share of assumed stock options 125.96 - -\nIntrinsic value of options exercised (1)\n47,529 42,204 34,785\nTotal fair value of options vested during the period 7,846 5,342 4,744\nCash received from options exercised 11,656 7,705 7,779\n(1) Intrinsic value of options exercised is the difference between the fair market value of the Company\u2019s common stock at the time of exercise and the exercise price paid.\nRestricted Stock Units\nA summary of RSU activity during the year ended December 31, 2020 is as follows (in thousands, except years and per share data):\nNumber of Shares Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value Per Share\nOutstanding as of December 31, 2019 2,372 $ 41.32\nRSUs granted 1,252 86.15\nRSUs vested and released (1,210) 41.35\nRSUs forfeited (147) 53.44\nOutstanding as of December 31, 2020 2,267 65.42\nFollowing is additional information pertaining to the Company\u2019s RSU activity (in thousands, except per share data):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2019 2018\nWeighted average grant date fair value per share of RSUs granted $ 86.15 $ 53.33 $ 32.30\nTotal fair value of RSUs vested during the period 136,805 68,072 41,245\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan\nIn March 2014, the Company\u2019s board of directors and stockholders adopted the 2014 ESPP Plan and the shares authorized for issuance thereunder. The 2014 ESPP Plan became effective on April 3, 2014.\nThe 2014 ESPP Plan permits eligible employees to purchase shares of the Company\u2019s common stock through payroll deductions with up to 15% of their pre-tax earnings subject to certain Internal Revenue Code limitations. The purchase price of the shares is 85% of the lower of the fair market value of the Company\u2019s common stock on the first day of a six month offering period, except for the initial offering period, or the relevant purchase date. In addition, no participant may purchase more than 1,500 shares of common stock in each purchase period.\nThe number of shares of common stock originally reserved for issuance under the 2014 ESPP Plan was 880,000 shares, which increases automatically each year, beginning on January 1, 2015 and continuing through January 1, 2024, by the lesser of (i) 1% of the total number of shares of the Company\u2019s common stock outstanding on December 31 of the preceding calendar year; (ii) 1,000,000 shares of common stock (subject to adjustment to reflect any split or combination of its common stock); or (iii) such lesser number as determined by its board of directors. Pursuant to the automatic annual increase, 664,960 additional shares were reserved under the 2014 ESPP Plan on January 1, 2021.\nDuring 2020, 168,737 shares were purchased by employees under the 2014 ESPP Plan at a weighted average price of $67.97 per share.\nStock-Based Compensation\nStock-based compensation expenses for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 were as follows (in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2019 2018\nCost of revenue $ 9,422 $ 6,334 $ 3,333\nResearch and development (1)\n14,043 7,658 5,303\nSales and marketing 20,164 11,368 6,307\nGeneral and administrative\n21,118 16,705 13,541\nTotal stock-based compensation $ 64,747 $ 42,065 $ 28,484\n(1)Includes an incremental stock-based compensation cost due to modification of certain stock-based awards of a former executive of the Company in the third quarter of 2018.\nAs of December 31, 2020, unrecognized stock-based compensation expense by award type and their expected weighted-average recognition periods are summarized in the following table (in thousands, except years).\nStock Option RSU ESPP\nUnrecognized stock-based compensation expense $ 22,526 $ 138,956 $ 1,825\nWeighted-average amortization period 2.6 years 2.9 years 0.4 years\nThe Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense that is calculated based upon awards that have vested, reduced for actual forfeitures. All stock-based compensation for equity awards granted to employees and non-employee directors is measured based on the grant date fair value of the award.\nThe Company values RSUs at the closing market price of its common stock on the date of grant. The Company estimates the fair value of each stock option and purchase right under the 2014 ESPP Plan granted to employees on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model and using the assumptions disclosed in the table below. Expected volatility is based upon the weighting of the Company\u2019s historical volatility. Prior to\n2020, expected volatility was based upon the weighting of the Company\u2019s historical volatility and the historical volatility of a peer group of publicly traded companies. The expected term of options granted is estimated using the simplified method by taking the average of the vesting term and the contractual term of the option. The expected volatility assumption for purchase rights under the 2014 ESPP Plan is based on the historical volatility of the Company\u2019s common stock. The risk-free rate for the expected term of the awards is based on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues at the time of grant. The Company has not paid, and does not anticipate paying, cash dividends on its shares of common stock. Accordingly, the expected dividend yield is zero.\nThe weighted average assumptions used to value stock options and purchase rights under the 2014 ESPP Plan granted during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 were as follows:\nStock Options\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 (1)\n2019 2018\nExpected term (years) 5.7 6.1 6.0\nVolatility 47% 46% 45%\nRisk-free interest rate 0.9% 2.3% 2.8%\nDividend yield - - -\n(1)The weighted average assumptions for the year ended December 31, 2020 includes assumed stock options. The weighted average assumptions, excluding the assumed stock options, were an expected term of 6.0 years, volatility of 47%, risk-free interest rate of 1.0% and dividend yield of 0%. The weighted average assumptions of the assumed stock options were an expected term of 4.3 years, volatility of 47%, risk-free interest rate of 0.3% and dividend yield of 0%.\nESPP\nGranted In\nNovember 2020 May 2020 November 2019 May 2019 November 2018 May 2018\nExpected term (years) 0.5 0.5 0.5 0.5 0.5 0.5\nVolatility 50% 50% 46% 51% 37% 36%\nRisk-free interest rate 0.1% 0.2% 2.4% 2.5% 2.1% 1.4%\nDividend yield - - - - - -\n8. Net Loss Per Share\nBasic net loss per share is calculated by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period, and excludes any dilutive effects of employee stock-based awards and warrants. Diluted net loss per share is computed giving effect to all potentially dilutive shares of common stock, including common stock issuable upon exercise of stock options, vesting of restricted stock and shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of convertible senior notes. As the Company had net losses for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, all potentially issuable shares of common stock were determined to be anti-dilutive.\nThe following table presents the calculation of basic and diluted net loss per share (in thousands, except per share data).\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2019 2018\nNet loss $ (42,130) $ (4,552) $ (221)\nWeighted-average shares used in computing basic and diluted net loss per share 64,154 60,371 58,076\nBasic and diluted net loss per share $ (0.66) $ (0.08) $ -\nThe following securities were excluded from the calculation of diluted net loss per share because their effect would have been anti-dilutive (in thousands).\nDecember 31,\n2020 2019 2018\nStock options 2,255 2,530 3,122\nRestricted stock units\n2,267 2,372 2,325\nConvertible senior notes\n910 1,619 -\nTotal 5,432 6,521 5,447\nThe Company uses the treasury stock method for calculating any potential dilutive effect of the conversion spread of its convertible senior notes. The conversion spread had a dilutive impact for the 2023 convertible senior notes during the year ended December 31, 2020 since the average market price of the Company\u2019s common stock during the period exceeded the initial conversion price of $40.82 per share. However, the potential shares of common stock issuable upon the conversion of the 2023 convertible senior notes were excluded from the calculation of diluted net loss per share because their effect would have been anti-dilutive. The conversion spread had an anti-dilutive impact for the 2025 convertible senior notes during the year ended December 31, 2020 since the average market price of the Company\u2019s common stock during the period was less than the initial conversion price of $134.34 per share.\n9.

The undistributed earnings of the Company\u2019s foreign subsidiaries were immaterial as of December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.\nA valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets where the recoverability of the assets is uncertain. The determination to provide a valuation allowance is dependent upon the assessment of whether it is more likely\nthan not that sufficient future taxable income will be generated to utilize the deferred tax assets. Based on the weight of the available evidence, which includes the Company\u2019s historical operating losses, lack of taxable income and the accumulated deficit, for the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company has provided a valuation allowance against its U.S. net deferred tax assets. However, starting in 2020, the Company recorded net foreign deferred tax liabilities associated with its U.K. and Australia operations totaling $4.4 million, which cannot reduce its U.S. valuation allowance. The net change in the valuation allowance for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was a decrease of $8.8 million and an increase of $12.8 million, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards for federal, state and foreign income tax purposes of $356.0 million, $201.6 million and $14.3 million, respectively, available to reduce future income subject to income taxes. If not utilized, the federal and state net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2024 and 2028, respectively, while the foreign net operating loss carryforwards do not expire. As of December 31, 2020, the Company also had gross research credit carryforwards for federal and California state tax purposes of $6.1 million and $4.5 million, available to reduce future income subject to income taxes. The federal research credit carryforwards will begin to expire in 2024 and the California state research credits can be carried forward indefinitely. The Internal Revenue Code (\u201cIRC\u201d) of 1986, as amended, imposes restrictions on the utilization of net operating losses in the event of an \u201cownership change\u201d of a corporation. Accordingly, a company\u2019s ability to use net operating losses may be limited as prescribed under the IRC Section 382. Events that may cause limitations in the amount of the net operating losses that the Company may use in any one year include, but are not limited to, a cumulative ownership change of more than 50% over a three-year period. Utilization of federal and state net operating losses may be subject to substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations provided by the IRC Section 382 and similar state provisions. In the event the Company has changes in ownership, net operating losses and research and development credit carryforwards, which are fully reserved by the deferred tax asset valuation allowance, could be limited and may expire unutilized.\nUnrecognized Tax Benefits\nThe table below shows the changes in the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits for the periods presented (in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2019 2018\nUnrecognized benefit - beginning of period $ 4,471 $ 10,723 $ 3,115\nGross increases - current year tax positions 1,605 963 7,608\nGross decreases - prior year tax positions - (7,215) -\nUnrecognized benefit - end of period $ 6,076 $ 4,471 $ 10,723\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company had $0.3 million and an immaterial amount, respectively, of total unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, would have an impact on the Company\u2019s effective tax rate. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as income tax expense. The Company does not anticipate its total unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2020 will significantly change due to settlement of examination or the expiration of statutes of limitation during the next 12 months. The Company is currently unaware of any uncertain tax positions that could result in significant additional payments, accruals or other material deviation in this estimate over the next 12 months.\nThe Company is subject to taxation in the United States, various states and several foreign jurisdictions. Due to the Company\u2019s net carryover of unused operating losses, all years from 2001 forward remain subject to future examination by the U.S. federal and state tax authorities.

The agreements require payments per month for a fixed period of time in exchange for certain guarantees of network and telecommunication availability. The Company is also committed to make future payments under maintenance service contracts for certain data center equipment.\nAs of December 31, 2020, future minimum payments under these arrangements were as follows (in thousands):\nYear Ending December 31, Hosting Services Telecommunication Usage Services Equipment Maintenance Services\n2021 $ 792 $ 3,304 $ 25\n2022 997 1,573 -\n2023 186 444 -\n2024 - 51 -\nThereafter $ - $ - $ -\nTotal future minimum payment $ 1,975 $ 5,372 $ 25\nUniversal Services Fund Liability\nThe Company is classified as a telecommunications service provider for regulatory purposes and is required to make contributions to the USF based on the revenue the Company receives from the resale of interstate and international telecommunications services. In order to comply with the obligation to make direct contributions, the Company is registered with the USAC, which is charged by the FCC with administering the USF, and has been remitting the required contributions to USAC since its registration with the USAC in April 2013. In June 2015, in connection with the Company\u2019s late registration with the USAC and past failure to make USF contributions prior to 2013, the Company entered into a consent decree with the FCC Enforcement Bureau. In the consent decree, the Company agreed to pay a civil penalty of $2.0 million to the U.S. Treasury, which was paid in installments ending on December 31, 2018. The Company also agreed to make USF contributions of $3.9 million based on its revenues for the period from 2008 to 2012. The Company is still in dispute with the FCC regarding whether the Company is liable for USF contributions related to the period from 2003 through 2007. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had accrued $0.9 million in respect of the remaining disputed assessments, including interest and penalties, for the period of 2003 through 2007.\nState and Local Taxes and Surcharges\nThe Company, based on analysis of its activities, has determined that it is obligated to collect and remit U.S. state or local sales, use, gross receipts, excise and utility user taxes, as well as fees or surcharges as a communications service provider in certain U.S. states, municipalities or local tax jurisdictions. The Company is registered for, collecting and remitting applicable taxes where such a determination has been made. Prior to the Company\u2019s making such determination, the Company neither collected nor remitted these taxes, fees or surcharges to applicable local, municipal or state jurisdictions. The Company continues to analyze its activities to determine if it is subject to these taxes in additional jurisdictions and based on the Company\u2019s ongoing assessment of its U.S. state\nand local tax collection and remittance obligations, the Company registers for tax and regulatory purposes in such jurisdictions and commences collecting and remitting applicable state and local taxes and surcharges to these jurisdictions.\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company had total accrued liabilities of $1.1 million and $1.2 million, respectively, for such contingent sales taxes and surcharges that were not being collected from its clients but may be imposed by various taxing authorities, of which $0.2 million and $0.4 million, respectively, were included in current \u201cSales tax liability\u201d on the consolidated balance sheets, and the remaining were included in non-current \u201cSales tax liability\u201d on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company\u2019s estimate of the probable loss incurred under this contingency is based on its analysis of the source location of its usage-based fees and the regulations and rules in each tax jurisdiction.\nLegal Matters\nThe Company is involved in various legal and regulatory matters arising in the normal course of business. In management\u2019s opinion, resolution of these matters is not expected to have a material impact on the Company\u2019s consolidated results of operations, cash flows, or its financial position. However, due to the uncertain nature of legal matters, an unfavorable resolution of a matter could materially affect the Company\u2019s future consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position in a particular period. The Company expenses legal fees as incurred.\nIndemnification Agreements\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company enters into agreements of varying scope and terms pursuant to which it agrees to indemnify clients, vendors, lessors, business partners and other parties with respect to certain matters, including, but not limited to, losses arising out of breach of such agreements, including breach of security, services to be provided by the Company or from intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties. In addition, the Company has entered into indemnification agreements with its directors, officers and certain employees that will require it, among other things, to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors, officers or employees. There are no claims that it is aware of that could have a material effect on the consolidated balance sheet, consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss, or consolidated statements of cash flows.\n11.

The Company elected the available practical expedients, implemented internal controls, and a lease accounting system to enable the preparation of financial information upon adoption. The adoption of ASC 842 resulted in the recognition of operating lease liabilities of $8.4 million and operating lease ROU assets of the same amount. Existing deferred rent of $0.6 million was recorded as an offset to ROU assets, resulting in net ROU assets of $7.8 million. The Company\u2019s accounting for finance leases remained substantially unchanged.
