    "item_1": "Item 1. Business\nOverview\nPROS provides solutions that optimize the processes of selling and shopping in the digital economy. PROS solutions leverage artificial intelligence (\"AI\"), self-learning and automation to ensure that every transactional experience is fast, frictionless and personalized for every shopper, supporting both business-to-business (\"B2B\") and business-to-consumer (\"B2C\") companies across industry verticals. Companies can use our selling, pricing, revenue optimization and eCommerce solutions to assess their market environments in real time to deliver customized prices and offers. Our solutions enable buyers to move fluidly across our customers\u2019 direct sales, partner, online, mobile and emerging channels with personalized experiences regardless of which channel buyers choose. Our decades of data science and AI expertise are infused into our solutions and are designed to reduce time and complexity through actionable intelligence. We provide standard configurations of our solutions based on the industries we serve and offer services to configure our solutions to meet the specific needs of each customer.\nOur subscription-as-a-service (\"SaaS\") solutions are designed to achieve high levels of security, scalability, performance and availability. We believe our SaaS solutions provide an advantage over traditional enterprise software by allowing our customers to reduce their initial investment in third-party software, hardware and administration requirements, and also allow smaller customers or business units to cost-effectively leverage our enterprise class infrastructure, infrastructure management, security and other strategic services.\nBefore 2015, we primarily offered on-premises license solutions, for which our customers purchased the perpetual right to use our software within a specific license scope. These license customers generally also purchased software maintenance and support, which includes unspecified software updates and enhancements on a when-and-if-available basis, maintenance releases and patches released during the term of the support period.\nMore than half of our revenue in 2020 and 2019 was derived from our cloud solutions, and since 2017 we have sold over 90% of our solutions as SaaS offerings. We manage all updates and upgrades of software deployed on the PROS cloud on behalf of our customers, which enables us to deliver our latest product innovations to our customers in a more uniform way. We focus the vast majority of our product development efforts on our SaaS solutions, and our next-generation solutions have been built natively in the cloud.\nOur Industry\nReal-time decision making is an important driver of business performance in the digital economy. Rapidly changing markets and buyer expectations make it increasingly harder for companies to compete and grow. In response to these pressures, we believe that market forces, including increasingly dynamic and complex business models, the explosion of eCommerce, and the exponential increase in the volume of enterprise and market data will accelerate the demand for software solutions that enable companies to dynamically price, configure and sell their products and services across an ever-increasing set of buyer channels with speed, precision and consistency. We believe the market for solutions that can power commerce using AI and machine learning is a large, growing market that spans most major industries.\nOur Solutions\nOur cloud-based software solutions provide companies with AI-based predictive and prescriptive guidance on key business decisions that drive growth and profitability, including product mix optimization, price forecasting, price optimization, product configuration recommendations, new sales opportunity recommendations, cross-sell recommendations and proactive attrition detection. These insights are derived from machine learning data science based on historical customer transactions, external market inputs and other data. Our cloud solutions enable a consistent buyer experience across direct, partner and eCommerce channels to support digital selling. Our solutions help increase visibility, business agility and customer engagement by aligning sales and pricing strategy across go-to-market channels. As a result, our solutions make it easier for companies to recommend and configure the correct solution(s), set the right price and quickly get a quote into the hands of a buyer.\nSolutions for Selling Improvement\nPROS selling solutions are designed to improve sales productivity and accelerate deal velocity by automating common sales tasks. Utilizing a foundation of AI and machine learning algorithms, PROS selling solutions empower businesses to tailor every offer for every buyer, across all sales channels, leading to more personalized and engaging customer interactions:\n\u2022PROS Smart CPQ accelerates the sales process and provides a powerful, intuitive tool for sales teams and partners to respond to customer quotes within minutes. Leveraging state-of-the-art AI and machine learning algorithms, Smart CPQ enables users to find and tailor product recommendations, customize configurations, manage approvals, price just right and generate professional proposals to increase the probability of winning the sale on the first quote. Smart CPQ supports all selling scenarios including spot-order purchases, subscription orders and setup and maintenance of negotiated sales agreements. Businesses can also integrate Smart CPQ into their eCommerce portals, empowering end users to self-serve with confidence. We also offer a Sales Agreements edition which automates the quoting process when a longer-term agreement on product, price and terms is negotiated between buyer and seller, supporting increased collaboration and approvals that are required when actual order quantity is uncertain but can be estimated over the agreement term period.\n\u2022PROS Opportunity Detection increases sales effectiveness and productivity while accelerating quota attainment by uncovering sales opportunities in existing accounts for sales teams. By applying AI and machine learning techniques to historical transactional activity, Opportunity Detection surfaces new opportunities to help proactively increase account penetration with existing customers while preventing customer churn. Businesses can also integrate Opportunity Detection into their eCommerce portal, providing personalized product recommendations for every end user along their eCommerce journey.\nSolutions for Pricing\nPROS pricing solutions enable enterprises to optimize, personalize and harmonize pricing across the complexity of their go-to-market channels in the context of dynamic market and competitive conditions. Our pricing solutions include:\n\u2022PROS Control provides a comprehensive pricing platform that offers a single source of accuracy for price management, coordination and strategy. This platform allows businesses to harmonize pricing across go-to-market channels while simultaneously increasing price discipline and protecting price attainment. Pricing users leverage this solution to deploy formulaic price strategies that can incorporate real-time information or conditional data to ensure that every delivered price is up-to-date with the latest market and competitive conditions. With the performance, power and scalability of PROS Control\u2019s Real-Time Pricing Engine, B2B and B2C organizations can replace price lists across commerce channels with dynamic calculations for price requests, ensuring that every delivered price is cognizant of conditions at the time of request. This engine allows businesses facing volatile price competition and underlying component costs to leverage data science\nto systematically adjust pricing in real time.\n\u2022PROS Guidance leverages AI-powered algorithms to provide market-relevant price guidance across sales channels that is dynamically refined to adapt to changing market conditions and buyer behavior. This predictive and prescriptive price guidance provides optimized pricing for each unique buying scenario, which is designed to help businesses drive revenue growth, recover margin leakage, accelerate quote turnaround times and increase win-rates. PROS Guidance works with traditional eCommerce scenarios where a sales person is not involved, as well as where a sales person needs negotiation support, and in all cases this solution provides business-relevant analytics to promote explainability of the AI recommendation.\nAirline Revenue Optimization\nPROS revenue optimization solutions enable enterprises in the travel industry to drive revenue- and profit-maximizing business strategies through the application of advanced forecasting, optimization technologies and decision-support capabilities. These solutions are designed to empower companies to quickly adapt to changing market conditions, differentiate customers by market and sales channel, monitor pricing and revenue management performance, and increase customer loyalty by providing the right products and services to the right customer at the right time. Our Airline Revenue Optimization suite of products includes:\n\u2022PROS Airline Revenue Management delivers algorithmic forecasting and network optimization for the travel industry. Airlines leverage our forecasting and optimization capabilities to determine optimal capacity levels and manage booking classes inventory in order to optimize revenue at the flight/network level.\n\u2022PROS Airline Real-Time Dynamic Pricing\u2122 is a scalable solution that offers accurate booking class availability and seat prices across all channels, while keeping the rules, fares and other data in sync. The solution dynamically applies strategies to compute both booking class availability and seat prices in real time at the time of transaction so that airlines can maximize revenue.\n\u2022PROS Airline Group Sales Optimizer is a group revenue optimization solution powered by dynamic pricing science that enables airlines and their travel agent partners to create and manage group bookings, contracts and policies in one location across users.\nAirline eCommerce\nOur Airline eCommerce solutions power airlines to become better retailers by increasing their control and flexibility over how they sell and distribute offers. These solutions provide airlines with scalable shopping, booking and merchandising capabilities to design and distribute offers across individuals and groups. The solutions are powered by proprietary algorithms, compliant with industry pricing and distribution standards and are entirely passenger service system-independent. Our Airline eCommerce suite of products includes:\n\u2022PROS Airline Shopping powers airlines' shopping, pricing and repricing by delivering fast, accurate and comprehensive flight offers to travelers across airlines\u2019 sales channels.\n\u2022PROS Airline Merchandising increases airlines' conversion and revenues per passenger by dynamically selling ancillary services, including extra baggage, legroom and other services. Airlines can upsell with personalized offers at any time in the customer journey using rich content across the airlines' sales channels.\n\u2022PROS Airline Retail offers a single, configurable end-to-end solution for airlines to optimize the user experience throughout the entire traveler journey from inspiration to post-trip. With this International Air Transport Association (\"IATA\") New Distribution Capability (\"NDC\") Level 4 capable solution, airlines can increase conversion rates and upsell opportunities while having the flexibility and control to optimize user interface across their internet booking engine and mobile application.\nTechnology\nOur high-performance software architecture supports real-time, high-volume transaction processing and enables us to handle the complex and demanding processing requirements of sophisticated global enterprises, including those who require sub-second response times for their customers. We provide the majority of our cloud services via cloud computing platform partners who offer Infrastructure-as-a-Service, including servers, storage, databases and networking, located in the United States, the Netherlands, Ireland, Germany, United Arab Emirates, Australia and other countries. The use of cloud computing platform partners provides us flexibility to service customers at scale and also offer options to comply with in-country data privacy requirements. We also deliver our solutions from infrastructure designed and operated by us but secured within third-party data center facilities. We offer both single-tenant and multi-tenant cloud solutions.\nArtificial Intelligence. More than three decades of data science research and access to very large data sets underlies the robust machine learning and AI capabilities of our solutions. Our dynamic AI, including forecasting, optimization, neural networks, segmentation and reinforcement learning, allows us to leverage our deep science and research expertise in our solutions. These capabilities are industry-independent and are validated using our proprietary verification and testing processes.\nConfiguration vs. Custom Coding. Our solutions can be configured to meet each customer's business needs through configuration rather than custom code. The configuration capabilities define both a business layer (including definition of user workflows, executive dashboards, analytics views, calculations, approval processes and alerts), as well as a data layer that permits configuration of data structures, including hierarchical dimensions, pricing levels and measures. We maintain our customers' configurations which allows them to use the latest version of our solutions.\nData Integration. The data needed to execute and power personalized digital buying typically resides in multiple sources, such as a company's enterprise resource planning (\"ERP\"), supply chain management (\"SCM\"), customer relationship management (\"CRM\"), eCommerce, reservations and inventory systems, external market data sources, spreadsheets and/or industry-specific transaction systems. Our platform interoperates with many different systems, including those that have been heavily customized to customer requirements. Our data integration capabilities bring data from disparate sources together into a single cohesive database, both in real time and through scheduled batch tasks. We also provide certified content for integration with SAP and integration development services using industry standard tools as well as adapters and integration tools for other common data sources and applications.\nMicro-services Architecture. A comprehensive web services interface is at the heart of our architecture. This interface enables extension onto other platforms and the creation of rich integrated solutions.\nUser Interface. Our technology provides a rich and modern, browser-based interface that supports both local and remote users. This interface supports a wide variety of interactive charts and other data views, and provides a comprehensive security model based on user role and scope of responsibility. This interface operates on a variety of internet browsers, mobile devices and tablets. We also provide native capabilities for Salesforce CRM and Microsoft Dynamics CRM.\nSubscription Services\nOur subscription services provide customers access to our software via the Internet which, as compared to an on-premises software model, helps reduce their infrastructure, installation and ongoing administration requirements. We also reduce the total cost of ownership of our cloud services over the subscription term by delivering multiple feature releases per year that automatically introduce new features, while preserving previous configurations and integrations that minimize additional customer investment for compatibility. We also offer cloud-based services to allow existing customers who previously purchased licenses to our software to have access to that software within a cloud-based IT environment that we manage.\nSales and Marketing\nWe sell and market our software solutions primarily through our direct global sales force and indirectly through go-to-market partners, resellers and systems integrators. Our sales force is organized by our target markets, including automotive and industrial manufacturing, transportation and logistics, chemicals and energy, food and beverage, healthcare, high tech and travel. Our marketing activities consist of a variety of programs designed to generate sales leads, accelerate sales opportunities and build awareness of our solutions. We also use digital channels including search and content syndication to reach our target market. We host an annual customer conference, Outperform, where our customers and prospects are invited to learn about best practices from thought leaders, executives and other practitioners in using technology to compete in the digital economy, hear about our latest innovations, and network with peers across industries. We also host other smaller conferences throughout the year, host informational web seminars and participate in and sponsor other industry and trade conferences and organizations.\nServices\nWe provide software-related services, including implementation, configuration, consulting and training services. Our software solution implementations have a standardized and tested implementation process developed through years of experience implementing our software solutions in global enterprises across multiple industries. We also offer an array of training on all aspects of our software solutions, from introductory on-demand mini-courses to multi-day hands-on deep\ntechnical classroom sessions. In addition to our own internal services team, we also work with many globally diverse partners who have been certified to implement our software.\nMaintenance and Support\nCustomers maintaining implementations under on-premises licenses may purchase, at their discretion, maintenance and support services. Maintenance enrollment entitles a customer to solicit support through a web-based interface to submit and track issues, access our online knowledge base, and receive unspecified upgrades, maintenance releases and bug fixes during the term of the support period.\nRevenue from maintenance and support services has continued to decline as a percentage of our total revenue since we transitioned to our cloud strategy and sold fewer on-premises licenses to our software. We expect our maintenance revenue to continue to decrease as more existing customers migrate from our legacy on-premises solutions to our cloud solutions. Revenue from maintenance and support services comprised 18%, 23%, and 33% of our total revenue in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nCustomers\nWe sell our solutions to customers across many industries, including automotive and industrial manufacturing, transportation and logistics, chemicals and energy, food and beverage, healthcare, high tech and travel. Our customers are generally large global enterprises and medium-sized businesses, although we also have customers that are smaller in scope of operations. In each of 2020, 2019 and 2018, we had no single customer that accounted for 10% or more of our revenue. Our customers are also geographically diverse, as approximately 67%, 66%, and 65% of our total revenue came from customers outside the U.S. for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nWe provide our customers with several service options including a customer success team to help our customers accelerate the value of their investments in our solutions; a services ecosystem of both our service teams and certified third-party system integrators; 24x7 support; and an online community to facilitate collaboration among our customers and our product development teams.\nCompetition\nThe markets for our solutions are competitive, fragmented and rapidly evolving. For example, we have seen consolidation in the quoting software market with large vendors acquiring smaller quoting companies as they attempt to provide end-to-end solutions. Today, we are increasingly competing in a sales ecosystem with competitors that all aim to drive effectiveness and efficiency in selling, although we believe we are unmatched in our ability to deliver sales and pricing AI with speed, scale and precision. We face competition from both larger and smaller competitors, including those providing industry specific software, a portion of our pricing solutions, a portion of our selling solutions, and a portion of our revenue management, retail, shopping and merchandising solutions in the airline industry. To a lesser extent, we compete against large enterprise application providers that have developed offerings that include competing functionality and custom solutions developed internally by businesses, which generally include some combination of spreadsheets, manual processes, external consultants, and internally developed software tools.\nThe number of companies that we compete with has increased in recent years as we expanded into adjacent technologies. We believe our customers consider the following factors when evaluating our solutions versus competitive solutions:\n\u2022product architecture, functionality, performance, data security, reliability and scalability;\n\u2022strength of AI embedded in offerings;\n\u2022real-time capabilities;\n\u2022customer base and references;\n\u2022return on investment, total cost of ownership and time-to-value;\n\u2022breadth and depth of product and service offerings;\n\u2022depth of expertise in data and pricing science;\n\u2022industry domain expertise;\n\u2022investment in research and development;\n\u2022services and customer support quality;\n\u2022size and quality of partner ecosystem;\n\u2022existing customer relationships; and\n\u2022vendor viability.\nWe believe that none of our competitors can provide a competitive level of all the functionality needed to support an organization interested in optimizing sales growth through AI-based omnichannel pricing, selling and revenue management. Our competitors generally compete on price or by bundling their applications with other enterprise applications, and we expect that this will continue in the future. We distinguish ourselves from these vendors through our long history of providing software solutions incorporating AI and/or machine learning, the breadth and depth of the functionality we offer, the robust integration and configuration capabilities of our solutions, our ability to handle large data volumes at scale, and our proven ability to provide high-value dynamic science-based optimization software to our global customer base across industries. In the future, we believe our competition will continue to increase as we expand into adjacent market segments.\nIntellectual Property\nOur success and ability to compete is dependent, in part, on our ability to develop and maintain the proprietary aspects of our technology and operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others. We protect our intellectual property with a combination of trade secrets, confidentiality procedures, contractual provisions, patents, trademarks, copyrights and other similar measures. We believe that reliance upon trade secrets and unpatented proprietary know-how are generally the most advantageous methods for us to protect our proprietary information.\nResearch and Development\nWe believe our software innovation is the foundation of our business and accordingly have made, and continue to make, significant investments in research and development for the enhancement of existing solutions and the development of solutions. We also believe that our long-term investments in AI and machine learning to power pricing and revenue management differentiate us from our competitors. We are committed to continuing the further development of these high-value solutions as evidenced by our continued investment in research and development. In fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, we incurred expenses of $75.6 million, $67.2 million and $55.7 million, respectively, in research and development, net of capitalized internal-use software cost, to enhance our existing portfolio of solutions and to develop new solutions. Our research and development expenses include costs associated with our product management, product development and science and research groups. We conduct research and development activities predominantly in Bulgaria, France and the U.S., and also utilize third-party contractors in Bolivia, Colombia, France, India, Romania and Mexico.\nWe employ data scientists, most of whom are Ph.D.'s, to advance sales, pricing, and revenue management technology and its implementation in our software solutions. These scientists have specialties including, but not limited to, AI, machine learning, operations research, management science, statistics, econometrics and computational methods. Our data scientists regularly interact with our customers, product development, sales, marketing and services team to help keep our science efforts relevant to real-world demands.\nHuman Capital Resources\nOur mission is to help people and companies outperform. To fulfill that mission, we believe we must attract, develop, motivate and retain exceptional employees to maintain our culture and uphold our high ethical standards. As innovation is one of our core values, we believe that our commitment to innovation begins with our commitment to create an environment where our employees can do their best work. To accomplish this, we offer competitive total rewards, invest in ongoing learning and development, promote diversity and inclusion, and focus on employee health, safety and well-being. Oversight of our approach to and investment in human capital management and leadership and talent development are thus key governance matters for the Board of Directors (\"Board\"). Directly, and through its Compensation and Leadership Development Committee, the Board engages regularly with management on human capital matters. As of December 31, 2020, we had 1,403 full-time personnel, which included 1,235 employees and 168 outsourced personnel. Our team spans 10+ countries, reflecting various backgrounds, ages, gender identities and ethnicities.\nAt PROS, our values and culture are embedded in everything we do. We proactively look for ways to maintain our collaborative and open company culture and further improve our organizational health, including through regular employee and\nmanagement communication, and periodic team events, as well as through employee pulse surveys. We use insights from our pulse surveys and other employee feedback, including through town halls, leader forums and other communication channels, to inform our human capital resources plans. Our most recent U.S. engagement survey, conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic and virtual work, shows the impact of our efforts, with 94% of our U.S.-based team members recommending PROS as a great place to work. Following the conclusion of this survey and submission of other required elements, PROS was designated as a 2020-2021 Great Place to Work-Certified\u2122 company.\nWe encourage you to visit our website for more detailed information regarding our Human Capital programs and initiatives. Nothing on our website shall be deemed incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nTotal Rewards. We require a talented workforce to drive innovation, operational excellence, and long-term stockholder value. We also believe that employees should be paid for what they do and how they do it, regardless of their gender, race, or other personal characteristics, and we constantly strive for pay parity. We define pay parity as ensuring that employees in the same job and location are paid fairly regardless of their gender or ethnicity. To attract and retain a talented workforce, we provide total rewards programs, practices and policies designed to be market-competitive, including by benchmarking and setting pay ranges based on market data, and also considering factors such as an employee\u2019s role, skills, experience, job location and performance. We have invested in analysis and transparency to demonstrate our commitment to fair compensation and opportunity.\nOur human resources management philosophy goes beyond traditional compensation and benefits. We design our total rewards to meet the needs of the whole person, not just the employee, recognizing that life events and circumstances that occur outside of work may impact what happens at work. For example, during 2020 we adopted a trusted time off approach in the U.S. to give employees more flexibility and control over their schedules. Our investments in employee mental health and wellness programs are also cornerstones of this philosophy. During COVID-19 we have added specific employee well-being initiatives discussed below.\nDiversity and Inclusion. We believe diversity and inclusion drive innovation and ownership. We are committed to fostering a diverse and inclusive workplace that attracts and retains exceptional talent and upholds high ethical standards. We strive to maintain a working environment that celebrates diverse perspectives, cultures and experiences. We are proud of what we have accomplished to advance diversity and inclusion, but we recognize we still have work to do, including beyond the virtual walls of PROS.\nOur commitment to diversity and inclusion starts at the top with a skilled and diverse Board which provides oversight for our human capital resources efforts, including our diversity and inclusion programs and initiatives. As of December 31, 2020, the majority of our Board was comprised of either female and/or ethnically diverse directors, with both female and ethnically diverse representation on our Board for more than 10 years. As of December 31, 2020, women represent 36% of our global employees, and in the U.S., more than half our employees represent minority groups, with underrepresented minorities (defined as those who identify as Black/African American, Hispanic/Latinx, Native American, Pacific Islander and/or two or more races) representing 26% of our U.S. employees.\nWe have a heritage of fostering inclusion and belonging, awareness and education, and social interaction and camaraderie through our employee resource groups. Sponsored and funded by PROS, these employee-led groups are open to any interested employee and create spaces for our people to connect from all walks of life, grow together and build relationships and community. Additional information on our diversity and inclusion strategy, diversity metrics and programs can be found on our website at pros.com/about-pros/diversity-and-inclusion. Nothing on our website shall be deemed incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nLearning and Development. We believe that continuous learning cultivates innovation and that the development of our most important assets, our people, is foundational to fulfill our mission. We regularly invest in our employees\u2019 career growth and provide our employees opportunities for training on a wide range of skills designed to help them to be more effective in their current and future roles. In 2020, over 95% of employees participated in learning and development activities, including thousands of courses across a broad range of categories - leadership, inclusion and diversity, professional skills, technical and compliance. Because the development of our employees and next generation of leaders is critical to our long-term success, we annually engage in a comprehensive talent evaluation and succession planning process, including manager evaluations of all employees and detailed succession planning for all director and above roles with Board oversight for senior management and other key roles.\nPandemic Response. Our top priority during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic remains protecting the health and well-being of our employees, customers, partners and communities. Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have maintained\na work-from-home policy for substantially all our employees, materially limited business travel, and we have taken an integrated approach to helping our employees manage their work and personal responsibilities, with a strong focus on employee physical and mental health. Recognizing that working virtually across a global company is a new and sudden way for all to interact, we instituted several company-wide initiatives to assist our employees in managing through the unprecedented situation, including a mental health awareness day, monthly recharge days and \"wellness Wednesdays\" with limited scheduled meetings. Additional information on our pandemic response and related wellness initiatives will be included in the 2021 Proxy Statement.\nCorporate Information\nWe were incorporated in Texas in 1985. We reincorporated as a Delaware corporation in 1998. In 2002, we reorganized as a holding company in Delaware. Our principal executive offices are located at 3200 Kirby Drive, Suite 600, Houston, Texas 77098. We report as one operating segment with our Chief Executive Officer acting as our chief operating decision maker. Our telephone number is (713) 335-5151. Our website is www.pros.com. Our website and the information that can be accessed through our website are not part of this report.\nAvailable Information\nWe make available, free of charge through our website, our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, including exhibits thereto, and any amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, as soon as reasonably practicable after the reports are electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC. Our reports that are filed with, or furnished to, the SEC are also available at the SEC's website at www.sec.gov.\nAnnual CEO Certification\nPursuant to Section 303A.12(a) of the New York Stock Exchange (\"NYSE\") Listed Company Manual, on May 14, 2020, we submitted to the NYSE an annual certification signed by our Chief Executive Officer certifying that he was not aware of any violation by us of NYSE corporate governance listing standards.",
    "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nWe operate in a dynamic environment that involves numerous risks and uncertainties. The following section describes some of the risks that may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations, and the trading price of our common stock; these risks are categories and not listed in terms of their importance or level of risk.\nStrategic, Commercial and Operational Risks\nWe must successfully navigate the demand, supply and operational challenges associated with the ongoing coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, and the duration and extent to which this will impact our future results of operations and overall financial performance remains uncertain.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted, and we expect will continue to adversely impact, many aspects of our business. Governmental authorities have implemented or reinstated numerous severe measures in an attempt to contain the spread of COVID-19, including travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, physical distancing, shelter-in-place orders, and business limitations and shutdowns. Compliance with these measures by us and by our prospects, customers, suppliers and other counterparties has impacted our business, and this impact could last for an indefinite period of time. The economic impact of COVID-19 has adversely impacted a number of our prospects and customers, who have experienced, and may continue to experience, downturns or uncertainty in their own businesses. In particular, our travel industry customers experienced unprecedented declines in demand globally in 2020, which may remain suppressed for some time. To address these financial difficulties, some prospects and customers decreased, and may continue to decrease, spending on technology initiatives, stalled or halted implementation projects, and in limited cases filed for bankruptcy protection. As a result, we may be unable to collect receivables from or renew subscription agreements with those customers significantly impacted by COVID-19. In addition, certain customers have requested, and we expect will continue to request, concessions from existing contracts, and the extent and impact of future requests is uncertain. If a significant number of our customers are unable to make their contractually obligated payments to us, file for bankruptcy protection, or elect to renew their current contracts with us at lower usage levels, this would have an adverse impact on our subscription revenue, business and financial condition. COVID-19 may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described herein, including risks associated with our customers and supply chain.\nAs compared to our expectations prior to COVID-19, the economic impact of COVID-19 adversely impacted our revenue, customer bookings, bad debt expense and operating cash flow during the year ended December 31, 2020. We expect that customer bookings and the related revenue and cash flows will continue to be lower than anticipated during the pandemic, particularly new demand for our airline solutions. In response, we have postponed or canceled, and may continue to postpone or cancel, planned investments in our business, which may impact our product development and rate of innovation, either of which could seriously harm our business. The impact of COVID-19 will likely continue even after the pandemic is contained. For example, airline travel demand may remain suppressed and recovery may not follow a linear path. As there are no comparable recent events that provide guidance as to the effect, extent or duration of the current pandemic, or the resultant personal, economic and governmental reactions, we are unable to forecast the impact of COVID-19 on our bookings, revenue, results from operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows, and may have to take additional actions in the future that could further harm our business and financial performance. Although we expect that current cash and cash equivalent balances and cash flows that are generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital needs and other capital and liquidity requirements for at least the next 12 months, if our access to capital is restricted or our borrowing costs increase, our operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted.\nTo support the health and well-being of our employees and communities, we implemented and expect to continue a work-from-home policy for substantially all our employees and materially limited business travel, and we may take further actions that alter our operations as required by governmental authorities, or which we determine are in our best interests. While almost all of our operations have been performed remotely since March 2020, and we have not experienced any material interruptions to our operations to date, there is no guarantee that we will continue to be as effective while working remotely. The disruptions caused by COVID-19, including the limitations on meeting in-person with existing and potential customers and amongst our teams because our team is dispersed, may result in inefficiencies, delays and additional costs in our product development, sales, marketing, product implementations and customer service efforts that we cannot fully mitigate through remote work arrangements. Many employees have additional personal needs to attend to such as looking after children as a result of school closures or adjusted school calendars or family who become sick, and employees may continue to become sick themselves and be unable to work. To date, employee illnesses have not materially impacted our operations. However, if one or more of our senior leaders were unable to carry our their duties due to COVID-19, it could have a significant adverse impact on our operations. Similarly, our business practice modifications in response to the pandemic could present challenges to maintaining our corporate culture, including employee engagement, development and productivity. Where local regulations permit, we have provided limited access to our offices for our employees, and when appropriate, we anticipate that we will fully\nreopen our offices. Planning for the reopening of our offices has required and will likely continue to require non-trivial investments to manage additional risks and operational challenges, including in the design, implementation and enforcement of new workplace safety protocols. These efforts may divert management attention, and the protocols may create logistical challenges for our employees which could adversely impact employee productivity and morale. Even if we follow what we believe to be best practices, our measures may not prevent the transmission of COVID-19. Any incidents of actual or perceived transmission may expose us to liability from employee claims, adversely impact employee productivity and morale, and result in negative publicity and reputational harm.\nThe impacts of COVID-19 on our business continue to be uncertain, evolving, dynamic and dependent on numerous unpredictable factors outside of our control, including:\n\u2022the spread, duration and severity of COVID-19 and the mutations or variations thereof as a public health matter and its impact on governments, businesses and society generally and our clients, partners and our business;\n\u2022the duration, impact and effectiveness of measures taken by governments, businesses and society in response to COVID-19, including the effectiveness of vaccines, the rate at which vaccines are administered, and the effectiveness of fiscal and monetary stimulus programs and other legislative and regulatory measures;\n\u2022the impact of COVID-19 on overall long-term demand for air travel, including the impact on demand for business travel as a result of increased usage of videoconferencing and other technologies;\n\u2022the impact of COVID-19 on the financial health and operations of our current and prospective customers and partners, including the increase in business failures among our customers and other businesses;\n\u2022the pace and extent to which our customers and other businesses reduce their personnel;\n\u2022the possibility of failure of our operating facilities, computer systems or communication systems;\n\u2022the willingness of current and prospective clients to invest in our products and services; and\n\u2022the satisfaction of current and prospective customers with product and service remote delivery and support.\nIf we are not able to respond to and manage the impact of such events effectively, our results of operations, financial performance, and overall business will be harmed. We continue to evaluate the nature and extent of the impact of COVID-19 to our business.\nIf our security measures are breached and unauthorized access is obtained to a customer\u2019s data, our data or our IT systems, our solutions may be perceived as not being secure, customers may limit or stop using our solutions and we may incur significant legal and financial exposure and liabilities.\nOur solutions involve the storage, and to a more limited extent, the transmission of our customers\u2019 proprietary information, including personal and other sensitive data. We have incurred, and expect to continue to incur significant costs to maintain security measures designed to prevent, eliminate or alleviate known security vulnerabilities, data theft, data corruption, computer viruses, malicious software programs, attacks by third parties or similar disruptive problems (each a \"Security Incident\"), and obtain third-party security attestations regarding those security measures. Despite the implementation of these security measures and third-party security attestations, if these measures are breached as a result of third-party action, employee error or misconduct or otherwise, we could experience a Security Incident that could result in someone obtaining unauthorized access to our IT systems, customers\u2019 data or our data, including our intellectual property and other confidential business information. Because the techniques used to compromise systems change frequently, may exploit vulnerabilities, and may not be recognized until launched, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. We cannot predict the extent, frequency or impact of these problems on us. Any Security Incident could result in interruptions, delays, cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers, as well as loss of confidence in the security of our solutions and services, damage to our reputation, negative impact to our future sales, disruption of our business, increases to our information security costs, and could lead to indemnity obligations, legal liability and other costs. In the normal course of our business, we experience Security Incidents and have increased risk given our all remote workforce due to COVID-19. To date, however, the identified Security Incidents have neither been material or significant to us, including to our business operations, nor had a material financial impact. There can be no assurance that future Security Incidents will not be material or significant.\nFailure to increase business from our customers and sustain our historical renewal rates and pricing could adversely affect our future revenue and operating results.\nMany of our existing customers initially purchase our software solutions for a specific business segment or geographic location within their organization, and over time we partner with them to add business segments and geographic locations within their organization. These customers might not choose to make additional purchases of our software solutions or to expand their existing software solutions to other business segments. In addition, as we deploy new applications and features for our software solutions or introduce new software solutions, our current customers may not purchase these new offerings. If we fail to generate additional business from our existing customers, our revenue could grow at a slower rate or even decrease.\nOur subscription agreements are typically for an initial term of three years, and our legacy maintenance and support agreements are typically renewed for annual terms. Our customers have no obligation to renew their software subscriptions after the expiration of their initial term, and some customers elect not to renew. Subscription revenue represented the majority of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020. Maintenance and support revenue from our legacy on-premises software products continues to decline as a percentage of total revenue, representing approximately 18%, 23% and 33% of our total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nWe may not accurately predict future customer renewal rates, which can decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including customers\u2019 level of satisfaction with our services, our ability to continue to regularly add functionality, the reliability (including uptime) of our subscription services, the prices of our services, the actual or perceived information security of our systems and services, mergers and acquisitions of our customers, reductions in our customers\u2019 spending levels, or declines in customer activity as a result of economic downturns or uncertainty in financial markets. COVID-19 has had a negative impact on our revenue retention, particularly for our travel industry customers. If our customers choose not to renew their subscription, maintenance and support agreements with us on favorable terms or at all, our business, operating results and financial condition could be harmed.\nIf we fail to manage our growth effectively, we may be unable to execute our business plan, maintain high levels of service and operational controls or adequately address competitive challenges.\nOver the past several years, we have experienced substantial growth in our customers, headcount and operations. Despite the challenges posed by COVID-19, we expect to continue to expand our customer base, headcount and operations over time. This growth has placed, and future growth will place, a significant strain on our management, general and administrative resources and operational infrastructure. Our success will depend in part on our ability to effectively manage this growth and scale our operations. To manage this growth, we have and will continue to need to improve our operational, financial, management controls, reporting systems and procedures. As we continue to grow, we also need to ensure that our policies and procedures evolve to reflect our current operations and are appropriately communicated to and observed by employees, and that we continue to appropriately manage our assets. Failure to effectively manage growth could adversely impact our business performance and operating results.\nWe depend on third-party data centers, software, data and other unrelated service providers and any disruption from such third-party providers could impair the delivery of our service and negatively affect our business.\nOur cloud products are dependent upon third-party hardware, software and cloud hosting vendors, including Microsoft Azure, IBM Softlayer and Amazon Web Services, all of which must inter-operate for end users to achieve their computing goals. We utilize third-party data center hosting facilities, cloud platform providers, and other service providers to host and deliver our subscription services as well as for our own business operations. We host our cloud products from data centers in a variety of countries, including the United States, the Netherlands, Ireland, Germany, United Arab Emirates, Australia and other countries. While we control and generally have exclusive access to our servers and all of the components of our network that are located in our external data centers, we do not control the operation of these facilities and they are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunications failures and similar events. They may also be subject to Security Incidents, break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism and similar misconduct. Despite our failover capabilities, standard protocols and other precautions, the occurrence of a natural disaster or an act of terrorism, a decision to close the facilities without adequate notice or other unanticipated problems at these facilities could result in lengthy interruptions in our service. In addition, these providers have no obligation to renew their agreements with us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. If we are unable to renew these agreements on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or if one of our data center operators is acquired, we may be required to transfer our servers and other infrastructure to new data center facilities, and we may incur significant costs and possible service interruption in connection with doing so.\nCertain of our applications are essential to our customers\u2019 ability to quote, price, and/or sell their products and services. Interruption in our service may affect the availability, accuracy or timeliness of quotes, pricing or other information and could require us to issue service credits to our customers, damage our reputation, cause our customers to terminate their use of our solutions, require us to indemnify our customers against certain losses, and prevent us from gaining additional business from current or future customers. In addition, certain of our applications require access to our customer\u2019s data which may be held by third parties, some of whom are, or may become, our competitors. For example, many of our travel industry products rely upon access to airline data held by large airline IT providers which compete against certain of our airline products. Certain of these competitors have in the past, and may again in the future, make it difficult for our airline customers to access their data in a timely and/or cost-effective manner.\nAny disruption from our third-party data center, software, data or other service providers could impair the delivery of our service and negatively affect our business, damage our reputation, negatively impact our future sales and lead to legal liability and other costs.\nImplementation projects involve risks which can negatively impact the effectiveness of our software, resulting in harm to our reputation, business and financial performance.\nThe implementation of certain of our software solutions involve complex, large-scale projects that require substantial support operations, significant resources and reliance on factors beyond our control. For example, the success of certain of our implementation projects is dependent upon the quality of data used by our software solutions and the commitment of customers\u2019 resources and personnel to the projects. We may not be able to correct or compensate for weaknesses or problems in data, or any lack of our customers\u2019 commitment and investment in personnel and resources. Further, various factors, including our customers\u2019 business, integration, migration and security requirements, or errors by us, our partners, or our customers, may cause implementations to be delayed, inefficient or otherwise unsuccessful. For example, changes in customer requirements, delays, or deviations from our recommended best practices have and continue to occur during implementation projects. As a result, we may incur significant costs in connection with the implementation of our products. If we are unable to successfully manage the implementation of our software solutions, and as a result those products or implementations do not meet customer needs, expectations or timeline, we may become involved in disputes with our customers, may be unable to sell additional products or secure a renewal of the customer\u2019s subscription, and our business reputation and financial performance may be significantly harmed. If an implementation project for a large customer or a number of customers is substantially delayed or canceled, our ability to recognize the associated revenue and our operating results could be adversely affected.\nIf we fail to manage our cloud operations, we may be subject to liabilities and our reputation and operating results may be adversely affected.\nWe have experienced substantial growth in the number of customers and data volumes serviced by our cloud infrastructure in recent years. While we have designed our cloud infrastructure to meet the current and anticipated future performance and accessibility needs of our customers, we must manage our cloud operations in order to handle changes in hardware and software parameters, spikes in customer usage and new versions of our software. We have experienced, and may in the future experience, system disruptions, outages and other cloud infrastructure performance problems. These problems may be caused by a variety of factors, including infrastructure changes, human or software errors, viruses, security attacks (internal or external), fraud, spikes in customer usage, denial of service issues and other Security Incidents. In some instances, we may not be able to identify the cause or causes of these performance problems within an acceptable period of time. Our customer agreements typically provide service level commitments on a monthly basis and for certain of our products we also offer response time commitments. If we are unable to meet the stated service level or response time commitments, or if we suffer extended periods of unavailability for our solutions, we may be contractually obligated to issue service credits or refunds to customers for prepaid and unused subscription services, or customers may choose to terminate or not renew contracts. Any extended service outages or other performance problems could also result in damage to our reputation or our customers\u2019 businesses, cause our customers to elect not to renew or to delay or withhold payment to us, loss of future sales, lead to customers making other claims against us that could harm our subscription revenues, result in an increase in our provision for doubtful accounts, increase collection cycles for our accounts receivable or lead to the expense and risk of litigation.\nIf we fail to protect our intellectual property adequately, our business may be harmed.\nOur success and ability to compete depends in part on our ability to protect our intellectual property. We rely upon a combination of trade secrets, confidentiality policies, nondisclosure and other contractual arrangements, and patent, copyright and trademark laws to protect our intellectual property rights. We cannot, however, be certain that steps we take to protect our intellectual property are adequate.\nWe may be required to spend significant resources to protect our intellectual property rights. Litigation brought to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights could be costly, time-consuming, and distracting to management and could result in the impairment or loss of portions of our intellectual property. Furthermore, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights may be met with defenses, counterclaims, and countersuits attacking the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights. The procurement and enforcement of certain intellectual property rights involves complex legal and factual considerations, and the associated legal standards are not always applied predictably or uniformly, can change, and may not provide adequate remedies. As a result, we may not be able to obtain or adequately enforce our intellectual property rights, and other companies may be better able to develop products that compete with ours. Our failure to secure, protect, and enforce our intellectual property rights could adversely affect our brand, competitive business position, business prospects, operating results and financial condition.\nOur use of third-party software creates dependencies outside of our control.\nWe use third-party software in our software solutions. If our relations with any of these third parties are impaired, or if we are unable to obtain or develop a replacement for the software, our business could be harmed. The operation of our solutions could be impaired if errors occur in the third-party software that we utilize. It may be more difficult for us to correct any defects in third-party software because the software is not within our control. Accordingly, our business could be adversely affected in the event of any errors in this software. There can be no assurance that these third parties continue to invest the appropriate levels of resources in their products and services to maintain and enhance the capabilities of their software.\nWe may enter into acquisitions that may be difficult to integrate, fail to achieve our strategic objectives, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value or divert management attention.\nWe have completed four acquisitions since 2013, and we plan to continue to acquire other businesses, technologies and products that we intend to complement or enhance our existing business, solutions, services and technologies. We cannot provide assurance that the acquisitions we have made or may make in the future will provide us with the benefits or achieve the results we anticipated when entering into the transaction(s). Acquisitions are typically accompanied by a number of risks, including:\n\u2022difficulties in integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired companies;\n\u2022difficulties in maintaining acceptable standards, controls, procedures and policies, including integrating financial reporting and operating systems, particularly with respect to foreign and/or public subsidiaries;\n\u2022disruption of ongoing business and distraction of management;\n\u2022inability to maintain relationships with customers of the acquired business;\n\u2022impairment of relationships with employees and customers as a result of any integration of new management and other personnel;\n\u2022difficulties in incorporating acquired technology and rights into our solutions and services;\n\u2022unexpected expenses resulting from the acquisition; and\n\u2022potential unknown liabilities associated with the acquisition.\nIn addition, we may incur debt, acquisition-related costs and expenses, restructuring charges and write-offs as a result of acquisitions. Acquisitions may also result in goodwill and other intangible assets that are subject to impairment tests, which could result in future impairment charges. In addition, we have in the past, and may in the future, enter into negotiations for acquisitions that are not ultimately consummated. Those negotiations could result in diversion of management time and significant out-of-pocket costs. If we fail to evaluate and execute acquisitions successfully, we may not be able to achieve our anticipated level of growth and our business and operating results could be adversely affected.\nCatastrophic events may disrupt our operations.\nOur headquarters are located in Houston, Texas, and we conduct business in other domestic and international locations. We also rely on our network and third-party infrastructure and enterprise applications for our sales, marketing, development, services, operational support and hosted services. A disruption, infiltration or failure of these systems or third-\nparty hosted services in the event of a major hurricane, earthquake, fire, flood or other weather event, power loss, telecommunications failure, software or hardware malfunctions, pandemics (including the COVID-19 pandemic), cyber-attack, war, terrorist attack or other catastrophic event that our business continuity and disaster recovery plans do not adequately address, could cause system interruptions, reputational harm, loss of intellectual property, delays in our product development, lengthy interruptions in our services, breaches of data security and loss of critical data. Any of these events could prevent us from fulfilling our customer obligations or could negatively impact a country or region in which we sell our products, which could in turn decrease that country\u2019s or region\u2019s demand for our products. Even though we carry business interruption insurance and typically have provisions in our contracts that protect us in certain events, we might suffer losses from business interruptions that exceed the coverage under our insurance policies or for which we do not have coverage. Any natural disaster or other catastrophic event could create a negative perception in the marketplace, delay our product innovations, or lead to lengthy interruptions in our services, breaches of data security, and losses of critical data, all of which could have an adverse effect on our operating results.\nWe are a multinational corporation exposed to risks inherent in international operations.\nThe majority of our revenues are derived from our customers outside the U.S. To date, the majority of our sales have been denominated in U.S. dollars, although the majority of our expenses that we incur in our international operations are denominated in local currencies. To date, we have not used risk management techniques or \"hedged\" the risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Consequently, our results of operations and financial condition, including our revenue and operating margins, can be subject to losses from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, as well as regulatory, political, social and economic developments or instability in the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. For additional financial information about geographic areas, see Note 19 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOur operations outside the U.S. are subject to risks inherent in doing business internationally, requiring resources and management attention, and may subject us to new or larger levels of regulatory, economic, foreign currency exchange, tax and political risks. We have customers in over 60 countries internationally, which we service through our operations in the U.S., Australia, Bulgaria, Canada, France, Germany, Ireland, United Arab Emirates and United Kingdom. We expect our international operations to continue to grow. Among the risks we believe are most likely to affect us with respect to our international operations are:\n\u2022economic conditions in various parts of the world;\n\u2022sustained disruption to international travel from the COVID-19 pandemic and variations or mutations thereof as well as any other outbreaks of contagious diseases;\n\u2022differing labor and employment regulations, especially where labor laws are generally more advantageous to employees as compared to the U.S.;\n\u2022the difficulty of managing and staffing our international operations and the increased travel, infrastructure and legal compliance costs associated with multiple international locations;\n\u2022unexpected changes in regulatory requirements, including changes in laws governing the flow of data across international borders;\n\u2022less favorable intellectual property laws;\n\u2022new and different sources of competition;\n\u2022compliance with multiple, conflicting, ambiguous or evolving governmental laws and regulations, including privacy, anti-corruption, import/export, antitrust, and industry-specific laws and regulations and our ability to identify and respond timely to compliance issues when they occur;\n\u2022vetting and monitoring our third-party business partners in new and evolving markets to confirm they maintain standards consistent with our brand and reputation;\n\u2022multiple, conflicting and changing tax laws and regulations that may affect both our international and domestic tax liabilities and result in increased complexity and costs;\n\u2022availability of sufficient network connectivity required for certain of our products;\n\u2022difficulties in enforcing contracts and collecting accounts receivable, especially in developing countries; and\n\u2022tariffs and trade barriers, data sovereignty, import and export controls and other regulatory or contractual limitations on our ability to sell or develop our solutions in certain foreign markets.\nIf we continue to expand our business globally, our success will depend, in large part, on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks associated with our international operations. Our failure to manage any of these risks successfully could harm our international operations and reduce our international sales, adversely affecting our business, operating results and financial condition.\nMarket and Competition Risks\nAny downturn in sales to our target markets could adversely affect our operating results.\nOur success is highly dependent upon our ability to sell our software solutions to customers in our target industries, including automotive and industrial manufacturing, transportation and logistics, chemicals and energy, food and beverage, healthcare, high tech and travel. If we are unable to sell our software solutions effectively to customers in these industries, we may not be able to grow our business. For example, COVID-19 has had a dramatic adverse impact on the travel industry and the timing and pace of recovery is unpredictable as further described above.\nWe have historically been subject to lengthy sales cycles, and delays or failures to complete sales may harm our business and cause our revenue and operating income to decline in the future.\nWhile our sales cycle times have continued to improve relative to our historical averages since we shifted to a cloud strategy in 2015, our sales cycles may take a month to over a year for large enterprise customers. A large enterprise customer\u2019s decision to use our solutions typically involves a number of internal approvals, and sales to those prospective customers generally require us to provide greater levels of education about the benefits of our solutions. We expend substantial resources during our sales cycles with no assurance that a sale may ultimately result. The length of each individual sales cycle depends on many factors, a number of which we cannot control, including the prospective customer's internal evaluation and approval process requirements, as well as the prospective customer's budget and/or resource constraints. Any unexpected lengthening of the sales cycle or failure to secure anticipated orders could negatively affect our revenue. Any significant failure to generate sales after incurring costs related to our sales process could also have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we fail to develop or acquire new functionality and software solutions, we may not be able to grow our business and it could be harmed.\nBecause the markets in which we compete are characterized by rapid technological developments, newly emerging and changing customer requirements, and frequent solution introductions, updates and functional enhancements, we spend substantial amounts of time and money to enhance our existing software solutions and research and develop new solutions. We must introduce enhancements to our existing software solutions and bring new solutions to the market to meet our business plan, maintain or improve our competitive position, keep pace with technological developments, satisfy increasing customer requirements and increase awareness for our software. New functionality and solutions we develop may not be introduced timely and may not achieve market acceptance sufficient to generate material revenue. Furthermore, our competitors could be heavily investing in research and development and may develop and market new solutions that may compete with, and may reduce the demand for, our software solutions. We may not be successful in developing or acquiring, marketing and selling new functionality or solutions, or delivering updates and upgrades that meet changing industry standards and customer demands. In addition, we may experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development, marketing and selling of such functionality or solutions. If we are unable to develop or acquire new functionality, enhance our existing software solutions, develop and market new solutions or adapt to changing industry requirements to meet market demand, we may not be able to grow our business and our revenue and operating results would be adversely affected. Furthermore, because our software solutions are intended to interoperate with a variety of third-party enterprise software solutions, we must continue to modify and enhance our software to keep pace with changes in such solutions. Any inability of our software to operate effectively with third-party software necessary to provide effective solutions to our customers, could reduce the demand for our software solutions, result in customer dissatisfaction and limit our revenue.\nThe markets in which we participate are intensely competitive, and if we do not compete effectively, our operating results could be harmed.\nThe markets for enterprise software applications for selling improvement (including configure-price-quote solutions and pricing), airline revenue optimization (including revenue management solutions), and airline eCommerce (including shopping, merchandising and retail solutions) are competitive, fragmented and rapidly evolving. We expect additional competition from other established and emerging companies as the markets in which we compete continue to develop and expand, as well as through industry consolidation, including through a merger or partnership of two or more of our competitors or the acquisition of a competitor by a larger company. Some of our current and potential competitors may have larger installed bases of users, longer operating histories, broader distribution, greater name recognition, and have significantly greater resources than we have. As a result, these companies may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer demands, and devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products.\nCompetition could seriously impede our ability to sell our software solutions and services on terms favorable to us. Our current and potential competitors may develop and market new technologies that render our existing or future solutions obsolete, unmarketable or less competitive. In addition, if these competitors develop solutions with similar or superior functionality to our solutions, or if they offer solutions with similar functionality at a substantially lower prices than our solutions, we may need to decrease the prices for our solutions in order to remain competitive. If we are unable to maintain our current pricing due to competitive pressures, our margins could be reduced and our operating results could be adversely affected. If we do not compete successfully against current or future competitors, competitive pressures could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe focus primarily on selling improvement, pricing, revenue management and airline eCommerce software, and if the markets for this software develop more slowly than we expect, our business could be harmed.\nWe derive most of our revenue from providing our software solutions for selling improvement (including our configure-price-quote solutions), pricing, airline revenue optimization (including our revenue management solutions), and airline eCommerce (including our shopping, merchandising and retail solutions), as well as providing implementation services and ongoing customer support. The selling improvement, pricing, revenue management and airline eCommerce markets are evolving rapidly, and it is uncertain whether software for these markets will achieve and sustain high levels of demand. Our success depends on the willingness of businesses in our target markets to use selling improvement, pricing, revenue management and airline eCommerce software. Some businesses may be reluctant or unwilling to implement such software for a number of reasons, including failure to understand the potential returns of improving their processes and lack of knowledge about the potential benefits that such software may provide. Some businesses may elect to improve their sales and pricing processes through solutions obtained from their existing enterprise software providers, whose solutions are designed principally to address functional areas other than what our solutions provide. If businesses do not embrace the benefits of selling improvement, pricing, revenue management and airline eCommerce software, the market for such software may not continue to develop or may develop more slowly than we expect, either of which would significantly and adversely affect our revenue and operating results.\nHuman Capital Risks\nIf we cannot maintain our corporate culture, we could lose the innovation, teamwork and passion that we believe contribute to our success, and our business may be harmed.\nWe invest substantial time and resources in building and maintaining our culture and developing our personnel; however, as we continue to scale our business both organically and through potential acquisitions, it may be increasingly difficult to maintain our culture. As stated above, since March 2020 our workforce has been primarily working virtually from home during the COVID-19 pandemic, and we plan to evolve to a more flexible, virtual first workforce over time post-pandemic. While we have implemented many wellness, development and supportive programs for our workforce, the dramatic shift in workplace and workstyle increases the risk to our culture. Any failure to preserve our culture could negatively affect our future success, including our ability to retain and recruit personnel and to effectively pursue our strategic objectives.\nWe may lose key members of our management team or sales, development or operations personnel, and may be unable to attract and retain employees we need to support our operations and growth.\nOur future success depends upon the performance and service of our executive officers and other key personnel. From time to time, there may be changes in our executive management team resulting from the hiring or departure of executives. For example, Mr. Rechan joined as our Chief Operating Officer in 2020, and two of our previous executive officers retired in the past twelve months. Changes in our executive management team may be disruptive to our business. Our future success depends on our ability to continue to timely identify, attract and retain highly qualified personnel and effectively plan for succession for key roles, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so. We have continued to add a significant number of new personnel to support our continued growth, and their ability to learn our business and manage it effectively is important to our continued growth and expansion. In addition, given the highly sophisticated artificial intelligence included in our solutions, the pool of data scientists and software developers qualified to work on our solutions is limited. The implementation of certain of our software solutions requires highly-qualified personnel, and hiring and retaining such personnel to support our growth may be challenging. Competition for qualified personnel is intense, and we compete for these individuals with other companies that may have greater resources than we do. If our key personnel are unable to effectively manage our business, or if we fail to identify, attract and retain additional qualified personnel, our operating results could be adversely affected.\nFailure to adequately expand and train our direct and indirect sales force may impede our growth.\nTo date, substantially all of our revenue has been attributable to the efforts of our direct sales force. We believe that our future growth will depend, to a significant extent, on the continued development of our direct sales force, and our sales team's ability to manage and retain our existing customer base, expand our sales to existing customers and obtain new customers. Our ability to achieve significant revenue growth in the future will depend, in large part, on our success in recruiting, training and retaining a sufficient number of direct sales personnel. New hires require significant training and may take a number of months before becoming fully productive, if at all. If we are unable to develop sufficient numbers of productive direct sales personnel, our growth may be impeded.\nIn addition to our direct sales force, we have developed, and expect to expand, our indirect sales force via channel partners, such as management consulting firms, systems integrators and other resellers, to market, sell and/or implement our solutions. We anticipate that channel partners will become an increasingly important driver of our sales growth, particularly as more channel partners become resellers of our solutions. We expect to invest significant resources to identify, establish, train and retain successful strategic resell partner relationships. If we are unable to establish and maintain our partner relationships, or otherwise develop and expand our indirect distribution channel, our sales growth rates may be limited.\nRegulatory, Compliance and Litigation Risks\nEvolving data privacy, cyber security and data localization laws impact our business and expose us to increased liability.\nPersonal privacy, data localization and data security have become significant issues in the United States, Europe, and in many other jurisdictions. We provide our cloud software solutions globally, including in countries that have, or may adopt in the future, stringent data privacy, cyber security or data localization laws. For example, the EU\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d) imposes substantial requirements regarding the handling of personal data and provides for robust regulatory enforcement and sanctions for non-compliance. As another example, the California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d) provides data privacy rights for consumers which creates new and uncertain operational requirements for our business.\nPrivacy, data localization and data security laws may be subject to interpretation, may be applied differently across jurisdictions resulting in inconsistent or conflicting requirements, and are likely to continue to evolve in the future. For example, in July 2020 the Court of Justice of the European Union (\"CJEU\") invalidated the U.S./EU Privacy Shield framework that allowed participating companies to transfer personal data from EU member states to the U.S. While we instead rely on Standard Contractual Clauses for such transfers, the CJEU ruling made clear that these transfer mechanisms will be subject to additional scrutiny. Although we have implemented measures designed to comply with the laws and regulations applicable to our business, our ongoing efforts to comply with the GDPR, the CCPA and other changes in laws and regulations entail substantial expenses and may divert resources from other initiatives. These changes have in the past increased, and may continue to increase, our cost of providing our products and services, could limit us from offering certain solutions in certain jurisdictions, could adversely affect our sales cycles, and could impact our new technology innovation. In addition, our cloud software solutions store data on behalf of our customers, and if our customers fail to comply with contractual obligations or applicable laws and regulations, such non-compliance could result in litigation or reputational harm to us. Any perceived\ninability to adequately address privacy, data localization or cyber security compliance or to comply with more complex and numerous laws and regulations, even if unfounded, could result in liability to us and indemnification obligations, damage our reputation, inhibit sales of our solutions or harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAny unauthorized, and potentially improper, actions of our personnel could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nThe recognition of our revenue depends on, among other things, the terms negotiated in our contracts with our customers. Our personnel may act outside of their authority and negotiate additional terms without our knowledge. We have implemented policies to help prevent and discourage such conduct, but there can be no assurance that such policies would be followed. For instance, in the event that our sales personnel negotiate terms that do not appear in the contract and of which we are unaware, whether such additional terms are written or verbal, we could be prevented from recognizing revenue in accordance with our plans. Furthermore, depending on when we learn of unauthorized actions and the size of the transactions involved, we may have to restate revenue for a previously reported period, which could seriously harm our business, operating results, financial condition and reputation with current and potential customers and investors.\nIntellectual property litigation and infringement claims may cause us to incur significant expense or prevent us from selling our software solutions.\nOur industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents, trademarks and copyrights, and by litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. A third-party may assert that our technology violates its intellectual property rights, or we may become the subject of a material intellectual property dispute. Selling improvement (including configure-price-quote), pricing, airline revenue optimization (including revenue management) and airline eCommerce (including shopping, merchandising and retail) solutions may become increasingly subject to infringement claims as the number of such commercially available solutions increases and the functionality of these solutions overlaps. In addition, changes in patent laws in the U.S. may affect the scope, strength and enforceability of our patent rights or the nature of proceedings which may be brought by us related to our patent rights. Future litigation may involve patent holding companies or other adverse patent owners who have no relevant product revenue and against whom our own potential patents may therefore provide little or no deterrence. Regardless of the merit of any particular claim that our technology violates the intellectual property rights of others, responding to such claims may require us to:\n\u2022incur substantial expenses and expend significant management efforts to defend such claims;\n\u2022pay damages, potentially including treble damages, if we are found to have willfully infringed such parties\u2019 patents or copyrights;\n\u2022cease making, selling or using products that are alleged to incorporate the intellectual property of others;\n\u2022distract management and other key personnel from performing their duties for us;\n\u2022enter into potentially unfavorable royalty or license agreements in order to obtain the right to use necessary technologies; and\n\u2022expend additional development resources to redesign our solutions.\nAny licenses required as a result of litigation under any patent may not be made available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. In addition, some licenses may be nonexclusive, and therefore our competitors may have access to the same technology licensed to us. If we fail to obtain a required license or are unable to design around a patent, we may be unable to effectively develop or market our solutions, which could limit our ability to generate revenue or maintain profitability.\nOur contract terms generally obligate us to indemnify and hold our customers harmless from certain costs arising from third-party claims brought against our customers alleging that the use of our solutions infringe intellectual property rights of others. If we are unable to resolve our legal obligations by settling or paying an infringement claim, we may be required to compensate our customers.\nOur use of open source software may subject our software solutions to general release or re-engineering.\nWe use open source software in our solutions. From time to time, there have been claims challenging the ownership of open source software against companies that incorporate open source software into their products. As a result, we could be\nsubject to lawsuits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software. Some open source licenses contain requirements that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon the open source software and that we license such modifications or derivative works under the terms of a particular open source license or other license granting third parties certain rights of further use. If we combine our proprietary software solutions with open source software in a certain manner, we could, under certain of the open source licenses, be required to release the source code of our proprietary software solutions. In addition to risks related to license requirements, usage of open source software can lead to greater risks than use of third-party commercial software, as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on origin of the software. In addition, open source license terms may be ambiguous and many of the risks associated with usage of open source cannot be eliminated, and could, if not properly addressed, negatively affect our business. If we were found to have inappropriately used open source software, we may be required to seek licenses from third parties in order to continue offering our software, to re-engineer our solutions, to discontinue the sale of our solutions in the event re-engineering cannot be accomplished on a timely basis or take other remedial action that may divert resources away from our development efforts, any of which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nDefects or errors in our software solutions could harm our reputation, impair our ability to sell our solutions and result in significant costs to us.\nOur software solutions are complex and may contain undetected defects or errors. Several of our solutions have recently been developed and may therefore be more likely to contain undetected defects or errors. In addition, we frequently develop enhancements to our software solutions that may contain defects. We have not suffered significant harm from any defects or errors to date. We have in the past issued, and may in the future need to issue, corrective releases of our solutions to correct defects or errors. The occurrence of any defects or errors could result in:\n\u2022delayed market acceptance and lost sales of our software solutions;\n\u2022delays in payment to us by customers;\n\u2022damage to our reputation;\n\u2022diversion of our resources;\n\u2022legal claims, including product liability claims, against us;\n\u2022increased maintenance and support expenses; and\n\u2022increased insurance costs.\nOur agreements with our customers typically contain provisions designed to limit our liability for defects and errors in our software solutions and damages relating to such defects and errors, but these provisions may not be enforced by a court or otherwise effectively protect us from legal claims. Our liability insurance may not be adequate to cover all of the costs resulting from these legal claims. Moreover, we cannot provide assurance that our current liability insurance coverage would continue to be available on acceptable terms. In addition, the insurer may deny coverage on any future claims. The successful assertion against us of one or more large claims that exceeds available insurance coverage, or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. Furthermore, even if we prevail in any litigation, we are likely to incur substantial costs and our management\u2019s attention may be diverted from our operations.\nBusiness Model and Capital Structure Risks\nWe incurred indebtedness by issuing convertible notes, and our debt repayment obligations may adversely affect our financial condition and cash flows from operations in the future.\nIn September 2020, we issued $150.0 million principal amount of 2.25% convertible senior notes (\"2027 Notes\") due September 15, 2027, unless earlier redeemed, purchased or converted in accordance with their terms prior to such date. Interest is payable semi-annually in arrears on March 15 and September 15 of each year. As of December 31, 2020, the entire $150.0 million of aggregate principal amount of 2027 Notes are outstanding.\nIn May 2019, we issued $143.8 million principal amount of 1.0% convertible senior notes (\"2024 Notes\" and together with the 2027 Notes, the \"Notes\") due May 15, 2024, unless earlier redeemed, purchased or converted in accordance with their\nterms prior to such date. Interest is payable semi-annually in arrears on May 15 and November 15 of each year. As of December 31, 2020, the entire $143.8 million of aggregate principal amount of 2024 Notes are outstanding.\nOur indebtedness could have important consequences because it may impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes. Our ability to meet our debt obligations will depend on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic, regulatory and other factors. We cannot control many of these factors. Our future operations may not generate sufficient cash to enable us to repay our debt. If we fail to comply with any covenants contained in the agreements governing any of our debt, or make a payment on any of our debt when due, we could be in default on such debt, which could, in turn, result in such debt and our other indebtedness becoming immediately payable in full. If we are at any time unable to pay our indebtedness when due, we may be required to renegotiate the terms of the indebtedness, seek to refinance all or a portion of the indebtedness, and/or obtain additional financing. There can be no assurance that, in the future, we will be able to successfully renegotiate such terms, that any such refinancing would be possible or that any additional financing could be obtained on terms that are favorable or acceptable to us.\nOur quarterly results may vary and may not fully reflect the performance of our business.\nWe generally recognize revenue from customers ratably over the terms of their subscription agreements. As a result, most of the revenue we report in each quarter is the result of agreements entered into during prior quarters. Consequently, a decline in new or renewed subscriptions in any quarter may not be reflected in our revenue for that quarter, but will negatively affect our revenue in future quarters. Accordingly, the effect of significant downturns in sales, our failure to achieve our internal sales targets, a decline in the market demand of our services or decreases in our retention rate may not be fully reflected in our operating results until future periods. For example, the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods. Our subscription model also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue through additional sales in any period, as subscription revenue from additional sales must be recognized over the applicable subscription term. We may be unable to timely adjust our cost structure to reflect changes in revenues. In addition, a significant majority of our costs are expensed as incurred, while subscription revenues are recognized over the term of the customer agreement. As a result, increased sales growth could result in our recognition of more costs than revenues in the earlier periods of the terms of our agreements. In addition, we expect to continue to experience some seasonal variations in our cash flows from operating activities, including, as a result of the timing of payment of payroll taxes, performance bonuses to our employees and costs associated with annual company-wide events, each of which have historically been highest in our first fiscal quarter. Therefore, the results of any prior quarterly periods should not be relied upon as an indication of our future operating performance.\nIf we fail to migrate customers with on-premises software licenses to our latest cloud software solutions, our future revenue may be limited and our costs to provide support to those customers may increase.\nCustomers with on-premises licenses for our legacy software may need to migrate to our current cloud solutions to take advantage of our latest features, functionality and security which are only available via the PROS cloud. Although we intend to continue to support our legacy on-premises software customers under perpetual licenses for the foreseeable future, we continue to focus on migrating such customers to our cloud solutions. Historically, customers who purchased on-premises licenses for our solutions may have invested substantial personnel and financial resources in our legacy software. In addition, when considering whether to migrate, these customers may evaluate alternative solutions due to the additional change management and implementation costs associated with migrating to cloud-based applications. When on-premises software customers delay or decline to migrate to our cloud solutions, our internal development and customer support teams find it increasingly difficult and costly to support a declining number of on-premises customers. In addition, if our legacy on-premises license customers delay or decline to migrate to our cloud solutions, choose alternative solutions or otherwise choose to not continue doing business with us by, for example, canceling maintenance, our future revenue may be limited.\nWe have experienced losses since we transitioned to a cloud strategy in 2015, and may continue to incur losses for longer than we expect.\nWe expect our expenses to continue to exceed our revenues in the near term as we continue to make investments as part of our cloud strategy, particularly in new product development, sales, marketing, security, privacy and cloud operations. Our ability to return to profitability depends on our ability to: continue to drive subscription sales, enhance our existing products and develop new products, scale our sales and marketing and product development organizations, successfully execute our marketing and sales strategies, renew our subscription agreements with existing customers, and manage our expenses. If we are not able to execute on these actions, our business may not grow as we anticipate, our operating results could be adversely affected and we may continue to incur net losses in the future. Additionally, our new initiatives may not generate sufficient\nrevenue and cash flows to recoup our investments in them. If any of these events were to occur, it could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets become impaired, we could be required to record a significant charge to earnings.\nUnder GAAP, we review our goodwill and amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. GAAP requires us to test for goodwill impairment at least annually. Factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable include declines in stock price, market capitalization or cash flows and slower growth rates in our industry. We could be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets were determined, negatively impacting our results of operations.\nRisks relating to Ownership of our Common Stock\nMarket volatility may affect our stock price and the value of your investment.\nThe market price for our common stock, and the software industry generally, has been and is likely to continue to be volatile. Volatility could make it difficult to trade shares of our common stock at predictable prices or times. Many factors could cause the market price of our common stock to be volatile, including the following:\n\u2022variations in our quarterly or annual operating results;\n\u2022decreases in market valuations of comparable companies;\n\u2022fluctuations in stock market prices and volumes;\n\u2022decreases in financial estimates by equity research analysts;\n\u2022announcements by our competitors of significant contracts, new solutions or enhancements, acquisitions, distribution partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n\u2022departure of key personnel;\n\u2022changes in governmental regulations and standards affecting the software industry and our software solutions;\n\u2022sales of common stock or other securities by us in the future;\n\u2022damages, settlements, legal fees and other costs related to litigation, claims and other contingencies;\n\u2022deterioration of the general U.S. and global economic condition; and\n\u2022other risks described elsewhere in this section.\nIn the past, securities class action litigation often has been initiated against a company following a period of volatility in the market price of the company\u2019s securities. If class action litigation is initiated against us, we may incur substantial costs and our management\u2019s attention could be diverted from our operations. All of these factors could cause the market price of our stock to decline, and you may lose some or all of your investment.\nOur directors, executive officers, and certain significant stockholders hold a significant portion of our outstanding shares.\nAt December 31, 2020, our directors and executive officers collectively control approximately 10% of our issued and outstanding common shares, and together with certain significant stockholders, including investment funds associated with Brown Capital Management, LLC, Vanguard Group Inc., BlackRock, Inc., Conestoga Capital Advisors, LLC and Fred Alger Management, LLC, control approximately 53% of our issued and outstanding common shares. In the event that these stockholders each independently decided to vote for or against matters requiring stockholder approval, they could influence such matters in ways that may not align with your specific interests as a stockholder, including the election of directors and\napproval of significant corporate transactions. This concentration of ownership could affect the market price of our shares if there is a sale by this group of stockholders, and could also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of us even if such change of control could be beneficial to you as a stockholder.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of us more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws and Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law contain provisions that might enable our management to resist a takeover of our company. These provisions include the following:\n\u2022the division of our board of directors into three classes to be elected on a staggered basis, one class each year;\n\u2022a prohibition on actions by written consent of our stockholders;\n\u2022the elimination of the right of stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders;\n\u2022a requirement that stockholders provide advance notice of any stockholder nominations of directors or any proposal of new business to be considered at any meeting of stockholders;\n\u2022a requirement that a supermajority vote be obtained to amend or repeal certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation; and\n\u2022the ability of our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval.\nIn addition, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which limits the ability of stockholders owning in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock to merge or combine with us. Although we believe these provisions collectively provide for an opportunity to obtain higher bids by requiring potential acquirors to negotiate with our board of directors, they would apply even if an offer were considered beneficial by some stockholders. In addition, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future.\nWe do not currently anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. We currently anticipate that we will retain all of our available cash, if any, for use as working capital, repayment of debt and for other general corporate purposes. Consequently, stockholders must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation as the only way to realize any future gains on their investment.",

Properties\nOur headquarters are located in Houston, Texas, where we lease approximately 118,000 square feet of office space; however, due to COVID-19 our workforce remained primarily remote during most of the year. We also lease a number of smaller regional offices. We believe our existing facilities are sufficient for our current needs. Based on the effectiveness of our all remote workforce during COVID-19, we plan to evolve to a virtual first workforce over time post-pandemic which we expect will impact our needs for leased office space. However, we may add new facilities and expand our existing facilities as we add employees, and we believe that suitable additional or substitute space will be available as needed to accommodate any such expansion of our operations.",

    "item_7": "Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nExecutive Summary\nIn 2020, we continued to grow through our subscription-based revenue model, by enabling our customers to leverage our AI-driven solutions to help them compete in the digital economy, while managing the impact of the coronavirus (\"COVID-19\") pandemic. Notable items for 2020 included:\n\u2022Subscription revenue increased by 17% in 2020 over 2019, and accounted for 68%, 58% and 50% of total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively;\n\u2022Recurring revenue, which consists of subscription and maintenance and support revenue, accounted for 85% of our total revenue and grew by 6% in 2020 over 2019;\n\u2022Annual recurring revenue (\"ARR\") was $209.7 million as of December 31, 2020, down 5% year-over-year;\n\u2022Designated as a 2020-2021 Great Place to Work-Certified\u2122 company;\n\u2022Delivered the record-breaking, virtual PROS 2020 Outperform Customer Conference, with registration exceeding more than 600% as compared with our 2019 Outperform conference;\n\u2022Completed an offering of $150.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2027 Notes in a private placement in September 2020.\nWhile COVID-19 continued to spread throughout the world, our focus remained on promoting employee health and safety, serving our customers and ensuring business continuity. As a result, we directed our teams to work from home, suspend travel and replaced historically in-person events such as our Outperform conference with digital events. For further discussion of the possible impact of COVID-19 to our business and our response, please see our Risk Factors under Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and \"Pandemic Response\" under Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nARR is one of our key performance metrics to assess the health and trajectory of our overall business. ARR, a non-GAAP financial measure, is defined, as of a specific date, as contracted recurring revenue, including contracts with a future start date, together with annualized overage fees incurred above contracted minimum transactions, and excluding perpetual and term license agreements recognized as license revenue in accordance with GAAP. ARR should be viewed independently of revenue, deferred revenue and other GAAP measures, and is not intended to be combined with any of these items. Total ARR as of December 31, 2020 was $209.7 million, down from $219.8 million as of December 31, 2019, a decrease of 5%, due to the impact of COVID-19.\nCash used in operating activities was $49.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to cash provided by operating activities of $5.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nFree cash flow is another key metric to assess the strength of our business. We define free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities minus capital expenditures (excluding expenditures for PROS new headquarters), purchases of other (non-acquisition-related) intangible assets and capitalized internal-use software development costs. We believe free cash flow may be useful to investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating the amount of cash generated by our business operations. Free cash flow used for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $53.3 million, compared to $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The following is a reconciliation of free cash flow to the most comparable GAAP measure, net cash provided by (used in) operating activities:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2019\nNet cash provided by operating activities $ (49,389) $ 5,245\nPurchase of property and equipment (excluding new headquarters) (2,248) (4,626)\nPurchase of intangible asset - (50)\nCapitalized internal-use software development costs (1,686) (1,436)\nFree cash flow $ (53,323) $ (867)\nFinancial Performance Summary\nRecurring revenue, which is comprised of our subscription and maintenance and support revenue, accounted for 85% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020. Total recurring revenue was $215.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to $203.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of approximately $11.7 million, or 6%. This increase in recurring revenue was primarily attributable to a 17% increase in subscription revenue from new and existing customers.\nRevenue by Geography\nGeographic revenue is categorized based on the location of our customers' headquarters, and for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, is as follows:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2019 2018\nRevenue Percent Revenue Percent Revenue Percent\nUnited States of America $ 82,299 32 % $ 85,963 34 % $ 68,482 35 %\nEurope 74,936 30 % 73,914 30 % 60,947 31 %\nThe rest of the world 95,189 38 % 90,457 36 % 67,595 34 %\nTotal revenue $ 252,424 100 % $ 250,334 100 % $ 197,024 100 %\nConvertible Debt\nIn September 2020, we issued the 2027 Notes in an aggregate principal amount of $150.0 million. The interest rate for the 2027 Notes is fixed at 2.25% per year and interest is payable semiannually in arrears in cash on March 15 and September 15 of each year, beginning on March 15, 2021. The 2027 Notes mature on September 15, 2027 unless redeemed or converted in accordance with their terms prior to such date.\nIn May 2019, we issued the 2024 Notes in an aggregate principal amount of $143.8 million. We used a portion of the net proceeds of the offering of the 2024 Notes to exchange and retire approximately $122.1 million in aggregate principal of 2.0% convertible senior notes due December 2019 (the \"2019 Notes\") for an aggregate cash consideration of $76.0 million and approximately 2.2 million shares of our common stock (the \"Exchange Transactions\"). We recorded a $2.3 million loss on debt extinguishment related to the Exchange Transactions. In the fourth quarter of 2019, at maturity, we settled the remaining principal of the 2019 Notes in cash and distributed approximately 0.3 million shares of our common stock to the notes holders, which represented the conversion value in excess of the principal amount.\nIn August 2019, we issued a notice of redemption to the holders of our outstanding 2.0% convertible senior notes due June 2047 (the \"2047 Notes\"), and during the third and fourth quarter of 2019, we converted the entire aggregate principal of $106.3 million of the 2047 Notes and delivered approximately 2.3 million shares of our common stock upon conversion. We recorded a $3.4 million loss on debt extinguishment related to the Redemption. The loss on extinguishment is included in the other (expense) income, net in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss).\nFactors Affecting Our Performance\nKey factors and trends that have affected and we believe will continue to affect our operating results include:\n\u2022COVID-19 Global Impact. The global economy has been significantly and negatively impacted by COVID-19, and the scope and duration of the outbreak and timeframe for economic recovery is uncertain. The travel industry, a sector served by our solutions, has been particularly adversely impacted. For example, unprecedented declines in travel demand have forced airlines, including some of our customers, to respond by significantly reducing capacity, grounding flights, reducing personnel, adjusting corporate liquidity and, in certain cases, filing for bankruptcy protection. The global workplace environment has also substantially changed in the wake of COVID-19. To support the health and well-being of our employees, customers, partners and communities, our global workforce has been primarily working remotely since March 16, 2020. Many of our customers are also working remotely, which in some cases has delayed, and may continue to impact the timing of new business and implementations of our solutions. The duration and extent of the impact of COVID-19 continues to be unknown and could continue to impact the pace and timing of adoption and implementation of our solutions, cash flow from operations and customer retention.\n\u2022COVID-19 Financial Impact. As compared to our expectations prior to COVID-19, the global economic impact of COVID-19 adversely impacted our revenue, bad debt expense and operating cash flow during the year ended December 31, 2020. We expect customer bookings and the related revenue and cash flows will continue to be lower than anticipated prior to the pandemic as a result of decreased demand for new subscriptions and services, delays to projects during the COVID-19 pandemic, and increased scrutiny on new large software purchases. In addition, certain customers have requested, and we expect will continue to request, relief to existing contracts and the impact of those is uncertain.\n\u2022Buying Preferences Driving Technology Adoption. Corporate buyers are increasingly demanding the same type of digital buying experience that they enjoy as consumers. Buyers often prefer not to interact with sales representatives as their primary source of research, and increasingly prefer to buy online when they have already decided what to buy. This trend has accelerated during the current pandemic environment. In response, we believe that businesses are increasingly modernizing their sales process to compete in digital commerce by adopting technologies which provide fast, frictionless, and personalized buying experiences across sales channels. We believe we are uniquely positioned to help power these buying experiences with our AI-powered solutions that enable buyers to move fluidly and with personalized experiences across our customers\u2019 direct sales, online, mobile and partner channels.\n\u2022Continued Investments. As a result of the economic impact of COVID-19, we are continuing to be measured in our investments and focused on cost control efforts across our organization, while continuing to create awareness for our solutions, expand our customer base and grow our subscription revenues. For example, we are slowing our overall rate of employee hiring, emphasizing hiring for strategic positions and cross training our travel implementation personnel to serve prospects and customers in other existing industry verticals. While we incurred losses in 2020, we believe our market is large and underpenetrated and intend to continue investing in sales, marketing, customer success, cloud support, security, privacy, infrastructure and other long-term initiatives to expand our ability to sell and renew our subscription offerings globally. We also plan to continue investing in product development to enhance our existing technologies, including initiatives to accelerate customer time-to-value and provide out-of-the-box integration with third-party commerce solutions, and develop new applications and technologies.\n\u2022Cloud Migrations. Sales of our cloud-based solutions have, and we expect future sales of our cloud-based solutions will continue to reduce our future maintenance and support revenue, as long-term customers continue to migrate from our legacy licensed solutions to our current cloud solutions.\nDescription of Key Components of our Operating Results\nRevenue\nWe derive our revenues primarily from recurring revenue, which includes subscription and maintenance and support services. Recurring revenues accounted for 85% of our total revenue in 2020.\nSubscription. Subscription revenue primarily consists of fees that give customers access to one or more of our cloud applications with related customer support. We primarily recognize subscription revenue ratably over the contractual term of the arrangement beginning with commencement of service. Subscription revenue related to certain offerings, where fees are based on a number of transactions, are recognized on a usage basis.\nMaintenance and support. Maintenance and support revenue includes customer support for our on-premises software and the right to unspecified software updates and enhancements. We recognize revenue from maintenance arrangements ratably over the period in which the services are provided. Our maintenance and support contracts are generally one year in length, billed annually in advance, and non-cancelable.\nServices. Services revenue primarily consists of fees for configuration services, consulting and training. We typically sell our services on either a fixed-fee or time-and-materials basis. Services revenue is generally recognized as the services are performed for time and material contracts, or on a proportional performance basis for fixed-price contracts. The majority of our services contracts are on a fixed-fee basis. Training revenues are recognized as the services are performed.\nServices revenue varies from period to period depending on different factors, including the level of services required to implement our solutions, the timing of services revenue recognition on certain subscription contracts and any additional services requested by our customers during a particular period.\nSignificant judgments are required in determining whether services that are contained in our customer subscription contracts are considered distinct, including whether the services are capable of being distinct and whether they are separately identifiable. Services deemed to be distinct are accounted for as a separate performance obligation and revenue is recognized as the services are performed. If determined services are not considered distinct, the services and the subscription are determined to be a single performance obligation and revenue is recognized over the contractual term of the subscription beginning on the date that subscription services are made available to the customer.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of subscription. Cost of subscription consists of infrastructure costs to support our current subscription customer base including third-party hosting services and expenses related to operating our network infrastructure, including depreciation expense and operating lease payments, salaries and related expenses, amortization of capitalized software and an allocation of depreciation, amortization of certain intangible assets and allocated overhead.\nCost of maintenance and support. Cost of maintenance and support consists largely of employee-related costs and an allocation of depreciation, amortization of intangibles, and allocated overhead.\nCost of services. Cost of services includes those costs related to services and implementation of our solutions, primarily employee-related costs and third-party contractors, billable and non-billable travel and an allocation of depreciation and allocated overhead. Cost of providing services may vary from quarter to quarter depending on a number of factors, including the amount of services required to implement and configure our solutions.\nServices gross profit varies period to period depending on different factors, including the level of services required to implement our solutions, our mix of employees and third-party contractors, our effective billable man-day rates, our use of third-party system integrators and the billable utilization of our services personnel.\nOperating Expenses\nSelling and marketing. Selling and marketing expenses primarily consist of employee-related costs, third-party contractors, sales commissions, sales and marketing programs such as lead generation programs, company awareness programs, our annual Outperform conference, participation in industry trade shows, and other sales and marketing programs, travel, amortization expenses associated with acquired intangible assets and allocated overhead. Sales commissions are deferred and amortized on a straight-line basis over the period of benefit, which we have determined to be five to eight years.\nGeneral and administrative. General and administrative expenses primarily consist of employee-related costs for executive, accounting, finance, legal, human resources and internal IT support functions and an allocation of depreciation and allocated overhead. General and administrative expenses also include outside legal and accounting fees and provision for bad debts.\nResearch and development. Research and development expenses primarily consist of employee-related costs and third-party contractors who work on enhancements of existing solutions, the development of new solutions, scientific research, quality assurance and testing, and an allocation of depreciation, facilities and allocated overhead.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of year ended December 31, 2020 with year ended December 31, 2019\nRevenue:\nFor the Year Ended December 31,\n2020 2019\n(Dollars in thousands) Amount Percentage of total revenue Amount Percentage of total revenue Variance $ Variance %\nSubscription\n$ 170,473 67 % $ 145,327 58 % $ 25,146 17 %\nMaintenance and support\n44,692 18 % 58,184 23 % (13,492) (23) %\nTotal subscription, maintenance and support 215,165 85 % 203,511 81 % 11,654 6 %\nServices\n37,259 15 % 46,823 19 % (9,564) (20) %\nTotal revenue $ 252,424 100 % $ 250,334 100 % $ 2,090 1 %\nSubscription revenue. Subscription revenue increased primarily due to an increased number of customer subscription contracts as compared to the prior year. For the year ended December 31, 2020, our subscription revenue was negatively impacted by a decrease in customer revenue retention attributed to the impact of COVID-19, and primarily driven by the impact of COVID-19 on our travel customers. Our ability to maintain consistently high customer retention rates will directly impact our ability to continue to grow our subscription revenue. Due to the ongoing uncertain economic conditions caused by COVID-19, we expect subscription revenue to grow at a slower pace in the near term.\nMaintenance and support revenue. Maintenance and support revenue decreased primarily as a result of existing maintenance customers migrating to our cloud solutions and a decrease in customer retention due to the impact of COVID-19. We expect maintenance revenue to continue to decline as we continue to migrate maintenance customers to our cloud solutions.\nServices revenue. Services revenue decreased primarily as a result of lower sales of services related to subscription contracts than in 2019 due to the impact of COVID-19.\nCost of revenue and gross profit.\nFor the Year Ended December 31,\n2020 2019\n(Dollars in thousands) Amount Percentage of total\nrevenue Amount Percentage of total\nrevenue Variance $ Variance %\nCost of subscription\n$ 51,673 20 % $ 42,339 17 % $ 9,334 22 %\nCost of maintenance and support\n9,880 4 % 11,052 4 % (1,172) (11) %\nTotal cost of subscription, maintenance and support 61,553 24 % 53,391 21 % 8,162 15 %\nCost of services\n43,080 17 % 45,726 18 % (2,646) (6) %\nTotal cost of revenue $ 104,633 41 % $ 99,117 40 % $ 5,516 6 %\nGross profit $ 147,791 59 % $ 151,217 60 % $ (3,426) (2) %\nCost of subscription. Cost of subscription increased primarily due to increased infrastructure costs to support our current subscription customer base and increased employee-related costs driven by higher headcount. Our subscription gross profit percentage was 70% and 71%, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nCost of maintenance and support. Cost of maintenance and support declined primarily due to a decrease in personnel costs as a result of the need to support a smaller maintenance customer base as we migrate customers to our subscription solutions. Maintenance and support gross profit percentages for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, were 78% and 81%, respectively.\nCost of services. Cost of services decreased primarily due to the lower utilization of third-party contractors and reduced travel expenses due to the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by increased employee-related costs driven by higher headcount. Services gross profit percentages for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, were (16)% and 2%, respectively. The decrease in services gross profit percentages was primarily due to the decrease in services revenues and the increase in headcount.\nGross profit. Overall gross profit decreased for the year ended December 31, 2020 principally attributable to the slower growth in revenue due to the impact of COVID-19.\nOperating expenses:\nFor the Year Ended December 31,\n2020 2019\n(Dollars in thousands) Amount Percentage of total revenue Amount Percentage of total revenue Variance $ Variance %\nSelling and marketing $ 87,182 35 % $ 89,553 36 % $ (2,371) (3) %\nGeneral and administrative 51,075 20 % 47,254 19 % 3,821 8 %\nResearch and development 75,614 30 % 67,246 27 % 8,368 12 %\nAcquisition-related - - % 502 - % (502) (100) %\nTotal operating expenses $ 213,871 85 % $ 204,555 82 % $ 9,316 5 %\nSelling and marketing expenses. Sales and marketing expenses decreased primarily due to a decrease of travel expense of $7.0 million due to the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by an increase of $4.2 million in employee-related costs driven by higher sales and marketing headcount, as we continue to focus on adding new customers and increasing penetration within our existing customer base, an increase of $0.3 million in expenses for sales and marketing events, and a $0.1 million increase in allocated overhead.\nGeneral and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses increased primarily due to an increase of $5.3 million in bad debt expense recognized as a result of increased credit risk from uncertain economic conditions caused by COVID-19 and the bankruptcy of several customers in the travel industry, partially offset by a decrease in professional fees in 2020 as compared to 2019 related to our acquisition of Travelaer in 2019.\nResearch and development expenses. Research and development expenses increased primarily due to an increase of $8.3 million in employee-related costs driven by higher headcount and a slight increase in allocated overhead.\nAcquisition-related expenses. Acquisition-related expenses were $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, and consisted primarily of integration costs, professional fees and retention bonuses for our acquisition of Travelaer in 2019.\nOther income (expense), net:\nFor the Year Ended December 31,\n2020 2019\n(Dollars in thousands) Amount Percentage of total revenue Amount Percentage of total revenue Variance $ Variance %\nConvertible debt interest and amortization $ (11,125) (4) % $ (14,765) (6) % $ 3,640 (25) %\nOther income (expense), net $ 897 - % $ (354) - % $ 1,251 (353) %\nConvertible debt interest and amortization. Convertible debt interest and amortization expense for each of the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 related to coupon interest and amortization of debt discount and issuance costs attributable to our Notes. Convertible debt interest and amortization decreased primarily as a result of our settlement of the 2019 Notes and 2047 Notes during 2019, partially offset by an increase due to the issuance of our 2027 Notes in September 2020.\nOther income (expense), net. The change in other income (expense), net for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily related to a $5.7 million loss on debt extinguishment related to our 2019 Notes and 2047 Notes recognized in 2019 which was partially offset by a decrease in interest income during the period.\nIncome tax provision:\nFor the Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n(Dollars in thousands) 2020 2019 Variance $ Variance %\nEffective tax rate (0.9) % (0.9) % n/a - %\nIncome tax provision $ 676 $ 624 $ 52 8 %\nOur tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2020 included both foreign income and withholding taxes. No tax benefit was recognized on jurisdictions with a projected loss for the year due to the valuation allowances on our deferred tax assets.\nOur 2020 and 2019 effective tax rates had an unusual relationship to pretax loss from operations due to a valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets. Our income tax provisions in 2020 and 2019 only included foreign income and withholding taxes, resulting in an effective tax rate of (0.9)% and (0.9)%, respectively. The difference between the effective tax rates and the federal statutory rate of 21% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was primarily due to the increase in our valuation allowance of $24.3 million and $12.4 million, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had a valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets of $130.7 million and $106.5 million, respectively. The increase in the valuation allowance was principally attributable to an additional valuation allowance recorded on our current year's tax loss.\nComparison of year ended December 31, 2019 with year ended December 31, 2018\nAdditional information on fiscal 2018 items, including discussion of the year-over-year comparisons between 2019 and 2018 that are not included in this Form 10-K, can be found in \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, filed with the SEC on February 19, 2020.\nRevenue:\nFor the Year Ended December 31,\n2019 2018\n(Dollars in thousands) Amount Percentage of total revenue Amount Percentage of total revenue Variance $ Variance %\nSubscription $ 145,327 58 % $ 98,708 50 % $ 46,619 47 %\nMaintenance and support 58,184 23 % 64,760 33 % (6,576) (10) %\nTotal subscription, maintenance and support 203,511 81 % 163,468 83 % 40,043 24 %\nServices 46,823 19 % 33,556 17 % 13,267 40 %\nTotal revenue $ 250,334 100 % $ 197,024 100 % $ 53,310 27 %\nCost of revenue and gross profit:\nFor the Year Ended December 31,\n2019 2018\n(Dollars in thousands) Amount Percentage of total\nrevenue Amount Percentage of total\nrevenue Variance $ Variance %\nCost of subscription\n$ 42,339 17 % $ 35,619 18 % $ 6,720 19 %\nCost of maintenance and support\n11,052 4 % 11,602 6 % (550) (5) %\nTotal cost of subscription, maintenance and support 53,391 21 % 47,221 24 % 6,170 13 %\nCost of services\n45,726 18 % 29,958 15 % 15,768 53 %\nTotal cost of revenue $ 99,117 40 % $ 77,179 39 % $ 21,938 28 %\nGross profit $ 151,217 60 % $ 119,845 61 % $ 31,372 26 %\nOperating expenses:\nFor the Year Ended December 31,\n2019 2018\n(Dollars in thousands) Amount Percentage of total revenue Amount Percentage of total revenue Variance $ Variance %\nSelling and marketing $ 89,553 36 % $ 72,006 37 % $ 17,547 24 %\nGeneral and administrative 47,254 19 % 41,302 21 % 5,952 14 %\nResearch and development 67,246 27 % 55,657 28 % 11,589 21 %\nAcquisition-related 502 - % 95 - % 407 428 %\nTotal operating expenses $ 204,555 82 % $ 169,060 86 % $ 35,495 21 %\nOther (expense) income, net:\nFor the Year Ended December 31,\n2019 2018\n(Dollars in thousands) Amount Percentage of total revenue Amount Percentage of total revenue Variance $ Variance %\nConvertible debt interest and amortization $ (14,765) (6) % $ (16,986) (9) % $ 2,221 (13) %\nOther (expense) income, net $ (354) - % $ 2,155 1 % $ (2,509) (116) %\nIncome tax provision:\nFor the Year Ended December 31,\n(Dollars in thousands) 2019 2018 Variance $ Variance %\nEffective tax rate (1) % - % n/a (1) %\nIncome tax provision $ 624 $ 200 $ 424 212 %\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAt December 31, 2020, we had $329.1 million of cash and cash equivalents and $246.4 million of working capital as compared to $306.1 million of cash and cash equivalents and $189.8 million of working capital at December 31, 2019.\nOur principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents, cash flows generated from operations and potential borrowings under our $50 million secured Credit Agreement (\"Revolver\") with the lenders party thereto and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association as agent for the lenders party thereto. The facility expires in July 2022. We issued the 2027 Notes in September 2020, the 2024 Notes in May 2019 and completed our Secondary Offering in August 2018 to supplement our overall liquidity position. Our material drivers or variants of operating cash flow are net income (loss), noncash expenses (principally share-based compensation, intangible amortization and amortization of debt discount and issuance costs) and the timing of periodic invoicing and cash collections related to licenses, subscriptions and support for our software and related services. Our operating cash flows are also impacted by the timing of payments to our vendors and the payments of our other liabilities and customer concessions. We generally pay our vendors and service providers in accordance with the invoice terms and conditions.\nWe believe our existing cash, cash equivalents, including funds available under our Revolver, and our current estimates of future operating cash flows, will provide adequate liquidity and capital resources to meet our operational requirements, anticipated capital expenditures and coupon interest payments for our Notes for the next twelve months. Our future working capital requirements will depend on many factors, including the operations of our existing business, potential growth of our subscription services, future acquisitions we might undertake, expansion into complementary businesses and the impact of COVID-19, including the pace and timing of adoption and implementation of our solutions, relief to existing contracts and customer retention. If such need arises, we may raise additional funds through equity or debt financings. However, the recent COVID-19 pandemic caused some disruption in the capital markets and further disruption could make financing more difficult and/or expensive and we may not be able to obtain such financing on terms acceptable to us or at all. During the period of uncertainty and volatility related to COVID-19, we will continue to monitor our liquidity.\nThe following table presents key components of our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018:\nFor the Year Ended December 31,\n(Dollars in thousands) 2020 2019 2018\nNet cash (used in) provided by operating activities $ (49,389) $ 5,245 $ 5,703\nNet cash used in investing activities (30,460) (17,560) (6,258)\nNet cash provided by financing activities 102,914 22,991 135,352\nCash and cash equivalents (beginning of period) 306,077 295,476 160,505\nCash and cash equivalents (end of period) $ 329,134 $ 306,077 $ 295,476\nOperating Activities\nCash used in operating activities in 2020 was $49.4 million and increased as compared to cash provided by operating activities in 2019 of $5.2 million. The increase was primarily attributable to higher cash operating expenses driven mainly by an increase in headcount year-over-year, higher annual incentive payment as compared to 2019, customer requests during the pandemic to defer payments into 2021, and a decrease in customer revenue retention attributed to the impact of COVID-19.\nCash provided by operating activities in 2019 was $5.2 million and declined slightly as compared to $5.7 million in 2018. The decrease was primarily attributable to higher cash operating expenses driven mainly by an increase in headcount and partially offset by an increase in sales and related cash collections.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities for 2020 of $30.5 million was primarily due to $28.5 million of capital expenditures mainly attributable to the build out of our new headquarters which was committed prior to the pandemic. In addition, we incurred capitalized internal-use software development costs on our subscription solutions of $1.7 million, and investment in equity securities of $0.3 million.\nNet cash used in investing activities for 2019 was $17.6 million, which was primarily related to our acquisition of Travelaer. In addition, we incurred capitalized internal-use software development costs on our subscription service solutions of $1.4 million, capital expenditures of $5.3 million, investment in equity securities of $0.3 million and intangible (non-acquisition) asset of $0.1 million.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities for 2020 was $102.9 million, which was attributable to the proceeds of $146.9 million from the issuance of our 2027 Notes and proceeds from the exercise of employee stock plans of $2.8 million, partially offset by the purchase of Capped Call of $25.3 million, a payment of $20.5 million for tax withholdings on vesting of employee share-based awards and a $1.0 million payment for debt issuance costs related to the 2027 Notes.\nNet cash provided by financing activities for 2019 was $23.0 million, which was attributable to the proceeds of $140.2 million from the issuance of our 2024 Notes, proceeds from the bond hedge termination of $64.8 million and proceeds from the exercise of employee stock plans of $2.0 million, which was partially offset by the settlement of our 2019 and 2047 Notes of $97.7 million, termination of warrant of $45.2 million, a payment of $23.8 million for tax withholdings on vesting of employee share-based awards, the purchase of Capped Call of $16.4 million and a $0.9 million payment for debt issuance costs related to the 2024 Notes.\nStock Repurchases\nIn August 2008, our Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program for the purchase of up to $15.0 million of our common stock. No shares were repurchased under the program during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, $10.0 million remained available in the stock repurchase program. The repurchase of stock, if continued, will be funded primarily with existing cash balances. The timing of any repurchases will depend upon various factors including, but not limited to, market conditions, the market price of our common stock and management\u2019s assessment of our liquidity and cash flow needs. For additional information on the stock repurchase program see Item 5, \"Market for Registrant\u2019s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.\"\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations\nWe do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as variable interest entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. Our principal commitments as of December 31, 2020 consist of obligations under operating leases and various service agreements. See Note 18 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our contractual commitments.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table sets forth our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2020:\nPayment due by period\n(Dollars in thousands) Total Less than 1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years More than 5 years\nNotes, including interest $ 322,350 $ 4,813 $ 9,625 $ 151,162 $ 156,750\nOperating leases 72,882 9,580 21,752 9,683 31,867\nPurchase and contractual commitments 39,259 30,148 9,111 - -\nTotal contractual obligations $ 434,491 $ 44,541 $ 40,488 $ 160,845 $ 188,617\nNotes\nAs of December 31, 2020, our outstanding Notes consist of the 2024 and 2027 Notes. Interest on the 2024 Notes is payable semi-annually, in arrears on May 15 and November 15 of each year. Interest on the 2027 Notes is payable semiannually in arrears in cash on March 15 and September 15 of each year, beginning on March 15, 2021. At December 31, 2020, our maximum commitment for interest payments under the 2024 and 2027 Notes was $28.6 million for their remaining duration.\nCovenants\nOur Revolver contains affirmative and negative covenants, including covenants which restrict our ability to, among other things, create liens, incur additional indebtedness and engage in certain other transactions, in each case subject to certain exclusions. In addition, our Revolver contains certain financial covenants which become effective in the event our liquidity falls below $50 million or upon the occurrence of an event of default. As of December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with all financial covenants in the Revolver.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nWe believe the critical accounting policies listed below affect significant judgment and estimates used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe derive our revenues primarily from subscription services, services and associated software maintenance and support services.\nWe determine revenue recognition through the following steps:\n\u2022Identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer;\n\u2022Identification of the performance obligations in the customer contract(s);\n\u2022Determination of the transaction price;\n\u2022Allocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation in the customer contract(s); and\n\u2022Recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation.\nSubscription revenue\nSubscription revenue primarily consists of fees that give customers access to one or more of our cloud applications with related customer support. We primarily recognize subscription revenue ratably over the contractual term of the arrangement beginning with commencement of service. Subscription revenue related to certain offerings, where fees are based on a number of transactions, are recognized on a usage basis.\nMaintenance and support revenue\nMaintenance and support revenue includes customer support for our on-premises software and the right to unspecified software updates and enhancements. We recognize revenue from maintenance arrangements ratably over the period in which the services are provided. Our maintenance and support contracts are generally one year in length, billed annually in advance, and non-cancelable.\nServices revenue\nServices revenue primarily consists of fees for configuration services, consulting and training. We typically sell our services on either a fixed-fee or time-and-materials basis. Services revenue is generally recognized as the services are performed for time and material contracts, or on a proportional performance basis for fixed-price contracts. The majority of our services contracts are on a fixed-fee basis. Training revenues are recognized as the services are performed.\nSignificant judgments are required in determining whether services that are contained in our customer subscription contracts are considered distinct, including whether the services are capable of being distinct and whether they are separately identifiable. Services deemed to be distinct are accounted for as a separate performance obligation and revenue is recognized as the services are performed. If determined services are not considered distinct, the services and the subscription are determined to be a single performance obligation and revenue is recognized over the contractual term of the subscription beginning on the date that subscription services are made available to the customer.\nCustomer contracts with multiple performance obligations\nA portion of our customer contracts contain multiple performance obligations. Significant judgment is required in determining whether multiple performance obligations contained in a single customer contract are capable of being distinct and are separately identifiable. An obligation determined to be distinct is accounted for as a separate performance obligation and revenue for that separate performance obligation is recognized when, or as, we satisfy the performance obligation. If obligations are not determined to be distinct, those obligations are accounted for as a single, combined performance obligation. The transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation on a relative standalone selling price basis.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nIn addition to our initial credit evaluations upon entering into a new customer contract, we regularly assess our ability to collect outstanding customer invoices. The allowance is based on both specific and general reserves. To do so, we make estimates of the collectability of accounts receivable. We provide an allowance for doubtful accounts when we determine that the collection of an outstanding customer receivable is not probable. We regularly review our trade receivables allowance by considering factors such as historical experience, the age of the trade receivable balances and current economic conditions that may affect a customer\u2019s ability to pay.\nDeferred Costs\nSales commissions earned by our sales representatives are considered incremental and recoverable costs of obtaining a customer contract. Sales commissions are deferred and amortized on a straight-line basis over the period of benefit, which we have determined to be five to eight years. We determined the period of benefit by taking into consideration our customer contracts, expected renewals of those customer contracts (as we currently do not pay an incremental sales commission for renewals), our technology and other factors. We also defer amounts earned by employees other than sales representatives who earn incentive payments under compensation plans tied to the value of customer contracts acquired.\nDeferred Implementation Costs\nWe capitalize certain contract fulfillment costs, including personnel and other costs (such as hosting, employee salaries, benefits and payroll taxes), that are associated with arrangements where services are not distinct from other undelivered obligations in our customer contracts. We analyze implementation costs and capitalize those costs that are directly related to customer contracts that are expected to be recoverable and enhance the resources which will be used to satisfy the undelivered performance obligations in those contracts. Deferred implementation costs are amortized ratably over the remaining contract term once the revenue recognition criteria for the respective performance obligation has been met and revenue recognition commences.\nDeferred Revenue\nDeferred revenue primarily consists of customer invoicing in advance of revenues being recognized. We generally invoice our customers annually in advance for subscription services and maintenance and support services. Deferred revenue that is anticipated to be recognized during the next twelve-month period is recorded as current deferred revenue and the remaining portion is recorded as noncurrent.\nNoncash Share-Based Compensation\nWe have two noncash share-based compensation plans, the 2007 equity incentive plan and the 2017 equity incentive plan which authorize the discretionary granting of various types of stock awards to key employees, officers, directors and consultants. Our 2007 equity incentive plan expired in March 2017, and in May 2017, we adopted our 2017 equity incentive plan which serves as the successor to our 2007 equity incentive plan. Under the 2017 equity incentive plan, we may provide noncash share-based compensation through the grant of: (i) restricted stock awards; (ii) restricted stock unit awards - time, performance and market-based (\"RSUs\"); (iii) stock options; (iv) stock appreciation rights (\"SARs\"); (v) phantom stock; and (vi) performance awards, such as market stock units (\"MSUs\"). To date, we have granted stock options, SARs, RSUs and MSUs.\nNoncash share-based compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period.\nThe fair value of the RSUs (time and performance-based) is based on the closing price of our stock on the date of grant. The fair value and the derived service period of the market-based RSUs is estimated on the date of grant using a Monte Carlo simulation model. The model requires the use of a number of assumptions including the expected volatility of our stock, our risk-free interest rate and expected dividends. Our expected volatility at the date of grant is based on our historical volatility over the performance period.\nWe estimate the fair value of the stock options and SARs using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, which requires us to use significant judgment to make estimates regarding the expected life of the award, volatility of our stock price, the risk-free interest rate and the dividend yield of our stock over the life of the award. The expected life of the award is a historical weighted average of the expected lives of similar securities of comparable public companies. We estimate volatility using our historical volatility. The risk-free interest rate assumption is based on observed interest rates appropriate for the terms of our awards. The dividend yield assumption is based on our expectation of paying no dividends.\nAs we issue stock options and SARs, we evaluate the assumptions used to value our stock option awards and SARs. If factors change and we employ different assumptions, noncash share-based compensation expense may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the past. If there are any modifications or cancellations of the underlying unvested securities, we may be required to accelerate, increase or cancel any remaining unearned noncash share-based compensation expense. Future noncash share-based compensation expense and unearned noncash share-based compensation will increase to the extent that we grant additional equity awards to employees.\nWe estimate the number of awards that will be forfeited and recognize expense only for those awards that ultimately are expected to vest. Significant judgment is required in determining the adjustment to noncash share-based compensation expense for estimated forfeitures. Noncash share-based compensation expense in a period could be impacted, favorably or unfavorably, by differences between forfeiture estimates and actual forfeitures.\nMSUs are performance-based awards that cliff vest based on our shareholder return relative to the total shareholder return of the Russell 2000 Index (\"Index\") over the three-year periods ending February 28, 2020, October 9, 2020 and December 31, 2020 (\"Performance Period\"), respectively. The MSUs vested on March 1, 2020 and October 9, 2020 and are\nscheduled to vest on January 10, 2021, respectively. The maximum number of shares issuable upon vesting is 200% of the MSUs initially granted based on the average price of our common stock relative to the Index during the Performance Period. We estimate the fair value of MSUs on the date of grant using a Monte Carlo simulation model. The determination of the fair value of the MSUs is affected by our stock price and a number of assumptions including the expected volatilities of our stock and the Index, the risk-free interest rate and expected dividends. Our expected volatility at the date of grant was based on the historical volatilities of our stock and the Index over the Performance Period.\nWe record deferred tax assets for share-based compensation awards that will result in future deductions on our income tax returns, based on the amount of share-based compensation recognized at the statutory tax rate in the jurisdiction in which we will receive a tax deduction. Because the deferred tax assets we record are based upon the share-based compensation expenses in a particular jurisdiction, the aforementioned inputs that affect the fair values of our stock awards may also indirectly affect our income tax expense. In addition, differences between the deferred tax assets recognized for financial reporting purposes and the actual tax deduction reported on our income tax returns are recorded in our income tax (expense) income.\nAt December 31, 2020, we had $55.9 million of total unrecognized compensation costs related to noncash share-based compensation arrangements for stock awards granted. These costs will be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.5 years.\nAccounting for Income Taxes\nWe estimate our income taxes based on the various jurisdictions where we conduct business and we use estimates in determining our provision for income taxes. We estimate separately our deferred tax assets, related valuation allowances, current tax liabilities and deferred tax liabilities. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax rules and the potential for future adjustment of our uncertain tax positions by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service or other taxing jurisdictions. We estimate our current tax liability and assess temporary differences that result from differing treatments of certain items for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which we show on our balance sheet. At December 31, 2020, our deferred tax assets consisted primarily of temporary differences related to noncash share-based compensation, interest expense limited under Section 163(j), Research and Experimentation (\"R&E\") tax credit carryforwards and net operating losses.\nWe review the realizability of our deferred tax asset on a quarterly basis, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that a review is required. In determining the requirement for a valuation allowance, the historical and projected financial results of the legal entity or consolidated group recording the net deferred tax asset are considered, along with any other positive or negative evidence. Since future financial results may differ from previous estimates, periodic adjustments to our valuation allowances may be necessary. We continually perform an analysis related to the realizability of our deferred tax assets. As a result, and after considering tax planning initiatives and other positive and negative evidence, we determine that it is more likely than not that our net deferred tax assets will not be realized. During 2020, there was not sufficient positive evidence to outweigh the current and historic negative evidence to determine that it was more likely than not that our net deferred tax assets would not be realized. Therefore, we continue to have a valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2020.\nWe account for uncertain income tax positions recognized in our financial statements in accordance with the Income Tax Topic of the Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\"), issued by the FASB. This interpretation requires companies to use a prescribed model for assessing the financial recognition and measurement of all tax positions taken or expected to be taken in their tax returns. This guidance provides clarification on recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosures and transition. Please see Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe record tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations under the purchase method of accounting. Amounts paid for each acquisition are allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values at the date of acquisition. We then allocate the purchase price in excess of net tangible assets acquired to identifiable intangible assets based on detailed valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management. We allocate any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed to goodwill. If the fair value of the assets acquired exceeds our purchase price, the excess is recognized as a gain.\nSignificant management judgments and assumptions are required in determining the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities, particularly acquired intangible assets. The valuation of purchased intangible assets is based upon estimates of the future performance and cash flows from the acquired business. Each asset is measured at fair value from the perspective of a market participant.\nIf different assumptions are used, it could materially impact the purchase price allocation and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nIntangible Assets, Goodwill and Long-Lived Assets\nWhen we acquire a business, a portion of the purchase consideration is typically allocated to acquired technology and other identifiable intangible assets, such as customer relationships. The excess of the purchase consideration over the net of the acquisition-date fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. We estimate fair value primarily utilizing the market approach, which calculates fair value based on the market values of comparable companies or comparable transactions. The amounts allocated to acquired technology and other intangible assets represent our estimates of their fair values at the acquisition date. We amortize our intangible assets that have finite lives using either the straight-line method or, if reliably determinable, the pattern in which the economic benefit of the asset is expected to be consumed utilizing expected undiscounted future cash flows. Amortization is recorded over the estimated useful lives ranging from two to eight years.\nWe review our intangible assets subject to amortization to determine if any adverse conditions exist or a change in circumstances has occurred that would indicate impairment or a change in the remaining useful life. If the carrying value of an asset exceeds its undiscounted cash flows, we will write down the carrying value of the intangible asset to its fair value in the period identified. In assessing recoverability, we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and discount rates. If these estimates or related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record impairment charges. If the estimate of an intangible asset\u2019s remaining useful life is changed, we will amortize the remaining carrying value of the intangible asset prospectively over the revised remaining useful life.\nWe assess goodwill for impairment as of November 30 of each fiscal year, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of our reporting unit has been reduced below its carrying value. When conducting our annual goodwill impairment assessment, we use a two-step process. The first step is to perform an optional qualitative evaluation as to whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting unit is less than its carrying value, using an assessment of relevant events and circumstances. In performing this assessment, we are required to make assumptions and judgments including, but not limited to, an evaluation of macroeconomic conditions as they relate to our business, industry and market trends, as well as the overall future financial performance of our reporting unit and future opportunities in the markets in which it operates. If we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting unit is less than its carrying value, we are not required to perform any additional tests in assessing goodwill for impairment. However, if we conclude otherwise or elect not to perform the qualitative assessment, we perform a second step for our reporting unit, consisting of a quantitative assessment of goodwill impairment. This quantitative assessment requires us to compare the fair value of our reporting unit with its carrying value. If the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, an impairment charge will be recognized, however, loss cannot exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report, regarding the impact of certain recent accounting pronouncements on our Consolidated Financial Statements.",
    "item_7A": "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk\nOur contracts are predominately denominated in U.S. dollars; however, we have contracts denominated in foreign currencies and therefore a portion of our revenue is subject to foreign currency risks. The primary market risk we face is from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Our cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The effect of an immediate 10% adverse change in exchange rates on foreign denominated receivables as of December 31, 2020, would have resulted in a $0.4 million loss. We are also exposed to foreign currency risk due to our operating subsidiaries in France, United Kingdom, Canada, Germany, Ireland, Australia, Bulgaria and United Arab Emirates. A hypothetical 10% adverse change in the value of the U.S. dollar in relation to the Euro, which is our single most significant\nforeign currency exposure, would have changed revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 by approximately $1.6 million. However, due to the relatively low volume of payments made and received through our foreign subsidiaries, we do not believe that we have significant exposure to foreign currency exchange risks. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could harm our financial results in the future.\nWe currently do not use derivative financial instruments to mitigate foreign currency exchange risks. We continue to review this issue and may consider hedging certain foreign exchange risks through the use of currency futures or options in future years.\nExposure to Interest Rates\nOur exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to the variable interest rate on borrowings under our Revolver. As of December 31, 2020, we had no borrowings under the Revolver.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had outstanding principal amounts of $150.0 million and $143.8 million of the 2027 and the 2024 Notes, respectively, which are fixed rate instruments. Therefore, our results of operations are not subject to fluctuations in interest rates. The fair value of the Notes may change when the market price of our stock fluctuates.\nWe believe that we do not have any material exposure to changes in the fair value as a result of changes in interest rates due to the short term nature of our cash equivalents.",

Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nAs of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based on that evaluation as of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act (i) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and (ii) is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe implemented internal controls to ensure we adequately evaluated our provisions for credit losses in light of the adoption of Topic 326 on January 1, 2020. There were no significant changes to our internal control over financial reporting due to the adoption of Topic 326.\nThere have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. We have not experienced any material impact to our internal controls over financial reporting despite the fact that our employees are working remotely due to COVID-19. We are continually monitoring and assessing the COVID-19 situation on our internal controls to minimize the impact on their design and operating effectiveness.\nManagement\u2019s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. Our internal control over financial reporting is a framework that includes policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nOur management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on the criteria in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2020 based upon the COSO criteria.\nThe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which is included herein.",

We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.\nChanges in Accounting Principles\nAs discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for leases in 2019 and the manner in which it accounts for revenues from contracts with customers in 2018.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and\nexpenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nRevenue recognition - Identifying distinct performance obligations within customer contracts\nAs described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, for the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recognized revenue of $252.4 million from customer contracts. A portion of these customer contracts contain multiple performance obligations. Significant judgment is required by management in determining whether multiple performance obligations contained in a single customer contract are capable of being distinct and are separately identifiable. An obligation determined to be distinct is accounted for as a separate performance obligation and revenue for that separate performance obligation is recognized when, or as, the Company satisfies the performance obligation. If obligations are not determined to be distinct, those obligations are accounted for as a single, combined performance obligation.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to identifying distinct performance obligations within customer contracts is a critical audit matter are the significant amount of judgment by management in determining whether multiple performance obligations contained in a single customer contract are capable of being distinct and are separately identifiable. This in turn led to significant auditor judgment and effort in performing procedures to evaluate whether the distinct performance obligations within a single customer contract were appropriately identified by management.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the revenue recognition process, including controls over the identification of distinct performance obligations. These procedures also included, among others, examining customer contracts on a test basis to identify whether the performance obligations were capable of being distinct and were separately identifiable, and evaluating management\u2019s conclusions through tests of underlying information.\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nSan Jose, California\nFebruary 12, 2021\nWe have served as the Company\u2019s auditor since 2002.\nPROS Holdings, Inc.\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\n(In thousands, except share and per share amounts)\nDecember 31,\n2020 2019\nAssets:\nCurrent assets:\nCash and cash equivalents $ 329,134 $ 306,077\nTrade and other receivables, net of allowance of $4,122 and $214, respectively\n49,578 65,074\nDeferred costs, current 5,941 5,756\nPrepaid and other current assets 9,647 9,038\nTotal current assets 394,300 385,945\nProperty and equipment, net 36,504 14,794\nOperating lease right-of-use assets 30,689 26,550\nDeferred costs, noncurrent 12,544 15,478\nIntangibles, net 8,341 14,605\nGoodwill 50,044 49,104\nOther assets, noncurrent 7,549 6,831\nTotal assets $ 539,971 $ 513,307\nLiabilities and Stockholders\u2019 Equity:\nCurrent liabilities:\nAccounts payable and other liabilities $ 4,246 $ 9,098\nAccrued liabilities 13,065 22,748\nAccrued payroll and other employee benefits 25,514 32,656\nOperating lease liabilities, current 5,937 7,173\nDeferred revenue, current 99,156 124,459\nTotal current liabilities 147,918 196,134\nDeferred revenue, noncurrent 11,372 17,801\nConvertible debt, net, noncurrent 218,028 110,704\nOperating lease liabilities, noncurrent 44,099 22,391\nOther liabilities, noncurrent 1,517 1,281\nTotal liabilities 422,934 348,311\nCommitments and contingencies (Note 18)\nStockholders\u2019 equity:\nPreferred stock, $0.001 par value, 5,000,000 shares authorized none issued\n- -\nCommon stock, $0.001 par value, 75,000,000 shares authorized; 48,142,267\nand 47,310,846 shares issued, respectively; 43,461,544 and 42,630,123 shares outstanding, respectively\n48 47\nAdditional paid-in capital 589,040 560,496\nTreasury stock, 4,680,723 common shares, at cost\n(29,847) (29,847)\nAccumulated deficit (438,773) (361,789)\nAccumulated other comprehensive loss (3,431) (3,911)\nTotal stockholders\u2019 equity 117,037 164,996\nTotal liabilities and stockholders\u2019 equity $ 539,971 $ 513,307\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.\nPROS Holdings, Inc.\nConsolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss)\n(In thousands, except per share data)\nFor the Year Ended December 31,\n2020 2019 2018\nRevenue:\nSubscription $ 170,473 $ 145,327 $ 98,708\nMaintenance and support 44,692 58,184 64,760\nTotal subscription, maintenance and support 215,165 203,511 163,468\nServices 37,259 46,823 33,556\nTotal revenue 252,424 250,334 197,024\nCost of revenue:\nSubscription 51,673 42,339 35,619\nMaintenance and support 9,880 11,052 11,602\nTotal cost of subscription, maintenance and support 61,553 53,391 47,221\nServices 43,080 45,726 29,958\nTotal cost of revenue 104,633 99,117 77,179\nGross profit 147,791 151,217 119,845\nOperating expenses:\nSelling and marketing 87,182 89,553 72,006\nGeneral and administrative 51,075 47,254 41,302\nResearch and development 75,614 67,246 55,657\nAcquisition-related -

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nPrinciples of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation\nThese Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (\"GAAP\"). Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified for consistency with the current year presentation. This insignificant reclassification had no effect on the reported results of operations. License revenue and license cost of revenue are now combined with subscription revenue and subscription cost of revenue, respectively.\nRisks and uncertainties\nCoronavirus (\"COVID-19\") continues to spread throughout the U.S. and the world and compliance with the various containment measures implemented by governmental authorities has impacted the Company's business, as well as the businesses of its customers, suppliers and other counterparties, and this impact could last for an indefinite period of time. There are no comparable recent events that provide guidance as to the effect of the spread of COVID-19 as a global pandemic, and as a result, the Company is unable to predict the full impact that COVID-19 will have on its results from operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows due to numerous uncertainties, including the duration and severity of the pandemic and containment measures.\nChanges in Accounting Policies\nThe Company has consistently applied the accounting policies described in this Note 2 to all periods presented in these Consolidated Financial Statements, except for the Company's adoption of certain accounting standards described in more detail under \"Recently adopted accounting pronouncements\" in this Note 2 below.\nDollar Amounts\nThe dollar amounts presented in the tabular data within these footnote disclosures are stated in thousands of dollars, except per share amounts, or as noted within the context of each footnote disclosure.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of these Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP requires the Company to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses during the reporting period. The complexity and judgment required in the Company's estimation process, as well as issues related to the assumptions, risks and uncertainties inherent in determining the nature and timing of satisfaction of performance obligations and determining the standalone selling price of performance obligations, affect the amounts of revenue, expenses, unbilled receivables and deferred revenue. Estimates are also used for, but not limited to, receivables, allowance for doubtful\naccounts, the determination of the period of benefit for deferred commissions, operating lease right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities, useful lives of assets, depreciation and amortization, fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed for business combinations, income taxes and deferred tax asset valuation, valuation of stock options, other current liabilities and accrued liabilities. Numerous internal and external factors can affect estimates. Actual results could differ from those estimates and such differences could be material to the Company's consolidated financial position and results of operations.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase, or the ability to be settled in cash within a period of three months, to be cash equivalents, except for commercial paper which is classified as short-term investments, if any. The Company has a cash management program that provides for the investment of excess cash balances, primarily in short-term money market instruments.\nTrade and Other Receivables\nTrade and other receivables are primarily comprised of trade receivables, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, contract assets and unbilled receivables. The Company records trade accounts receivable for its unconditional rights to consideration arising from the Company's performance under contracts with customers. The Company's standard billing terms are that payment is due upon receipt of invoice, payable generally within thirty to sixty days. The carrying value of such receivables, net of the allowance for doubtful accounts, represents their estimated net realizable value. When developing its estimate of expected credit losses on trade and other receivables, the Company considers the available information relevant to assessing the collectability of cash flows, which includes a combination of both internal and external information relating to past events, current conditions, and future forecasts as well as relevant qualitative and quantitative factors that relate to the environment in which the Company operates.\nContract assets represent conditional rights to consideration that have been recognized as revenue in advance of billing the customer. Unbilled receivables represent unconditional rights to consideration arising from contingent revenue that have been recognized as revenue in advance of billing the customer.\nPrepaid Expenses and Other Assets\nPrepaid expenses and other assets consist primarily of prepaid third-party software subscription and license fees, deferred project costs and prepaid income taxes.\nProperty and Equipment, Net\nProperty and equipment are recorded at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Maintenance, repairs and minor replacements are charged to expense as incurred. Significant renewals and betterments are capitalized. Depreciation on property and equipment, with the exception of leasehold improvements, is recorded using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Depreciation on leasehold improvements is recorded using the shorter of the lease term or useful life. When property is retired or disposed of, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any resulting gains or losses are reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss) in the period of disposal.\nInternal-Use Software\nCosts incurred to develop internal-use software during the application development stage are capitalized, stated at cost, and depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Application development stage costs generally include salaries and personnel costs and third-party contractor expenses associated with internal-use software development, configuration and coding. Capitalization of such costs begins when the preliminary project stage is complete and ceases at the point in which the project is substantially complete and is ready for its intended purpose. Capitalized internal-use software is included in property and equipment, net in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nLeases\nThe Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating leases are included in operating lease right-of-use (\"ROU\") assets, current operating lease liabilities and noncurrent operating lease liabilities in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nROU assets represent the Company\u2019s right to use an underlying asset over the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Company\u2019s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the estimated present value of lease payments over the lease term. The Company includes any anticipated lease incentives in the determination of lease liability.\nThe Company uses its estimated incremental borrowing rate, which is derived from information available at the lease commencement date, in determining the present value of lease payments. The Company gives consideration to its recent debt issuances as well as publicly available data for instruments with similar characteristics when determining its incremental borrowing rates.\nThe Company\u2019s lease terms will include options to extend the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. Leases with a term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the Company's unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet. The Company\u2019s lease agreements do not contain any residual value guarantees.\nDeferred Costs\nSales commissions earned by the Company's sales representatives are considered incremental and recoverable costs of obtaining a customer contract. Sales commissions are deferred and amortized on a straight-line basis over the period of benefit, which the Company has determined to be five to eight years. The Company determined the period of benefit by taking into consideration its customer contracts, expected renewals of those customer contracts (as the Company currently does not pay an incremental sales commission for renewals), the Company's technology and other factors. The Company also defers amounts earned by employees other than sales representatives who earn incentive payments under compensation plans that are also tied to the value of customer contracts acquired.\nDeferred Implementation Costs\nThe Company capitalizes certain contract fulfillment costs, including personnel and other costs (such as hosting, employee salaries, benefits and payroll taxes), that are associated with arrangements where services are not distinct from other undelivered obligations in its customer contracts. The Company analyzes implementation costs and capitalizes those costs that are directly related to customer contracts that are expected to be recoverable and enhance the resources which will be used to satisfy the undelivered performance obligations in those contracts. Deferred implementation costs are amortized ratably over the remaining contract term once the revenue recognition criteria for the respective performance obligation has been met and revenue recognition commences. Deferred implementation costs are included in prepaid and other current assets and other assets, noncurrent in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Amortization of deferred implementation costs is included in cost of subscription and cost of services revenues in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss).\nDeferred Revenue\nDeferred revenue primarily consists of customer invoicing in advance of revenues being recognized. The Company generally invoices its customers annually in advance for subscription services and maintenance and support services. Deferred revenue that is anticipated to be recognized during the next twelve-month period is recorded as current deferred revenue and the remaining portion is recorded as noncurrent deferred revenue.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nLong-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever an event or change in circumstances indicates that the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable. The impairment review includes comparison of future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or group of assets with the associated assets\u2019 carrying value. If the carrying value of the asset or group of assets exceeds its expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges), an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value. The Company did not identify any impairment indicators and recorded no impairment charges in the year ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.\nIntangible Assets and Goodwill\nIntangible assets that have finite lives are amortized over their useful lives and are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. During this review, the Company reevaluates the significant assumptions used in determining the original cost and estimated lives of the intangible assets. Although the assumptions may vary from asset to asset, they generally include operating results, changes in the use of the asset, cash flows and other indicators of value. Management then determines whether the remaining useful life continues to be appropriate or whether there has been an impairment of the intangible assets based primarily upon whether expected future undiscounted cash flows are sufficient to support the assets\u2019 recovery. If impairment exists, the Company would adjust the carrying value of the asset to fair value, generally determined by a discounted cash flow analysis.\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase consideration over the net of the acquisition-date fair value of identifiable assets acquired, including identifiable intangible assets, and liabilities assumed in connection with business combinations. Goodwill is not amortized but is assessed for impairment as of November 30 of each fiscal year, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of the Company\u2019s sole reporting unit has been reduced below its carrying value. When conducting the annual goodwill impairment assessment, a two-step process is used. The first step is to perform an optional qualitative evaluation as to whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the Company\u2019s sole reporting unit is less than its carrying value, using an assessment of relevant events and circumstances. In performing this assessment, the Company is required to make assumptions and judgments including but not limited to an evaluation of macroeconomic conditions as they relate to the business, industry and market trends, as well as the overall future financial performance of the reporting unit and future opportunities in the markets in which it operates. If it is determined that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, no additional tests are required to be performed in assessing goodwill for impairment. However, if the Company concludes otherwise or elects not to perform the qualitative assessment, the Company performs a second step, consisting of a quantitative assessment of goodwill impairment. This quantitative assessment requires the Company to compare the fair value of its reporting unit with its carrying value. If the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, an impairment charge will be recognized, however, loss cannot exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. Based on the results of the qualitative review of goodwill performed as of November 30, 2020, the Company did not identify any indicators of impairment. As such, the quantitative assessment described above was not necessary.\nEquity Investments\nInvestments in equity securities of privately held companies without readily determinable fair value, where the Company does not exercise significant influence over the investee, are recorded at cost, less impairment and adjusted for subsequent observable price changes obtained from orderly transactions for identical or similar investments issued by the same investee. Adjustments resulting from impairment, fair value, or observable price changes are accounted for in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss).\nFinancial Instruments\nThe carrying amount of the Company\u2019s financial instruments, which include cash equivalents, receivables and accounts payable, and equity investments approximates their fair values at December 31, 2020 and 2019. For additional information on the Company\u2019s fair value measurements, see Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nConvertible Senior Notes\nIn accounting for the issuance of the Notes, the Company separates each of the Notes into liability and equity components. The carrying amounts of the liability components are calculated by measuring the fair value of similar liabilities that do not have associated convertible features. The carrying amount of the equity components representing the conversion option are determined by deducting the fair value of the liability components from the par value of the respective Notes. These differences represent debt discounts that are amortized to interest expense over the respective terms of the Notes using the effective interest rate method. The equity components are not remeasured as long as they continue to meet the conditions for equity classification. In accounting for the issuance costs related to the Notes, the Company allocates the total amount of issuance costs incurred to the liability and equity components based on their relative values. Issuance costs attributable to the liability components are being amortized on a straight-line basis, which approximates the effective interest rate method, to interest expense over the respective terms of the Notes. The issuance costs attributable to the equity components are netted against the respective equity components in additional paid-in capital.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development costs for software sold to customers are expensed as incurred. These costs include salaries and personnel costs, including employee benefits, third-party contractor expenses, software development tools, an allocation of facilities and depreciation expenses and other expenses in developing new solutions and upgrading and enhancing existing solutions.\nSoftware Development Costs\nCapitalization of software development costs for software to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed begins upon the establishment of technological feasibility, which is generally the completion of a working prototype that has been certified as having no critical bugs and is a release candidate. Amortization begins once the software is ready for its intended use, generally based on the pattern in which the economic benefits will be consumed. To date, software development costs incurred between completion of a working prototype and general availability of the related product have not been material.\nTreasury Stock\nThe Company is authorized to make treasury stock purchases in the open market pursuant to the share repurchase program, which was approved by its Board of Directors on August 28, 2008. The Company accounts for the purchase of treasury stock under the cost method. For additional information on the Company\u2019s stock repurchase program, see Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. There were no treasury stock repurchases under the program for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company derives its revenues primarily from subscriptions, services, and associated software maintenance and support services.\nThe Company determines revenue recognition through the following steps:\n\u2022Identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer;\n\u2022Identification of the performance obligations in the customer contract(s);\n\u2022Determination of the transaction price;\n\u2022Allocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation in the customer contract(s); and\n\u2022Recognition of revenue when, or as, the Company satisfies a performance obligation.\nSubscription revenue\nSubscription revenue primarily consists of fees that give customers access to one or more of the Company's cloud applications with related customer support. The Company primarily recognizes subscription revenue ratably over the contractual term of the arrangement beginning with commencement of service. Subscription revenue related to certain offerings, where fees are based on a number of transactions, are recognized on a usage basis. The Company's subscription contracts do not provide customers with the right to take possession of the software supporting the service and, as a result, are accounted for as service contracts. The Company's subscription contracts are generally two to five years in length, billed annually in advance, and non-cancelable.\nMaintenance and support revenue\nMaintenance and support revenue includes customer support for on-premises licenses and the right to unspecified software updates and enhancements. The Company recognizes revenue from maintenance and support arrangements ratably over the period in which the services are provided. The Company's maintenance and support contracts are generally one year in length, billed annually in advance, and non-cancelable.\nServices revenue\nServices revenue primarily consists of fees for configuration services, consulting and training. The Company typically sells its services either on a fixed-fee or time-and-material basis. Services revenue is generally recognized as the services are performed for time and material contracts, or on a proportional performance basis for fixed-price contracts. The majority of the Company's Services contracts are on a fixed-fee basis. Training revenue is recognized as the services are rendered.\nSignificant judgments are required in determining whether services that are contained in the Company's customer subscription contracts are considered distinct, including whether the services are capable of being distinct and whether they are separately identifiable. Services deemed to be distinct are accounted for as a separate performance obligation and revenue is recognized as the services are performed. If determined services are not considered distinct, the services and the subscription are determined to be a single performance obligation and revenue is recognized over the contractual term of the subscription beginning on the date that subscription services are made available to the customer.\nCustomer contracts with multiple performance obligations\nA portion of the Company's customer contracts contain multiple performance obligations. Significant judgment is required in determining whether multiple performance obligations contained in a single customer contract are capable of being distinct and are separately identifiable. An obligation determined to be distinct is accounted for as a separate performance obligation and revenue for that separate performance obligation is recognized when, or as, the Company satisfies the performance obligation. If obligations are not determined to be distinct, those obligations are accounted for as a single, combined performance obligation. The transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation on a relative standalone selling price basis.\nDisaggregation of revenue\nThe Company categorizes revenue from external customers by geographic area based on the location of the customer's headquarters. For additional information regarding the Company's revenue by geography, see Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nForeign Currency\nThe Company has contracts denominated in foreign currencies and therefore a portion of the Company\u2019s revenue is subject to foreign currency risks. Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions, such as those resulting from the settlement of receivables, are classified in other income (expense), net included in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss).\nThe functional currency of PROS France SAS (\"PROS France\") is the Euro. The financial statements of this subsidiary are translated into U.S. dollars using period-end rates of exchange for assets and liabilities, historical rates of exchange for equity, and average rates of exchange for the period for revenue and expenses. Translation gains (losses) are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as a component of stockholders\u2019 equity.\nNoncash Share-Based Compensation\nThe Company has two noncash share-based compensation plans, the 2007 Equity Incentive Plan (\"2007 Stock Plan\") and the 2017 Equity Incentive Plan (\"2017 Stock Plan\"), which authorize the discretionary granting of various types of stock awards to key employees, officers, directors and consultants. The 2007 Stock Plan expired in March 2017. The 2017 Stock Plan serves as the successor to the 2007 Stock Plan and was adopted in May 2017. The Company may provide noncash share-based compensation through the grant of: (i) restricted stock awards; (ii) restricted stock unit awards - time, performance and market-based (\"RSUs\"); (iii) stock options; (iv) stock appreciation rights (\"SARs\"); (v) phantom stock; and (vi) performance awards, such as market stock units (\"MSUs\").\nTo date, the Company has granted stock options, SARs, RSUs, time, performance and market-based, and MSUs. The Company issues common stock from its pool of authorized stock upon exercise of stock options, settlement of SARs and MSUs or upon vesting of RSUs.\nThe following table presents the number of awards outstanding for each award type as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 (in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31,\nAward type 2020 2019\nRestricted stock units (time-based) 1,802 1,893\nRestricted stock units (performance-based) 162 114\nStock appreciation rights 28 65\nMarket stock units 111 267\nStock options. The Company did not grant stock options during 2020 and 2019. The fair value of each stock option is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.\nRestricted stock units. The fair value of the RSUs (time-based and performance-based) is based on the closing price of the Company\u2019s stock on the date of grant and is amortized over the vesting period. RSUs include (i) time-based awards and (ii) performance-based awards in which the number of shares that vest are based upon achievement of certain internal performance metrics set by the Company.\nStock appreciation rights. SARs will be settled in stock at the time of exercise and vest over four years from the date of grant. The Company used the Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of its SARs. The determination of the fair value of SARs utilizing the Black-Scholes model is affected by the Company\u2019s stock price and a number of assumptions, including expected volatility, expected life, delivery of risk-free interest rate and expected dividends. The Company estimates the expected volatility of common stock at the date of grant based on a combination of its historical volatility and the average volatility of comparable companies. The expected life of the SARs noncash share-based payment awards is a historical weighted average of the expected lives of similar securities of comparable public companies. The risk-free interest rate assumption is based on observed interest rates appropriate for the terms of the Company\u2019s awards. The dividend yield assumption is based on the Company's expectation of paying no dividends.\nMarket stock units. MSUs are performance-based awards that vest based upon the Company\u2019s relative shareholder return. The actual number of MSUs that will be eligible to vest is based on the total shareholder return of the Company relative to the total shareholder return of the Russell 2000 Index (\"Index\") over a 3-year period ending February 28, 2020, October 9, 2020 and December 31, 2020 (\"Performance Period\"), respectively. The MSUs vested on March 1, 2020 and October 9, 2020, and will vest on January 10, 2021, respectively. The maximum number of shares issuable upon vesting is 200% of the MSUs initially granted based on the average price of the Company's common stock relative to the Index during the Performance Period. The Company estimates the fair value of MSUs on the date of grant using a Monte Carlo simulation model. The determination of the fair value of the MSUs is affected by the Company\u2019s stock price and a number of assumptions including the expected volatility of the Company\u2019s stock and the Index, its risk-free interest rate and expected dividends. The Company\u2019s expected volatility at the date of grant was based on the historical volatilities of the Company and the Index over the Performance Period.\nAs the Company issues stock options and SARs, it evaluates the assumptions used to value its stock option awards and SARs. If factors change and the Company employs different assumptions, noncash share-based compensation expense may differ significantly from what has been recorded in the past. If there are any modifications or cancellations of the underlying unvested securities, the Company may be required to accelerate, increase or cancel any remaining unearned noncash share-based compensation expense. Future noncash share-based compensation expense and unearned noncash share-based compensation will increase to the extent that the Company grants additional equity awards to employees.\nAt December 31, 2020, there were an estimated $55.9 million of total unrecognized compensation costs related to noncash share-based compensation arrangements. These costs will be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.5 years. For further discussion of the Company\u2019s noncash share-based compensation plans, see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company uses the asset and liability method to account for income taxes, including recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the anticipated future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement amounts and their respective tax basis. The Company reviews its deferred tax assets for recovery. A valuation allowance is established when the Company believes that it is more likely than not that some portion of its deferred tax assets will not be realized. Changes in the valuation allowance from period to period are included in the Company\u2019s tax provision in the period of change.\nThe Company accounts for uncertain income tax positions recognized in an enterprise\u2019s financial statements in accordance with the income tax topic of the ASC issued by the FASB. This interpretation requires companies to use a prescribed model for assessing the financial recognition and measurement of all tax positions taken or expected to be taken in its tax returns. This guidance provides clarification on recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosures and transition. The Company recognized accrued interest and penalties related to income taxes as a component of income tax expense. For additional information regarding the Company\u2019s income taxes, see Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nSegment Reporting\nThe Company reports as one operating segment with the Chief Executive Officer (\"CEO\") acting as the Company\u2019s chief operating decision maker. The Company\u2019s CEO reviews financial information presented on a consolidated basis for purposes of allocating resources and evaluating financial performance. The Company has a single reporting unit, and there are no segment managers who are held accountable for operations, operating results or components below the consolidated unit level.\nEarnings Per Share\nThe Company computes basic earnings (loss) per share by dividing net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings (loss) per share is computed by giving effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method and convertible notes using the if-converted method. Dilutive potential common shares consist of shares issuable upon the exercise of stock options, shares of unvested restricted stock units and market stock units, and settlement of stock appreciation rights. When the Company incurs a net loss, the effect of the Company's outstanding stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock units, market stock units and convertible notes are not included in the calculation of diluted earnings (loss) per share as the effect would be anti-dilutive. Accordingly, basic and diluted net loss per share are identical.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (\"Topic 326\"), in order to improve financial reporting of expected credit losses on financial instruments and other commitments to extend credit. Topic 326 requires that an entity measure and recognize expected credit losses for financial assets held at amortized cost and replaces the incurred loss impairment methodology in current GAAP with a methodology that requires consideration of a broader range of information to estimate credit losses. The Company adopted Topic 326 as of January 1, 2020 using the modified retrospective method and there was no material impact on the Company's unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements as of the adoption date. As of December 31, 2020, the Company has recorded allowance for doubtful accounts related to trade receivables of $4.1 million primarily due to increased credit risk from uncertain economic conditions caused by COVID-19.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, \"Leases (Topic 842)\" (\"Topic 842\"), which requires the lessee to recognize most leases on the balance sheet thereby resulting in the recognition of right-of-use (\"ROU\") assets and lease liabilities for those leases currently classified as operating leases. Lessor accounting remains largely unchanged from current guidance, however, Topic 842 provides improvements that are intended to align lessor accounting with the lessee model and with updated revenue recognition guidance. This standard took effect in the first quarter of 2019, including interim periods within that reporting period. The Company adopted Topic 842 as of January 1, 2019 using the modified retrospective method by recognizing the cumulative effect of initially applying the new standard as an adjustment to the opening balances of operating ROU assets and lease liabilities, while prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with the Company's historic accounting under the prior lease accounting rules in ASC 840, \"Leases\". See Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, regarding the impact of Topic 842 adoption on the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-15, \"Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer's Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That is a Service Contract\" (\"Subtopic 350-40\"). The amendment aligns the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs in a cloud computing arrangement service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain an internal-use software. The standard is effective for annual periods, including interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2019; early adoption is permitted. The Company early adopted Subtopic 350-40 prospectively effective January 1, 2019 and there was no impact on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements as of the adoption date. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company capitalized implementation cost in result of\nadoption of the standard which affected the prepaid and other current assets and other assets, noncurrent line items in the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, \"Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment\" (\"Topic 350\"), which eliminates step two from the goodwill impairment test. Under the amendments in this standard, an entity should recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value; however, the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. The standard is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019; earlier adoption is permitted for goodwill impairment tests performed after January 1, 2017. The Company early adopted Topic 350 effective October 1, 2019 and there was no impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements in result of the standard adoption.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") No. 2014-09, \" Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) \" (\"Topic 606\"). Topic 606 replaces the prior revenue recognition requirements in ASC 605, \"Revenue Recognition\" (\"Topic 605\" or \"Prior Guidance\") with a comprehensive revenue measurement and recognition standard, and expanded disclosure requirements. The new standard also provides guidance on the recognition of costs related to obtaining customer contracts. Topic 606 took effect in the first quarter of 2018, including interim periods within that reporting period. The Company adopted Topic 606 and applied Topic 606 to those contracts which were not complete as of January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective method by recognizing the cumulative effect of initially applying the new standard as an adjustment to the opening balance of accumulated deficit, while prior period amounts were not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with the Company's historic accounting under the Prior Guidance. See Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, regarding the impact of Topic 606 adoption on the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Debt - Debt with Conversion and Other Options (\"Subtopic 470-20\") and Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in an Entity's Own Equity (\"Subtopic 815-40\"), which simplifies the accounting for certain convertible instruments, amends the guidance on derivative scope exceptions for contracts in an entity's own equity, and modifies the guidance on diluted earnings per share calculations as a result of these changes. This new standard is effective for the Company's interim and annual periods beginning January 1, 2022, and earlier adoption is permitted on January 1, 2021. The Company may elect to apply the amendments on a retrospective or modified retrospective basis. The Company will early adopt the new standard effective January 1, 2021 on the modified retrospective basis. The adoption is expected to increase convertible debt, net, noncurrent by approximately $70.6 million excluding the impact of debt issuance cost and the equity conversion component. The Company is currently continuing to assess the impact of the adoption of the standard on its financial statements.\nWith the exception of the new standards discussed above, there have been no other recent accounting pronouncements or changes in accounting pronouncements during the year ended December 31, 2020, that are of significance or potential significance to the Company.\n3. Business Combination\nTravelaer\nOn August 14, 2019, the Company acquired Travelaer SAS (\"Travelaer\"), a privately held company based near Nice, France, for a total cash consideration, net of cash acquired, of approximately $10.5 million. Travelaer is a digital innovator for the travel industry with a focus on improving the customer experience across all phases of travel, and brings an internet booking engine and New Distribution Capability platform to the Company's portfolio. The Company has included the financial results of Travelaer in the Consolidated Financial Statements from the date of the acquisition, which have not been material to date. The transaction cost associated with the acquisition was $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nThe Company accounted for the transaction as a business combination and all of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed in the transaction have been recognized at their acquisition date fair values. The Company recorded approximately $2 million for developed technology and customer relationships with estimated useful lives of seven years and five years, respectively. The Company recorded approximately $11 million of goodwill which is primarily related to the assembled workforce and expanded market opportunities from integrating Travelaer's technology with the Company's solutions. The goodwill balance is not deductible for U.S. income tax purposes.\n4. Trade and Other Receivables, Net\nAccounts receivable at December 31, 2020 and 2019, consists of the following (in thousands):\nDecember 31,\n2020 2019\nAccounts receivable $ 50,257 $ 59,606\nUnbilled receivables and contract assets 3,443 5,682\nTotal receivables 53,700 65,288\nLess: Allowance for doubtful accounts (4,122) (214)\nTrade and other receivables, net $ 49,578 $ 65,074\nThe bad debt expense reflected in general and administrative expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss) for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, totaled approximately $4.8 million, $(0.6) million and $0.2 million, respectively. However, as a result of the ongoing and uncertain economic conditions caused by COVID-19, the amount of bad debt expense recognized by the Company could vary in the near term depending on the ongoing impact of COVID-19 on the Company\u2019s customers and inherently the related receivables.\n5. Deferred Costs\nDeferred costs, which primarily consist of deferred sales commissions, were $18.5 million and $21.2 million as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. Amortization expense for the deferred costs was $5.9 million, $4.8 million and $3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. There was no impairment loss in relation to the costs capitalized for the periods presented.\n6. Deferred Implementation Costs\nDeferred implementation costs, which related to certain customer contract fulfillment costs, were $2.9 million and $4.4 million as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. Amortization expense for the deferred implementation costs was $1.8 million, $1.4 million and $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Deferred implementation costs are included in prepaid and other current assets and other assets, noncurrent in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Amortization of deferred implementation costs is included in cost of subscription and cost of services revenues in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss). There was no impairment loss in relation to the costs capitalized for the periods presented.\n7. Property and Equipment, Net\nProperty and equipment, net as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 consists of the following:\nDecember 31,\nEstimated useful life 2020 2019\nFurniture and fixtures 5-10 years $ 6,248 $ 3,227\nComputers and equipment 3-5 years 17,333 15,388\nSoftware 3-6 years 7,646 7,302\nCapitalized internal-use software development costs 3 years 12,217 10,194\nLeasehold improvements Shorter of lease term or useful life 20,709 5,591\nConstruction in progress 147 794\nProperty and equipment, gross 64,300 42,496\nLess: Accumulated depreciation and amortization (27,796) (27,702)\nProperty and equipment, net $ 36,504 $ 14,794\nDepreciation and amortization was approximately $8.0 million, $7.1 million and $5.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the Company disposed of approximately $8.3 million, $7.4 million and $0.5 million, respectively, of fully depreciated assets. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recognized no loss on disposal of assets and during the years ended 2019 and 2018, the Company recognized immaterial amounts of loss on disposal of certain non-fully depreciated assets, respectively. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company had approximately $10.7 million and $12.2 million, respectively, of fully depreciated assets in use.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company capitalized internal-use software development costs of approximately $1.7 million and $1.4 million, respectively, related to its subscription solutions. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, $12.2 million and $9.6 million, respectively, of capitalized internal-use software development costs were subject to amortization and $7.3 million and $4.1 million, respectively, of capitalized internal-use software development costs were included in accumulated depreciation and amortization for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nNo impairment was recorded for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.\n8. Leases\nThe Company has operating leases for data centers, computer infrastructure, corporate offices and certain equipment. These leases have remaining lease terms ranging from 1 year to 13 years. Some of these leases include options to extend for up to 15 years, and some include options to terminate within 1 year. The Company includes options in the lease terms when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company did not have any finance leases.\nThe components of operating lease expense were as follows (in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31, 2020 Year Ended December 31, 2019\nOperating lease cost $ 11,632 $ 10,109\nVariable lease cost 1,717 1,810\nSublease income (375) (332)\nTotal lease cost\n$ 12,974 $ 11,587\nOperating lease expense was $4.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 under Topic 840, the predecessor of Topic 842.\nSupplemental information related to leases was as follows (in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31, 2020 Year Ended December 31, 2019\nCash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liability:\nCash paid for operating lease liabilities $ 7,562 $ 5,883\nRight-of-use asset obtained in exchange for operating lease liability (1) $ 12,599 $ 34,418\n(1) For the year ended December 31, 2019, the balance included $26.9 million for operating leases existing on January 1, 2019 upon adoption of ASU 842.\nDecember 31, 2020 December 31, 2019\nWeighted average remaining lease term:\nOperating leases\n8.6 years 7.1 years\nWeighted average discount rate:\nOperating leases\n7.12 % 7.26 %\nAs of December 31, 2020, maturities of lease liabilities were as follows (in thousands):\nYear Ending December 31, Amount\n2021 $ 9,580\n2022 10,374\n2023 11,378\n2024 5,418\n2025 4,265\n2026 and thereafter 31,867\nTotal operating lease payments 72,882\nLess: Imputed interest (21,461)\nLess: Anticipated lease incentive (1,385)\nTotal operating lease liabilities $ 50,036\n9.

Fair Value Measurements\nThe Company adopted fair value measurements guidance for financial and nonfinancial assets and liabilities. The guidance defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in GAAP and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.\nThe guidance defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset, or paid to transfer a liability, in an orderly transaction between market participants. The guidance establishes a fair value hierarchy for valuation inputs that gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. The fair value hierarchy is as follows:\nLevel 1: Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities;\nLevel 2: Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active or inputs which are observable, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability; and\nLevel 3: Prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable (i.e., supported by little or no market activity).\nA portion of the Company\u2019s existing cash and cash equivalents are invested in short-term interest bearing obligations with original maturities less than 90 days, principally various types of money market funds. The Company does not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes.\nAt December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company had approximately $301.3 million and $273.1 million invested in treasury money market funds. The fair value of the treasury money market funds is determined based on quoted market prices, which represents level 1 in the fair value hierarchy as defined by Accounting Standard Codification (\"ASC\") 820, \"Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure.\"\nThe fair value of the Company's Notes is classified in the level 2 hierarchy. See Note 16 for further detail regarding the Notes.\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company had $2.6 million and $2.3 million, respectively, of equity securities in privately held companies. These investments are accounted for at cost, less impairment and adjusted for subsequent observable price changes obtained from orderly transactions for identical or similar investments issued by the same investee. The Company estimates the fair value of its equity investments by considering available information such as pricing in recent rounds of financing and any other readily available market data, which represents level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. An impairment charge to current earnings is recorded when the cost of the investment exceeds its fair value and this condition is determined to be other-than-temporary. As of December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 the Company determined there were no other-than-temporary impairments on its equity investments.\n11. Deferred Revenue and Performance Obligations\nDeferred Revenue\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company recognized approximately $120.9 million and $96.4 million, respectively, in each case of revenue that was included in the deferred revenue balances at the beginning of the respective periods and primarily related to subscription services, maintenance and support, and other services.\nPerformance Obligations\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company expects to recognize approximately $389.7 million of revenue from remaining performance obligations. The Company expects to recognize revenue on approximately $178.9 million of these performance obligations over the next 12 months, with the balance recognized thereafter. However, as a result of the ongoing and uncertain economic conditions caused by COVID-19, the amount of revenue recognized from the Company's contractual remaining performance obligations could vary and be less than what the Company expects as revenue recognized could be delayed or not occur depending on the ongoing impact of COVID-19.\n12. Stockholders\u2019 equity\nEquity Offering\nIn August 2018, the Company completed a follow-on public offering of 3,800,000 shares of the Company's common stock at an offering price of $34 per share (the \"Secondary Offering\"). Additionally, as part of the Secondary Offering the underwriters exercised, in full, their over-allotment option to purchase an additional 570,000 shares of the Company's common stock at the offering price of $34 per share. The aggregate gross proceeds from the Secondary Offering, including the exercise of the over-allotment, were $148.6 million, and net proceeds received after underwriting fees and offering expenses were approximately $142.0 million.\nStock Repurchase\nOn August 25, 2008, the Company\u2019s Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program that authorized the Company to purchase up to $15.0 million of the Company\u2019s outstanding shares of common stock. Under the board-approved repurchase program, share purchases may be made from time to time in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions depending on market conditions, share price, trading volume and other factors, and such purchases, if any, will be made in accordance with applicable insider trading and other securities laws and regulations. These repurchases may be commenced or suspended at any time or from time to time without prior notice.\nThe Company did not repurchase any shares under this plan for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. The remaining amount available to purchase common stock under this plan was $10.0 million as of December 31, 2020.\n13. Earnings Per Share\nThe following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share:\nFor the Year Ended December 31,\n2020 2019 2018\nNumerator:\nNet loss $ (76,984) $ (69,081) $ (64,246)\nDenominator:\nWeighted average shares (basic) 43,301 40,232 34,465\nDilutive effect of stock options, SARs, RSUs, MSUs and convertible notes - - -\nWeighted average shares (diluted) 43,301 40,232 34,465\nBasic earnings per share $ (1.78) $ (1.72) $ (1.86)\nDiluted earnings per share $ (1.78) $ (1.72) $ (1.86)\nDilutive potential common shares consist of shares issuable upon the exercise of stock options, settlement of SARs, and the vesting of RSUs and MSUs. Potential common shares determined to be antidilutive and excluded from diluted weighted average shares outstanding were approximately 1.4 million, 2.1 million and 2.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Potential common shares related to the Notes determined to be antidilutive and excluded from diluted weighted average shares outstanding were 5.8 million and 2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\n14. Noncash Share-Based Compensation\nEmployee Noncash Share-based Compensation Plans\nThe Company has two noncash share-based compensation plans, the 2007 Stock Plan and the 2017 Stock Plan (collectively the \"Stock Plans\"). These plans authorize the discretionary granting of various types of stock awards to key employees, officers, directors and consultants. The discretionary issuance of stock awards generally contains vesting provisions ranging from one to four years.\n2007 Stock Plan. The Company\u2019s 2007 Stock Plan expired in March 2017 for purposes of granting future equity awards. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had outstanding equity awards to acquire 175,733 shares of its common stock held by the Company\u2019s employees, directors and consultants under the 2007 Stock Plan (assuming MSU performance at 100% of the MSUs initially granted), and inclusive of zero stock options, 147,733 RSUs, 28,000 SARs and zero MSUs.\n2017 Stock Plan. The Company\u2019s 2017 Stock Plan provides for the issuance of awards to employees, officers, directors and certain other individuals providing services to the Company are eligible to receive awards. The 2017 Stock Plan reserved an aggregate amount of 4,550,000 shares for issuance. The Company may provide these incentives through the grant of: (i) restricted stock awards; (ii) RSUs (time, performance and market-based); (iii) stock options; (iv) SARs; (v) phantom stock; and (vi) performance awards, such as MSUs.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company had outstanding equity awards to acquire 1,927,109 shares of its common stock held by the Company\u2019s employees, directors and consultants under the 2017 Stock Plan (assuming MSU performance at 100% of the MSUs initially granted), and inclusive of 1,816,383 RSUs and 110,726 MSUs. As of December 31, 2020, 1,745,900 shares remain available for grant under the 2017 Stock Plan. As of December 31, 2020, there were no options, SARs, restricted stock awards or phantom stock issued under the 2017 Stock Plan.\nNoncash share-based compensation expense for all noncash share-based payment awards granted is determined based on the grant date fair value of the award. The Company recognizes compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, which represents noncash share-based awards expected to vest on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award, which is generally the vesting term. Noncash share-based awards typically vest over four years. Stock options are generally granted for a ten-year term. The Company estimates forfeiture rates based on its historical experience for grant years where the majority of the vesting terms have been satisfied. Changes in estimated forfeiture rates are recognized through a cumulative catch-up adjustment in the period of change and thus impact the amount of noncash share-based compensation expense to be recognized in future periods.\nNoncash share-based compensation expense is allocated to expense categories on the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss). The following table summarizes noncash share-based compensation expense, net of amounts capitalized, for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 (in thousands).\nFor the Year Ended December 31,\n2020 2019 2018\nShare-based compensation:\nCost of revenue $ 2,132 $ 2,025 $ 1,721\nOperating expenses:\nSelling and marketing 6,536 5,995 4,396\nGeneral and administrative 9,670 11,451 10,717\nResearch and development 6,061 5,209 4,619\nTotal included in operating expenses 22,267 22,655 19,732\nTotal share-based compensation expense $ 24,399 $ 24,680 $ 21,453\nAt December 31, 2020, there was an estimated $55.9 million of total unrecognized compensation costs related to noncash share-based compensation arrangements. These costs will be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.5 years.\nStock Options\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, the Company did not grant any stock options and had no stock options outstanding. The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was zero, zero and $2.5 million, respectively.\nRSUs (time-based)\nThe Company has granted time-based RSUs under the Stock Plans. Time-based RSUs granted to employees, directors and consultants vest in equal annual installments over a one to four-year period from the grant date.\nThe following table summarizes the Company's unvested time-based RSUs as of December 31, 2020, and changes during the year then ended (number of shares and intrinsic value in thousands):\nNumber of\nshares Weighted\naverage\ngrant date\nfair value Weighted\naverage\nremaining\ncontractual\nterm (year) Aggregate\nintrinsic value\n(1)\nUnvested at December 31, 2019 1,893 $ 27.83\nGranted 976 52.62\nVested (814) 23.88\nForfeited (253) 39.25\nUnvested at December 31, 2020 1,802 $ 41.44 2.03 $ 91,476\nExpected to vest at December 31, 2020 1,653 $ 40.80 2.00 $ 83,909\n(1) The aggregate intrinsic value was calculated based on the fair value of the Company\u2019s common stock on December 31, 2020 of $50.77.\nThe weighted average grant-date fair value of the time-based RSUs granted during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $52.62, $35.38 and $27.61, respectively.\nRSUs (performance-based)\nDuring 2020 and 2019, the Company granted performance-based RSUs (\"PRSUs\") under the 2017 Stock Plan to certain executive employees. These PRSUs vest on January 13, 2023 and January 15, 2022 respectively, and the actual number of PRSUs that will be eligible to vest is based upon achievement of certain internal performance metrics, as defined by each award's plan documents or individual award agreements. The maximum number of shares issuable upon vesting is 200% of the PRSUs initially granted. The following table summarizes the Company's unvested PRSUs as of December 31, 2020, and changes during the year then ended (number of shares and intrinsic value in thousands):\nNumber of\nshares Weighted\naverage\ngrant date\nfair value Weighted\naverage\nremaining\ncontractual\nterm (year) Aggregate\nintrinsic value\n(1)\nUnvested at December 31, 2019 114 $ 33.05\nGranted 76 54.23\nVested - -\nForfeited (28) 39.46\nUnvested at December 31, 2020 162 $ 41.89 1.46 $ 8,243\nExpected to vest at December 31, 2020 74 $ 33.05 1.04 $ 3,744\n(1) The aggregate intrinsic value was calculated based on the fair value of the Company\u2019s common stock on December 31, 2020 of $50.77.\nSARs\nThe Company has granted SARs under the 2007 Stock Plan. These SARs will be settled in stock at the time of exercise and vest four years from the date of grant subject to the recipient\u2019s continued employment with the Company. The number of shares issued upon the exercise of the SARs is calculated as the difference between the share price of the Company\u2019s stock on the date of exercise and the date of grant multiplied by the number of SARs divided by the share price on the exercise date. The Company did not grant SARs in 2020, 2019 and 2018. The following table summarizes the Company's SARs activity for the year ended December 31, 2020 (number of shares and intrinsic value in thousands):\nStock\nappreciation\nrights Weighted\naverage\nexercise price Weighted\naverage\nremaining\ncontractual\nterm (year) Aggregate\nintrinsic value\n(1)\nOutstanding, December 31, 2019 65 $ 10.38\nGranted - -\nExercised (37) 9.59\nForfeited - -\nExpired - -\nOutstanding, December 31, 2020 28 $ 11.42 0.16 $ 1,102\nExercisable at December 31, 2020 28 $ 11.42 0.16 $ 1,102\nVested and expected to vest at December 31, 2020 28 $ 11.42 0.16 $ 1,102\n(1) The aggregate intrinsic value was calculated based on the positive difference between the estimated fair value of the Company\u2019s common stock on December 31, 2020 of $50.77 and the exercise price of the underlying SARs.\nMSUs\nIn 2018 and 2017, the Company granted MSUs to certain executive employees under the Stock Plans. The MSUs are performance-based awards that vest based upon the Company\u2019s relative shareholder return. The actual number of MSUs that will be eligible to vest is based on the total shareholder return of the Company relative to the total shareholder return of the Index over the 3-year Performance Period. The MSUs vested on March 1, 2020 and October 9, 2020 and will vest on January 10, 2021, respectively. The MSUs maximum number of shares issuable upon vesting is 200% of the MSUs initially granted. The Company did not grant any MSUs in 2020 and 2019. The following table summarizes the Company's MSUs activity for the year ended December 31, 2020 (number of shares and intrinsic value in thousands):\nNumber of\nunvested awards Weighted\naverage\ngrant date fair value Weighted\naverage\nremaining\ncontractual\nterm (year) Aggregate\nintrinsic\nvalue (1)\nUnvested at December 31, 2019 267 $ 32.54\nGranted - -\nVested (150) 28.03\nForfeited (6) 38.18\nExpired - -\nUnvested at December 31, 2020 111 $ 38.18 0.03 $ 5,622\n(1) The aggregate intrinsic value was calculated based on the positive difference between the estimated fair value of the Company\u2019s common stock on December 31, 2020 of $50.77 and the grant date fair value of the underlying MSUs.\nThe Company estimates the fair value of MSUs on the date of grant using a Monte Carlo simulation model. The determination of the fair value of the MSUs is affected by the Company's stock price and a number of assumptions including the expected volatilities of the Company's stock and the Index, its risk-free interest rate and expected dividends. The Company's expected volatility at the date of grant was based on the historical volatilities of the Company and the Index over the Performance Period. The Company did not estimate a forfeiture rate for the MSUs due to the limited size, the vesting period and nature of the grantee population and the lack of history of granting this type of award. Significant assumptions used in the Monte Carlo simulation model for MSUs granted during the year ended December 31, 2018 are as follows:\nFor the Year Ended December 31,\nVolatility 43.67%\nRisk-free interest rate 2.12%\nExpected option life in years 2.97\nDividend yield -\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan\nThe Company's Employee Stock Purchase Plan (\"ESPP\") provides for eligible employees to purchase shares on an after-tax basis in an amount between 1% and 10% of their annual pay: (i) on June 30 of each year at a 15% discount of the fair market value of the Company's common stock on January 1 or June 30, whichever is lower, and (ii) on December 31 of each year at a 15% discount of the fair market value of the Company's common stock on July 1 or December 31, whichever is lower. An employee may not purchase more than $5,000 in either of the six-month measurement periods described above or more than $10,000 annually. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company issued 65,457 shares under the ESPP. As of December 31, 2020, 74,794 shares remain authorized and available for issuance under the ESPP. As of December 31, 2020, the Company held approximately $1.6 million on behalf of employees for future purchases under the ESPP and this amount was recorded in accrued liabilities in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n15. Income Taxes\nThe income tax provision consisted of the following for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 (in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2019 2018\nCurrent:\nFederal $ - $ - $ (252)\nState and Foreign 676 624 663\n676 624 411\nDeferred:\nFederal - - (211)\nState - - -\nIncome tax provision $ 676 $ 624 $ 200\nThe differences between the effective tax rates reflected in the total provision for income taxes and the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, were as follows (in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2019 2018\nProvision at the U.S. federal statutory rate $ (16,035) $ (14,491) $ (13,464)\nIncrease (decrease) resulting from:\nState income taxes, net of federal taxes - 17 46\nNondeductible expenses 482 468 414\nStatutory to GAAP income adjustment 109 (640) (221)\nNoncash share-based compensation (3,268) (570) (394)\nOther 460 (368) (153)\nIncremental benefits for tax credits (2,391) (990) (1,656)\nChange in tax rate/income subject to lower tax rates (2,385) 788 (1,824)\nChange related to prior tax years (553) 4,006 (4,800)\nChange related to US tax reform - - 1,835\nChange in valuation allowance 24,257 12,404 20,417\nIncome tax provision $ 676 $ 624 $ 200\nThe Company\u2019s effective tax rate was (0.9)%, (0.9)% and (0.3)% for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company's effective tax rate was impacted primarily by changes in valuation allowance, partially offset by changes in tax rates and benefits of noncash shared based compensation.\nThe Company reviewed its offshore earnings and profits as of December 31, 2020, has no additional earnings to repatriate, and has provided for no repatriation tax. Based on the current accumulated loss in the foreign jurisdictions, the Company has no global intangible low-taxed income (\u201cGILTI\u201d) to report for December 31, 2020. The Company is under the revenue requirements to be subject to the base erosion and avoidance tax (\u201cBEAT\u201d), however, it has reviewed the transactions with foreign affiliates and does not believe there are payments that qualify under BEAT. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (\"TCJA\") created the foreign derived intangible income (\u201cFDII\u201d) which allows for a deduction for certain types of foreign income. However, since the Company is in a current net operating loss position, no deduction for FDII is allowable for the current year.\nThe tax effects of temporary differences and other tax attributes that give rise to significant portions of the deferred tax assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 are as follows (in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2019\nNoncurrent deferred taxes:\nProperty and equipment $ (104) $ (158)\nNoncash share-based compensation 2,878 2,534\nDisallowed interest expense 8,174 5,871\nCapitalized software (2,097) (1,905)\nAmortization (1,831) (2,971)\nOperating lease right-of-use assets (5,645) (4,431)\nOperating lease liabilities 9,833 5,068\nR&E tax credit carryforwards 12,620 11,594\nDeferred revenue 2,441 2,264\nFederal Net Operating Losses (\"NOLs\") 81,745 69,673\nState NOLs 2,697 2,254\nState Credits 3,987 2,005\nForeign NOLs 14,090 11,808\nForeign tax credit carryforward 2,168 2,168\nOther (93) 821\nTotal noncurrent deferred tax assets 130,863 106,595\nLess: Valuation allowance (130,733) (106,476)\nTotal net deferred tax asset $ 130 $ 119\nThe net deferred tax asset is classified as other assets, noncurrent in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nAs of December 31, 2014, the Company determined it was more likely than not that it would be unable to fully utilize the majority of its U.S. and state deferred tax assets. As a result, the Company had recorded a valuation allowance against those assets to the extent that they cannot be realized through net operating loss carrybacks to prior years. This valuation allowance is evaluated periodically and will be reversed partially or in whole if business results and the economic environment have sufficiently improved to support realization of some or all of the Company's deferred tax assets. In performing the analysis throughout 2020, the Company determined that there was no sufficient positive evidence to outweigh the current and historic negative evidence to determine that it was more likely than not that the deferred assets would not be realized. Therefore, the Company continues to have a valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nThe Company has federal and state net operating loss carryforwards related to current and prior year operations and acquisitions. Internal Revenue Code Section 382 (\"Section 382\") places certain limitations on the annual amount of U.S. net operating loss carryforwards that can be utilized when a change of ownership occurs. The Company believes the past acquisitions were changes in ownership pursuant to Section 382, subjecting federal acquired net operating losses to limitations. According to French tax law, the net operating loss carryforwards are not subject to ownership change limitations.\nThe U.S. federal net operating losses and R&E tax credit carryforward amount available to be used in future periods, taking into account the Section 382 annual limitation and current year losses, is approximately $389.5 million and $16.6 million, respectively. The Company\u2019s net operating losses will begin to expire in 2024, R&E credits will begin to expire in 2031, and foreign tax credits will begin to expire in 2022. The U.S. net operating losses generated after January 1, 2018 have no expiration. Also included in foreign net operating losses are $50.3 million of French carryforwards which have no expiration.\nUndistributed earnings of the Company\u2019s foreign subsidiaries are considered permanently reinvested and, accordingly, no provision for U.S. federal or state income taxes or non-U.S. withholding taxes has been provided thereon. The cumulative amount of positive undistributed earnings of the Company\u2019s non-U.S. subsidiaries, if any, was minimal for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. The Company is presently investing in international operations located in Europe, North America, the United Arab Emirates, and Australia. The Company is funding the working capital needs of its foreign operations\nthrough its U.S. operations. In the future, the Company plans to utilize its foreign undistributed earnings, as well as continued funding from its U.S. operations, to support its continued foreign investment.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company had approximately zero unrecognized tax benefits, and $0.2 million of net unrecognized tax benefits in 2018 which, if recognized, would impact the Company's effective tax rate. The Company recorded immaterial amounts for interest and penalties to tax expense as of December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. During 2019, the Company determined that the statute of limitations concluded for positions and removed these positions from the uncertain tax positions. The Company believes the remaining position will be removed from the schedule during the next twelve months as the statute expires on that position. The Company continually monitors tax positions and will evaluate if any new positions need to be added during the next twelve months.\nThe Company is currently under an income tax audit in Germany for the calendar tax years 2014-2016. No material taxes are expected to arise from the audit. The Company files tax returns in the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions. The Company may be subject to U.S. federal income tax examination for the calendar tax years 2019, 2018, 2017, 2016, 2015 and 2014 and state and foreign income tax examination for various years depending on the statutes of limitation of those jurisdictions.\nThe following table sets forth the changes to the Company's unrecognized tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 (in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2019 2018\nBeginning balance $ 14 $ 183 $ 183\nChanges based on tax positions related to prior year - - -\nChanges due to settlement - (169) -\nEnding balance $ 14 $ 14 $ 183\nThe table above has been updated to reflect gross tax liability, exclusive of interest and penalties and other offsetting amounts.\n16. Convertible Senior Notes\nThe Company issued $143.8 million principal amount of the 2019 Notes in December 2014, $106.3 million principal amount of the 2047 Notes in June 2017, $143.8 million principal amount of the 2024 Notes in May 2019 and $150.0 million principal amount of the 2027 Notes in September 2020. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, there was no principal amount of either the 2019 Notes or the 2047 Notes outstanding. The interest rate for the 2024 Notes is fixed at 1% per annum and the effective interest rate related to the amortization of the liability component is 6.6%, interest is payable semi-annually in arrears on May 15 and November 15 of each year, commencing on November 15, 2019. The interest rate for the 2027 Notes is fixed at 2.25% per year and the effective interest rate related to the amortization of the liability component is 8.5%, interest is payable semiannually in arrears in cash on March 15 and September 15 of each year, beginning on March 15, 2021. The 2024 Notes mature on May 15, 2024 and the 2027 Notes mature on September 15, 2027, unless redeemed or converted in accordance with their terms prior to such date.\nEach $1,000 of principal of the 2019 Notes were initially convertible into 29.5972 shares of the Company\u2019s common stock, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $33.79 per share. Each $1,000 of principal of the 2024 Notes will initially be convertible into 15.1394 shares of the Company\u2019s common stock, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $66.05 per share. Each $1,000 of principal of the 2027 Notes will initially be convertible into 23.9137 shares of the Company\u2019s common stock, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $41.82 per share. Each $1,000 of principal amount at maturity of the 2047 Notes had an issue price of $880 and were initially convertible into 20.5624 shares of the Company\u2019s common stock, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $48.63 per share. The initial conversion price for each of the Notes is subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain specified events.\nThe Notes are each general unsecured obligations and rank senior in right of payment to all of the Company's indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes, rank equally in right of payment with all of the Company's existing and future liabilities that are not so subordinated, are effectively junior to any of the Company's secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness and are structurally subordinated to all\nindebtedness and other liabilities of the Company's subsidiaries (including trade payables but excluding intercompany obligations owed to the Company or its subsidiaries).\nOn or after February 15, 2024 and June 15, 2027, respectively, to the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders may convert all or any portion of their 2024 and 2027 Notes, respectively, regardless of the contingent conversion conditions described herein. Upon conversion, the Company will pay or deliver cash, shares of its common stock or a combination of cash and shares of its common stock, at its election, as described in the indenture governing the 2024 and 2027 Notes.\nHolders may convert their 2024 and 2027 Notes at their option at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding February 15, 2024 and June 15, 2027, respectively, only under the following circumstances:\n\u2022during the five consecutive business day period immediately following any five consecutive trading day period (the \"Measurement Period\") in which the trading price per 2024 and 2027 Note, respectively, for each day of that Measurement Period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of the Company's common stock and the conversion rate on each such day;\n\u2022during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending on June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2020, respectively, if the last reported sale price of the common stock for 20 or more trading days (whether or not consecutive) in a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price on each applicable trading day; or\n\u2022upon the occurrence of specified corporate events.\nIf a fundamental change (as defined in the relevant indenture governing the applicable series of Notes) occurs prior to the maturity date, holders of each of the Notes may require the Company to repurchase all or a portion of their notes for cash at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount at maturity of the Notes, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the repurchase date.\nIn accordance with accounting guidance on embedded conversion features, the Company valued and bifurcated the conversion options associated with each of the Notes from the respective host debt instrument, which is referred to as debt discount, and recorded the conversion option of each of the Notes in stockholders\u2019 equity. The equity component for each Note is not remeasured as long as such Note continues to meet the conditions for equity classification.\nIn accounting for the transaction costs for each of the Notes issuances, the Company allocated the costs incurred to the liability and equity components in proportion to the allocation of the proceeds from issuance to the liability and equity components. Issuance costs attributable to the liability component, totaling $3.4 million for the 2024 Notes and $2.8 million for the 2027 Notes, are being amortized to expense over the expected life of each Note using the effective interest method. Issuance costs attributable to the equity component related to the conversion option, totaling $1.1 million for the 2024 Notes and $1.3 million for the 2027 Notes, were netted with the equity component in stockholders' equity.\nIn May 2019, in accordance with the Exchange Transactions, the Company used a portion of the net proceeds of the offering of the 2024 Notes to exchange and retire approximately $122.1 million in aggregate principal of the 2019 Notes for an aggregate cash consideration of $76.0 million and approximately 2.2 million shares of the Company's common stock. The Company recorded a $2.3 million loss on debt extinguishment related to the Exchange Transactions. The loss on extinguishment is included in the other (expense) income, net in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss). In the fourth quarter of 2019, at maturity, the Company settled the remaining principal of the 2019 Notes in cash and distributed approximately 0.3 million shares of its common stock to the notes holders, which represented the conversion value in excess of the principal amount.\nIn August 2019, the Company issued a notice of redemption to the holders of its outstanding 2047 Notes and during the third and fourth quarter of 2019, the Company converted the entire aggregate principal of $106.3 million of the 2047 Notes and delivered approximately 2.3 million shares of its common stock upon conversion. The Company recorded a $3.4 million loss on debt extinguishment related to the Redemption. The loss on extinguishment is included in the other (expense) income, net in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss).\nAs of December 31, 2020, the 2024 and 2027 Notes are not yet convertible, and their remaining life is approximately 40 months and 80 months, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the fair value of the principal amount of the Notes was $363.8 million and $163.2 million, respectively. The estimated fair value was determined based on inputs that are observable in the market or that could be derived from, or corroborated with, observable market data, including the Company's stock price and interest rates, which represents level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.\nThe Notes consist of the following (in thousands):\nDecember 31, 2020 December 31, 2019\nLiability component:\nPrincipal $ 293,750 $ 143,750\nLess: debt discount, net of amortization (75,722) (33,046)\nNet carrying amount $ 218,028 $ 110,704\nEquity component (1)\n$ 80,098 $ 32,883\n(1) Recorded within additional paid-in capital in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. As of December 31, 2020, it included $32.9 million and $47.2 million related to the 2024 and 2027 Notes, respectively, net of $1.1 million and $1.3 million issuance cost in equity, respectively. As of December 31, 2019, it included $32.9 million related to the 2024 Notes, net of $1.1 million issuance cost in equity.\nThe following table sets forth total interest expense recognized related to the Notes (in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2019 2018\nCoupon $ 2,422 $ 3,691 $ 5,000\nAmortization of debt issuance costs 733 1,157 1,419\nAmortization of debt discount 7,970 9,917 10,567\nTotal $ 11,125 $ 14,765 $ 16,986\nNote Hedge and Warrant Transactions\nConcurrently with the offering of the 2019 Notes, the Company entered into separate convertible note hedge (the \"Note Hedges\") and warrant (the \"Warrants\") transactions. Taken together, the purchase of the Note Hedges and the sale of the Warrants were intended to offset any actual dilution from the conversion of the 2019 Notes and to effectively increase the overall conversion price of the 2019 Notes from $33.79 to $45.48 per share. The total cost of the Note Hedges was $29.4 million. The Company received $17.1 million in cash proceeds from the sale of the Warrants. The Warrants were not part of the 2019 Notes or Note Hedges. Both the Note Hedges and Warrants have been accounted for as part of additional paid-in capital.\nIn May 2019, in connection with the Exchange Transactions, the Company entered into certain note hedge termination agreements (the \u201cNote Hedge Termination Agreements\u201d) and warrant termination agreements (the \u201cWarrant Termination Agreements\u201d). The Note Hedge Termination Agreements terminated certain of the Note Hedges, and the Warrant Termination Agreements terminated certain of the Warrants. The Company received cash proceeds of $64.8 million related to the Note Hedge Termination Agreements, and paid $45.2 million related to the Warrant Termination Agreements.\nDuring the fourth quarter 2019, the Company received approximately 0.3 million shares of its common stock from the exercise of the remaining Note Hedges related to the 2019 Notes. These shares were recorded as treasury stock, at cost. The remaining warrants expired in August 2020.\nCapped Call Transactions\nIn May 2019 and in September 2020, in connection with the offering of the 2024 and 2027 Notes, respectively, the Company entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions (collectively, the \"Capped Call\") with certain option counterparties. The Capped Call transactions cover, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, the number of shares of the Company\u2019s common stock initially underlying the Notes, at a strike price that corresponds to the initial conversion price of the Notes, also subject to adjustment, and are exercisable upon conversion of the Notes. The Capped Call transactions are intended to reduce potential dilution to the Company\u2019s common stock and/or offset any cash payments the Company will be required to make in excess of the principal amounts upon any conversion of Notes, and to effectively increase the overall conversion price of the 2024 Notes from $66.05 to $101.62 per share and for the 2027 Notes from $41.82 to $78.90 per share. As the Capped\nCall transactions meet certain accounting criteria, they are recorded in stockholders\u2019 equity and are not accounted for as derivatives. The cost of the Capped Call was $16.4 million and $25.3 million for the 2024 and 2027 Notes, respectively, and was recorded as part of additional paid-in capital.\n17. Credit Facility\nIn July 2012, the Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary PROS, Inc., entered into a secured Revolver with a bank lender with a borrowing capacity of up to $50 million, with interest paid at the end of the applicable one month, three month or six month interest period at a rate per annum equal to LIBOR plus an applicable margin of 1.5% to 2.25% or the Federal Funds Rate plus an applicable margin of 1.5% to 2.25%. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had no outstanding borrowings under the Revolver, which expires in July 2022.\nBorrowings under the Revolver are collateralized by a first priority interest in and lien on all of the Company's material assets. The Revolver contains affirmative and negative covenants, including covenants which restrict the ability of the Company to, among other things, create liens, incur additional indebtedness and engage in certain other transactions, in each case subject to certain exclusions. In addition, the Revolver contains certain financial covenants which become effective in the event the Company's liquidity falls below $50 million or upon the occurrence of an event of default. As of December 31, 2020, the Company was in compliance with all financial covenants in the Revolver.\nAs of both December 31, 2020 and 2019, $0.1 million of unamortized debt issuance costs related to the Revolver is included in prepaid and other current assets and other assets, noncurrent in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the Company recorded an immaterial amount of amortization of debt issuance cost which is included in other income (expense), net in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss).\n18. Commitments and Contingencies\nLitigation\nThe Company is involved in various legal proceedings, claims and litigation which arise in the ordinary course of the business. The Company makes a provision for a liability relating to legal matters when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. These provisions are reviewed at least quarterly and adjusted to reflect the impacts of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel and other information and events pertaining to a particular matter. The Company is not currently involved in any outstanding litigation that it believes, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nPurchase Commitments\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company enters into various purchase commitments for goods and services.\nIn March 2019, the Company entered into a noncancelable agreement with a computing infrastructure vendor that amended the existing agreement dated June 2017. The amended agreement has purchase commitments of $37.6 million remaining as of December 31, 2020, and expires in March 2022.\nContractual Obligations\nIn September 2018, the Company entered into an agreement of limited partnership related to a venture fund, pursuant to which the Company committed to make a capital contribution within the next five years.

To date, the Company has not incurred any losses as a result of such indemnifications and has not accrued any liabilities related to such obligations in the Company\u2019s Consolidated Financial Statements.\n19. Segment and Geographic Information\nThe Company operates as one segment with a single reporting unit. Operating segments are the components of an enterprise where separate financial information is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision-maker, who is the Company's Chief Executive Officer, in deciding how to allocate resources and assessing financial performance.
