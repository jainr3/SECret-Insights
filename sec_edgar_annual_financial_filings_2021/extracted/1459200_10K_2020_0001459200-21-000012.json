    "item_1": "ITEM 1. BUSINESS\nOverview\nAlarm.com is the leading platform for the intelligently connected property. We offer a comprehensive suite of cloud-based solutions for smart residential and commercial properties, including interactive security, video monitoring, intelligent automation, energy management and wellness solutions. Millions of property owners depend on our technology to intelligently secure, automate and manage their residential and commercial properties. In the last year alone, our platforms processed more than 200 billion data points generated by over 100 million connected devices. We believe that this scale of subscribers, connected devices and data operations makes us the leader in the connected property market.\nOur solutions are delivered through an established network of over 10,000 trusted service providers, who are experts at selling, installing and supporting our solutions. We primarily generate Software-as-a-Service, or SaaS, and license revenue through our service provider partners, who resell these services and pay us monthly fees. We also generate hardware and other revenue, primarily from our service provider partners and distributors. Our hardware sales include connected devices that enable our services, such as video cameras, video recorders, gateway modules and smart thermostats.\nWe enter into contracts with our service provider partners that establish pricing for access to our platform solutions and for the sale of hardware. These service provider contracts typically have an initial term of one year, with subsequent renewal terms of one year. Our service provider partners typically enter into contracts with our subscribers, which our service provider partners have indicated range from three to five years in length. Our service provider partners are free to market and sell our products under their own guidelines at prices to the consumer that they establish independently. We believe that our network of service providers and the length of our service relationships with residential and commercial property owners, combined with our robust SaaS platforms and over 20 years of operating experience, contribute to a compelling business model.\nWe have experienced significant growth since our company's inception in 2000. We generated total revenue of $618.0 million, $502.4 million and $420.5 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Our SaaS and license revenue was $393.3 million, $337.4 million and $291.1 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, representing a compound annual growth rate of 16.2%. We also generated net income attributable to common stockholders of $77.9 million, $53.5 million and $21.5 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, as well as Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP metric, of $125.3 million, $108.3 million and $93.1 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. See the Non-GAAP Measures section of Item 7. \"Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Non-GAAP Measures,\" for a discussion of the limitations of Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income, the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP, for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.\nOur Solutions and Integrated Platforms\nOur solutions are designed to make both residential and commercial properties safer, smarter and more efficient. Our technology platforms support all participants in what we refer to as the connected property market. This market includes the residential and commercial property owners who subscribe to our services, the hardware partners who manufacture devices that integrate with our platforms and the service provider partners who install and maintain our solutions.\nThe Alarm.com platform enables our service provider partners to deploy our interactive security, video monitoring, intelligent automation, energy management and wellness solutions as stand-alone offerings or as combined solutions to address the needs of a broad range of customers.\nSubscriber Solutions\nInteractive Security\nInteractive security is the entry point for most of our smart home and business subscribers. Our dedicated, two-way cellular connection between the property and our platforms is designed to be tamper resistant and to meet the high reliability standards for life safety services. Our solution integrates with central stations used by our service providers to monitor 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and coordinate emergency response as needed. Subscribers can seamlessly connect to our services to control and monitor their security systems, as well as connected security devices including motion sensors, door locks, garage doors, thermostats and video cameras, through our family of mobile apps, websites and engagement platforms like voice control through Amazon Echo and Google Home, wearable devices like the Apple Watch and TV applications such as Apple TV and Amazon Fire TV.\nThe capabilities associated with this solution include:\n\u25e6Alarm Transmission. We transmit alarm signals from monitored properties through our platforms to approximately 1,000 third-party central monitoring stations staffed 24 hours a day, seven days a week with live operators ready to initiate emergency response.\n\u25e6Smart Signal. Smart Signal is a mobile app feature that gives property owners a faster way to communicate critical information directly to their monitoring station. With a single button push in the Alarm.com mobile app, users can verify an alarm to help expedite emergency response or quickly cancel a false alarm. In addition, home or business owners who need emergency assistance can send a one-touch panic signal directly to their monitoring station.\n\u25e6Connected Car. Our new battery-powered, cellular Connected Car solution extends smart security beyond the home, enabling subscribers to track their vehicle's location, view engine status and analyze fuel efficiency from the Alarm.com mobile app. Subscribers enjoy peace of mind with real-time driver safety alerts, diagnostic alerts and unexpected activity alerts. Fully integrated with the Alarm.com platform, Connected Car provides smarter, more responsive alerts and more intelligent automation than standalone solutions.\n\u25e6Always-On Monitoring. Whether the security system is armed or disarmed, we continuously monitor sensors in the property and can keep subscribers aware of system events in all kinds of situations.\n\u25e6Insights Engine. Our proprietary machine learning algorithms help safeguard connected properties by learning the unique activity patterns at the property and automatically notifying the subscriber of unexpected activity. Facial recognition technology enhances unexpected activity alerts by enabling certain security panels with built-in cameras to proactively monitor for unauthorized sharing or theft of an authorized user's security system codes.\n\u25e6Real-Time Alerts. Notifications for any type of system event are delivered through push notifications, short message service, or SMS, or email, based on the subscriber's preference.\n\u25e6Flex IO. Flex IO is a versatile, completely wireless device that extends awareness across a property and to assets in any location. The battery-powered device leverages LTE Category M capabilities to create new applications of our technology that existing hub-connected sensors cannot address. Flex IO can easily install on a backyard gate, detached garage, remote storage unit, or it can be tethered to other assets like a boat, tractor or lawn mower. Flex IO triggers activity notifications to subscribers as well as video recordings when activity is detected, or an asset is moved.\n\u25e6Wellness. Our technology intelligently monitors quality of life through a suite of connected sensors and devices, and delivers proactive insights into activities of daily living. With alerts about changes in behavior that can indicate emerging quality of life issues, family members and homecare and senior living providers can address issues before they escalate and deliver more efficient care.\nVideo Monitoring\nOur high definition video monitoring solution can provide a direct view into the property, capture footage of critical events and provide visual peace of mind. We offer indoor and outdoor camera solutions for residential and commercial properties at varying price points. We also provide a doorbell video camera solution that supports two-way audio with guests at the door, as well as video management software and cameras for enterprise commercial applications through our OpenEye business.\nThe capabilities associated with our video monitoring solution include:\n\u25e6Video Analytics: Our video analytics engine provides object classification and object tracking technology that can distinguish between people, vehicles and animals, determine an object's direction of movement and measure the duration of activity. Subscribers can selectively control and manage notifications and assign virtual zones and multi-directional \"tripwires\" so they can monitor their properties for highly specific activity.\n\u25e6Live Streaming. Subscribers can securely access live video feeds through the web and mobile apps at any time.\n\u25e6Video Doorbell: Our next generation video doorbell uses proprietary video analytics that quickly and accurately detect outside visitors while reducing unwanted alerts, such as those caused by passing vehicle traffic or swaying branches. A touch-free feature eliminates the need to physically press a doorbell button by immediately activating the doorbell chime when a visitor is detected standing in a designated \u201cdoorbell zone.\u201d\n\u25e6Secure Cloud Storage. Video clips are uploaded to our cloud-based storage system for secure storage and remote viewing.\n\u25e6Video Alerts. Smart clips can be automatically sent via SMS, push notifications or email as soon as they are recorded.\n\u25e6Continuous High Definition Recording. Onsite recording up to 24 hours a day, seven days a week is enabled through our Stream Video Recorder, or SVR, and can be played back securely, from anywhere, through the web and mobile apps.\n\u25e6Commercial Video Surveillance. Our commercial video surveillance offering provides leading commercial-grade network cameras to support a wide range of business needs, enabling multi-camera installations with continuous recording, cloud-based storage and mobile access. Our commercial-grade stream video recorder offers a hybrid solution with local recording, cloud management and off-site storage of critical events and supports up to 16 cameras to give our service provider partners a highly competitive video service for supporting larger video installations in the small and medium sized business market. Our OpenEye solution supports enterprise-level requirements such as advanced forensic video search, point of sale system integration and customer site mapping, as well as large-scale camera deployments.\nIntelligent Automation and Energy Management\nOur solution provides enhanced monitoring and control for a large ecosystem of connected devices, including thermostats, lights, locks, power meters, shades and other devices. Increasing awareness of energy usage and providing intelligent control over connected devices enables subscribers to create personalized automation rules and schedules. We believe our solutions can reduce energy waste as well as increase comfort and convenience for our subscribers. The capabilities associated with this solution include:\n\u25e6Scenes. A customizable scenes button within the Alarm.com app provides the ability to adjust multiple devices in the property with a single command. For example, a homeowner leaving the house can arm the security system, lock the front door, close the garage door and adjust the thermostat with a single command.\n\u25e6Smart Thermostat Schedules. Machine learning algorithms analyze system activity patterns to recommend thermostat schedules that increase energy efficiency when the property is not likely to be occupied.\n\u25e6Responsive Savings. Smart thermostats connected to our platforms can automatically respond to sensors and other devices in the property to conserve energy. For example, when the security system is armed away, an arming state used when the property is not occupied, the thermostat can automatically adjust to save energy.\n\u25e6Precision Comfort. Remote temperature sensors enable a subscriber to manage comfort in a specific area within their property. For example, a homeowner can set a desired temperature for a child's nursery to improve the child\u2019s comfort. Subscribers can easily customize detailed schedules and rules to have the right temperature in the right location at the right time.\n\u25e6Energy Usage Monitoring. Real-time and historical energy usage and solar energy production data for the entire property and individual devices can give subscribers greater insight into the property\u2019s energy profile and encourage more efficient use of energy-consuming devices.\n\u25e6HVAC Monitoring Service. Our Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning, or HVAC, monitoring service works with select high-efficiency heating and cooling systems and allows HVAC contractors to remotely monitor and manage sophisticated residential and light commercial heating and cooling systems.\n\u25e6Whole Home Water Safety Solution. Our comprehensive whole home water safety solution protects properties from a full range of water-related damage. Integrated with Alarm.com\u2019s Smart Water Valve + Meter, our solution can monitor usage, detect both low- and high-volume leaks and automatically shut off the property\u2019s water supply. Working with other connected devices in the Alarm.com ecosystem, our solution can also alert the homeowner about conditions that can lead to frozen and burst pipes, intelligently manage humidity levels and notify homeowners if a sump pump fails.\n\u25e6Geo-Services. Geo-Services use a phone\u2019s geo-location to determine when to notify a subscriber of specific system conditions, or to automatically adjust system settings. Subscribers who enable Geo-Services can be notified if they leave home and forgot to lock a door, close the garage door, arm their security system or close a window. Additionally, smart thermostats and lights can be automatically adjusted based on the subscriber's location. Subscribers can create multiple geo-fences and customize the opt-in feature to meet their specific needs.\n\u25e6Demand Response Programs. Utilities can reduce or shift power consumption during peak demand periods by accessing connected thermostats and other connected devices and appliances that participate in the utility's program. Managed at scale, these voluntary programs can significantly reduce costs for utilities. In addition to enabling subscribers to participate in these programs through our energy management solution, our EnergyHub subsidiary\naggregates a diverse set of smart thermostats, connected water heaters, batteries and electric vehicles, enabling utilities to leverage these devices as an enterprise-grade, grid resource through EnergyHub's SaaS platform.\nCommercial Solutions\nIn addition to our residential solutions, we offer Alarm.com for Business, a security solution for small and medium businesses, ranging from single-site to multi-location businesses. Alarm.com for Business combines intelligent intrusion detection, video surveillance, access control and energy management into a single solution through Alarm.com's app and online interfaces.

Key benefits of the commercial offering include:\n\u25e6Daily Safeguards. Smarter business security keeps subscribers' properties and business locations secure with automatic arming at a certain time each day or after a certain period of inactivity.\n\u25e6Commercial Grade Video Solutions. Connected commercial cameras communicate with the security system, capturing clips as activity occurs, and clips are uploaded to our cloud-based storage system for secure storage and remote viewing. Subscribers can receive real-time alerts and instantly view footage through the web or mobile apps if the alarm goes off, a door is unlocked, or unexpected activity occurs outside of normal business hours. Business owners can assess the situation and take appropriate action at any time of day and from any location.\n\u25e6Energy Savings. Our smarter thermostat helps subscribers reduce energy costs automatically, even if someone forgets to adjust the temperature when they're closing up at the end of the day, generating a return on investment.\n\u25e6Protection for Valuables and Inventory. Quick notifications keep business owners in the know about individuals entering or exiting the back office, the supply room, or any other specific rooms or doors.\n\u25e6Temperature Monitoring. Our new temperature monitoring solution provides monitoring 24 hours a day, seven days a week, real-time alerts and historical temperature reporting to support the temperature control needs of restaurants, grocery stores, pharmacies and other single-system and multi-location commercial customers.

Commercial subscribers with multiple business locations and access points can easily manage Alarm.com\u2019s commercial video and access control solutions from a single dashboard and customize video feeds to seamlessly monitor multiple properties and use sophisticated rules, user permissions and schedules to manage access across multiple locations and security partitions. Business owners and managers can easily add and delete access for new employees and departing employees in a few clicks and provide limited access for third parties such as delivery personnel, without calling the alarm company or worrying about spare keys.\n\u25e6Operational Insights. Visibility into activity patterns and trends can help business owners make smarter decisions around staffing, promotions, energy use and more. Reports show activity patterns across the business, helping owners spot new opportunities for staffing, traffic flow and promotions.\n\u25e6Early Problem Identification. Unexpected activity alerts provide business owners and managers with the early identification of activity such as unexpected entry after hours, or doors propped open that could cause energy waste or safety concerns, helps business owners quickly respond to problematic situations. Alarm.com provides a time stamped log of which users armed or disarmed the system or entered the property using their keycard.\n\u25e6Simple to Use.

Such acquisitions could expand our team and/or technology portfolio to help us add new features to our platforms, accelerate the pace of our innovation or help us access attractive markets.\nMarket Opportunity\nOur addressable market consists of both residential and commercial properties. Our residential subscribers are typically owners of single-family homes and our commercial subscribers often include retail businesses, restaurants, schools and universities, commercial facilities and professional offices.\nWe believe there is an opportunity to significantly increase the adoption of our solutions as more residential and commercial property owners adopt intelligently connected property solutions and as the major technology trends of mobile access, the IoT, big data and cloud technology continue to create opportunities to connect people with their properties in new ways. According to research data published by Strategy Analytics in 2020, the global installed base for smart home devices will grow at a 24.5% compound annual growth rate from 2020 to 2025. We believe that this trend highlights a significant opportunity for market participants, including Alarm.com and our service provider partners.\nOur Technology\nCloud Services Platform\nOur internal engineering teams have designed and developed our core technology. As an industry leader, we believe we have robust cloud service platforms for the intelligently connected property. Our cloud services platforms manage communication with the system at the property, intelligently direct alerts and notifications, learn patterns and identify anomalies and manage video processing and storage. Additionally, our platforms enable device integrations through application program interfaces, or APIs, and offer our service provider partners extensive workflow efficiency services.\nSince our inception, we have utilized a multi-tenant SaaS platform architecture to enable rapid innovation in a scalable environment. Our platforms are architected to scale and our technology team has developed proprietary cloud-based applications to support our service provider partners and subscribers. Security and life safety are mission critical components of our service offering; thus, we are committed to high reliability standards. We operate our Alarm.com cloud services platform through two redundant network operations centers located in Phoenix, Arizona and Ashburn, Virginia. Each center is designed to run the entire Alarm.com platform independent of the other.\nCybersecurity\nThe solutions we provide rely on technology and data, and cybersecurity is a crucial part of our business. We conduct our business in the United States and are expanding internationally in various other countries. Conducting expanded international operations subjects us to additional risks, including our exposure to cyber-attacks. We dedicate substantial resources to the protection of our data, systems and infrastructure. We have implemented and continue to maintain a comprehensive information security program consisting of policies, procedures, and technology designed to maintain the privacy, security and integrity of our data, confidential information, systems and networks. Among other things, the program includes controls designed to limit and monitor access to our systems, networks and data, prevent inappropriate or unauthorized access or modification, and monitor for threats or vulnerability.\nHardware and Manufacturing\nWe are involved in designing and manufacturing various types of hardware that enable our solutions, including:\n\u25e6Cellular Communication Modules. We offer cellular communications modules that are tightly integrated with security system control panels, sensors and other devices. We regularly pioneer technical advances in this space, including the expansion of our deployment of security services hardware with 4G LTE cellular network connections. All of our modules, designed by our device engineering team and manufactured in the United States by a contract manufacturing partner, provide a dedicated and fully managed two-way cellular connection between the subscriber\u2019s property and our cloud platforms. The modules run our proprietary firmware and enable:\n\u2022Real-time analysis of system events reported by security sensors and other devices.\n\u2022Local automation rule execution.\n\u2022The management of message transmissions to our cloud platforms for further processing.\n\u25e6Flex IO. A versatile, completely wireless device that extends awareness across a property and to assets in any location. It can easily install on a backyard gate, detached garage, remote storage unit, or it can be tethered to other assets like a boat, tractor or lawn mower, and triggers activity notifications to subscribers as well as video recordings when activity is detected, or an asset is moved.\n\u25e6Image Sensor. Our image sensor, designed by our device engineering team and manufactured in the United States by a contract manufacturing partner, is a wireless, battery-operated, passive infrared motion sensor that captures images based on various system triggers. These images are transmitted by our cellular communications module to our cloud platforms. Subscribers can securely view images through our website and mobile apps, as well as customize their notification settings to have new images automatically sent via SMS and email.\n\u25e6Video Cameras. We offer a suite of high definition, Internet Protocol, or IP, video cameras to enable our video monitoring services. Our indoor, outdoor, and video doorbell cameras include options for night vision capabilities as well as wireless or Power over Ethernet communication features. We also offer a network video recording device, the SVR, for on premise, continuous video recording seamlessly connected to our cloud platforms for remote playback through our user interfaces. Our video cameras and SVRs are specified to our platforms through proprietary software.\n\u25e6Alarm.com Smart Thermostat. Our Smart Thermostat combines elegant design, sophisticated cloud services and advanced energy management features. It was designed by our Building 36 and device engineering teams to work in concert with other devices in the connected property. It communicates with the Alarm.com communications module via Z-wave and supports both battery power and common wire power installation.\n\u2022Remote temperature sensors can pair with our Smart Thermostat to enable temperature set points for any room in the property, not just the room where the thermostat is installed. Our Smart Thermostat supports multiple remote temperature sensors for precise temperature control for a residential or commercial property.\n\u2022We designed our Smart Thermostat to be easy to install and support remotely. The MobileTech app assists in proper wiring and installation and Remote Toolkit enables remote access to the thermostat settings for easy troubleshooting and support.\n\u25e6Smart Water Valve + Meter. Our Smart Water Valve + Meter is an innovative addition to the Alarm.com Water Management solution, identifying low and high-volume water leaks and constantly monitoring overall water use and current usage rates in homes and businesses. Deep integration with the Alarm.com platform leverages intelligence and insights to help reduce the risk of losses from water emergencies, while also improving water conservation efforts.\nResearch and Development\nWe invest substantial resources in research and development to enhance our platforms and applications, support our technology infrastructure, develop new capabilities and conduct quality assurance testing. We expect to invest significantly in continued research and development efforts to expand the capabilities of our technology. Our research and development of new products and services is a multidisciplinary effort across our product management, program management, software engineering, device engineering, quality engineering, configuration management and network operations teams.\nService Provider Network\nOur trusted service provider partner network is key in driving the adoption of connected home and commercial solutions. Our solutions are sold, installed, and serviced by a network of independent licensed, professional service provider partners. Our channel network currently consists of over 10,000 active service provider partners, including smaller local providers, larger regional providers and national service providers with thousands of employees. We have also seen growth in other areas of our channel network, including new providers in the intelligent automation, HVAC, property management and insurance markets.\nWe believe this highly trusted, established network is a core strength that enables an efficient and scalable customer acquisition model, allowing us to focus on technology innovation. We also believe that the combination of our solutions and our service provider partners\u2019 expertise is the most effective way to drive mass market adoption of the intelligently connected property.\nThe traditional security and home automation market is highly fragmented with approximately 15,000 security service providers nationally. According to the February 2020 Barnes Buchanan Conference Report, the top 5 dealers represented approximately 34% of all industry recurring monthly revenue in 2020. The distribution of revenue among our service provider partners is reflective of the industry overall. ADT LLC represented greater than 15% but not more than 20% of our revenue in 2018, 2019 and 2020.\nSubscribers\nOur platforms currently support millions of residential and commercial subscribers. We define the number of subscribers as the number of residential or commercial properties to which we are delivering at least one of our solutions. A subscriber who subscribes to one of our service level packages as well as one or more of our a la carte add-ons is counted as one subscriber. Our number of subscribers does not include the customers of our service provider partners to whom we license our intellectual property, as they do not utilize one of our SaaS platforms. Our subscriber acquisition cost payback period has historically been one year or less.\nSales and Marketing\nThe goal of our sales team is to help our service provider partners succeed in selling, installing and supporting our full suite of solutions. Our sales team is also responsible for recruiting new service provider partners to Alarm.com. We also have a global business development team dedicated to establishing new service provider and distribution relationships in international markets.\nOur marketing team is focused on empowering our service provider partners to effectively promote and sell our solutions. We design, develop and provide end-to-end marketing services including tools and content for lifecycle marketing to help our service providers build awareness, create interest, activate subscribers, develop and maintain the ongoing customer relationship, increase customer engagement, and generate upsell and referral opportunities. While we offer tools and services to assist our service providers when they are marketing to potential subscribers, we do not control or influence the marketing activities performed by our service providers, as they are free to select the marketing tools they believe will be the most effective. Our contracts with our service providers require that they comply with all applicable rules and laws when engaging in marketing activities. We also offer comprehensive training opportunities through our Alarm.com Academy, including in-person training courses and an online learning management system.\nWe believe our sales and marketing approach enables us to expand our breadth of service providers, provide highly customized services and scale quickly.\nService Provider Support\nWe support the full suite of software and hardware products on the Alarm.com platform through a highly trained and experienced team of professionals based in the United States. We primarily support our service provider partners. Our service provider partners, in turn, support their customers, who are our subscribers. To that end, subscribers occasionally reach us directly with support needs and we either assist the subscriber directly or, when appropriate, route the subscriber to the appropriate service provider partner for additional assistance.\nWe offer high-quality support to our service providers via phone, web ticketing and email. With every interaction, our team is committed to exceptional customer satisfaction and industry-leading response times. We use a tiered structure to efficiently escalate and resolve issues of varying complexity and to scale our support organization as we grow. Our staff is multilingual and we continue to grow our language capabilities to support our international expansion.\nOur Competition\nThe market in which we participate for connected property solutions is fragmented, highly competitive and constantly evolving. We expect competition to continue from existing competitors as well as potential new market entrants in the interactive security, video monitoring, intelligent automation and energy management markets. Our current competitors include providers of other technology platforms for the connected property with interactive security, including Alula (formed following the merger of ipDatatel, LLC and Resolution Products, LLC), Avigilon Corporation, Brivo Inc., Digital Monitoring Products Inc., Eagle Eye Networks Inc., Honeywell International Inc., Resideo Technologies Inc., SecureNet Technologies, LLC, Telular Corporation (acquired by AMETEK, Inc.), United Technologies Corporation, and Verkada Inc., which sell solutions to service providers, cable operators, technology retailers and other residential and commercial automation providers. We also compete with interactive, monitored security solutions sold directly to subscribers and may also be sold through our partners, including companies like Abode Systems, Inc., Arlo Technologies, Inc., Cove Smart, LLC, Scout Security, Inc. and SimpliSafe, Inc. In addition, our service provider partners compete with security solutions sold directly to subscribers, as well as managed service providers, such as cable television, telephone and broadband companies like AT&T Inc., Comcast Cable Communications, LLC and Rogers Communications, Inc., and providers of point products, including Google Inc.'s Nest Labs, Inc. Amazon.com offers Amazon Home Services security packages with bundled equipment and professional installation, and Amazon Key, a security camera and smart lock integration feature. Ring Inc., owned by Amazon.com, offers a connected video doorbell, video cameras and an integrated security system, Ring Alarm. Samsung's SmartThings offers a security system and a home automation and awareness hub. Arlo Technologies, Inc. and Wyze Labs, Inc. offers connected video cameras, a connected video doorbell, and smart security devices. Apple Inc. offers a feature that allows some manufacturers\u2019 connected devices and accessories, including video cameras and doorbells, to be controlled through its HomeKit service available in Apple\u2019s iOS operating system. Additionally, Canary and other companies offer all in one video monitoring and awareness devices. In addition, we may compete\nwith other large and small technology companies that offer control capabilities among their products, applications and services, and have ongoing development efforts to address the broader connected home market.\nMany of our competitors have longer operating histories, greater name recognition, larger customer bases and significantly greater financial, technical, sales, marketing, distribution and other resources than we have. We expect to encounter new competitors as we enter new markets as well as increased competition, both domestically and internationally, from other established and emerging home automation, security monitoring, video monitoring and automation, wellness, and energy management companies as well as large technology companies. In addition, there may be new technologies that are introduced that reduce demand for our solutions or make them obsolete. Our current and potential competitors may also establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties and rapidly acquire significant market share. Increased competition could also result in price reductions and loss of market share, any of which could result in lower revenue and negatively affect our ability to grow our business. We believe the principal competitive factors in the connected property market include the following:\n\u2022simplicity and ease of use;\n\u2022ability to offer persistent awareness, control, and intelligent automation;\n\u2022breadth of features and functionality provided;\n\u2022flexibility of the solutions and ability to personalize for the individual consumer;\n\u2022compatibility with a wide selection of third-party devices;\n\u2022pricing, affordability, and accessibility;\n\u2022sales reach and local installation and support capabilities; and\n\u2022brand awareness and reputation.\nWe believe that we compete favorably with respect to each of these factors. Additionally, we believe that our cloud-based software platforms, intelligently connected property solutions, and proven scalability help further differentiate us from competitors. Nevertheless, our competitors may have substantially greater financial, technical and other resources, greater brand recognition, larger sales and marketing budgets and broader distribution channels than we do.\nOur Intellectual Property\nOur success and ability to compete effectively depend in part on our ability to protect our proprietary technology and to establish and adequately protect our intellectual property rights. To accomplish these objectives, we rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws in the United States and other jurisdictions, as well as license agreements, confidentiality agreements and other contractual protections.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we owned 423 issued United States utility patents, one issued United States design patent, eight issued Canadian patents and five issued Australian patents and these patents are scheduled to expire between 2021 and 2039. We continue to broaden our intellectual property portfolio and file patent applications and as of December 31, 2020, we had 261 pending utility patent applications and 44 provisional patent applications filed in the United States. We also had 13 pending international patent applications and 106 international patent applications pending under the Patent Cooperation Treaty. The claims for which we have sought patent protection apply to both our platforms and solutions. Our patent and patent applications generally apply to the features and functions of our platforms, and solutions and the applications associated with our platforms. We also have, and may be required to seek, licenses under patents or intellectual property rights owned by third parties, including open-source software and other commercially available software.\nWe also rely on several registered and unregistered trademarks to protect our brand. We have 15 registered trademarks in the United States, including Alarm.com and the Alarm.com logo and design, and six registered trademarks in Canada.\nWe seek to protect our intellectual property rights by requiring our employees and independent contractors involved in development to enter into agreements acknowledging that all inventions, trade secrets, works of authorship, developments, concepts, processes, improvements and other works generated by them on our behalf are our intellectual property, and assigning to us any rights, including intellectual property rights, that they may claim in those works.\nWe expect that products in our industry may be subject to third-party infringement lawsuits as the number of competitors grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps. We have brought infringement claims against third parties in the past and may do so in the future to defend our intellectual property position. In addition, from time to time, we\nmay face claims by third parties that we infringe upon or misappropriate their intellectual property rights, and we may be found to be infringing upon or to have misappropriated such rights. In the future, we, or our service providers or subscribers, may be the subject of legal proceedings alleging that our solutions or underlying technology infringe or violate the intellectual property rights of others.\nOur Human Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had 1,404 full-time employees, including 461 in sales and marketing, 780 in research and development and 163 in a general and administrative capacity. As of December 31, 2020, we had 1,290 employees in our Alarm.com segment and 114 employees in our Other segment. We also engage consultants and temporary employees from time to time. None of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements and we consider our relations with our employees to be good.\nWe recognize that attracting, motivating and retaining talent at all levels is critical to continuing our success. By improving employee retention and engagement, we also improve our ability to support our service provider partners and protect the long-term interests of our stockholders. We invest in our employees through high-quality benefits and various health and wellness initiatives and offer competitive compensation packages, ensuring fairness in internal compensation practices.\nTo further engage and incentivize our workforce, we offer a wide range of programs and avenues for support, motivation, and professional recognition. We utilize both instructor-led training and online learning to provide custom training courses to ensure our sales and services teams stay up-to-date on our products and service offerings. For our talent pipeline development, we work closely with individual departments to provide training and hands-on support for managers and leaders, to assess talent, identify development opportunities and discuss succession planning. In addition, we regularly conduct employee surveys to gauge employee engagement and identify areas of focus.\nGovernment Regulations\nOur business, operations and service provider partners are subject to various U.S. federal, state and local consumer protection laws, licensing regulation and other laws and regulations, and to similar laws and regulations in the other countries in which we operate. Compliance with these laws, rules, and regulations has not had a material effect upon our capital expenditures, results of operations or competitive position. Nevertheless, compliance with existing or future governmental regulations, including, but not limited to, those pertaining to global trade, business acquisitions, consumer protection, and taxes, could have a material impact on our business in subsequent periods. Refer to \u201c",
    "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nOur business and results of operations may be negatively affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the global economy and global supply chains, and created significant disruption of global financial markets. Governments, public institutions and other organizations in many countries and localities where COVID-19 has been detected have taken certain emergency measures and may from time to time take additional emergency measures, to combat its spread, including imposing lockdowns, shelter-in-place orders, quarantines, restrictions on travel and gatherings and the extended shutdown of non-essential businesses that cannot be conducted remotely. These emergency measures remain in place to varying degrees. While vaccines have been approved for use in the United States and in many other countries, supplies of the vaccine remain limited and it remains difficult to assess or predict the ultimate duration and economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. To date, the COVID-19 pandemic has, and it may continue to, disrupt our hardware supply chain, including limited inventory availability, increased lead times, and shipping delays, as well as cause disruptions to and restrictions on our service providers\u2019 ability to travel and to meet with residential and commercial property owners who use our solutions, cancellations or postponement of certain events, or temporary closures of our facilities or the facilities of our service providers or suppliers. See \u201cWe depend on our suppliers, and the loss of any key supplier could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations\u201d below. The COVID-19 pandemic has also resulted in significant volatility in global financial markets, which may reduce our ability to access capital and which could negatively affect our liquidity in the future. This economic and financial uncertainty may also negatively impact pricing for our platform or cause customers to reduce or postpone purchasing our solutions, which may, in turn, negatively affect our revenue, cash flows, results of operations and financial condition. The increased uncertainty and volatility in global markets may also negatively impact our growth opportunities whether organically or through acquisitions. Because our service provider partners have indicated that they typically have three to five-year service contracts with residential and commercial property owners who use our solutions, any such adverse effects may not be fully reflected in our results of operation until future periods.\nThe uncertainty caused by and the unprecedented nature of the current COVID-19 pandemic makes the potential impact of the pandemic difficult to predict and the extent to which it may negatively affect our industry, our supply of hardware products, our business operations or our operating results is uncertain. Weak global economic conditions, additional business disruptions or closures and spikes or surges in COVID-19 infection, also may exacerbate the impact of the pandemic. Further, we do not yet know the full effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our suppliers and service providers. However, if the economy fails to fully recover or there are additional shutdowns of non-essential businesses due to a resurgence of COVID-19, our SaaS and license revenue growth rate may be lower in future periods, with a corresponding reduction in hardware revenue, if some consumers or small businesses defer or cancel previously anticipated purchases.\nThe ultimate impact to our results will depend to a large extent on currently unknowable developments, including the length of time the disruption and uncertainty caused by COVID-19 will continue, which will, in turn, depend on, among other things, the actions taken by authorities and other entities to effect a widespread roll-out of the available vaccines or otherwise contain COVID-19 or treat its impact, including the impact of any re-opening plans, additional closures and spikes or surges in COVID-19 infection, and individuals\u2019 and companies\u2019 risk tolerance regarding health matters going forward, all of which are beyond our control. Accordingly, these potential impacts, while uncertain, could harm our business and adversely affect our operating results. In addition, to the extent the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business and results of operations, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks and uncertainties described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section which may materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur actual operating results may differ significantly from any guidance provided.\nOur guidance, including forward-looking statements, is prepared by management and is qualified by, and subject to, a number of assumptions and estimates that, while presented with numerical specificity, are inherently subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies. Many of these uncertainties and contingencies are beyond our control and are based upon specific assumptions with respect to future business decisions, some of which will change. We generally state possible outcomes as high and low ranges which are intended to provide a sensitivity analysis as variables are changed but are not intended to represent that actual results could not fall outside of the suggested ranges.\nGuidance is necessarily speculative in nature, and it can be expected that some or all of the assumptions of the guidance furnished by us will not materialize or will vary significantly from actual results. In particular, guidance relating to the anticipated results of operations of an acquired business is inherently more speculative in nature than other guidance as management will, necessarily, be less familiar with the business, procedures and operations of the acquired business. Similarly, guidance offered in periods of extreme uncertainty, such as the uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the evolving responses to the resulting public health crisis, is inherently more speculative in nature than guidance offered in periods of relative stability. Accordingly, any guidance with respect to our projected financial performance is necessarily only an estimate of what management believes is realizable as of the date the guidance is given. Actual results will vary from the guidance and the\nvariations may be material. Investors should also recognize that the reliability of any forecasted financial data will diminish the farther in the future that the data is forecasted.\nActual operating results may be different from our guidance, and such differences may be adverse and material. In light of the foregoing, investors are urged to put the guidance in context and not to place undue reliance on it. In addition, the market price of our common stock may reflect various market assumptions as to the accuracy of our guidance. If our actual results of operations fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts, the price of our common stock could decline substantially.\nWe have taken certain precautions due to the COVID-19 pandemic that could harm our business.\nIn light of the uncertain and rapidly evolving situation relating to the spread of COVID-19 and shelter-in-place orders in many of the locations we have offices or other facilities, we have taken temporary precautionary measures intended to help minimize the risk of COVID-19 to our employees, service providers and subscribers, as well as the communities in which we participate. These precautionary measures could negatively impact our business. In particular, we have enabled substantially all of our employees to work remotely in compliance with relevant government advice, have suspended all non-essential travel for our employees, are canceling or postponing company-sponsored events, employee attendance at industry events and in-person work-related meetings. Although we continue to monitor the situation and may adjust our current policies as more information and guidance become available, temporarily suspending travel and shifting non-essential function employees to work-from-home could negatively impact our marketing efforts, slow down our recruiting efforts, or create operational or other challenges, including decreased productivity, any of which could harm our business. Though we are taking these precautionary measures as well as preparing our systems for the likelihood of increased cybersecurity threats, there is no guarantee that our precautions will fully protect our employees or enable us to maintain our productivity and any illnesses linked or alleged to be linked to our employees or service providers, whether accurate or not, could further harm our business. The extent to which COVID-19 and our precautionary measures related thereto may impact our business will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time.\nOur quarterly results of operations have fluctuated and are likely to continue to fluctuate. As a result, we may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of investors or securities analysts, which could cause our stock price to decline.\nOur quarterly operating results, including the levels of our revenue, gross margin, cash flow and deferred revenue, may fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors, including adverse macroeconomic conditions, the product mix that we sell, the relative sales related to our platforms and solutions and other factors which are outside of our control. If our quarterly revenue or results of operations fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts, the price of our common stock could decline substantially. Fluctuations in our results of operations may be due to a number of factors, including:\n\u2022the portion of our revenue attributable to software as a service, or SaaS, and license versus hardware and other sales;\n\u2022our ability to manage the businesses we have acquired, and to integrate and manage any future acquisitions of businesses;\n\u2022fluctuations in demand, including due to seasonality or broader economic factors, for our platforms and solutions;\n\u2022changes in pricing by us in response to competitive pricing actions;\n\u2022our ability to increase, retain and incentivize the service provider partners that market, sell, install and support our platforms and solutions;\n\u2022the ability of our hardware vendors to continue to manufacture high-quality products and to supply sufficient components and products to meet our demands;\n\u2022the timing and success of introductions of new solutions, products or upgrades by us or our competitors and the entrance of new competitors;\n\u2022changes in our business and pricing policies or those of our competitors;\n\u2022the ability to accurately forecast revenue as we generally rely upon our service provider partner network to generate new revenue;\n\u2022our ability to control costs, including our operating expenses and the costs of the hardware we purchase;\n\u2022changes in U.S. trade policies, including new or potential tariffs or penalties on imported products;\n\u2022competition, including entry into the industry by new competitors and new offerings by existing competitors;\n\u2022issues related to introductions of new or improved products such as supply chain disruptions or shortages of prior generation products or short-term decreased demand for next generation products;\n\u2022perceived or actual problems with the security, privacy, integrity, reliability, quality or compatibility of our solutions, including those related to security breaches in our systems, our subscribers\u2019 systems, unscheduled downtime, or outages;\n\u2022the amount and timing of expenditures, including those related to expanding our operations, including through acquisitions, increasing research and development, introducing new solutions or paying litigation expenses;\n\u2022the ability to effectively manage growth within existing and new markets domestically and abroad;\n\u2022changes in the payment terms for our platforms and solutions;\n\u2022collectability of receivables due from service provider partners and other third parties;\n\u2022the strength of regional, national and global economies; and\n\u2022the impact of natural disasters such as earthquakes, hurricanes, fires, power outages, floods, epidemics, pandemics, including COVID-19, and other catastrophic events or man-made problems such as terrorism or global or regional economic, political and social conditions.\nFluctuations in our quarterly operating results may be particularly pronounced in the current economic environment due to the uncertainty caused by and the unprecedented nature of the current COVID-19 pandemic. Due to the foregoing factors and the other risks discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, you should not rely on quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our results of operations as an indication of our future performance. You should not consider our recent revenue and Adjusted EBITDA growth or results of one quarter as indicative of our future performance. See the Non-GAAP Measures section of Item 7. \"Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Non-GAAP Measures,\" for a discussion of the limitations of Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income, the most comparable GAAP measurement, for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.\nDownturns in general economic and market conditions and reductions in spending may reduce demand for our platforms and solutions, which could harm our revenue, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur revenue, results of operations and cash flows depend on the overall demand for our platforms and solutions. Negative conditions in the general economy both in the United States and abroad, including conditions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, changes in gross domestic product growth, financial and credit market fluctuations, energy costs, international trade relations and other geopolitical issues, the availability and cost of credit and the global housing and mortgage markets could cause a decrease in consumer discretionary spending and business investment and diminish growth expectations in the U.S. economy and abroad.\nDuring weak economic times, the available pool of service providers may decline as the prospects for home building and home renovation projects diminish, which may have a corresponding impact on our growth prospects. In addition, there is an increased risk during these periods that an increased percentage of our service provider partners will file for bankruptcy protection, which may harm our reputation, revenue, profitability and results of operations. In addition, we may determine that the cost of pursuing any claim may outweigh the recovery potential of such claim. Likewise, consumer bankruptcies can detrimentally affect the business stability of our service provider partners.\nThe current COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant uncertainty and volatility in global markets, which has and may continue to cause consumer discretionary spending to decline for an unknown period of time. A prolonged economic slowdown and a material reduction in new home construction and renovation projects may result in diminished sales of our platforms and solutions. Further worsening, broadening or protracted extension of the economic downturn could have a negative impact on our business, revenue, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe sell security and life safety solutions and if our solutions fail for any reason, we could be subject to liability and our business could suffer.\nWe sell security and life safety solutions, which are designed to secure the safety of our subscribers and their residences or commercial properties. If these solutions fail for any reason, including due to defects in our software, a carrier outage, a failure of our network operations centers, a failure on the part of one of our service provider partners or user error, some of which have happened from time to time, we could be subject to liability for such failures and our business could suffer.\nOur platforms and solutions may contain undetected defects in the software, infrastructure, third-party components or processes. In addition, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have enabled substantially all of our employees to work remotely which may make us more vulnerable to cyber-attacks and may create operational or other challenges, any of which could harm our systems or our business. Although we have taken precautionary measures to prepare for these threats and challenges, there is no guarantee that our precautions will fully protect our systems. We continue to monitor the situation and may adjust our current policies as more information and guidance become available. If our platforms or solutions suffer from defects, we could experience harm to our branded reputation, claims by our subscribers or service provider partners or lost revenue during the period required to address the cause of the defects. We have found and may find defects in new, acquired or upgraded solutions, resulting in loss of, or delay in, market acceptance of our platforms and solutions, which could harm our business, financial condition, cash flows or results of operations.\nSince solutions that enable our platforms are installed by our service provider partners, if they do not install or maintain such solutions correctly, our platforms and solutions may not function properly. If the improper installation or maintenance of our platforms and solutions leads to service or equipment failures after introduction of, or an upgrade to, our platforms or a solution, we could experience harm to our branded reputation, claims by our subscribers or service provider partners or lost revenue during the period required to address the cause of the problem. Further, we rely on our service provider partners to provide the primary source of support and ongoing service to our subscribers and, if our service provider partners fail to provide an adequate level of support and services to our subscribers, it could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition, cash flows or results of operations.\nAny defect in, or disruption to, our platforms and solutions could cause consumers not to purchase additional solutions from us, prevent potential consumers from purchasing our platforms and solutions or harm our reputation. Although our contracts with our service provider partners limit our liability to our service provider partners for these defects, disruptions or errors, we nonetheless could be subject to litigation for actual or alleged losses to our service provider partners or our subscribers, which may require us to spend significant time and money in litigation or arbitration, or to pay significant settlements or damages. Defending a lawsuit, regardless of its merit, could be costly, divert management's attention and affect our ability to obtain or maintain liability insurance on acceptable terms and could harm our business. Although we currently maintain some warranty reserves, we cannot assure you that these warranty reserves will be sufficient to cover future liabilities.\nOur business is subject to the risks of earthquakes, hurricanes, fires, power outages, floods, pandemics, natural disasters and other catastrophic events, and to interruption by man-made problems such as terrorism or global or regional economic, political and social conditions.\nA significant natural disaster, such as an earthquake, hurricane, fire, flood, or a public health pandemic, such as COVID-19, or a significant power outage could harm our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. Natural disasters could affect our hardware vendors, our wireless carriers or our network operations centers. Further, if a natural disaster occurs in a region from which we derive a significant portion of our revenue, such as metropolitan areas in North America, consumers in that region may delay or forego purchases of our platforms and solutions from service providers in the region, which may harm our results of operations for a particular period. In addition, terrorist acts or acts of war could cause disruptions in our business or the business of our hardware vendors, service providers, subscribers or the economy as a whole. More generally, these and other geopolitical, social and economic conditions could result in increased volatility in worldwide financial markets and economies that could harm our sales. Given our concentration of sales during the second and third quarters, any disruption in the business of our hardware vendors, service provider partners or subscribers that impacts sales during the second or third quarter of each year could have a greater impact on our annual results. All of the aforementioned risks may be augmented if the disaster recovery plans for us, our service provider partners and our suppliers prove to be inadequate. To the extent that any of the above results in delays or cancellations of orders, or delays in the manufacture, deployment or shipment of our platforms and solutions, our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations would be harmed.\nWe may not sustain our growth rate and we may not be able to manage any future growth effectively.\nWe have experienced significant growth and also have substantially expanded our operations in a short period of time. Our revenue increased from $261.1 million in 2016 to $618.0 million in 2020. We do not expect to achieve similar growth rates in future periods. You should not rely on our operating results for any prior quarterly or annual periods as an indication of our future operating performance. If we are unable to maintain expected revenue growth in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of prior period revenue, our financial results could suffer and our stock price could decline.\nOur future operating results depend, to a large extent, on our ability to successfully manage any future expansion and growth. To successfully manage our growth and obligations as a public company, we believe we must effectively, among other things:\n\u2022maintain our relationships with existing service provider partners and add new service provider partners;\n\u2022increase our subscriber base and help our service provider partners maintain and improve their revenue retention rates, while also expanding their cross-sell effectiveness;\n\u2022manage our relationships with our hardware vendors and other key suppliers;\n\u2022add, train and integrate sales and marketing personnel;\n\u2022expand our international operations; and\n\u2022continue to implement and improve our administrative, financial and operational systems, procedures and controls.\nWe intend to continue to invest in research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative functions and other areas to grow our business. We are likely to recognize the costs associated with these increased investments earlier than some of the anticipated benefits and the return on these investments may be lower, or may develop more slowly, than we expect, which could adversely affect our operating results.\nIf we are unable to manage our growth effectively, we may not be able to take advantage of market opportunities or develop new solutions or enhancements to our existing solutions and we may fail to satisfy subscriber and service provider partner requirements, maintain the quality of our solutions, execute on our business plan or respond to competitive pressures, which could result in our financial results suffering and a decline in our stock price.\nWe have expanded our business rapidly in recent periods. If we fail to manage the expansion of our operations and infrastructure effectively, we may be unable to execute our business plan, maintain high levels of service or address competitive challenges adequately.\nWe increased our number of full-time employees from 607 as of December 31, 2016 to 1,404 as of December 31, 2020. Our growth has placed, and may continue to place, a significant strain on our managerial, administrative, operational, financial and other resources. We intend to further expand our overall business, service provider partner network, subscriber base, headcount and operations, including by acquiring other businesses. Creating and maintaining a global organization and managing a geographically dispersed workforce requires substantial management effort and significant additional investment in our infrastructure. We will be required to continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls and our reporting procedures to ensure timely and accurate reporting of our operational and financial results and we may not be able to do so effectively. As such, we may be unable to manage our expenses effectively in the future, which may negatively impact our gross profit or operating expenses in any particular quarter. If we fail to manage our anticipated growth and change in a manner that preserves the key aspects of our corporate culture, the quality of our solutions may suffer, which could negatively affect our brand and reputation and harm our ability to retain and attract service provider partners and consumers.\nFrom time to time, we are involved in legal proceedings where a negative outcome, including an adverse litigation judgment or settlement, could expose us to monetary damages or limit our ability to operate our business, resulting in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nWe are involved and have been involved in the past in legal proceedings from time to time, including claims directly against us or claims against certain of our service provider partners where we have agreed to indemnify those service provider partners. For example, on June 2, 2015, Vivint filed a lawsuit against us alleging that our technology directly and indirectly infringes six patents purchased by Vivint. On October 22, 2019, EcoFactor, Inc., or EcoFactor, filed a complaint with the U.S. International Trade Commission, or ITC, alleging that Alarm.com\u2019s smart thermostats infringe three U.S. patents owned by EcoFactor. On November 11, 2019, EcoFactor filed a lawsuit against us in U.S. District Court, District of Massachusetts, alleging infringement of the same three patents asserted against us in the ITC. On January 31, 2020, EcoFactor filed a lawsuit against us in the U.S. District Court, Western District of Texas, alleging Alarm.com\u2019s products and services infringe four additional U.S. patents owned by EcoFactor. EcoFactor is seeking permanent injunctions, enhanced damages and attorney's fees. On July 13, 2016, Applied Capital, Inc., or Applied Capital, filed a lawsuit against ADT, alleging that ADT\u2019s sales of ADT Pulse directly and indirectly infringe two patents purchased by Applied Capital. Applied Capital is seeking damages and attorney\u2019s fees. We are indemnifying ADT in this matter. See the section of this Annual Report titled \"Legal Proceedings\" for additional information regarding each of these matters and the other legal proceedings we are involved in. We may not be able to accurately assess the risks related to any of these suits, and we may be unable to accurately assess our level of exposure as the results of any litigation, investigations and other legal proceedings are inherently unpredictable and expensive. Any claims against us, whether meritorious or not, could be time consuming, result in costly litigation, damage our reputation, require significant amounts of management time and divert significant resource. Companies in our industry have been subject to claims related to patent infringement, regulatory matters, and product liability, as well as contract and employment-related claims. As a result of patent infringement and other intellectual property proceedings, we have, and may be required to seek in the future, licenses under patents or intellectual property rights owned by third parties, including open-source software and other commercially available software, which can be costly, or cross-license agreements relating to our and third-party intellectual property. The outcome of legal claims and proceedings against us\ncannot be predicted with certainty, and a negative outcome could result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nOur business operates in a regulated industry.\nOur business, operations and service provider partners are subject to various U.S. federal, state and local consumer protection laws, licensing regulation and other laws and regulations, and to similar laws and regulations in the other countries in which we operate. Our advertising and sales practices and that of our U.S. service provider partner network are subject to regulation by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, or the FTC, in addition to state consumer protection laws. The FTC and the Federal Communications Commission have issued regulations that place restrictions on, among other things, unsolicited automated telephone calls to residential and wireless telephone subscribers by means of automatic telephone dialing systems and the use of prerecorded or artificial voice messages. If our service provider partners were to take actions in violation of these regulations, such as telemarketing to individuals on the \"Do Not Call\" registry or using automatic telephone dialing systems and prerecorded or artificial voice messages, we could be subject to fines, penalties, private actions or enforcement actions by government regulators. Although we have taken steps to insulate ourselves from any such wrongful conduct by our service provider partners, and to contractually require our service provider partners to comply with these laws and regulations, we have in the past incurred costs to settle alleged violations of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, or TCPA, and no assurance can be given that we will not be exposed to future liability as result of our service provider partners\u2019 conduct. Further, to the extent that any changes in law or regulation further restrict the lead generation activity of our service provider partners, these restrictions could result in a material reduction in subscriber acquisition opportunities, reducing the growth prospects of our business and adversely affecting our financial condition and future cash flows. In addition, most states in which we operate have licensing laws directed specifically toward the monitored security services industry. Our business relies heavily upon cellular telephone service to communicate signals. Cellular telephone companies are currently regulated by both federal and state governments. State-level privacy and data security laws in California and various other U.S. states regulate our, and our service provider partners\u2019, use, collection, and disclosure of subscribers\u2019 personal information. A number of proposed privacy bills in other U.S. states could place restrictions on how we and our service provider partners use personal information and market to consumers in those states. Other laws and regulations, including consumer protection laws, laws and regulations governing advertising and sales practices, as well as privacy and data security laws and regulations apply in the other countries in which we operate. See \u201cEvolving government and industry regulation and changes in applicable laws relating to the Internet and data privacy may increase our expenditures related to compliance efforts or otherwise limit the solutions we can offer, which may harm our business and adversely affect our financial condition\u201d below. Changes in laws or regulations could require us to change the way we operate, which could increase costs or otherwise disrupt operations. In addition, failure to comply with any such applicable laws or regulations could result in substantial fines or revocation of our operating permits and licenses, including in geographic areas where our services have substantial penetration, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. Further, if these laws and regulations were to change or if we fail to comply with such laws and regulations as they exist today or in the future, our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe markets in which we participate are highly competitive and many companies, including large technology companies, broadband and security service providers and other managed service providers, are actively targeting the home automation, security monitoring, video monitoring and energy management markets. If we are unable to compete effectively with these companies, our sales and profitability could be adversely affected.\nWe compete in several markets, including security, video, automation, energy management and wellness solutions. The markets in which we participate are highly competitive and competition may intensify in the future.\nOur ability to compete depends on a number of factors, including:\n\u2022our platforms and solutions\u2019 functionality, performance, ease of use and installation, reliability, availability and cost effectiveness relative to that of our competitors\u2019 products;\n\u2022our success in utilizing new and proprietary technologies to offer solutions and features previously not available in the marketplace;\n\u2022our success in identifying new markets, applications and technologies;\n\u2022our ability to attract and retain service provider partners;\n\u2022our name recognition and reputation;\n\u2022our ability to recruit software engineers and sales and marketing personnel; and\n\u2022our ability to protect our intellectual property.\nConsumers may prefer to purchase from their existing suppliers rather than a new supplier regardless of product performance or features. In the event a consumer decides to evaluate a new home automation, security monitoring, video monitoring, energy management, or wellness solution, the consumer may be more inclined to select one of our competitors whose product offerings are broader than those that we offer. In addition, while the COVID-19 pandemic continues, consumers may prefer to purchase products that they can install themselves. If there are continuing restrictions on our service providers\u2019 ability to meet with residential and commercial property owners in person, our ability to compete will depend on our ability to make our products available for remote installation or to make certain of our products easily installable by consumers rather than solely by our service providers.\nOur current competitors include providers of other technology platforms for the connected property with interactive security, including Alula (formed following the merger of ipDatatel, LLC and Resolution Products, LLC), Avigilon Corporation, Brivo Inc., Digital Monitoring Products Inc., Eagle Eye Networks Inc., Honeywell International Inc., Resideo Technologies Inc., SecureNet Technologies, LLC, Telular Corporation (acquired by AMETEK, Inc.), United Technologies Corporation, and Verkada Inc., which sell solutions to service providers, cable operators, technology retailers and other residential and commercial automation providers. We also compete with interactive, monitored security solutions sold directly to subscribers and may also be sold through our partners, including companies like Abode Systems, Inc., Arlo Technologies, Inc., Cove Smart, LLC, Scout Security, Inc. and SimpliSafe, Inc. In addition, our service provider partners compete with security solutions sold directly to subscribers, as well as managed service providers, such as cable television, telephone and broadband companies like AT&T Inc., Comcast Cable Communications, LLC and Rogers Communications, Inc., and providers of point products, including Google Inc.'s Nest Labs, Inc. Amazon.com offers Amazon Home Services security packages with bundled equipment and professional installation, and Amazon Key, a security camera and smart lock integration feature. Ring Inc., owned by Amazon.com, offers a connected video doorbell, video cameras and an integrated security system, Ring Alarm. Samsung's SmartThings offers a security system and a home automation and awareness hub. Arlo Technologies, Inc. and Wyze Labs, Inc. offers connected video cameras, a connected video doorbell, and smart security devices. Apple Inc. offers a feature that allows some manufacturers\u2019 connected devices and accessories, including video cameras and doorbells, to be controlled through its HomeKit service available in Apple\u2019s iOS operating system. Additionally, Canary and other companies offer all in one video monitoring and awareness devices. In addition, we may compete with other large and small technology companies that offer control capabilities among their products, applications and services, and have ongoing development efforts to address the broader connected home market.\nMany of our competitors have longer operating histories, greater name recognition, larger customer bases and significantly greater financial, technical, sales, marketing, distribution and other resources than we have. We expect to encounter new competitors as we enter new markets as well as increased competition, both domestically and internationally, from other established and emerging home automation, security monitoring, video monitoring and automation, wellness, and energy management companies as well as large technology companies. In addition, there may be new technologies that are introduced that reduce demand for our solutions or make them obsolete. Our current and potential competitors may also establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties and rapidly acquire significant market share. Increased competition could also result in price reductions and loss of market share, any of which could result in lower revenue and negatively affect our ability to grow our business.\nAggressive business tactics by our competitors may reduce our revenue.\nIncreased competition in the markets in which we compete may result in aggressive business tactics by our competitors, including:\n\u2022selling at a discount;\n\u2022offering products similar to our platforms and solutions on a bundled basis at no charge;\n\u2022announcing competing products combined with extensive marketing efforts;\n\u2022providing financing incentives to consumers; and\n\u2022asserting intellectual property rights irrespective of the validity of the claims.\nOur service provider partners may switch and offer the products and services of competing companies, which would adversely affect our sales and profitability. Competition from other companies may also adversely affect our negotiations with service provider partners and suppliers, including, in some cases, requiring us to lower our prices. Opportunities to take market share using innovative products, services and sales approaches may also attract new entrants to the field. We may not be able to compete successfully with the offerings and sales tactics of other companies, which could result in the loss of service provider partners offering our platforms and solutions and, as a result, our revenue and profitability could be adversely affected.\nIf we fail to compete successfully against our current and future competitors, or if our current or future competitors employ aggressive business tactics, including those described above, demand for our platforms and solutions could decline, we could experience cancellations of our services to consumers, or we could be required to reduce our prices or increase our expenses.\nThe proper and efficient functioning of our network operations centers and data back-up systems is central to our solutions.\nOur solutions operate with a hosted architecture and we update our solutions regularly while our solutions are operating. If our solutions and/or upgrades fail to operate properly, our solutions could stop functioning for a period of time, which could put our users at risk. Our ability to keep our business operating is highly dependent on the proper and efficient operation of our network operations centers and data back-up systems. Although our network operations centers have back-up computer and power systems, if there is a catastrophic event, natural disaster, terrorist attack, security breach or other extraordinary event, we may be unable to provide our subscribers with uninterrupted monitoring service or may be unable to adequately protect confidential information and data from unauthorized access or loss. Furthermore, because data back-up systems are susceptible to malfunctions and interruptions (including those due to equipment damage, power outages, human error, computer viruses, computer hacking, data corruption and a range of other hardware, software and network problems), we cannot guarantee that we will not experience data back-up failures in the future. A significant or large-scale security breach, malfunction or interruption of our network operations centers or data back-up systems could adversely affect our ability to keep our operations running efficiently or could result in unauthorized access to or loss of data. If such an event results in unauthorized access to or loss of service provider partner, subscriber, employee or other personally identifiable data subject to data privacy and security laws and regulations, then it could result in substantial fines by U.S. federal and state authorities, foreign data privacy authorities in the European Union, or the EU, Canada, and other countries, and/or private claims by companies or individuals. If a malfunction or security breach results in a wider or sustained disruption, it could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition, cash flows or results of operations.\nFailure to maintain the security of our information and technology networks, including information relating to our service provider partners, subscribers and employees, could adversely affect us.\nWe are dependent on information technology networks and systems, including the Internet, to process, transmit and store electronic information and, in the normal course of our business, we collect and retain certain information pertaining to our service provider partners, subscribers and employees, including credit card information for many of our service provider partners and certain of our subscribers. If security breaches in connection with the delivery of our solutions allow unauthorized third parties to access any of this data or obtain control of our subscribers\u2019 systems, our reputation, business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations could be harmed.\nThe legal, regulatory and contractual environment surrounding information security, privacy and credit card fraud is constantly evolving and companies that collect and retain such information are under increasing attack by cyber-criminals around the world. Further, as the regulatory focus on privacy issues continues to increase and worldwide laws and regulations concerning the protection of data and personal information expand and become more complex, these potential risks to our business will intensify. A significant actual or potential theft, loss, fraudulent use or misuse of service provider partner, subscriber, employee or other personally identifiable data, whether by third parties or as a result of employee malfeasance or otherwise, non-compliance with our contractual or other legal obligations regarding such data or a violation of our privacy and security policies with respect to such data could result in loss of confidential information, damage to our reputation, early termination of our service provider partner contracts, litigation, regulatory investigations or actions and other liabilities or actions against us, including significant fines by U.S. federal and state authorities, foreign data privacy authorities in the EU, Canada, and other countries and private claims by companies and individuals for violation of data privacy and security regulations. To the extent that any such exposure leads to credit card fraud or identity theft, we may experience a general decline in consumer confidence in our business, which may lead to an increase in attrition rates or may make it more difficult to attract new subscribers. If any one of these risks materializes our business, financial condition, cash flows or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nIf our security measures are breached, including any breaches caused by cyber-attacks, our reputation may be damaged, we may be exposed to significant liabilities under U.S. and foreign laws, and our business and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nCyber-attacks from computer hackers and cyber criminals and other malicious Internet-based activity continue to increase generally, and perpetrators of cyber-attacks may be able to develop and deploy viruses, worms, ransomware, malware, DNS attacks, wireless network attacks, attacks on our cloud networks, phishing attempts, social engineering attempts, distributed denial of service attacks and other advanced persistent threats or malicious software programs that attack our products and services, our networks and network endpoints or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities of our products, services and networks. Techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target. As a result, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. We cannot be certain that advances in cyber-capabilities or other developments will not\ncompromise or breach the technology protecting the networks that access our platforms and solutions, and we can make no assurance that we will be able to detect, prevent, timely and adequately address or mitigate the negative effects of cyber-attacks or other security breaches. In addition, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have enabled substantially all of our employees to work remotely which may make us more vulnerable to cyber-attacks or other security breaches.\nSecurity breaches of, or sustained attacks against, our networks and infrastructure could create system disruptions and shutdowns that could result in disruptions to our operations or unauthorized access to or loss of our data. If such an event results in unauthorized access to or loss of any data subject to data privacy and security laws and regulations, then we could be subject to substantial fines by U.S. federal and state authorities, foreign data privacy authorities in the EU, Canada, and other countries, and private claims by companies or individuals. A system disruption, shutdown, or loss of data may result in adverse publicity and therefore adversely affect the market's perception of the security and reliability of our services. A cyber-attack may cause additional costs, such as investigative and remediation costs, and the costs of providing individuals and/or data owners with notice of the breach, legal fees and the costs of any additional fraud detection activities required by law, a court or a third-party. Additionally, some of our customer contracts require us to indemnify customers from damages they may incur as a result of a breach of our networks and systems. There can be no assurance that the limitation of liability provisions in our contracts for a security breach would be enforceable or would otherwise protect us from any such liabilities or damages with respect to any particular claim. While we maintain general liability insurance coverage and coverage for technology errors or omissions, we cannot assure you that such coverage will be available in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims related to a breach, will continue to be available on acceptable terms or at all. If any one of these risks materializes, our business, financial condition, cash flows or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe rely on our service provider partner network to acquire additional subscribers, and the inability of our service provider partners to attract additional subscribers or retain their current subscribers could adversely affect our operating results.\nSubstantially all of our revenue is generated through the sales of our platforms and solutions by our service provider partners, who incorporate our solutions in certain of the products and packages they sell to their customers, and our service provider partners are responsible for subscriber acquisition, as well as providing customer service and technical support for our platforms and solutions to the subscribers. We provide our service provider partners with specific training and programs to assist them in selling and providing support for our platforms and solutions, but we cannot assure you that these steps will be effective. In addition, we rely on our service provider partners to sell our platforms and solutions into new markets in the intelligent and connected property space. If our service provider partners are unsuccessful in marketing, selling and supporting our platforms and solutions, our operating results could be adversely affected.\nIn order for us to maintain our current revenue sources and grow our revenues, we must effectively manage and grow relationships with our service provider partners. Recruiting and retaining qualified service provider partners and training them in our technology and solutions requires significant time and resources and has been made more challenging by the shelter-in-place orders and travel restrictions which were, and may from time to time be, implemented in many locations to combat the COVID-19 pandemic, which orders and restrictions to varying degrees remain in place. If we fail to maintain our relationships with existing service provider partners or develop relationships with new service provider partners, our revenue and operating results would be adversely affected. In addition, to execute on our strategy to expand our sales internationally, we must develop, manage and grow relationships with service provider partners that sell into these markets.\nAny of our service provider partners may choose to offer a product from one of our competitors instead of our platforms and solutions, elect to develop their own competing solutions or simply discontinue their operations with us. For example, we entered into a license agreement in November 2013 with Vivint Inc., or Vivint, pursuant to which we granted a license to use the intellectual property associated with our connected home solutions. Under the terms of this arrangement, Vivint has transitioned from selling our solutions directly to its customers to selling its own home automation product to its new customers. We now generate revenue from a monthly fee charged to Vivint on a per customer basis from sales of this service provider partner\u2019s product; however, these monthly fees are less on a per customer basis than fees we receive from our SaaS solutions. Therefore, we receive less revenue on a per customer basis from Vivint compared to our SaaS subscriber base, which may result in a lower revenue growth rate. Similarly, we recently entered into a patent license agreement with ADT pursuant to which we granted a license to use certain Alarm.com intellectual property following the termination or expiration of the initial term of our master service agreement with ADT. Under the terms of the license, beginning in 2023, ADT will pay us a monthly royalty for each subscriber to its branded residential interactive security, automation and video service offerings that is covered by any of our licensed patents and not supported on our platforms. We must also work to expand our network of service provider partners to ensure that we have sufficient geographic coverage and technical expertise to address new markets and technologies. While it is difficult to estimate the total number of available service provider partners in our markets, there are a finite number of service provider partners that are able to perform the types of technical installations required for our platforms and solutions. In the event that we saturate the available service provider pool, or if market or other forces cause the available pool of service providers to decline, it may be increasingly difficult to grow our business. If we are unable to expand our network of service provider partners, our business could be harmed.\nAs consumers\u2019 product and service options grow, it is important that we enhance our service provider partner footprint by broadening the expertise of our service provider partners, working with larger and more sophisticated service provider partners and expanding the mainstream solutions our service provider partners offer. If we do not succeed in this effort, our current and potential future service provider partners may be unable or unwilling to broaden their offerings to include our connected property solutions, resulting in harm to our business.\nWe receive a substantial portion of our revenue from a limited number of service provider partners, and the loss of, or a significant reduction in, orders from one or more of our major service provider partners would result in decreased revenue and profitability.\nOur success is highly dependent upon establishing and maintaining successful relationships with a variety of service provider partners. We market and sell our platforms and solutions through a channel assisted sales model and we derive substantially all of our revenue from these service provider partners. We generally enter into agreements with our service provider partners outlining the terms of our relationship, including service provider pricing commitments, installation, maintenance and support requirements, and our sales registration process for registering potential sales to subscribers. These service provider contracts typically have an initial term of one year, with subsequent renewal terms of one year, and are terminable at the end of the initial term or renewal terms without cause upon written notice to the other party. In some cases, these contracts provide the service provider partner with the right to terminate prior to the expiration of the term without cause upon 30 days written notice, or, in the case of certain termination events, the right to terminate the contract immediately. While we have developed a network of over 10,000 service provider partners to sell, install and support our platforms and solutions, we receive a substantial portion of our revenue from a limited number of channel partners and significant customers. During the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, our 10 largest revenue service provider partners accounted for 48%, 52% and 57% of our revenue, respectively. ADT LLC, or ADT, represented greater than 15% but not more than 20% of our revenue in 2018, 2019 and 2020. ADT also represented more than 10% of accounts receivable as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nWe recently amended our master service agreement with ADT, or MSA, to extend the initial term through January 1, 2023 and to provide for the integration of certain third party products into the ADT Command and Control software platform which we operate. In connection with the amendment to the MSA, we agreed to provide ADT a license to use certain Alarm.com intellectual property following the termination or expiration of the initial term of the MSA for which ADT will pay us a monthly royalty for each subscriber to its ADT branded residential interactive security, automation and video service offerings that is covered by any of our licensed patents and not enabled by one of our software platforms. We cannot assure you that we will be able to meet the conditions set forth in the amended agreement. If our MSA with ADT expires or terminates, we would continue to generate revenue from each subscriber that is already installed on one of our platforms for the life of that subscriber account but the number of such subscribers would likely decline over time. While we would generate revenue from ADT subscribers not on our platform using service offerings covered by any of our licensed patents from the per subscriber royalty fee charged to ADT under the patent license, these monthly fees will be less on a per subscriber basis than fees we receive from our SaaS solutions. In addition, even if ADT continues to use other services that we offer, we cannot assure you that the revenue from ADT or new accounts added by ADT will reach or exceed historical levels in any future period. We may not be able to offset any unanticipated decline in revenue from ADT with revenues from new customers or other existing customers. Any negative developments in ADT\u2019s business, or any significant decrease in revenue from or loss of ADT as a customer could materially and adversely harm our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nWe anticipate that we will continue to be dependent upon a limited number of service provider partners for a significant portion of our revenue for the foreseeable future and, in some cases, a portion of our revenue attributable to individual service provider partners may increase in the future. The loss of one or more key service provider partners, a reduction in sales through any major service provider partners or the inability or unwillingness of any of our major service provider partners to pay for our platforms and solutions would reduce our revenue and could impair our profitability.\nSubstantially all of the revenues associated with the non-hosted software platform are from a single customer and the loss of this customer could harm our operating results.\nIn March 2017, we acquired certain assets related to the Connect business unit of Icontrol Networks, Inc., or Icontrol, and all of the outstanding equity interests of the two subsidiaries through which Icontrol conducted its Piper business, which we refer to in this report as the Acquisition. Historically, ADT has accounted for, and continues to account for, substantially all of the revenue of the Connect business unit. In connection with the Acquisition we amended our master service agreement with ADT to cover services provided with respect to the non-hosted software platform, or Software platform. We cannot assure you that ADT will use the Software platform for its new customers or keep existing customers on the Software platform. In addition, even if ADT continues to use the Software platform, we cannot assure you that the revenue from ADT or new accounts added by ADT will reach or exceed historical levels of revenue for the Connect business unit in any future period. Any negative developments in ADT\u2019s business, or any significant decrease in revenue from or loss of ADT as a customer could materially and adversely harm our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nWe have relatively limited visibility regarding the consumers that ultimately purchase our solutions, and we often rely on information from third-party service providers to help us manage our business. If these service providers fail to provide timely or accurate information, our ability to quickly react to market changes and effectively manage our business may be harmed.\nWe sell our solutions through service provider partners. These service provider partners work with consumers to design, install, update and maintain their connected home and commercial installations and manage the relationship with our subscribers. While we are able to track orders from service provider partners and have access to certain information about the configurations of their Alarm.com systems that we receive through our platforms, we also rely on service provider partners to provide us with information about consumer behavior, product and system feedback, consumer demographics and buying patterns. We use this channel sell-through data, along with other metrics, to forecast our revenue, assess consumer demand for our solution, develop new solutions, adjust pricing and make other strategic business decisions. Channel sell-through data is subject to limitations due to collection methods and the third-party nature of the data and thus may not be complete or accurate. If we do not receive consumer information on a timely or accurate basis, or if we do not properly interpret this information, our ability to quickly react to market changes and effectively manage our business may be harmed.\nConsumers may choose to adopt point products that provide control of discrete functions rather than adopting our connected property solutions. If we are unable to increase market awareness of the benefits of our unified solutions, our revenue may not continue to grow, or it may decline.\nMany vendors have emerged, and may continue to emerge, to provide point products with advanced functionality for use in connected properties, such as a video doorbell or thermostat that can be controlled by an application on a smartphone. We expect more and more consumer electronic and consumer appliance products to be network-aware and connected - each very likely to have its own smart device (phone or tablet) application. Consumers may be attracted to the relatively low costs of these point products and the ability to expand their connected property control solution over time with minimal upfront costs, despite some of the disadvantages of this approach, which may reduce demand for our connected property solutions. If so, our service provider partners may switch and offer the point products and services of competing companies, which would adversely affect our sales and profitability. If a significant number of consumers in our target market choose to adopt point products rather than our connected property solutions, then our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations will be harmed, and we may not be able to achieve sustained growth or our business may decline.\nMergers or other strategic transactions involving our competitors could weaken our competitive position, which could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively and harm our results of operations.\nOur industry is highly fragmented, and we believe it is likely that some of our existing competitors will consolidate or be acquired. In addition, some of our competitors may enter into new alliances with each other or may establish or strengthen cooperative relationships with systems integrators, third-party consulting firms or other parties. Any such consolidation, acquisition, alliance or cooperative relationship could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively and lead to pricing pressure and our loss of market share and could result in a competitor with greater financial, technical, marketing, service and other resources, all of which could harm our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nWe are dependent on our connected property solutions, and the lack of continued market acceptance of our connected property solutions would result in lower revenue.\nOur connected property solutions account for substantially all of our revenue and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future. As a result, our revenue could be reduced by:\n\u2022any decline in demand for our connected property solutions;\n\u2022the failure of our connected property solutions to achieve continued market acceptance;\n\u2022the introduction of products and technologies that serve as a replacement or substitute for, or represent an improvement over, our connected property solutions;\n\u2022technological innovations or new communications standards that our connected property solutions do not address; and\n\u2022our inability to release enhanced versions of our connected property solutions on a timely basis.\nWe are vulnerable to fluctuations in demand for Internet-connected devices in general and interactive security systems in particular. If the market for connected home and commercial solutions grows more slowly than anticipated or if demand for connected home and commercial solutions does not grow as quickly as anticipated, whether as a result of competition, product obsolescence, technological change, unfavorable economic conditions, uncertain geopolitical environments, budgetary\nconstraints of our consumers or other factors, we may not be able to continue to increase our revenue and earnings and our stock price would decline.\nA significant decline in our SaaS and license revenue renewal rate would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nWe generally bill our service provider partners based on the number of subscribers they have on our platforms and the features being utilized by subscribers on a monthly basis in advance. Subscribers could elect to terminate our services in any given month. If our efforts and our service provider partners\u2019 efforts to satisfy our existing subscribers are not successful, we may not be able to retain them or sell additional functionality to them and, as a result, our revenue and ability to grow could be adversely affected. We track our SaaS and license revenue renewal rate on an annualized basis, as reflected in the section of this Annual Report titled \"Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Other Business Metrics - SaaS and License Revenue Renewal Rate.\" However, our service provider partners, who resell our services to our subscribers, have indicated that they typically have three to five-year service contracts with our subscribers. Our SaaS and license revenue renewal rate is calculated across our entire subscriber base, including subscribers whose contract with their service provider reached the end of its contractual term during the measurement period, as well as subscribers whose contract with their service provider has not reached the end of its contractual term during the measurement period, and is not intended to estimate the rate at which our subscribers renew their contracts with our service provider partners. As a result, we may not be able to accurately predict future trends in renewals and the resulting churn. Subscribers may choose not to renew their contracts for many reasons, including the belief that our service is not required for their needs or is otherwise not cost-effective, a desire to reduce discretionary spending, or a belief that our competitors\u2019 services provide better value. Additionally, our subscribers may not renew for reasons entirely out of our control, such as moving a residence or the dissolution of their business, which is particularly common for small to mid-sized businesses. A significant increase in our churn would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows or results of operations.\nIf we are unable to develop new solutions, sell our platforms and solutions into new markets or further penetrate our existing markets, our revenue may not grow as expected.\nOur ability to increase sales will depend, in large part, on our ability to enhance and improve our platforms and solutions, introduce new solutions in a timely manner, sell into new markets and further penetrate our existing markets. The success of any enhancement or new solution or service depends on several factors, including the timely completion, introduction and market acceptance of enhanced or new solutions, the ability to maintain and develop relationships with service providers, the ability to attract, retain and effectively train sales and marketing personnel and the effectiveness of our marketing programs. Any new product or service we develop or acquire may not be introduced in a timely or cost-effective manner, and may not achieve the broad market acceptance necessary to generate significant revenue. Any new markets into which we attempt to sell our platforms and solutions, including new vertical markets and new countries or regions, may not be receptive. Our ability to further penetrate our existing markets depends on the quality, availability and reliability of our platforms and solutions and our ability to design our platforms and solutions to meet consumer demand.\nWe benefit from integration of our solutions with third-party platform providers. If these developers choose not to partner with us, or are acquired by our competitors, our business and results of operations may be harmed.\nOur solutions are incorporated into the hardware of our third-party platform providers. For example, our hardware platform partners produce control devices that deliver our platform services to subscribers. It may be necessary in the future to renegotiate agreements relating to various aspects of these solutions or other third-party solutions. The inability to easily integrate with, or any defects in or disruption in the supply or availability of, any third-party solutions could result in increased costs, or in delays in new product releases or updates to our existing solutions until such issues have been resolved, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows, results of operations and future prospects and could damage our reputation. In addition, if these third-party solution providers choose not to partner with us, choose to integrate their solutions with our competitors\u2019 platforms, or are unable or unwilling to update their solutions, our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations could be harmed. Further, if third-party solution providers that we partner with or that we would benefit from partnering with are acquired by our competitors, they may choose not to offer their solutions on our platforms, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nWe rely on wireless carriers to provide access to wireless networks through which we provide our wireless alarm, notification and intelligent automation services, and any interruption of such access would impair our business.\nWe rely on wireless carriers to provide access to wireless networks for machine-to-machine data transmissions, which are an integral part of our services. Our wireless carriers may suspend wireless service to expand, maintain or improve their networks, or may discontinue or sunset older wireless networks as new technology evolves. For example, certain cellular carriers have announced their intention to shut down their 3G and CDMA wireless networks by the end of 2022 which may require our subscribers to upgrade to alternative and potentially more expensive technologies. See \u201cThe technology we employ may become obsolete, and we may need to incur significant capital expenditures to update our technology\u201d below. Any suspension or other\ninterruption of services would adversely affect our ability to provide our services to our service provider partners and subscribers and may adversely affect our reputation. In addition, the inability to provide uninterrupted services, maintain our existing contracts with our wireless carriers or enter into new contracts with such wireless carriers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to adapt to technological change, including maintaining compatibility with a wide range of devices, our ability to remain competitive could be impaired.\nThe market for connected home and commercial solutions is characterized by rapid technological change, frequent introductions of new products and evolving industry standards. Our ability to attract new subscribers and increase revenue from existing subscribers will depend in significant part on our ability to anticipate changes in industry standards, to continue to enhance our existing solutions or introduce new solutions on a timely basis to keep pace with technological developments, and to maintain compatibility with a wide range of connected devices in residential and commercial properties. We may change aspects of our platforms and may utilize open source technology in the future, which may cause difficulties including compatibility, stability and time to market. The success of any enhanced or new product or solution will depend on several factors, including the timely completion and market acceptance of the enhanced or new product or solution. Similarly, if any of our competitors implement new technologies before we are able to implement them, those competitors may be able to provide more effective products than ours, possibly at lower prices. Any delay or failure in the introduction of new or enhanced solutions could harm our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nThe technology we employ may become obsolete, and we may need to incur significant capital expenditures to update our technology.\nOur industry is characterized by rapid technological innovation. Our platforms and solutions interact with the hardware and software technology of systems and devices located at our subscribers\u2019 properties and we depend upon cellular, broadband and other telecommunications providers to provide communication paths to our subscribers in a timely and efficient manner. We may be required to implement new technologies or adapt existing technologies in response to changing market conditions, consumer preferences or industry standards, which could require significant capital expenditures. The discontinuation of cellular communication technology, cellular networks or other services by telecommunications service providers can affect our services and require our subscribers to upgrade to alternative and potentially more expensive, technologies. For example, certain cellular carriers have announced their intention to shut down their 3G and CDMA wireless networks by the end of 2022. We intend to work with our service providers to develop a transition plan over the next three years to convert or upgrade the equipment of end user accounts reliant upon 3G or CDMA networks, and we expect to incur incremental costs over the next two years related to the planned 3G and CDMA network shutdown. If our service providers are not able to convert or upgrade the equipment of their customers who are currently using 3G or CDMA network technology, then those accounts may be terminated with us when such networks are no longer available.\nIt is also possible that one or more of our competitors could develop a significant technical advantage that allows them to provide additional or superior quality products or services, or to lower their price for similar products or services, which could put us at a competitive disadvantage. Our inability to adapt to changing technologies, market conditions or consumer preferences in a timely manner could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows or results of operations.\nWe depend on our suppliers, and the loss of any key supplier could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nOur hardware products depend on the availability and quality of components that we procure from third-party suppliers. Reliance on suppliers, as well as industry supply conditions, generally involves several risks, including the possibility of defective parts, which can adversely affect the reliability and reputation of our platforms and solutions, and a shortage of components and reduced control over delivery schedules and increases in component costs, which can adversely affect our profitability. These supply chain risks are heightened in the current environment where continuing travel restrictions and shelter-in-place orders as well as limitations on factory capacity and delays in shipping times due to the COVID-19 pandemic have and may continue to adversely affect production of and the timing of delivery of components. Shortages of essential components of our products or significantly increased lead times for obtaining such components may lead to delays in our production, and we may be unable to fulfill orders for our hardware products on a timely basis or at all. Even if we are able to procure components from alternative sources, we may be required to pay more for them, which could adversely affect our profitability. We are working with our suppliers to secure components and materials to account for longer lead times and limited availability, but we cannot assure you that our efforts will be successful or that demand for our hardware products will continue at the same level. In addition, global transportation disruptions have led to slower shipping times generally, while reductions in passenger air travel have also led to reduced capacity and increased costs for air freight shipments, which may continue to adversely affect the timing and cost of delivery of components, materials and products. Any of these disruptions to our inventory and supply chain could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. We have several large hardware suppliers from which we procure hardware on a purchase order basis, including one supplier that supplied products and components which generated 16% of our hardware and other revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020. From time to\ntime we provide advance payments or loans to our vendors to, for example, secure procurement of long lead time parts or to provide bridge financing to ensure continuity of operations. If these suppliers are unable to continue to provide a timely and reliable supply, we could experience interruptions in delivery of our platforms and solutions to our service provider partners, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. If we were required to find alternative sources of supply, qualification of alternative suppliers and the establishment of reliable supplies could result in delays and a possible loss of sales, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nGrowth of our business will depend on market awareness and a strong brand, and any failure to develop, maintain, protect and enhance our brand would hurt our ability to retain or attract subscribers.\nWe believe that building and maintaining market awareness, brand recognition and goodwill in a cost-effective manner is important to our overall success in achieving widespread acceptance of our existing and future solutions and is an important element in attracting new service provider partners and subscribers. An important part of our business strategy is to increase service provider and consumer awareness of our brand and to provide marketing leadership, services and support to our service provider partner network. This will depend largely on our ability to continue to provide high-quality solutions, and we may not be able to do so effectively. While we may choose to engage in a broader marketing campaign to further promote our brand, this effort may not be successful. Our efforts in developing our brand may be hindered by the marketing efforts of our competitors and our reliance on our service provider partners and strategic partners to promote our brand. If we are unable to cost-effectively maintain and increase awareness of our brand, our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations could be harmed.\nWe operate in the emerging and evolving connected property market, which may develop more slowly or differently than we expect. If the connected property market does not grow as we expect, or if we cannot expand our platforms and solutions to meet the demands of this market, our revenue may decline, fail to grow or fail to grow at an accelerated rate, and we may incur operating losses.\nThe market for solutions that bring objects and systems not typically connected to the Internet, such as home automation, security monitoring, video monitoring, energy management and wellness solutions, into an Internet-like structure is still developing, and it is uncertain how rapidly or how consistently this market will continue to develop and the degree to which our platforms and solutions will be accepted into the markets in which we operate. Some consumers may be reluctant or unwilling to use our platforms and solutions for a number of reasons, including satisfaction with traditional solutions, concerns about additional costs, concerns about data privacy and lack of awareness of the benefits of our platforms and solutions. Our ability to expand the sales of our platforms and solutions into new markets depends on several factors, including the awareness of our platforms and solutions, the timely completion, introduction and market acceptance of our platforms and solutions, the ability to attract, retain and effectively train sales and marketing personnel, the ability to develop relationships with service providers, the effectiveness of our marketing programs, the costs of our platforms and solutions and the success of our competitors. If we are unsuccessful in developing and marketing our platforms and solutions into new markets, or if consumers do not perceive or value the benefits of our platforms and solutions, the market for our platforms and solutions might not continue to develop or might develop more slowly than we expect, either of which would harm our revenue and growth prospects.\nRisks of liability from our operations are significant.\nThe nature of the solutions we provide, including our interactive security solutions, and new technologies we may acquire, such as in our recent acquisition of Shooter Detection Systems, LLC, potentially exposes us to greater risks of liability for data privacy and security, employee acts or omissions, or technology or system failure than may be inherent in other businesses. Substantially all of our service provider partner agreements contain provisions limiting our liability to service provider partners and our subscribers in an attempt to reduce this risk. However, in the event of litigation with respect to these matters, we cannot assure you that these limitations will be enforced, and the costs of such litigation could have a material adverse effect on us. Moreover, in the event of any regulatory investigations or actions against us related to these matters, we could be subject to additional risks and liabilities, including significant fines by U.S. federal and state authorities, foreign data privacy authorities in the EU, Canada, and other countries, in addition to the costs of such investigations, all of which could have a material adverse effect on us. In addition, there can be no assurance that we are adequately insured for these risks. Certain of our insurance policies and the laws of some states may limit or prohibit insurance coverage for punitive or certain other types of damages or liability arising from gross negligence.\nOur strategy includes pursuing acquisitions, and our potential inability to successfully integrate newly-acquired technologies, assets or businesses may harm our financial results. Future acquisitions of technologies, assets or businesses which are paid for partially or entirely through the issuance of stock or stock rights could dilute the ownership of our existing stockholders.\nWe believe part of our growth will continue to be driven by acquisitions of other companies or their technologies, assets and businesses. For example, on October 21, 2019, we acquired 85% of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of PC Open Incorporated, doing business as OpenEye, and on December 14, 2020, we acquired Shooter Detection Systems, LLC. We\nhave acquired other businesses in the past. For example, we acquired the assets of HiValley Technology Inc. in March 2015, assets of ObjectVideo, Inc. in January 2017 and Icontrol's Connect and Piper business units in March 2017. These acquisitions and any other acquisitions we may complete in the future will give rise to certain risks, including:\n\u2022incurring higher than anticipated capital expenditures and operating expenses;\n\u2022failing to assimilate and integrate the operations and personnel or failing to retain the key personnel of the acquired company or business;\n\u2022failing to retain customers and service providers and other third-party business partners seeking to terminate or renegotiate their relationships with us;\n\u2022failing to integrate the acquired technologies, or incurring significant expense to integrate acquired technologies into our platforms and solutions;\n\u2022disrupting our ongoing business;\n\u2022encountering complexities associated with managing a larger, more complex and growing business;\n\u2022diverting our management\u2019s attention and other company resources;\n\u2022failing to maintain uniform standards, controls and policies;\n\u2022incurring significant accounting charges;\n\u2022impairing relationships with employees, service provider partners or subscribers;\n\u2022finding that the acquired technology, asset or business does not further our business strategy, that we overpaid for the technology, asset or business or that we may be required to write off acquired assets or investments partially or entirely;\n\u2022failing to realize the expected synergies of the transaction;\n\u2022being exposed to unforeseen liabilities and contingencies that were not identified prior to acquiring the company; and\n\u2022being unable to generate sufficient revenue and profits from acquisitions to offset the associated acquisition costs.\nFully integrating an acquired technology, asset or business into our operations may take a significant amount of time. We may not be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered with acquisitions. To the extent we do not successfully avoid or overcome the risks or problems related to any such acquisitions, or fail to manage the acquired business or execute our integration and growth strategy in an efficient and effective manner, our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations could be harmed. Acquisitions also could impact our financial position and capital requirements, or could cause fluctuations in our quarterly and annual results of operations. Acquisitions could include significant goodwill and intangible assets, which may result in future impairment charges that would reduce our stated earnings. We may incur significant costs in our efforts to engage in strategic transactions and these expenditures may not result in successful acquisitions.\nWe expect that the consideration we might pay for any future acquisitions of technologies, assets or businesses could include stock, rights to purchase stock, cash or some combination of the foregoing. If we issue stock or rights to purchase stock in connection with future acquisitions, net income per share and then-existing holders of our common stock may experience dilution.\nWe may pursue business opportunities that diverge from our current business model, which may cause our business to suffer.\nWe may pursue business opportunities that diverge from our current business model, including but not limited to expanding our platforms and solutions and investing in new and unproven technologies. We can offer no assurance that any such new business opportunities will prove to be successful. Among other negative effects, our pursuit of such business opportunities could reduce operating margins and require more working capital, subject us to additional federal state, and local laws and regulations, materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows or results of operations.\nEvolving government and industry regulation and changes in applicable laws relating to the Internet and data privacy may increase our expenditures related to compliance efforts or otherwise limit the solutions we can offer, which may harm our business and adversely affect our financial condition.\nAs Internet commerce continues to evolve, federal, state or foreign agencies have adopted and could in the future adopt regulations covering issues such as user privacy and content. We are particularly sensitive to these risks because the Internet is a critical component of our SaaS business model. In addition, taxation of products or services provided over the Internet or other charges imposed by government agencies or by private organizations for accessing the Internet may be imposed. Any regulation imposing greater fees for Internet use or restricting information exchange over the Internet could result in a decline in the use of the Internet and the viability of Internet-based services, which could harm our business.\nOur platforms and solutions enable us to collect, manage and store a wide range of data related to our subscribers\u2019 interactive security, intelligent automation, video monitoring, energy management and wellness systems. A valuable component of our platforms and solutions is our ability to analyze this data to present the user with actionable business intelligence. We obtain our data from a variety of sources, including our service provider partners, our subscribers and third-party providers. We cannot assure you that the data we require for our proprietary data sets will be available from these sources in the future or that the cost of such data will not increase. The United States federal government and various state governments have adopted or proposed limitations on the collection, distribution, storage and use of personal information. Several foreign jurisdictions, including the European Union and the United Kingdom, have adopted legislation (including directives or regulations) that is more rigorous governing data collection and storage than in the United States.\nOn June 28, 2018, the State of California enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, or CCPA, which took effect on January 1, 2020. The CCPA governs the collection, sale and use of California residents\u2019 personal information, and significantly impacts businesses\u2019 handling of personal information and privacy policies and procedures. The CCPA, as well as data privacy laws that have been proposed in other states, may limit our ability to use, process and store certain data, which may decrease adoption of our platforms and solutions, affect our relationships with service provider partners and our suppliers, increase our costs for compliance, and harm our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. Specifically, the CCPA may subject us to regulatory fines by the State of California, individual claims, class actions, and increased commercial liabilities. In addition, the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020, or CPRA, was approved by California voters and will be effective as of January 1, 2023. The CPRA will, among other things, amend the CCPA by creating additional privacy rights for California consumers and additional obligations on businesses, which could subject us to additional compliance costs as well as potential fines, individual claims, class actions and commercial liabilities.\nEuropean data protection laws, including the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, generally restrict the transfer of personal data from Europe, including the European Economic Area, or EEA, UK and Switzerland, to the United States and most other countries unless the parties to the transfer have implemented specific safeguards to protect the transferred personal data. On July 16, 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union, or CJEU, invalidated the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield framework, a program for transferring personal data from the EEA to the United States. The ruling also raised questions about whether one of the primary alternatives to the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield, namely the European Commission\u2019s Standard Contractual Clauses, or SCCs, can lawfully be used for transfers from the EEA to the United States or most other countries. While the CJEU did not invalidate the use of SCCs as a valid mechanism for transferring personal data from the EEA to the United States, the CJEU required entities relying on SCCs to, among other things, verify on a case-by-case basis that the SCCs provide adequate protection of personal data under European Union, or EU, law by providing, where necessary, additional safeguards to those offered by the existing SCCs. For data transfers to the United States, these additional safeguards may need to be added to existing SCCs in order for entities to continue using SCCs as a valid data transfer mechanism. Furthermore, the CJEU advised European data protection authorities that they would need to closely examine the privacy practices of countries outside of the EEA where EEA personal data is transferred; therefore, it is possible that data transfers to the United States from the EEA will be subject to more regulatory scrutiny following the CJEU decision. We have historically relied on both the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield and SCCs for transferring personal data from the EEA, and as a result of the CJEU ruling, we are transitioning any data transfers covered under the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield to be covered under SCCs. In November 2020, the European Commission released a draft version of revised SCCs. After receiving public comments, the European Commission is currently working to adopt a final version of the revised SCCs. Once final, we will have one year to implement the revised SCCs with all of our customers from the EEA. Moreover, we will need to determine whether UK regulators will also require us to adopt the revised SCCs with our customers in the UK. Our transition from relying on the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield to relying on the SCCs for certain data transfers, future requirements to implement new versions of the SCCs or potential requirements to implement another valid data transfer mechanism may slow down our contracting process and increase our legal and compliance costs (including an increase in exposure to substantial fines under EEA data protection laws as well as injunctions against processing or transferring personal data from the EEA), which could adversely affect our cash flows and financial condition. SCCs with additional safeguards and obligations put in place by EEA data protection authorities or customers may impose new restrictions on our business and could affect our operations in the EEA. In September 2020, the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner, or FDPIC, determined that the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework does not provide an adequate level of data protection for data transfers from Switzerland to the U.S. While the FDPIC does not have the authority to invalidate the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield, the FDPIC\u2019s announcement casts serious doubt on the viability of the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield as a valid mechanism for Swiss-U.S. data transfers. As a result of the FDPIC decision, we will likely need to transition any data transfers covered under the\nSwiss-U.S. Privacy Shield to be covered under SCCs. Authorities in the UK whose data protection laws are similar to those of the EEA, may similarly invalidate reliance on the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as a mechanism for data transfers from the UK to the United States. As a result of these ongoing changes, there will continue to be significant regulatory uncertainty surrounding the validity of data transfers from the EEA, UK and Switzerland to the United States. The inability to import personal data from the EEA, UK or Switzerland may require us to increase our data processing capabilities in those jurisdictions at significant expense. Various other non-EU jurisdictions may also choose to impose data localization laws limiting the transfer of personal data out of their respective jurisdictions, or our EEA, UK or Swiss service provider partners may require similar contractual restrictions regarding data localization. Such laws or contractual restrictions may increase our costs for compliance, and harm our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nThe EU's General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, went into effect on May 25, 2018. Prior to May 25, 2018, we updated our existing privacy and data security measures to comply with GDPR. As guidance on compliance with GDPR from the EU data protection authorities evolves over time, our privacy or data security measures may be deemed or perceived to be in noncompliance with current or future laws and regulations, which may subject us to litigation, regulatory investigations or other liabilities and could limit the products and services we can offer in certain jurisdictions. Further, in the event of a breach of personal information that we hold, we may be subject to governmental fines, individual claims, remediation expenses and/or harm to our reputation. Moreover, if future laws, regulations, or court rulings, such as the CJEU\u2019s decision invalidating the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield, limit our ability to use and share this data or our ability to store, process and share data over the Internet, demand for our platforms and solutions could decrease, our costs could increase, and our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations could be harmed.\nFurthermore, Brazil\u2019s comprehensive privacy law, the General Data Protection Law, or LGPD, took effect on September 18, 2020 with federal regulatory enforcement set to begin on August 1, 2021. However, private and state-level enforcement of the law began in September 2020. The LGPD creates a new legal framework for the use, processing and storage of Brazilians\u2019 personal data, and it adds significant privacy and security obligations for companies processing personal data in Brazil. The LGPD may limit our and our service providers\u2019 ability to use, process and store certain data, which may decrease adoption of our platforms and solutions, affect our relationships with our service provider partners and suppliers, increase our costs for compliance, and harm our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. In addition, the LGPD may subject us to regulatory fines by the Brazilian Data Protection Authority and increased commercial liabilities.\nSince April 2018 we have offered a solution for certain service provider partners who may be subject to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, and its implementing regulations, or HIPAA, which regulates the use and disclosure of Protected Health Information, or PHI. As a result, we are subject to HIPAA when PHI is accessed, created, maintained or transmitted through our solution by these service provider partners. We have implemented additional privacy and security policies and procedures, as well as administrative, physical and technical safeguards to enable our solution to be HIPAA-compliant. Additionally, HIPAA compliance has required us to put in place certain agreements with contracting partners and to appoint a Privacy Officer and Security Officer. If our privacy and security policies or other safeguards for PHI are deemed to be in noncompliance by the United States Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, we may be subject to litigation, regulatory investigations or other liabilities. In the event of a breach of PHI that we hold, we may be subject to governmental fines, individual claims under state privacy laws governing personal health information, remediation expenses and/or harm to our reputation. Furthermore, if future changes to HIPAA or state privacy laws governing PHI expand the definition of PHI or put more restrictions on our ability to use, process and store PHI, then HIPAA compliance for our solutions as currently constituted may be costly both financially and in terms of administrative resources. Ongoing compliance efforts may take substantial time and require the assistance of external resources, such as attorneys, information technology, and/or other consultants and advisors.\nWe rely on the performance of our senior management and highly skilled personnel, and if we are unable to attract, retain and motivate well-qualified employees, our business and results of operations could be harmed.\nWe believe our success has depended, and continues to depend, on the efforts and talents of senior management and key personnel, including Stephen Trundle, our Chief Executive Officer, and our senior information technology managers. Our future success depends on our continuing ability to attract, develop, motivate and retain highly qualified and skilled employees. Qualified individuals are in high demand, and we may incur significant costs to attract them. In addition, the loss of any of our senior management or key personnel, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, could interrupt our ability to execute our business plan, as such individuals may be difficult to replace. If we do not succeed in attracting well-qualified employees or retaining and motivating existing employees, our business and results of operations could be harmed.\nWe provide minimum service level commitments to certain of our service provider partners, and our failure to meet them could cause us to issue credits for future services or pay penalties, which could harm our results of operations.\nCertain of our service provider partner agreements currently, and may in the future, provide minimum service level commitments regarding items such as uptime, functionality or performance. If we are unable to meet the stated service level commitments for these service provider partners or suffer extended periods of service unavailability, we are or may be contractually obligated to provide these service provider partners with credits for future services, provide services at no cost or\npay other penalties, which could adversely impact our revenue. We have incurred such penalties in the past, which have reduced our revenue. We do not currently have any reserves on our balance sheet for these commitments.\nWe have indemnity obligations to certain of our service provider partners for certain expenses and liabilities, which could force us to incur substantial costs.\nWe have indemnity obligations to certain of our service provider partners for certain claims regarding our platforms and solutions, including security breach, product recall, epidemic failure, and product liability claims. As a result, in the case of any such claims against these service provider partners, we could be required to indemnify them for losses resulting from such claims or to refund amounts they have paid to us. We expect that some of our service provider partners may seek indemnification from us in the event that such claims are brought against them. In addition, we may elect to indemnify service provider partners where we have no contractual obligation to do so and we will evaluate each such request on a case-by-case basis. If a service provider partner elects to invest resources in enforcing a claim for indemnification against us, we could incur significant costs disputing it. If we do not succeed in disputing it, we could face substantial liability. See \"We have indemnity obligations to certain of our service provider partners for certain expenses and liabilities resulting from intellectual property infringement claims regarding our platforms and solutions, which could force us to incur substantial costs\" below for details on indemnity obligations resulting from intellectual property.\nWe may be subject to significant additional liabilities as a result of the Acquisition for which we will not be indemnified.\nIn connection with the Acquisition, we assumed certain historic liabilities of the Connect and Piper business units, including pre-closing liabilities relating to current and former employees of the Connect and Piper business units, pre-closing compliance by the Connect and Piper business units with applicable laws and pre-closing performance by the Connect and Piper business units of the assumed contracts. In addition, we assumed any liabilities that may arise from certain pending intellectual property litigation. In addition to the known liabilities we assumed, there could be unasserted claims or assessments that we failed or were unable to discover or identify in the course of performing due diligence investigations and there may be liabilities that are neither probable nor estimable at this time which may become probable and estimable in the future. Further, while the terms of the Acquisition transaction documents provide for us to be indemnified for breaches of certain representations and warranties made about the Connect and Piper business units, the liabilities that arise may not entitle us to contractual indemnification or our contractual indemnification may not be effective. Any such liabilities, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our business and our prospects.\nThe incurrence of debt may impact our financial position and subject us to additional financial and operating restrictions.\nOn October 6, 2017, we entered into a $125.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility, or the 2017 Facility, with Silicon Valley Bank, or SVB, as administrative agent, PNC Bank, National Association, as documentation agent, and a syndicate of lenders. Upon entry into the 2017 Facility, we borrowed $72.0 million, which was used to repay the previously outstanding balance under our previous credit facility. On November 30, 2018, we amended the 2017 Facility to incorporate the parameters that must be met for us to repurchase our outstanding common stock under the stock repurchase program authorized by our board of directors on November 29, 2018. On March 25, 2020, we borrowed $50.0 million under the 2017 Facility as a precautionary measure in order to provide financial flexibility in light of current uncertainty in the financial markets resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. The outstanding balance of the 2017 Facility was $110.0 million as of December 31, 2020. On January 20, 2021, we issued $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 0% convertible senior notes due January 15, 2026 in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers, or the 2026 Notes. We received proceeds from the issuance of the 2026 Notes of $484.3 million, net of $15.7 million of transaction fees and other debt issuance costs. We used some of the proceeds to repay the $110.0 million outstanding principal balance under our 2017 Facility and also used some of the proceeds to pay accrued interest, fees and expenses related to the 2017 Facility. We terminated the 2017 Facility effective January 20, 2021. We intend to invest a portion of the proceeds in a portfolio of securities and other investments and although we plan to follow an established investment policy and seek to minimize the credit risk associated with investments by limiting exposure to any one issuer depending on credit quality, we cannot give assurances that the assets in our investment portfolio will not lose value, become impaired or suffer from illiquidity.\nOur overall leverage and certain obligations contained in the related documentation could adversely affect our financial health and business and future operations by, among other things:\n\u2022making it more difficult to satisfy our obligations, including under the terms of the 2026 Notes;\n\u2022limiting our ability to refinance our debt on terms acceptable to us or at all;\n\u2022limiting our flexibility to plan for and adjust to changing business and market conditions and increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022limiting our ability to use our available cash flow to fund future acquisitions, working capital, business activities, and other general corporate requirements; and\n\u2022limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, to fund growth or for general corporate purposes, even when necessary to maintain adequate liquidity.\nAny of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows or results of operations.\nWe may not be able to secure additional financing on favorable terms, or at all, to meet our future capital needs.\nIn the future, we may require additional capital to respond to business opportunities, challenges, acquisitions or unforeseen circumstances and may determine to engage in equity or debt financings or enter into credit facilities for other reasons. For example, on January 20, 2021, we issued the 2026 Notes. We received proceeds from the issuance of the 2026 Notes of $484.3 million, net of $15.7 million of transaction fees and other debt issuance costs. We may require additional capital to respond to the significant uncertainty arising from the COVID-19 pandemic and we may not be able to timely secure additional debt or equity financing on favorable terms or at all. Any debt financing obtained by us in the future could involve restrictive covenants relating to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions. If we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity, convertible debt securities or other securities convertible into equity, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution in their percentage ownership of our company, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us, when we require it, our ability to continue to grow or support our business and to respond to business challenges could be limited. See \u201cRisks Related to our Outstanding Convertible Senior Notes\u201d below for further details on risks related to the 2026 Notes.\nGoodwill and other identifiable intangible assets represent a significant portion of our total assets, and we may never realize the full value of our intangible assets.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had $216.1 million of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets. Goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets are recorded at fair value on the date of acquisition. We review such assets for impairment at least annually. Impairment may result from, among other things, deterioration in performance, adverse market conditions, including adverse market conditions arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, adverse changes in applicable laws or regulations, including changes that restrict the activities of or affect the solutions we offer, challenges to the validity of certain registered intellectual property, reduced sales of certain products or services incorporating registered intellectual property, increased attrition and a variety of other factors. The amount of any quantified impairment must be expensed immediately as a charge to results of operations. Depending on future circumstances, it is possible that we may never realize the full value of our intangible assets. Any future determination of impairment of goodwill or other identifiable intangible assets could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nComprehensive tax reform bills could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nThe U.S. government enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or the Tax Act, into law on December 22, 2017. The 2017 Tax Act included significant changes to the taxation of business entities. These changes included, among others, (i) a permanent reduction to the corporate income tax rate, (ii) a partial limitation on the deductibility of business interest expense, (iii) a shift of the U.S. taxation of multinational corporations from a tax on worldwide income to a territorial system (along with certain rules designed to prevent erosion of the U.S. income tax base) and (iv) a base erosion and anti-abuse tax on base erosion payments if the federal group has sufficient gross receipts. Future changes in tax laws, including as a result of changes proposed by the new Presidential administration, or tax rulings could also materially affect our effective tax rate. In particular, the reduction in the corporate income tax rate resulting from the 2017 Tax Act could be reduced or rescinded by future tax law changes. The overall impact of any potential tax reform is uncertain, and our business and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nWe may be subject to additional tax liabilities, which would harm our results of operations.\nWe are subject to income, sales, use, value added and other taxes in the United States and other countries in which we conduct business, which laws and rates vary greatly by jurisdiction. Certain jurisdictions in which we do not collect sales, use, value added or other taxes on our sales may assert that such taxes are applicable, which could result in tax assessments, penalties and interest, and we may be required to collect such taxes in the future. Additionally, longstanding international tax norms that determine each country\u2019s jurisdiction to tax cross-border international trade are subject to potential evolution. An outgrowth of the original Base Erosion and Profit Shifting project is a project undertaken by the more than 130 member countries of the expanded Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development Inclusive Framework focused on \"Addressing the Challenges of the Digitalization of the Economy.\" The breadth of this project is likely to impact all multinational businesses by potentially redefining jurisdictional taxation rights. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. These determinations are highly complex and require detailed analysis of the available information and applicable statutes and regulatory materials. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be different from our historical tax practices, provisions and accruals. If we receive an adverse ruling as a result of an audit, or we unilaterally determine that we have misinterpreted provisions of the tax regulations to which we are subject, our tax provision, results of operations or cash flows could be harmed. In addition, liabilities associated with taxes are often subject to an extended or indefinite statute of limitations period. Therefore, we may be subject to additional tax liability (including penalties and interest) for a particular year for extended periods of time.\nIf the U.S. insurance industry were to change its practice of providing incentives to homeowners for the use of alarm monitoring services, we could experience a reduction in new subscriber growth or an increase in our subscriber attrition rate.\nIt has been common practice in the U.S. insurance industry to provide a reduction in rates for policies written on residences that have monitored alarm systems. There can be no assurance that insurance companies will continue to offer these rate reductions. If these incentives were reduced or eliminated, new homeowners who otherwise may not feel the need for alarm monitoring services would be removed from our potential subscriber pool, which could hinder the growth of our business, and existing subscribers may choose to disconnect or not renew their service contracts, which could increase our attrition rates. In either case, our results of operations and growth prospects could be adversely affected.\nFailure to comply with laws and regulations could harm our business.\nWe conduct our business in the United States and in various other countries. We are subject to regulation by various federal, state, local and foreign governmental agencies, including, but not limited to, agencies and regulatory bodies or authorities responsible for monitoring and enforcing product safety and consumer protection laws, data privacy and security laws and regulations, employment and labor laws, workplace safety laws and regulations, environmental laws and regulations, antitrust laws, federal securities laws and tax laws and regulations.\nWe are subject to the U.S. domestic bribery statute contained in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 201, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, the U.S. Travel Act, and possibly other anti-bribery laws, including those that comply with the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, or OECD, Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions and other international conventions. Anti-corruption laws are interpreted broadly and prohibit our company from authorizing, offering, or providing directly or indirectly improper payments or benefits to recipients in the public or private-sector. Certain laws also prohibit us from soliciting or accepting bribes or kickbacks. Our company has direct government interactions and in several cases uses third-party representatives, including dealers, for regulatory compliance, sales and other purposes in a variety of countries. These factors increase our anti-corruption risk profile. We can be held liable for the corrupt activities of our employees, representatives, contractors, partners and agents, even if we did not explicitly authorize such activity. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with anti-corruption laws, there can be no assurance that all of our employees, representatives, contractors, partners, and agents will comply with these laws and policies.\nOur global operations require us to import from and export to several countries, which geographically stretches our compliance obligations. We are also subject to anti-money laundering laws such as the USA PATRIOT Act and may be subject to similar laws in other jurisdictions. Our platforms and solutions are subject to export control and import laws and regulations, including the U.S. Export Administration Regulations, U.S. Customs regulations, and various economic and trade sanctions regulations administered by the U.S. Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Controls. Exports of our platforms and solutions must be made in compliance with these laws and regulations. We may also be subject to import/export laws and regulations in other jurisdictions in which we conduct business. If we fail to comply with these laws and regulations, we and certain of our employees could be subject to substantial civil or criminal penalties, including the possible loss of export or import privileges; fines, which may be imposed on us and responsible employees or managers; and, in extreme cases, the incarceration of responsible employees or managers. In addition, if our service provider partners fail to obtain appropriate import, export or re-export licenses or authorizations, we may also be adversely affected through reputational harm and penalties. Obtaining the\nnecessary authorizations, including any required license, for a particular sale may be time-consuming, is not guaranteed and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities. In addition, changes in our platforms or solutions or changes in applicable export or import laws and regulations may create delays in the introduction and sale of our platforms and solutions in international markets, prevent our service provider partners with international operations from deploying our platforms and solutions or, in some cases, prevent the export or import of our platforms and solutions to certain countries, governments or persons altogether. Any change in export or import laws and regulations, shift in the enforcement or scope of existing laws and regulations, or change in the countries, governments, persons or technologies targeted by such laws and regulations, could also result in decreased use of our platforms and solutions, or in our decreased ability to export or sell our platforms and solutions to existing or potential service provider partners with international operations. Any decreased use of our platforms and solutions or limitation on our ability to export or sell our platforms and solutions would likely adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nIn addition, our software contains encryption technologies, certain types of which are subject to U.S. and foreign export control regulations and, in some foreign countries, restrictions on importation and/or use. Any failure on our part to comply with encryption or other applicable export control requirements could result in financial penalties or other sanctions under the U.S. export regulations, including restrictions on future export activities, which could harm our business and operating results. Regulatory restrictions could impair our access to technologies needed to improve our platforms and solutions and may also limit or reduce the demand for our platforms and solutions outside of the United States.\nFurthermore, U.S. export control laws and economic sanctions programs prohibit the shipment of certain products and services to countries, governments and persons that are subject to U.S. economic embargoes and trade sanctions. Even though we take precautions to prevent our platforms and solutions from being shipped or provided to U.S. sanctions targets, our platforms and solutions could be shipped to those targets or provided by third-parties despite such precautions. Any such shipment could have negative consequences, including government investigations, penalties and reputational harm. Furthermore, any new embargo or sanctions program, or any change in the countries, governments, persons or activities targeted by such programs, could result in decreased use of our platforms and solutions, or in our decreased ability to export or sell our platforms and solutions to existing or potential service provider partners, which would likely adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nChanges in laws that apply to us could result in increased regulatory requirements and compliance costs which could harm our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. In certain jurisdictions, regulatory requirements may be more stringent than in the United States. Noncompliance with applicable regulations or requirements could subject us to whistleblower complaints, investigations, sanctions, settlements, mandatory product recalls, enforcement actions, disgorgement of profits, fines, damages, civil and criminal penalties or injunctions, suspension or debarment from contracting with certain governments or other customers, the loss of export privileges, multi-jurisdictional liability, reputational harm, and other collateral consequences. If any governmental or other sanctions are imposed, or if we do not prevail in any possible civil or criminal litigation, our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations could be materially harmed. In addition, responding to any action will likely result in a materially significant diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources and an increase in defense costs and other professional fees. Enforcement actions and sanctions could further harm our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nWe face many risks associated with our international business operations and our plans to expand internationally, which could harm our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nWe anticipate that our efforts to operate and continue to expand our business internationally will entail additional costs and risks as we establish our international offerings and develop relationships with service provider partners to market, sell, install, and support our platforms, solutions and brand in other countries. Revenue in countries outside of North America accounted for 3%, 3% and 2% of our total revenue for each of the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. We have limited experience in selling our platforms and solutions in international markets outside of North America or in conforming to the local cultures, standards, or policies necessary to successfully compete in those markets, and we may be required to invest significant resources in order to do so. We may not succeed in these efforts or achieve our consumer acquisition, service provider expansion or other goals. In some international markets, consumer preferences and buying behaviors may be different, and we may use business or pricing models that are different from our traditional model to provide our platforms and solutions to consumers in those markets or we may be unsuccessful in implementing the appropriate business model. Our revenue from new foreign markets may not exceed the costs of establishing, marketing, and maintaining our international offerings. In addition, current global instability could have many adverse consequences on our international expansion. These could include sovereign default, liquidity and capital pressures on financial institutions in other parts of the world including the eurozone, reducing the availability of credit and increasing the risk of financial sector failures and the risk of one or more eurozone member states leaving the euro, resulting in the possibility of capital and exchange controls and uncertainty about the impact of contracts and currency exchange rates.\nIn addition, conducting expanded international operations subjects us to additional risks that we do not generally face in our North American markets. These risks include:\n\u2022localization of our solutions, including the addition of foreign languages and adaptation to new local practices, as well as certification, registration and other regulatory requirements;\n\u2022lack of experience in other geographic markets;\n\u2022strong local competitors;\n\u2022the cost and burden of complying with, lack of familiarity with, and unexpected changes in, foreign legal and regulatory requirements, including the development of policies and procedures for different countries when requirements under privacy regulations in such countries may conflict or be inconsistent with one another;\n\u2022difficulties in managing and staffing international operations;\n\u2022increased costs due to new or potential tariffs, penalties, trade restrictions and other trade barriers;\n\u2022fluctuations in currency exchange rates or restrictions on foreign currency;\n\u2022potentially adverse tax consequences, including the complexities of transfer pricing, value added or other tax systems, double taxation and restrictions and/or taxes on the repatriation of earnings;\n\u2022dependence on third parties, including commercial partners with whom we do not have extensive experience;\n\u2022increased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities;\n\u2022political, social, and economic instability, terrorist attacks, and security concerns in general; and\n\u2022reduced or varied protection for intellectual property rights in some countries.\nOperating in international markets also requires significant management attention and financial resources. The investment and additional resources required to establish operations and manage growth in other countries may not produce desired levels of revenue or profitability.\nOur software contains encryption technologies, certain types of which are subject to U.S. and foreign export control regulations and, in some foreign countries, restrictions on importation and/or use. Any failure on our part to comply with encryption or other applicable export control requirements could result in financial penalties or other sanctions under the U.S. export regulations, including restrictions on future export activities, which could harm our business and operating results. Regulatory restrictions could impair our access to technologies needed to improve our platforms and solutions and may also limit or reduce the demand for our platforms and solutions outside of the United States.\nEnhanced United States tax, tariff, import/export restrictions, or other trade barriers may have an adverse impact on global economic conditions, financial markets and our business.\nThere is currently significant uncertainty about the future relationship between the United States and various other countries, including China, the European Union, Canada, and Mexico, with respect to trade policies, treaties, tariffs and customs duties, and taxes. In 2019, the U.S. administration imposed significant changes to U.S. trade policy with respect to China. Tariffs have subjected certain Alarm.com products manufactured overseas to additional import duties of up to 25%. The amount of the import tariff and the number of products subject to tariffs have changed numerous times based on action by the U.S. administration. We are addressing the risks related to these imposed and announced tariffs, which have affected, or have the potential to affect, at least some of our imports from China.\nBetween one-fifth to one-half of the finished goods hardware products that we sell to our customers are imported from China and could be subject to increased tariffs. Other Alarm.com finished goods hardware products that are not manufactured in China may contain subcomponents made in China that could also be subject to increased tariffs. While the additional import duties resulted in an increase to our cost of hardware revenue, these import duties had a modest impact on hardware revenue margins. If tariffs, trade restrictions, or trade barriers are expanded or interpreted by a court or governmental agency to apply to more of our products, then our exposure to future taxes and duties on such imported products and components could be significant and could have a material effect on our financial results. If our products are deemed to be subject to additional duties and taxes as determined by a court or governmental agency, we may suffer additional hardware revenue margin erosion or be required to raise our prices on certain imported products. There can be no assurance that we will not experience a disruption in our business or harm to our financial condition related to these or other changes in trade practices, and any changes to our operations or our sourcing strategy in order to mitigate any such tariff costs could be complicated, time-consuming, and costly. Furthermore, our business may be adversely affected by retaliatory trade measures taken by China and other countries, which could materially\nharm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Trade barriers, or the perception that any of them could be imposed, may have a negative effect on global economic conditions and the stability of global financial markets, and may significantly reduce global trade and, in particular, trade between these nations and the United States. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe LIBOR calculation method may change and LIBOR is expected to be phased out after 2021.\nOn July 27, 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority, or the FCA, announced that it will no longer require banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. In the meantime, actions by the FCA, other regulators or law enforcement agencies may result in changes to the method by which LIBOR is calculated. At this time, it is not possible to predict the effect of any such changes or any other reforms to LIBOR that may be enacted in the United Kingdom or elsewhere.\nOur financial results may be adversely affected by changes in accounting principles applicable to us.\nOur accounting policies are critical to the manner in which we present our results of operations and financial condition. Many of these policies are highly complex and involve many assumptions, estimates and judgments. A change in accounting standards or practices, in particular with respect to revenue recognition, could harm our operating results and may even affect our reporting of transactions completed before the change is effective. GAAP rules are subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, the SEC and other various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles. For example, we adopted Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, 2016-13, \"Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326),\" or Topic 326, effective January 1, 2020, which provides guidance designed to provide financial statement users with more information about the expected credit losses on financial instruments and other commitments to extend credit held by a reporting entity at each reporting date. See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information about the impact of this accounting standard and other new accounting pronouncements. Implementation of new accounting standards could have a significant effect on our financial results, and any difficulties in implementing these pronouncements could cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations, which could result in regulatory discipline and harm investors\u2019 confidence in us.\nOur accounting is becoming more complex, and relies upon estimates or judgments relating to our critical accounting policies. If our accounting is erroneous or based on assumptions that change or prove to be incorrect, our operating results could fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in our stock price.\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes, and also to comply with many complex requirements and standards. Because of the use of estimates inherent in the financial reporting process, actual results could differ from those estimates and any such differences may be material. We devote substantial resources to compliance with accounting requirements and we base our estimates on our best judgment, historical experience, information derived from third parties, and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets, liabilities, equity, revenue and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. However, various factors are causing our accounting to become complex. For example, as a result of our acquisition of the Connect business unit of Icontrol, we now recognize revenue relating to the delivery of software relating to the Software platform under different revenue recognition standards than those that apply to delivery of our services under the Alarm.com platforms. Ongoing evolution of our business, and the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting uncertainty have, and any future acquisitions may, compound these complexities. Our operating results may be adversely affected if we make accounting errors or our judgments prove to be wrong, assumptions change or actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions, which could cause our operating results to fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors or guidance we may have provided, resulting in a decline in our stock price and potential legal claims. Significant judgments, assumptions and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements include those related to revenue recognition, stock-based compensation, business combinations, and income taxes.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nIf we fail to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights adequately, our business could be harmed.\nWe believe that our proprietary technology is essential to establishing and maintaining our leadership position. We seek to protect our intellectual property through trade secrets, copyrights, confidentiality, non-compete and nondisclosure agreements, patents, trademarks, domain names and other measures, some of which afford only limited protection. We also rely on patent, trademark, trade secret and copyright laws to protect our intellectual property. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our technology or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. Our means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate or our competitors may independently develop similar or superior technology, or design around our intellectual property. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as the laws of the United States. Intellectual property protections may also be unavailable, limited or difficult to enforce in some countries, which could make it easier for competitors to capture market share. Our failure or inability to adequately protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights could harm our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nTo prevent substantial unauthorized use of our intellectual property rights, it may be necessary to prosecute actions for infringement and/or misappropriation of our proprietary rights against third parties. See the section of this Annual Report titled \"Legal Proceedings\" for additional information on related intellectual property litigation matters. Any such action could result in significant costs and diversion of our resources and management's attention, and we cannot assure you that we will be successful in such action. Furthermore, many of our current and potential competitors have the ability to dedicate substantially greater resources to enforce their intellectual property rights than we do. Accordingly, despite our efforts, we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property.\nAn assertion by a third party that we are infringing its intellectual property could subject us to costly and time-consuming litigation or expensive licenses that could harm our business and results of operations.\nThe industries in which we compete are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, and by frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. We have been involved with patent litigation suits in the past and we may be involved with and subject to similar litigation in the future to defend our intellectual property position. For example, on June 2, 2015, Vivint filed a lawsuit against us in U.S. District Court, District of Utah, alleging that our technology directly and indirectly infringes six patents that Vivint purchased. Vivint is seeking permanent injunctions, enhanced damages and attorneys' fees. Should Vivint prevail on its claims that one or more elements of our solution infringe one or more of its patents, we could be required to pay damages of Vivint\u2019s lost profits and/or a reasonable royalty for sales of our solution, enjoined from making, using, and selling our solution if a license or other right to continue selling such elements is not made available to us or we are unable to design around such patents, and required to pay ongoing royalties and comply with unfavorable terms if such a license is made available to us. While we believe we have valid defenses to Vivint\u2019s claims, any of these outcomes could result in a material adverse effect on our business.\nIn addition, on October 22, 2019, EcoFactor, filed a complaint with the ITC, and on November 22, 2019, the ITC instituted an investigation into EcoFactor\u2019s allegations, naming us, among several others, as respondents, alleging with respect to Alarm.com that Alarm.com\u2019s smart thermostats infringe three U.S. patents owned by EcoFactor. EcoFactor is seeking a permanent limited exclusion order and permanent cease and desist order. On November 11, 2019, EcoFactor filed a lawsuit against us in the U.S. District Court, District of Massachusetts, alleging infringement of the same three patents asserted against us in the ITC, seeking permanent injunctions, enhanced damages and attorneys' fees. On January 31, 2020, EcoFactor filed a lawsuit against us in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas, alleging Alarm.com\u2019s products and services infringe four additional U.S. patents owned by EcoFactor. EcoFactor is seeking permanent injunctions, enhanced damages and attorneys' fees. See the section of this Annual Report titled \"Legal Proceedings\" for additional information on each of these matters. Should EcoFactor prevail in the ITC investigation, Alarm.com thermostats made abroad could be excluded from importation into the United States. Should EcoFactor prevail in either of its district court lawsuits we could be required to pay damages in the amount of EcoFactor\u2019s lost profits and/or a reasonable royalty for sales of our solution, we could be enjoined from making, using and selling our solution if a license or other right to continue selling such elements is not made available to us or we are unable to design around such patents, and we could be required to pay ongoing royalties and comply with unfavorable terms if such a license is made available to us. While we believe we have valid defenses to EcoFactor\u2019s claims, any of these outcomes could result in a material adverse effect on our business.\nEven if we were to prevail in any of these matters, ongoing litigation could continue to be costly and time-consuming, divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations and dissuade potential customers from purchasing our solution, which would also materially harm our business. During the course of each of these litigation matters, we anticipate announcements of the results of hearings and motions, and other interim developments related to the litigation matters at hand. If securities analysts or investors regard these announcements as negative, the market price of our common stock may decline.\nWe might not prevail in any intellectual property infringement litigation given the complex technical issues and inherent uncertainties in such litigation and our service provider partner contracts may require us to indemnify them against certain liabilities they may incur as a result of our infringement or alleged infringement of any third party intellectual property. Defending such claims, regardless of their merit, could be time-consuming and distracting to management, result in costly litigation or settlement, cause development delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements. In addition, we currently have a limited portfolio of issued patents compared to our larger competitors, and therefore may not be able to effectively utilize our intellectual property portfolio to assert defenses or counterclaims in response to patent infringement claims or litigation brought against us by third parties. Further, litigation may involve patent holding companies or other adverse patent owners who have no relevant products or revenues and against which our potential patents provide no deterrence, and many other potential litigants have the capability to dedicate substantially greater resources to enforce their intellectual property rights and to defend claims that may be brought against them. Given that our platforms and solutions integrate with many aspects of a property, the risk that our platforms and solutions may be subject to these allegations is exacerbated. As we seek to extend our platforms and solutions, we could be constrained by the intellectual property rights of others. If our platforms and solutions exceed the scope of in-bound licenses or violate any third party proprietary rights, we could be required to withdraw those solutions from the market, re-develop those solutions or seek to obtain licenses from third parties, which might not be available on reasonable terms or at all. Any efforts to re-develop our platforms and solutions, obtain licenses from third parties on favorable terms or license a substitute technology might not be successful and, in any case, might substantially increase our costs and harm our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. If we were compelled to withdraw any of our platforms and solutions from the market, our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations could be harmed.\nWe have indemnity obligations to certain of our service provider partners for certain expenses and liabilities resulting from intellectual property infringement claims regarding our platforms and solutions, which could force us to incur substantial costs.\nWe have indemnity obligations to certain of our service provider partners for intellectual property infringement claims regarding our platforms and solutions. As a result, in the case of infringement claims against these service provider partners, we could be required to indemnify them for losses resulting from such claims or to refund amounts they have paid to us. We expect that some of our service provider partners may seek indemnification from us in connection with infringement claims brought against them. For example, on July 13, 2016, Applied Capital, Inc., or Applied Capital, filed a lawsuit against ADT, alleging that ADT\u2019s sales of ADT Pulse directly and indirectly infringe two patents purchased by Applied Capital. Applied Capital is seeking damages and attorney\u2019s fees. We are indemnifying ADT in this matter. In addition, we may elect to indemnify service provider partners where we have no contractual obligation to indemnify them and we will evaluate each such request on a case-by-case basis. If a service provider partner elects to invest resources in enforcing a claim for indemnification against us, we could incur significant costs disputing it. If we do not succeed in disputing it, we could face substantial liability. See the section of this Annual Report titled \"Legal Proceedings\" for additional information regarding this matter and the other legal proceedings we are involved in.\nThe use of open source software in our platforms and solutions may expose us to additional risks and harm our intellectual property.\nSome of our platforms and solutions use or incorporate software that is subject to one or more open source licenses and we may incorporate open source software in the future. Open source software is typically freely accessible, usable and modifiable. Certain open source software licenses require a user who intends to distribute the open source software as a component of the user's software to disclose publicly part or all of the source code to the user's software. In addition, certain open source software licenses require the user of such software to make any derivative works of the open source code available to others on potentially unfavorable terms to us or at no cost.\nThe terms of many open source licenses to which we are subject have not been interpreted by U.S. or foreign courts, and accordingly there is a risk that those licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our platforms and solutions. In that event, we could be required to seek licenses from third parties in order to continue offering our platforms and solutions, to re-develop our platforms and solutions, to discontinue sales of our platforms and solutions or to release our proprietary software code under the terms of an open source license, any of which could harm our business. Further, given the nature of open source software, it may be more likely that third parties might assert copyright and other intellectual property infringement claims against us based on our use of these open source software programs. Litigation could be costly for us to defend, have a negative effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations or require us to devote additional research and development resources to change our solutions.\nAlthough we are not aware of any use of open source software in our platforms and solutions that would require us to disclose all or a portion of the source code underlying our core solutions, it is possible that such use may have inadvertently occurred in deploying our platforms and solutions. Additionally, if a third party software provider has incorporated certain types of open source software into software we license from such third party for our platforms and solutions without our knowledge, we could, under certain circumstances, be required to disclose the source code to our platforms and solutions. This could harm our intellectual property position as well as our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nThe market price of our common stock has been and will likely continue to be volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock may be highly volatile and may fluctuate substantially as a result of a variety of factors, some of which are related in complex ways. Since shares of our common stock were sold in our initial public offering in June 2015 at a price of $14.00 per share, our stock price has ranged from an intraday low of $10.26 to an intraday high of $104.75 through December 31, 2020. The market price of our common stock may decline regardless of our operating performance, resulting in the potential for substantial losses for our stockholders, and may fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including the factors listed below and other factors described in this \"Risk Factors\" section:\n\u2022actual or anticipated fluctuations in our financial condition and operating results;\n\u2022the financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in these projections or our failure to meet these projections;\n\u2022failure of securities analysts to initiate or maintain coverage of our company, changes in financial estimates by any securities analysts who follow our company, or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors;\n\u2022ratings changes by any securities analysts who follow our company;\n\u2022variance in our financial performance from expectations of securities analysts;\n\u2022announcements by us or our competitors of significant business developments, technical innovations, acquisitions or new solutions;\n\u2022changes in the prices of our platforms and solutions;\n\u2022changes in our projected operating and financial results;\n\u2022changes in laws or regulations applicable to our platforms and solutions or marketing techniques, or our industry in general;\n\u2022our involvement in any litigation, including any lawsuits threatened or filed against us;\n\u2022repurchases of our common stock under the stock repurchase program authorized by our board of directors or our sale of our common stock or other securities in the future;\n\u2022changes in senior management or key personnel;\n\u2022trading volume of our common stock;\n\u2022changes in the anticipated future size and growth rate of our market; and\n\u2022general economic, regulatory and market conditions in the United States and abroad as well as the uncertainty resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies. These fluctuations have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. Broad market and industry fluctuations, as well as general economic, political, regulatory and market conditions, may negatively impact the market price of our common stock. In the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their securities have been subject to securities class action litigation. We may be the target of this type of litigation in the future, which could result in substantial costs and divert our management\u2019s attention.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could cause our market price to decline.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales might occur, could depress the market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. We are unable to predict the effect that sales, particularly sales by our directors, executive officers, and significant stockholders, may have on the prevailing market price of our common stock. Additionally, the shares of common stock subject to outstanding options under our equity incentive plans and the shares reserved for future issuance under our\nequity incentive plans, as well as shares issuable upon vesting of restricted stock awards, will become eligible for sale in the public market in the future, subject to certain legal and contractual limitations. Moreover, some holders of shares of our common stock have rights, subject to certain conditions, to require us to file registration statements covering their shares or to include their shares in registration statements that we may file for ourselves or our stockholders. We have also registered shares of common stock that we may issue under our employee equity incentive plans. Accordingly, these shares may be able to be sold freely in the public market upon issuance as permitted by any applicable vesting requirements. See \u201cConversion of the 2026 Notes may dilute the ownership interest of our stockholders or may otherwise depress the price of our common stock\u201d below for further details on the risks related to the dilutive impact of the 2026 Notes.\nWe are obligated to develop and maintain a system of effective internal controls over financial reporting. These internal controls may be determined to be not effective, which may adversely affect investor confidence in our company and, as a result, the value of our common stock.\nWe have been and are required, pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, to furnish a report by management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting on an annual basis. This assessment includes disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our management in our internal control over financial reporting. During the evaluation and testing process, if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we will be unable to assert that our internal controls are effective and would be required to disclose any material weaknesses identified in Management\u2019s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. While we have established certain procedures and control over our financial reporting processes, we cannot assure you that these efforts will prevent restatements of our financial statements in the future.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm is also required, pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. For future reporting periods, our independent registered public accounting firm may issue a report that is adverse in the event it is not satisfied with the level at which our controls are documented, designed or operating. We may not be able to remediate any future material weaknesses, or to complete our evaluation, testing and any required remediation in a timely fashion.\nIf we are unable to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion that our internal controls over financial reporting are effective, investors could lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which could cause the price of our common stock to decline, and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by regulatory authorities, including the SEC and Nasdaq. Failure to remediate any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, or to maintain other effective control systems required of public companies, could also restrict our future access to the capital markets.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or publish negative reports about our business, our share price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock depends, in part, on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. We do not have any control over these analysts. If our financial performance fails to meet analyst estimates or one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our shares or change their opinion of our shares, our share price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause our share price or trading volume to decline.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future and, as a result, your ability to achieve a return on your investment will depend on appreciation in the price of our common stock.\nWe do not intend to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. We anticipate that we will retain all of our future earnings for use in the development of our business and for general corporate purposes. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors and may be subject to any restrictions on paying dividends in any future indebtedness. Accordingly, investors must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investments.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of us more difficult, limit attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management and limit the market price of our common stock.\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control or changes in our management. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws include provisions that:\n\u2022authorize our board of directors to issue preferred stock, without further stockholder action and with voting liquidation, dividend and other rights superior to our common stock;\n\u2022require that any action to be taken by our stockholders be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting and not by written consent, and limit the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings;\n\u2022establish an advance notice procedure for stockholder proposals to be brought before an annual meeting, including proposed nominations of persons for director nominees;\n\u2022establish that our board of directors is divided into three classes, with directors in each class serving three-year staggered terms;\n\u2022prohibit cumulative voting in the election of directors; and\n\u2022provide that vacancies on our board of directors may be filled only by the vote of a majority of directors then in office, even though less than a quorum.\nThese provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management. In addition, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which generally prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any of a broad range of business combinations with any \"interested\" stockholder for a period of three years following the date on which the stockholder became an \"interested\" stockholder. Any of the foregoing provisions could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock, and they could deter potential acquirers of our company, thereby reducing the likelihood that you would receive a premium for your common stock in an acquisition.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the exclusive forum for certain litigation that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us.\nPursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the sole and exclusive forum for the following types of actions or proceedings under Delaware statutory or common law: (1) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (2) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or other employees to us or our stockholders, (3) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws or (4) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this choice of forum provision will not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. Furthermore, Section 22 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all such Securities Act actions. Accordingly, both state and federal courts have jurisdiction to entertain such claims. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our common stock is deemed to have notice of and consented to the foregoing provision. The forum selection clause in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation may limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us.\nRisks Related to our Outstanding Convertible Senior Notes\nWe may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to settle cash conversions of the 2026 Notes or to repurchase the 2026 Notes upon a fundamental change, and our future debt may contain limitations on our ability to pay cash upon conversion or repurchase of the 2026 Notes.\nOn January 20, 2021, we issued the 2026 Notes. The terms of the 2026 Notes are governed by an Indenture, or the Indenture, by and between Alarm.com Holdings, Inc. and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee. The 2026 Notes are senior unsecured obligations that do not bear regular interest and the principal amount of the 2026 Notes will not accrete. The 2026 Notes may bear special interest under specified circumstances related to our failure to comply with our reporting obligations under the Indenture. Special interest, if any, will be payable semiannually in arrears on January 15 and July 15 of each year, beginning on July 15, 2021. We received proceeds from the issuance of the 2026 Notes of $484.3 million, net of $15.7 million of transaction fees and other debt issuance costs. Holders of the 2026 Notes will have the right, subject to certain conditions and limited exceptions, to require us to repurchase all or a portion of their notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change at a fundamental change repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2026 Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid special interest, if any, as defined in the Indenture. In addition, upon conversion of the 2026 Notes, unless we elect to deliver solely shares of our common stock to settle such conversion (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we will be required to make cash payments in respect of the 2026 Notes being converted as defined in the Indenture. However, we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to make repurchases of 2026 Notes surrendered therefor or pay cash with respect to 2026 Notes being converted. In addition, our ability\nto repurchase the 2026 Notes or to pay cash upon conversions of the 2026 Notes may be limited by law, by regulatory authority or by agreements governing our future indebtedness. Our failure to repurchase the 2026 Notes at a time when the repurchase is required by the Indenture or to pay any cash payable on future conversions of the 2026 Notes as required by the Indenture would constitute a default under the Indenture. A default under the Indenture governing the 2026 Notes or the fundamental change itself could also lead to a default under agreements governing our future indebtedness. If the repayment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and repurchase the 2026 Notes or make cash payments upon conversions thereof.\nThe conditional conversion feature of the 2026 Notes, if triggered, may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nIn the event the conditional conversion feature of the 2026 Notes is triggered, holders of 2026 Notes will be entitled to convert the 2026 Notes at any time during specified periods at their option. If one or more holders elect to convert their 2026 Notes, unless we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering solely shares of our common stock (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we would be required to settle a portion or all of our conversion obligation through the payment of cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity. In addition, even if holders do not elect to convert their notes, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the notes as a current rather than long-term liability, which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital.\nConversion of the 2026 Notes may dilute the ownership interest of our stockholders or may otherwise depress the price of our common stock.\nThe conversion of some or all of the 2026 Notes may dilute the ownership interests of our stockholders. Upon conversion of the 2026 Notes, we have the option to pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of our common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock. If we elect to settle our conversion obligation in shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock, any sales in the public market of our common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock. In addition, the existence of the 2026 Notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of the 2026 Notes could be used to satisfy short positions, or anticipated conversion of the 2026 Notes into shares of our common stock could depress the price of our common stock.",

    "item_3": "ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nOn June 2, 2015, Vivint, Inc., or Vivint, filed a lawsuit against us in U.S. District Court, District of Utah, alleging that our technology directly and indirectly infringes six patents that Vivint purchased. Vivint is seeking permanent injunctions, enhanced damages and attorneys' fees. We answered the complaint on July 23, 2015. Among other things, we asserted defenses based on non-infringement and invalidity of the patents in question. On August 19, 2016, the U.S. District Court, District of Utah stayed the litigation pending inter partes review by the U.S. Patent Trial and Appeal Board, or PTAB, of five of the patents in suit. In March 2017, the PTAB issued final written decisions relating to two patents finding all challenged claims unpatentable. In May 2017, the PTAB issued final written decisions relating to the remaining three patents that found certain claims unpatentable, while certain other claims were not found to be unpatentable. Vivint appealed the decisions to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, or the Federal Circuit, and we cross-appealed. In July 2018, the Federal Circuit issued orders affirming the PTAB\u2019s March 2017 decisions that invalidated all challenged claims of two patents. The U.S. District Court, District of Utah lifted the stay on the litigation on June 26, 2017, with Vivint proceeding with its case on four of the six patents in its complaint. No trial date has been set. In September 2017, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or PTO, ordered ex parte reexaminations of\ncertain claims of two of the remaining patents in suit, at our request. On October 30, 2018 and November 5, 2018, the PTO issued final office actions in the pending reexaminations rejecting all claims being examined as unpatentable over the prior art. Nine claims asserted in the litigation were found unpatentable in the PTO rejections. Vivint appealed these rejections to the PTAB on March 29, 2019 and April 4, 2019. The PTAB issued decisions affirming the rejections on February 28, 2020 and May 4, 2020. Vivint appealed one of these decisions to the Federal Circuit on July 1, 2020, and requested rehearing from the PTAB on the other decision. On December 20, 2018, the Federal Circuit issued an order regarding the inter partes review of three of the remaining patents in suit that vacated, reversed and remanded the PTAB\u2019s ruling with regard to the construction of a term (\u201ccommunication device identification code\u201d) as requested by Alarm.com and affirmed the PTAB\u2019s May 2017 rulings invalidating certain of the Vivint patents in all other respects. On July 24, 2019, the PTAB issued further decisions with respect to two of the remaining patents in suit, finding additional claims unpatentable in view of the Federal Circuit\u2019s December 20, 2018 decision. One of the claims asserted in the litigation was found unpatentable in the July 14, 2019 decisions. Vivint appealed the July 24, 2019 decisions to the Federal Circuit on September 25, 2019. The appeal has been fully briefed and is now pending decision. On February 12, 2021, we filed an action in U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Virginia challenging the refusal by the PTO to proceed with additional reexaminations of the remaining patent claims asserted in the lawsuit. The PTO has not yet responded to the complaint.\nShould Vivint prevail in proving Alarm.com infringes one or more of its patent claims, we could be required to pay damages of Vivint\u2019s lost profits and/or a reasonable royalty for sales of our solution. Since all remaining patent claims in the litigation have expired, Vivint shall not be entitled to injunctive relief as a remedy in this matter. While we believe we have valid defenses to Vivint\u2019s claims, any of these outcomes could result in a material adverse effect on our business. Even if we were to prevail, this litigation could continue to be costly and time-consuming, divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations and dissuade potential customers from purchasing our solution, which would also materially harm our business. During the course of the litigation, we anticipate announcements of the results of hearings and motions, and other interim developments related to the litigation. If securities analysts or investors regard these announcements as negative, the market price of our common stock may decline.\nOn October 22, 2019, EcoFactor, Inc., or EcoFactor, filed a complaint with the U.S. International Trade Commission, or ITC, naming Alarm.com Incorporated and Alarm.com Holdings, Inc., among others, as proposed respondents. The complaint alleges that Alarm.com\u2019s smart thermostats infringe three U.S. patents owned by EcoFactor. EcoFactor is seeking a permanent limited exclusion order and permanent cease and desist order. On November 22, 2019, the ITC instituted an investigation into EcoFactor\u2019s allegations naming Alarm.com Incorporated, Alarm.com Holdings, Inc. and others as respondents. We answered the complaint on December 19, 2019. Among other things, we asserted defenses based on non-infringement and invalidity of the patents in question. An evidentiary hearing was held in November 2020. The administrative law judge presiding over the investigation has set August 20, 2021 as the target date for completion of the investigation.\nOn November 11, 2019, EcoFactor filed a lawsuit against us in U.S. District Court, District of Massachusetts, alleging infringement of the same three patents asserted against us in the ITC. EcoFactor is seeking permanent injunctions, enhanced damages and attorneys' fees. On December 26, 2019, the court issued an order staying the lawsuit pending the conclusion of the related ITC investigation.\nOn May 26, 2020, EcoFactor filed a second lawsuit against us in U.S. District Court, District of Massachusetts, alleging Alarm.com\u2019s products and services infringe four additional U.S. patents owned by EcoFactor. EcoFactor is seeking permanent injunctions, enhanced damages and attorneys' fees. On January 19, 2021, the court issued an order staying the lawsuit until May 19, 2021 in light of the related ITC investigation. On February 12, 2021, Alarm.com requested the PTO reexamine the claims of one of the patents asserted in the lawsuit. The request is pending with the PTO.\nShould EcoFactor prevail in the ITC investigation, Alarm.com thermostats manufactured abroad could be excluded from importation into the United States. Should EcoFactor prevail in its district court lawsuits we could be required to pay damages and/or a reasonable royalty for sales of our solution, we could be enjoined from making, using and selling our solution if a license or other right to continue selling such elements is not made available to us, and we could be required to pay ongoing royalties and comply with unfavorable terms if such a license is made available to us. While we believe we have valid defenses to EcoFactor\u2019s claims, the outcome of these legal claims cannot be predicted with certainty and any of these outcomes could result in an adverse effect on our business.\nOn July 29, 2020, a putative class action was filed against Alarm.com Incorporated d/b/a ICN Acquisition, among other defendants, by Abante Rooter and Plumbing Inc. and Sidney Naiman in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, alleging violations of the TCPA. The complaint sought statutory damages under the TCPA, injunctive relief, and other relief. The matter was resolved in December 2020. On January 27, 2021, the Court entered an order dismissing the case.\nIn addition to the matters described above, we may be required to provide indemnification to certain of our service provider partners for certain claims regarding our solutions. For example, we are incurring costs associated with the indemnification of our service provider ADT, LLC in ongoing patent infringement suits.\nOn July 13, 2016, Applied Capital, Inc., or Applied Capital, filed a lawsuit against ADT, LLC, the ADT Corporation, and Icontrol Networks, Inc. in U.S. District Court, the District of New Mexico. Applied Capital, Inc v. The ADT Corporation et al., D. New Mexico Case No. 1-16-cv-00815. Icontrol was dismissed without prejudice on May 22, 2017. Applied Capital alleges that ADT\u2019s sales of ADT Pulse directly and indirectly infringes U.S. Patent Nos. 8,378,817 and 9,728,082, which were allegedly purchased by Applied Capital. Applied Capital is seeking damages and attorneys\u2019 fees. ADT answered Applied Capital\u2019s amended complaint on July 16, 2018. Among other things, ADT has asserted defenses based on non-infringement and invalidity of the patents-in-suit. On April 5, 2019, Applied Capital filed a lawsuit for breach of contract against Rodney Fox, the inventor of the patents-in-suit, in the Second Judicial District Court, County of Bernalillo in New Mexico State Court (No. D-202-CV-2019-02841). Mr. Fox counterclaimed, alleging that he is the rightful owner of the patents-in-suit. Based on the dispute of ownership, on October 15, 2019, ADT filed a motion to stay in this matter pending its resolution. Applied Capital and Mr. Fox reached settlement and stipulated to dismissal of the New Mexico State Court action on October 31, 2019. Applied Capital filed its Second Amended Complaint on January 27, 2020 and ADT answered, adding a claim of inequitable conduct, on February 10, 2020. The court issued its claim construction order on August 12, 2019, fact discovery closed on November 12, 2019, expert discovery closed on March 9, 2020, and summary judgment and Daubert motions briefing closed on June 3, 2020 and are pending. The pretrial conference is scheduled for March 22, 2021, and trial is set for June 15, 2021.\nOn July 2, 2020, Portus Singapore Pte. Ltd. and Portus Pty. Ltd., or Portus, sued ADT, LLC d/b/a ADT Security Services in U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas. Portus alleges that ADT\u2019s sales of ADT Pulse directly and indirectly infringe U.S. Patent Nos. 8,914,526 and 9,961,097, which were assigned to Portus. Portus is seeking damages and attorneys\u2019 fees. ADT answered the complaint on August 31, 2020. The claim construction hearing is set for June 11, 2021. Trial is scheduled for April 4, 2022.\nShould the plaintiffs prevail on the claims that one or more elements of ADT\u2019s products infringe, we could be required to indemnify ADT for damages in the form of a reasonable royalty or ADT could be enjoined from making, using and selling our solution if a license or other right to continue selling our technology is not made available to us or we are unable to design around such patents, and required to pay ongoing royalties and comply with unfavorable terms if such a license is made available to us. The outcome of these legal claims cannot be predicted with certainty.\nWe may also be a party to litigation and subject to claims incident to the ordinary course of business. Although the results of litigation and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, we currently believe that the final outcome of these ordinary course matters will not have a material adverse effect on our business. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources and other factors.",

MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this Annual Report. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should review Item 1A. \"Risk Factors\" and \"Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\" in this Annual Report for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.\nOverview\nAlarm.com is the leading platform for the intelligently connected property. We offer a comprehensive suite of cloud-based solutions for smart residential and commercial properties, including interactive security, video monitoring, intelligent automation, energy management and wellness solutions. Millions of property owners depend on our technology to intelligently secure, automate and manage their residential and commercial properties. In the last year alone, our platforms processed more than 200 billion data points generated by over 100 million connected devices. We believe that this scale of subscribers, connected devices and data operations makes us the leader in the connected property market.\nOur solutions are delivered through an established network of over 10,000 trusted service providers, who are experts at selling, installing and supporting our solutions. We primarily generate Software-as-a-Service, or SaaS, and license revenue through our service provider partners, who resell these services and pay us monthly fees. These service provider contracts typically have an initial term of one year, with subsequent renewal terms of one year. Our service provider partners have indicated that they typically have three to five-year service contracts with residential and commercial property owners who use our solutions. We also generate hardware and other revenue, primarily from our service provider partners and distributors. Our hardware sales include connected devices that enable our services, such as video cameras, video recorders, gunshot detection sensors, gateway modules and smart thermostats. We believe that the length of our service relationships with residential and commercial property owners, combined with our robust platforms and over 20 years of operating experience, contribute to a compelling business model.\nOur solutions are designed to make both residential and commercial properties safer, smarter and more efficient. Our technology platforms support all participants in what we refer to as the connected property market. This market includes the residential and commercial property owners who subscribe to our services, the hardware partners who manufacture devices that integrate with our platforms and the service provider partners who install and maintain our solutions.\nThe Alarm.com platform enables our service provider partners to deploy our interactive security, video monitoring, intelligent automation, energy management and wellness solutions as stand-alone offerings or as combined solutions to address the needs of a broad range of customers.\nExecutive Overview and Highlights of 2020 and 2019 Results\nWe primarily generate SaaS and license revenue, our largest source of revenue, through our service provider partners who resell our services and pay us monthly fees. Our service provider partners sell, install and support Alarm.com solutions that enable residential and commercial property owners to intelligently secure, connect, control and automate their properties. Our subscribers consist of all of the properties maintained by those residential and commercial property owners to which we are delivering at least one of our solutions. We derive a portion of our revenue from licensing our intellectual property to third parties on a per customer basis. SaaS and license revenue represented 64%, 67% and 69% of our revenue in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nWe also generate SaaS and license revenue from monthly fees charged to service providers on a per subscriber basis for access to our non-hosted software platform, or Software platform. The non-hosted software for interactive security, automation and related solutions is typically deployed and operated by the service provider in its own network operations center. Software license revenue represented 6%, 9% and 10% of our revenue in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nWe also generate revenue from the sale of many types of hardware, including video cameras, video recorders, cellular radio modules, thermostats, image sensors, gunshot detection sensors and other peripherals, that enable our solutions. Our hardware and other revenue also includes our revenue from the sale of perpetual licenses that provide our customers in the commercial market the right to use our video surveillance software for an indefinite period of time in exchange for a one-time license fee. Our hardware and other revenue also includes our revenue from the sale of licenses that provide our customers the right to use our gunshot detection solution in exchange for license fees. Hardware and other revenue represented 36%, 33% and 31% of our revenue in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. We typically expect hardware and other revenue to fluctuate as a percentage of total revenue.\nHighlights of our financial performance for the periods covered in this Annual Report include:\n\u2022SaaS and license revenue increased 17% to $393.3 million in 2020 from $337.4 million in 2019. SaaS and license revenue increased 16% to $337.4 million in 2019 from $291.1 million in 2018.\n\u2022Total revenue increased 23% to $618.0 million in 2020 from $502.4 million in 2019. Total revenue increased 19% to $502.4 million in 2019 from $420.5 million in 2018.\n\u2022Net income increased 44% to $76.7 million in 2020 from $53.3 million in 2019. Net income increased 148% to $53.3 million in 2019 from $21.5 million in 2018. Net income attributable to common stockholders increased 45% to $77.9 million in 2020 from $53.5 million in 2019. Net income attributable to common stockholders increased 149% to $53.5 million in 2019 from $21.5 million in 2018.\n\u2022Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measurement of operating performance, increased to $125.3 million in 2020 from $108.3 million in 2019. Adjusted EBITDA increased to $108.3 million in 2019 from $93.1 million in 2018.\nPlease see Non-GAAP Measures below in this section of this Annual Report for a discussion of the limitations of Adjusted EBITDA (a non-GAAP measure) and a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income, the most comparable GAAP measure, for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.\nHistorical Trends within the Financial Results\nInformation about current period and prior period acquisitions that may affect the comparability of our historical financial information is included in Item 1. Business. In 2018, we recorded an expense of $28.0 million in general and administrative expense, which relates to the agreement reached to settle the legal matter alleging violations of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, or TCPA, which may affect the comparability of our historical financial information. Information about the $1.7 million of interest recorded within interest income and the $6.9 million of gain recorded within other income, net, in 2019, which relates to promissory note proceeds received from one of our hardware suppliers and proceeds from an acquired promissory note, and may affect the comparability of our historical financial information, is disclosed in the Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 2020 to December 31, 2019 section below within Item 7. \"Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\" Information about the $24.7 million gain on the sale of an investment recorded in other income, net, in 2020, which relates to the sale of an investment in one of our platform partners, and may affect the comparability of historical financial information, is disclosed in the Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 2020 to December 31, 2019 section below within Item 7. \"Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nGeographic Areas\nWe believe there is significant opportunity to expand our international business, as 3% of our total revenue during the year ended December 31, 2020 originated from customers located outside of North America. Our products are currently localized and available in over 40 countries outside of North America.\nRecent Developments\nThe COVID-19 pandemic disrupted and may continue to disrupt our supply chain for an unknown period of time due to its impact on manufacturing, production and global transportation. The COVID-19 pandemic also disrupted and may intermittently continue to disrupt our sales channels due to restrictions on our service providers\u2019 ability to meet with residential and commercial property owners who use our solutions. We have taken precautionary measures intended to help protect our employees, service providers and subscribers, as well as the communities in which we participate, including enabling substantially all of our employees to work remotely. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a global slowdown of economic activity and a recession in the United States and the economic situation remains fluid as parts of the economy appear to be recovering while others continue to struggle. While vaccines have been approved for use in the United States and in many other countries, supplies of the vaccine remain limited and it remains difficult to assess or predict the ultimate duration and economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Prolonged uncertainty with respect to COVID-19 could cause further economic slowdown or cause other unpredictable events, each of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nWhile our business and those of our service providers showed some resiliency beginning towards the end of the second quarter of 2020 and continuing through much of the remainder of 2020, if the economy fails to fully recover or there are additional shutdowns of non-essential businesses due to a resurgence of COVID-19, our SaaS and license revenue growth rate may be lower in future periods, with a corresponding reduction in hardware revenue, if some consumers or small businesses defer or cancel previously anticipated purchases. The challenges posed by COVID-19 on our business continue to evolve rapidly and we will continue to evaluate our business and operations in light of future developments.\nOn December 14, 2020, Alarm.com Incorporated, one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries, acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding ownership interest units of Shooter Detection Systems, LLC, or SDS. SDS provides an indoor gunshot detection solution through the Guardian Indoor Active Shooter Detection System, which uses a combination of acoustic and infrared sensors and proprietary algorithms to detect gunshots and communicate shooting incident details to building occupants and security teams. The acquisition of SDS expands our commercial solutions and helps our partners outfit commercial and enterprise customers with the gunshot detection solution.\nIn consideration for the purchase of 100% of the issued and outstanding ownership interest units of SDS, we paid $26.6 million in cash on December 14, 2020. Pursuant to the terms of the unit purchase agreement, following the preliminary determination of the working capital of SDS as of the closing date, the purchase price decreased by $0.1 million. The working capital adjustment is expected to be finalized and paid to the equity holders of SDS in the first half of 2021. The purchase price allocation, which is pending the final determination of the working capital, was not finalized as of the filing date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nSubsequent to December 31, 2020, on January 20, 2021, we issued $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 0% convertible senior notes due January 15, 2026 in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers, or the 2026 Notes. The terms of the 2026 Notes are governed by an Indenture, or the Indenture, by and between Alarm.com Holdings, Inc. and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee. The 2026 Notes are senior unsecured obligations that do not bear regular interest and the principal amount of the 2026 Notes will not accrete. The 2026 Notes may bear special interest under specified circumstances related to our failure to comply with our reporting obligations under the Indenture. Special interest, if any, will be payable semiannually in arrears on January 15 and July 15 of each year, beginning on July 15, 2021. We received proceeds from the issuance of the 2026 Notes of $484.3 million, net of $15.7 million of transaction fees and other debt issuance costs. We used some of the proceeds to repay the $110.0 million outstanding principal balance under our 2017 Facility and also used some of the proceeds to pay accrued interest, fees and expenses related to the 2017 Facility. We terminated the 2017 Facility effective January 20, 2021.\nOther Business Metrics\nWe regularly monitor a number of financial and operating metrics in order to measure our current performance and estimate our future performance. Our other business metrics may be calculated in a manner different from the way similar business metrics used by other companies are calculated and include the following (dollars in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2019 2018\nSaaS and license revenue $ 393,257 $ 337,375 $ 291,072\nAdjusted EBITDA 125,257 108,307 93,081\nTwelve Months Ended December 31,\n2020 2019 2018\nSaaS and license revenue renewal rate 94 % 94 % 93 %\nSaaS and License Revenue\nSaaS and license revenue is a GAAP measure that we use to measure our current performance and estimate our future performance. We believe that SaaS and license revenue is an indicator of the productivity of our existing service provider partners and their ability to activate and maintain subscribers using our intelligently connected property solutions, our ability to add new service provider partners reselling our solutions, the demand for our intelligently connected property solutions and the pace at which the market for these solutions is growing.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure that represents our net income before interest expense, interest income, other income, net, provision for / (benefit from) income taxes, amortization and depreciation expense, stock-based compensation expense, secondary offering expense, acquisition-related expense and legal costs and settlement fees incurred in connection with non-ordinary course litigation and other disputes, particularly costs involved in ongoing intellectual property litigation. We do not consider these items to be indicative of our core operating performance. The non-cash items include amortization and depreciation expense and stock-based compensation expense. We do not adjust for ordinary course legal expenses resulting from maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property portfolio and license agreements.\nAdjusted EBITDA is a key measure that our management uses to understand and evaluate our core operating performance and trends to generate future operating plans, to make strategic decisions regarding the allocation of capital, and to make investments in initiatives that are focused on cultivating new markets for our solutions. In particular, the exclusion of certain expenses in calculating Adjusted EBITDA facilitates comparisons of our operating performance on a period-to-period basis and, in the case of exclusion of acquisition-related adjustments and certain historical legal expenses, excludes items that we do not consider to be indicative of our core operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure calculated in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Please see Non-GAAP Measures in this section for a discussion of the limitations of Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income, the most comparable GAAP measurement, for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.\nSaaS and License Revenue Renewal Rate\nOur SaaS and license revenue renewal rate is an operating metric. We measure our SaaS and license revenue renewal rate on a trailing 12-month basis by dividing (a) the total SaaS and license revenue recognized during the trailing 12-month period from our subscribers on our Alarm.com platform who were subscribers on the first day of the period, by (b) total SaaS and license revenue we would have recognized during the period from those same subscribers assuming no terminations, or service level upgrades or downgrades. The SaaS and license revenue renewal rate represents both residential and commercial properties. Our SaaS and license revenue renewal rate is expressed as an annualized percentage and it is calculated across our entire subscriber base on the Alarm.com platform excluding subscribers of service providers that may use one of our other platforms as a substitute for the Alarm.com platform. Our service provider partners, who resell our services to our subscribers, have indicated that they typically have three to five-year service contracts with our subscribers. Our SaaS and license revenue renewal rate is calculated across our entire subscriber base on the Alarm.com platform, including subscribers whose contract with their service provider reached the end of its contractual term during the measurement period, as well as subscribers whose contract with their service provider has not reached the end of its contractual term during the measurement period, and is not intended to estimate the rate at which our subscribers renew their contracts with our service provider partners. We believe that our SaaS and license revenue renewal rate allows us to measure our ability to retain and grow our SaaS and license revenue and serves as an indicator of the lifetime value of our subscriber base.\nCredit Losses (Topic 326)\nOn June 16, 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, 2016-13, \"Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326),\" or Topic 326, which provides guidance designed to provide\nfinancial statement users with more information about the expected credit losses on financial instruments and other commitments to extend credit held by a reporting entity at each reporting date. From November 2018 to February 2020, amendments to Topic 326 were issued to clarify numerous accounting topics. When determining such expected credit losses, the guidance requires companies to apply a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. The amendment was effective for us beginning on January 1, 2020.\nOn January 1, 2020, we adopted Topic 326 by applying the modified retrospective approach to our trade receivables and our notes receivable that were outstanding as of that date, which required us to record the initial effect of Topic 326 as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings on January 1, 2020.\nThe adoption of Topic 326 resulted in the recording of the following amounts on our consolidated balance sheets (in thousands):\nBalance Sheet Caption As of January 1, 2020\nAccumulated deficit $ 816\nAccounts receivable, net (367)\nOther current assets (83)\nOther assets (366)\nThe adoption of Topic 326 did not materially impact our consolidated statements of operations, consolidated statement of equity or our consolidated statements of cash flows.\nComponents of Operating Results\nOur fiscal year ends on December 31. The key elements of our operating results include:\nRevenue\nWe derive our revenue from three primary sources: the sale of cloud-based SaaS services on our integrated Alarm.com platform, the sale of licenses and services on the Software platform and the sale of hardware products. We sell our platform and hardware solutions to service provider partners that resell our solutions and hardware to residential and commercial property owners, who are the service provider partners\u2019 customers.\nSaaS and License Revenue. We generate the majority of our SaaS and license revenue primarily from monthly fees charged to our service provider partners on a per subscriber basis for access to our cloud-based intelligently connected property platform and related solutions. Our fees per subscriber vary based upon the service plan and features utilized.\nWe offer multiple service level packages for our platform solutions including a range of solutions and a range of a la carte add-ons for additional features. The fee paid by our service provider partners each month for the delivery of our solutions is based on the combination of packages and add-ons enabled for each subscriber. We utilize tiered pricing plans where our service provider partners may receive prospective pricing discounts driven by volume.\nWe also generate SaaS and license revenue from the fees paid to us when we license our intellectual property to third parties for use of our patents. In addition, in certain markets, our EnergyHub subsidiary sells its demand response service for an annual service fee, with pricing based on the number of subscribers or amount of aggregate electricity demand made available for a utility\u2019s or market\u2019s control.\nSoftware License Revenue. Our SaaS and license revenue also includes our software license revenue from monthly fees charged to service providers on a per subscriber basis for access to our Software platform. The non-hosted software for interactive security, automation and related solutions is typically deployed and operated by the service provider in its own network operations center. Our agreements for the Software platform solution typically include software and services, such as post-contract customer support, or PCS. Software license revenue included in SaaS and license revenue is expected to continue to decline over time as we transition subscribers to our cloud-based hosted platform.\nHardware and Other Revenue. We generate hardware and other revenue primarily from the sale of video cameras, video recorders and cellular radio modules that provide access to our cloud-based platforms and, to a lesser extent, the sale of other devices, including image sensors, gunshot detection sensors and peripherals. We primarily transfer hardware to our customers upon delivery to the customer, which corresponds with the time at which the customer obtains control of the hardware. We record a reserve against revenue for hardware returns based on historical returns.\nOur hardware and other revenue also includes our revenue from the sale of perpetual licenses that provide our customers in the commercial market the right to use our OpenEye video surveillance software for an indefinite period of time in exchange for a one-time license fee, which is generally paid at contract inception. Our hardware and other revenue also includes our revenue from Shooter Detection Systems from the sale of licenses that provide our customers the right to use our indoor gunshot detection solution in exchange for license fees, which are generally paid at contract inception. Hardware and other revenue may also include activation fees charged to some of our service provider partners for activation of a new subscriber account on our platforms, as well as fees paid by service provider partners for our marketing services. The decision whether to charge an activation fee is based in part on the expected number of subscribers to be added by our service provider partners and as a result, many of our largest service provider partners do not pay an activation fee.\nAs a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, governments, public institutions and other organizations in many countries and localities where COVID-19 has been detected have taken certain emergency measures, and may from time to time take additional emergency measures, to combat its spread, including imposing lockdowns, shelter-in-place orders, quarantines, restrictions on travel and gatherings and the extended shutdown non-essential businesses that cannot be conducted remotely. These emergency measures remain in place to varying degrees. We have seen and anticipate we may continue to see disruption to our hardware supply chain, including limited inventory availability, increased lead times, and shipping delays, due to the impact of COVID-19 on manufacturing, production and global transportation, as well as to our sales channels due to restrictions on our service providers\u2019 ability to meet with residential and commercial property owners who use our solutions, reluctance of service providers and property owners to meet even where such restrictions have been lifted and general economic conditions. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a global slowdown of economic activity and a recession in the United States and the economic situation remains fluid as parts of the economy appear to be recovering while others continue to struggle. While vaccines have been approved for use in the United States and in many other countries, supplies of the vaccine remain limited and it remains difficult to assess or predict the ultimate duration and economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. As the future impact on global supply chains from COVID-19 is difficult to predict, the extent to which COVID-19 may negatively affect our hardware revenue is uncertain; however, if the economy fails to fully recover or there are additional shutdowns of non-essential businesses due to a resurgence of COVID-19, our SaaS and license revenue growth rate may be lower in future periods, with a corresponding reduction in hardware revenue, if some consumers or small businesses defer or cancel previously anticipated purchases.\nCost of Revenue\nOur cost of SaaS and license revenue primarily includes the amounts paid to wireless network providers and, to a lesser extent, the costs of running our network operations centers which are expensed as incurred, as well as patent and royalty costs in connection with technology licensed from third-party providers. Our cost of SaaS and license revenue also includes our cost of software license revenue, which primarily includes the payroll and payroll-related costs of the department dedicated to providing service exclusively to those service providers that host the Software platform. Our cost of hardware and other revenue primarily includes cost of raw materials, tooling and amounts paid to our third-party manufacturer for production and fulfillment of our cellular radio modules and image sensors, and procurement costs for our video cameras, video recorders and gunshot detection sensors, which we purchase from an original equipment manufacturer, and other devices. Our cost of hardware and other revenue also includes royalty costs in connection with technology licensed from third-party providers.\nWe record the cost of SaaS and license revenue as expenses are incurred, which corresponds to the delivery period of our services to our subscribers. We record the cost of hardware and other revenue primarily when the hardware and other services are delivered to the service provider partner, which occurs when control of the hardware and other services transfers to the service provider partner. Our cost of revenue excludes amortization and depreciation shown in operating expenses.\nIn 2019, the U.S. administration imposed significant changes to U.S. trade policy with respect to China. Tariffs have subjected certain Alarm.com products manufactured overseas to additional import duties of up to 25%. The amount of the import tariff and the number of products subject to tariffs have changed numerous times based on action by the U.S. administration. Approximately one-fifth to one-half of the finished goods hardware products that we sell to our service provider partners are imported from China and could be subject to increased tariffs. While the additional import duties resulted in an increase to our cost of hardware revenue, these import duties had a modest impact on hardware revenue margins. We continue to monitor the changes in tariffs. If tariffs are increased or are expanded to apply to more of our products, such actions may increase our cost of hardware revenue and reduce our hardware revenue margins in the future.\nOperating Expenses\nOur operating expenses consist of sales and marketing, general and administrative, research and development and amortization and depreciation expenses. Salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation, benefits and other personnel related costs are the most significant components of each of these expense categories, excluding amortization and depreciation. We include stock-based compensation expense in connection with the grant of stock options and other forms of equity compensation in the applicable operating expense category based on the respective equity award recipient\u2019s function (sales and marketing, general and administrative or research and development). We grew from 1,160 employees as of January 1, 2020 to 1,404 employees as of December 31, 2020, and we expect to continue to hire new employees to support the projected future growth of our business.\nSales and Marketing Expense. Sales and marketing expense consists primarily of personnel and related expenses for our sales and marketing teams, including salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation, benefits, travel, and commissions. Our sales and marketing teams engage in sales, account management, service provider partner support, advertising, promotion of our products and services and marketing.\nThe number of employees in sales and marketing functions increased from 391 as of January 1, 2020 to 461 as of December 31, 2020. We expect to continue to invest in our sales and marketing activities to expand our business both domestically and internationally. We intend to increase the size of our sales force and our service provider partner support team to provide additional support to our existing service provider partner base to drive their productivity in selling our solutions as well as to enroll new service provider partners in North America and in international markets.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense. General and administrative expense consists primarily of personnel and related expenses for our administrative, legal, human resources, finance and accounting personnel, including salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation, benefits and other personnel costs. Additional expenses included in this category are legal costs, including those that are incurred to defend and license our intellectual property, as well as non-personnel costs, such as travel related expenses, rent, subcontracting and professional fees, audit fees, tax services, and insurance expenses. Also included in general and administrative expenses are credit losses and acquisition-related expenses, which consist primarily of legal, accounting and professional service fees directly related to acquisitions and valuation gains or losses on acquisition-related contingent liabilities.\nThe number of employees in general and administrative functions increased from 148 as of January 1, 2020 to 163 as of December 31, 2020. Excluding intellectual property litigation and acquisition-related expense, we expect general and administrative costs to increase prospectively as our business grows. This includes cost increases related to accounting, finance, and legal personnel, additional external legal, audit fees and other expenses associated with regulations governing public companies. While somewhat unpredictable, we also expect to continue to incur costs related to litigation involving intellectual property. See the section of this Annual Report titled \"Legal Proceedings\" for additional information regarding litigation matters.\nResearch and Development Expense. Research and development expense consists primarily of personnel and related expenses for our employees working on our product development and software and device engineering teams, including salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation, benefits and other personnel costs. Also included are non-personnel costs such as consulting and professional fees paid to third-party development resources as well as acquisition costs of IPR&D with no alternative future use.\nThe number of employees in research and development functions grew from 621 as of January 1, 2020 to 780 as of December 31, 2020. Our research and development efforts are focused on innovating new features and enhancing the functionality of our platforms and the solutions we offer to our service provider partners and subscribers. We will also continue to invest in efforts to extend our platforms to adjacent markets and internationally to maintain our leadership position in the development of intelligently connected property technology, and continued enhancement of our Enterprise Tools platform for our service provider partners.\nAmortization and Depreciation. Amortization and depreciation consists of amortization of intangible assets originating from our acquisitions as well as our internally-developed capitalized software. Our depreciation expense is related to investments in property and equipment. Acquired intangible assets include developed technology, customer related intangibles, trademarks and trade names. We expect in the near term that amortization and depreciation may fluctuate based on our acquisition activity, development of our platforms and capitalized expenditures.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense consists of interest expense associated with our credit facility. On October 6, 2017, we entered into a $125.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility, or the 2017 Facility, with Silicon Valley Bank, or SVB, as administrative agent, PNC Bank, National Association, as documentation agent, and a syndicate of lenders. The 2017 Facility was available to us to refinance existing debt and for general corporate and working capital purposes as permitted under the terms of the 2017 Facility. Interest expense is expected to increase in 2021 as compared to 2020 due to the issuance of the 2026 Notes.\nInterest Income\nInterest income consists of interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents and our notes receivable.\nOther Income, Net\nOther income, net primarily consists of gains earned on the sale of our investments, changes in the fair value of our investments and gains earned on our notes receivable and conversion of our outstanding notes receivable balance into an equity investment, partially offset by an impairment of one of our investments.\nProvision for / (benefit from) income taxes\nWe are subject to U.S. federal, state and local income taxes as well as foreign income taxes. During the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. As a result, we recognize tax liabilities based on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due. Our effective tax rates were below the statutory rate primarily due to research and development tax credits claimed, tax windfall benefits from employee stock-based payment transactions and foreign derived intangible income deductions, partially offset by the impact of state taxes and valuation allowances recorded against state research and development tax credit carryforwards. We recognize excess tax windfall benefits on a discrete basis during the quarter in which they occur, and we anticipate that our effective tax rate will vary from quarter to quarter depending on our stock price and exercises of stock options under our equity incentive plans each period.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth our selected consolidated statements of operations and data as a percentage of revenue for the periods presented (in thousands).

Our software license revenue included within SaaS and license revenue decreased $5.4 million to $38.0 million in 2020 as compared to $43.4 million during 2019, which decreased primarily due to the result of the continuing transition of customers from non-hosted software to our cloud based hosted platform. The $49.2 million increase in our Alarm.com segment SaaS and license revenue in 2020 was primarily due to growth in our subscriber base, including the revenue impact from subscribers we added in 2019. The increase in hardware and other revenue in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily from the Alarm.com segment and was due to an increase in the volume of video cameras sold, as well as the increased revenue from our acquisition of 85% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of OpenEye, on October 21, 2019. The $6.6 million increase in SaaS and license revenue for our Other segment in 2020, as compared to the same period in the prior year was due to an increase in sales of our energy management and demand response solutions and our property management and HVAC solutions. Hardware and other revenue, net of intersegment eliminations, in 2020 in our Other segment decreased 38%, or $5.0 million, as compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to a decrease in sales related to our property management solution.\nCost of Revenue\nYear Ended December 31, % Change\n2020 2019 2020 vs. 2019\nCost of revenue(1):\nCost of SaaS and license revenue $ 53,539 $ 50,066 7 %\nCost of hardware and other revenue 173,889 133,533 30\nTotal cost of revenue $ 227,428 $ 183,599 24 %\n% of total revenue 37 % 37 %\n________________\n(1) Excludes amortization and depreciation shown in operating expenses.\nThe $43.8 million increase in cost of revenue in 2020 as compared to 2019 was the result of a $40.3 million, or 30%, increase in cost of hardware and other revenue and a $3.5 million, or 7%, increase in cost of SaaS and license revenue. Our cost of software license revenue included within cost of SaaS and license revenue remained relatively consistent at $1.3 million during 2020 as compared to 2019. The increase in cost of hardware and other revenue was due to the Alarm.com segment and related primarily to an increase in the number of hardware units shipped in 2020 as compared to 2019 as well as the increased cost of revenue from our acquisition of 85% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of OpenEye on October 21, 2019. The increase in cost of Alarm.com segment SaaS and license revenue related primarily to the growth in our subscriber\nbase, which drove a corresponding increase in amounts paid to wireless network providers. The increase in cost of Other segment SaaS and license revenue related primarily to an increase in sales of our energy management and demand response solutions, which drove a corresponding increase in amounts paid to distributed energy resource providers.\nCost of hardware and other revenue as a percentage of hardware and other revenue was 77% and 81% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Cost of SaaS and license revenue as a percentage of SaaS and license revenue was 14% and 15% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Cost of software license revenue as a percentage of software license revenue was 3% for each of the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. The decrease in cost of hardware and other revenue as a percentage of hardware and other revenue in 2020 as compared to 2019 is a reflection of the mix of product sales during the periods.\nSales and Marketing Expense\nYear Ended December 31, % Change\n2020 2019 2020 vs. 2019\nSales and marketing $ 75,967 $ 61,815 23 %\n% of total revenue 12 % 12 %\nThe $14.2 million increase in sales and marketing expense in 2020 as compared to 2019 was primarily due to increases in headcount for our sales team and service provider partner support team to support our growth. As a result, our personnel and related costs for our Alarm.com segment, including salary, benefits, stock-based compensation and travel expenses, increased by $9.7 million in 2020 as compared to 2019, net of decreased travel expenses of $3.2 million due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, marketing costs increased by $3.1 million in 2020 for our Alarm.com segment as compared to the same period in the prior year due to an increase in advertising. Sales and marketing expense from our Other segment increased $0.9 million in 2020 as compared to 2019, primarily due to increases in headcount for our sales team. The overall number of employees in our sales and marketing teams increased from 391 as of December 31, 2019 to 461 as of December 31, 2020. Sales and marketing expense as a percentage of total revenue was 12% for each of the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense\nYear Ended December 31, % Change\n2020 2019 2020 vs. 2019\nGeneral and administrative $ 78,643 $ 69,959 12 %\n% of total revenue 13 % 14 %\nThe $8.7 million increase in general and administrative expense in 2020 as compared to 2019 was primarily due to a $4.8 million increase in personnel and related costs for our Alarm.com segment due to an increase in employee headcount to support our operational growth as well as the reversal of a $3.3 million reserve for a promissory note with one of our hardware suppliers within our Alarm.com segment during 2019 which did not occur during 2020. Additionally, costs for external consultants increased by $2.3 million in 2020 for our Alarm.com segment as compared to the same period in the prior year and legal expenses increased $1.1 million within our Alarm.com segment in 2020 as compared to the same period year resulting from intellectual property litigation. These increases were partially offset by a $2.4 million decrease to the contingent consideration liability from our acquisition of 85% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of OpenEye on October 21, 2019 within our Alarm.com segment as well as a $2.2 million decrease in costs related to an offsite internal strategy and product roadmap conference incurred during 2019 which did not occur during 2020. General and administrative expenses from our Other segment increased by $0.2 million in 2020 as compared to 2019, primarily due to an increase in rent expense. The overall number of employees in general and administrative functions increased from 148 as of December 31, 2019 to 163 as of December 31, 2020.\nResearch and Development Expense\nYear Ended December 31, % Change\n2020 2019 2020 vs. 2019\nResearch and development $ 152,147 $ 114,443 33 %\n% of total revenue 25 % 23 %\nThe $37.7 million increase in research and development expense in 2020 as compared to 2019 was primarily due to an increase in headcount of employees in research and development functions. Our personnel and related costs for our Alarm.com segment increased by $28.9 million in 2020 as compared to 2019 and our expenses for external consultants increased by $2.1 million. Additionally, the increase in research and development expense is due to $4.4 million of in-process research and development we acquired in 2020, partially offset by the $1.0 million of in-process research and development we acquired 2019. Research and development expense from our Other segment increased by $2.7 million primarily due to an increase in personnel and related costs, including salary, benefits and stock-based compensation in 2020 as compared to 2019. The overall number of employees in research and development functions increased from 621 as of December 31, 2019 to 780 as of December 31, 2020.\nAmortization and Depreciation\nYear Ended December 31, % Change\n2020 2019 2020 vs. 2019\nAmortization and depreciation $ 27,520 $ 22,134 24 %\n% of total revenue 4 % 4 %\nAmortization and depreciation increased $5.4 million in 2020 as compared to 2019, primarily due to the intangible assets that were acquired in connection with the purchase of 85% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of OpenEye on October 21, 2019.\nInterest Expense\nYear Ended December 31, % Change\n2020 2019 2020 vs. 2019\nInterest expense $ (2,596) $ (2,974) (13) %\n% of total revenue - % (1) %\nInterest expense decreased $0.4 million in 2020 as compared to 2019, primarily due to the decrease in the effective interest rate on the 2017 Facility resulting from decreases in the Eurodollar Base Rate, or LIBOR. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in the carrying value of the 2017 Facility due to the $50.0 million borrowed on March 25, 2020.\nInterest Income\nYear Ended December 31, % Change\n2020 2019 2020 vs. 2019\nInterest income $ 870 $ 4,922 (82) %\n% of total revenue - % 1 %\nInterest income decreased $4.1 million in 2020 as compared to 2019, primarily due to a decrease in interest income earned on our notes receivable with one of our hardware suppliers as well as a decrease in interest income earned on our cash balance due to a decrease in interest rates.\nOther Income, Net\nYear Ended December 31, % Change\n2020 2019 2020 vs. 2019\nOther income, net $ 25,588 $ 6,535 292 %\n% of total revenue 4 % 2 %\nOther income, net increased $19.1 million during 2020 as compared to 2019, primarily due to recording a gain on the sale of an investment in one of our platform partners of $24.7 million within our Alarm.com segment in 2020 which did not occur in 2019, recording a gain on the investment in one of our technology partners of $0.7 million within our Alarm.com segment in 2020 which did not occur in 2019 as well a $0.6 million impairment of one of our investments recorded in 2019 which did not occur in 2020. These increases in other income, net, were partially offset by the $6.9 million gain recorded in 2019 related to a promissory note with one of our hardware suppliers within our Alarm.com segment which did not occur in 2020.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nYear Ended December 31, % Change\n2020 2019 2020 vs. 2019\nProvision for income taxes $ 3,500 $ 5,566 (37) %\n% of total revenue 1 % 1 %\nThe provision for income taxes decreased $2.1 million in 2020 as compared to 2019. Our effective tax rate was 4.4% in 2020 as compared to 9.5% in 2019. The decrease in the provision for income taxes and our effective tax rate was primarily due to increased tax windfall benefits and research and development tax credits in 2020 as compared to 2019.\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2018\nA comparison of the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 has been omitted from this Form 10-K, but may be found in \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d of our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, filed with the SEC on February 26, 2020.\nSegment Information\nWe have two reportable segments: Alarm.com and Other. Our Alarm.com segment represents our cloud-based and Software platforms for the intelligently connected property and related solutions that contributed 94%, 93% and 93% of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Our Other segment is focused on researching, developing and offering residential and commercial automation solutions and energy management products and services in adjacent markets. The consolidated subsidiaries that make up our Other segment are in the investment stage and have incurred significant operating expenses relative to their revenue.\nOur Alarm.com segment increased from 1,076 employees as of January 1, 2020 to 1,290 employees as of December 31, 2020. Our Other segment increased from 84 employees as of January 1, 2020 to 114 employees as of December 31, 2020. Inter-segment revenue includes sales of hardware between our segments.\nThe following table presents our revenue, inter-segment revenue and operating expenses by segment (in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2019 2018\nSaaS and License Revenue Hardware and Other Revenue Operating Expenses SaaS and License Revenue Hardware and Other Revenue Operating Expenses SaaS and License Revenue Hardware and Other Revenue Operating Expenses\nAlarm.com $ 366,815 $ 219,826 $ 310,960 $ 317,580 $ 156,265 $ 249,097 $ 278,013 $ 119,221 $ 243,835\nOther 26,442 14,254 23,317 19,795 20,919 19,254 13,059 20,316 18,742\nIntersegment Alarm.com - (3,093) - - (4,301) - - (4,749) -\nIntersegment Other - (6,241) - - (7,895) - - (5,366) -\nTotal $ 393,257 $ 224,746 $ 334,277 $ 337,375 $ 164,988 $ 268,351 $ 291,072 $ 129,422 $ 262,577\nOur SaaS and license revenue for the Alarm.com segment included software license revenue of $38.0 million, $43.4 million and $41.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. There was no software license revenue recorded for the Other segment during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nOur management\u2019s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue, costs and expenses during the reported period. In accordance with GAAP, we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Because of the use of estimates inherent in the financial reporting process in light of the continuing uncertainty arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, actual results could differ from those estimates and any such differences may be material. To the extent that there are differences between our estimates and actual results, our future financial statement presentation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows will be affected. During the first quarter of 2020, we adopted the guidance regarding accounting for expected credit losses in\nFASB Topic 326. Our most critical accounting policies are summarized below. See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for a description of our other significant accounting policies.\nRevenue\nWe derive our revenue from three primary sources: the sale of cloud-based SaaS services on our integrated Alarm.com platform, the sale of licenses and services on the Software platform and the sale of hardware products. We sell our platform and hardware solutions to service provider partners that resell our solutions and hardware to residential and commercial property owners, who are the service provider partners\u2019 customers.\nWe have variable consideration in the form of retrospective volume discounts, rebate incentives, restocking fees and assurance-type warranties. The significant inputs related to variable consideration include the volume and amount of products and services sold historically and expected to be sold in the future, the availability and performance of our services and the historical and expected number of returns. We record a reserve against revenue for hardware returns based on historical returns. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, our reserve against revenue for hardware returns was 1%, 1% and 2% of hardware and other revenue, respectively. We evaluate our hardware reserve on a quarterly basis or if there is an indication of significant changes in return experience. Historically, our returns of hardware have not significantly differed from our estimated reserve.\nIf we enter into contracts that contain multiple promised services, we evaluate which of the promised services represent separate performance obligations based on whether or not the promised services are distinct and whether or not the services are separable from other promises in the contract. If these criteria are met, then we allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations using the relative stand-alone selling price method at contract inception. In determining the relative estimated selling prices, we consider market conditions, entity-specific factors and information about the customer or class of customer. Any discount within the contract is allocated proportionately to all of the separate performance obligations in the contract unless the terms of discount relate specifically to the entity\u2019s efforts to satisfy some but not all of the performance obligations.\nWhile variable consideration assumptions and assumptions regarding the relative stand-alone selling price are specific to each contract, we did not make any material changes to these assumptions for the year ended December 31, 2020. We do not expect any material changes in the near term to the underlying assumptions used to recognize revenue during the year ended December 31, 2020. However, if changes in these assumptions occur, and, should those changes be significant, they could have a material impact on our SaaS and license revenue as well as our hardware and other revenue.\nFair Value Measurements\nThe accounting standard for fair value measurements provides a framework for measuring fair value and requires disclosures regarding fair value measurements. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received for an asset or the exit price that would be paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date.\nThe liability for the contingent consideration consisted of the potential earn-out payment related to our acquisition of 85% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of OpenEye on October 21, 2019. The earn-out payment was contingent on the satisfaction of certain calendar 2020 revenue targets and had a maximum potential payment of up to $11.0 million. During parts of 2019 and 2020, we accounted for the contingent consideration using fair value and established a liability for the future earn-out payment based on an estimation of revenue attributable to perpetual licenses and subscription licenses over the 2020 calendar year. We estimated the fair value of the liability by using a Monte Carlo simulation model for determining each of the projected measures by using an expected distribution of potential outcomes. The contingent consideration liability was valued with Level 3 significant unobservable inputs, including the revenue volatility and the discount rate. All contingencies related to the contingent consideration liability were resolved as of December 31, 2020 and no further estimates were necessary at December 31, 2020.\nWe did not make any material changes in the accounting methodology used to determine the fair value of the contingent consideration liability for the year ended December 31, 2020. We do not expect any material changes in the near term to the underlying assumptions used to determine the significant unobservable inputs used to calculate the fair value of the contingent consideration given that all contingencies have been resolved as of December 31, 2020.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe compensate our executive officers, board of directors, employees and consultants with stock-based compensation plans under our 2015 Equity Incentive Plan, or 2015 Plan. We record stock-based compensation expense related to time-based restricted stock units based upon the award\u2019s grant date fair value and use an accelerated attribution method, net of actual forfeitures, in which compensation cost for each vesting tranche in an award is recognized ratably from the service inception date to the vesting date for that tranche. We record stock-based compensation expense related to performance-based restricted stock\nunits based on management\u2019s determination of the probable outcome of the performance conditions, which requires considerable judgment. We estimate the fair value of each option granted on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which requires us to estimate the risk-free interest rate, expected term, expected stock price volatility and dividend yield. The risk-free interest rate assumption is based upon observed interest rates for constant maturity U.S. Treasury securities consistent with the expected term of our stock options. We use the \"simplified method\" to calculate the expected term, which is presumed to be the mid-point between the vesting date and the end of the contractual term. Beginning in November 2019, the expected volatility for options granted is based on historical volatilities of our stock over the estimated expected term of the stock options. The expected volatility for options granted prior to November 2019 was based on historical volatilities of our stock and publicly traded stock of comparable companies over the estimated expected term of the stock options.\nWe did not make any material changes to the underlying assumptions used to calculate stock-based compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 and we do not expect any material changes in the near term to the underlying assumptions used to calculate stock-based compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2020. However, if changes in these assumptions occur, and, should those changes be significant, they could have a material impact on our stock-based compensation expense.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe are required to allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date based upon their estimated fair values. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred. Goodwill as of the acquisition date represents the excess of the purchase consideration of an acquired business over the fair value of the underlying net tangible and intangible assets acquired net of liabilities assumed. This valuation requires management to apply significant judgment in estimating the fair value of long-lived and intangible assets acquired, which involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions.\nSignificant estimates and assumptions in valuing intangible assets include estimates about future expected cash flows, discount rates, attrition rates related to acquired customer relationships, royalty rates and obsolescence factors related to acquired developed technology and royalty rates relate to acquired trade names.\nWe did not make any material changes to the underlying assumptions used as of the acquisition date to calculate the purchase price of the acquisition of SDS, during the year ended December 31, 2020. We do not expect any material changes in the near term to the underlying assumptions used to calculate purchase price of the acquisition of SDS for the year ended December 31, 2020. However, if changes in these assumptions occur, and, should those changes be significant, they could have a material impact on our purchase price allocation for the acquisition of SDS.\nGoodwill, Intangible Assets and Long-lived Assets\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of (1) the aggregate of the fair value of consideration transferred in a business combination, over (2) the fair value of assets acquired, net of liabilities assumed. Goodwill is not amortized, but is subject to annual impairment tests. We perform our annual impairment review of goodwill on October 1 and when a triggering event occurs between annual impairment tests. We test our goodwill at the reporting unit level. We perform either a qualitative analysis or a quantitative analysis every year depending on the changes to our goodwill balance as well as changes in our business and the economy. Qualitative factors we consider include, but are not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, company specific events, changes in circumstances and market capitalization.\nFor our 2020 annual impairment review, we performed a qualitative assessment for our Alarm.com reporting unit, our only reporting unit with a goodwill balance. Based on the results of our qualitative assessment, we determined that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting unit was less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. Therefore, we concluded that there was no goodwill impairment as of October 1, 2020. Our assessment was performed as of October 1, 2020, and we have determined there have been no triggering events from our assessment date through December 31, 2020.\nWe did not make any material changes to the underlying assumptions used in our qualitative assessment of our goodwill as of October 1, 2020 and we do not expect any material changes in the near term to the underlying assumptions used in our qualitative assessment of our goodwill as of October 1, 2020. However, if changes in these assumptions occur, and, should those changes be significant, they could have a material impact on our goodwill and potentially our other income, net, if those significant changes result in an impairment.\nIntangible Assets and Long-lived Assets\nIntangible assets are initially valued at fair value using generally accepted valuation methods appropriate for the type of intangible asset. Intangible assets with definite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for impairment if indicators of impairment arise.\nWe evaluate the recoverability of our long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of long-lived assets are measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate. If the asset is considered to be impaired, the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, we determined there were no indicators of impairment of our intangible assets with definite lives or long-lived assets. We did not make any material changes to the underlying assumptions used in our assessment of intangible assets and long-lived assets for the year ended December 31, 2020 and we do not expect any material changes in the near term to the underlying assumptions used in our assessment of intangible assets and long-lived assets for the year ended December 31, 2020. However, if changes in these assumptions occur, and, should those changes be significant, they could have a material impact on our intangible assets and long-lived assets and potentially our other income, net, if those significant changes result in an impairment.\nAccounting for Income Taxes\nWe account for income taxes under the asset and liability method as required by accounting standards codification, or ASC 740, \"Income Taxes,\" which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that are included in the financial statements.\nWe record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized. In making such a determination, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent operations. Due to the uncertainty of realization of certain deferred tax assets related to our Canadian net operating losses and research and development tax credits, we established a valuation allowance of $0.3 million during the second quarter of 2019, which remained at $0.3 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. During 2020, we established a valuation allowance on state research and development tax credits of $1.3 million. As of December 31, 2018, based on our historical and expected future taxable earnings, we believed it was more likely than not that we would realize all of the benefit of the existing deferred tax assets. Accordingly, we did not record a valuation allowance as of December 31, 2018.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and foreign jurisdictions based upon our business operations in those jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating uncertain tax positions. We record uncertain tax positions in accordance with ASC 740-10 on the basis of a two-step process whereby (1) we determine whether it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained based on the technical merits of the position, and (2) with respect to those tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, we recognize the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority.\nWe did not make any material changes to the underlying assumptions used to calculate deferred tax assets and liabilities as well as uncertain tax positions for the year ended December 31, 2020 and we do not expect any material changes in the near term to the underlying assumptions used to calculate deferred tax assets and liabilities as well as uncertain tax positions for the year ended December 31, 2020. However, if changes in these assumptions occur, and, should those changes be significant, they could have a material impact on our deferred tax assets and liabilities as well as our provision for income taxes.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 of our consolidated financial statements for information related to recently issued accounting standards.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWorking Capital\nThe following table summarizes our cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, net and working capital, for the periods indicated (in thousands):\nAs of December 31,\n2020 2019 2018\nCash and cash equivalents $ 253,459 $ 119,629 $ 146,061\nAccounts receivable, net 83,326 76,373 49,510\nWorking capital 307,170 167,879 152,793\nWe define working capital as current assets minus current liabilities. Our cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2020 are available for working capital purposes. We do not enter into investments for trading purposes, and our investment policy is to invest any excess cash in short term, highly liquid investments that limit the risk of principal loss; therefore, our cash and cash equivalents are held in demand deposit accounts that generate very low returns.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had $253.5 million in cash and cash equivalents. We consider all highly liquid instruments purchased with an original maturity from the date of purchase of three months or less to be cash equivalents. To date, we have principally financed our operations through cash generated by operating activities and, to a lesser extent, through private and public equity financings.\nSubsequent to December 31, 2020, on January 20, 2021, we issued $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 0% convertible senior notes due January 15, 2026 in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers, or the 2026 Notes. The terms of the 2026 Notes are governed by an Indenture, or the Indenture, by and between Alarm.com Holdings, Inc. and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee. The 2026 Notes are senior unsecured obligations that do not bear regular interest and the principal amount of the 2026 Notes will not accrete. The 2026 Notes may bear special interest under specified circumstances related to our failure to comply with our reporting obligations under the Indenture. Special interest, if any, will be payable semiannually in arrears on January 15 and July 15 of each year, beginning on July 15, 2021. We received proceeds from the issuance of the 2026 Notes of $484.3 million, net of $15.7 million of transaction fees and other debt issuance costs. We used some of the proceeds to repay the $110.0 million outstanding principal balance under our 2017 Facility and also used some of the proceeds to pay accrued interest, fees and expenses related to the 2017 Facility. We terminated the 2017 Facility effective January 20, 2021. We intend to use the remaining net proceeds from the issuance of the 2026 Notes for working capital and other general corporate purposes, which may include acquisitions or strategic investments in complementary businesses or technologies.\nSubsequent to December 31, 2020, in February 2021, we paid $5.0 million in cash to purchase 1,000,000 shares of Series B-2 Preferred Stock from one of our technology partners as part of a financing round that included other investors.\nWe believe our existing cash and cash equivalents and our future cash flows from operating activities will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs for at least the next 12 months. Over the next 12 months, we expect our capital expenditure requirements to be approximately $11.3 million, primarily related to the continued build out of our leased and owned office space, as well as purchases of computer software and equipment. Maturities of lease liabilities for our various office leases are as follows: $11.5 million in 2021, $10.5 million in 2022, $9.6 million in 2023, $8.5 million in 2024, $7.5 million in 2025 and $4.4 million in 2026 and thereafter.\nOur future working capital, capital expenditure and cash requirements will depend on many factors, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the economy and our operations, the rate of our revenue growth, the amount and timing of our investments in human resources and capital equipment, future acquisitions and investments, and the timing and extent of our introduction of new solutions and platform and solution enhancements. As the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the economy and our operations evolves, we will continue to assess our liquidity needs. To the extent our cash and cash equivalents and cash flows from operating activities are insufficient to fund our future activities, we may need to borrow additional funds through our bank credit arrangements or raise funds from public or private equity or debt financings. If we raise additional funds through the incurrence of indebtedness, such indebtedness would likely have rights that are senior to holders of our equity securities and could contain covenants that restrict our operations. Any additional equity financing would be dilutive to our current stockholders.\nSources of Liquidity\nOur 2017 Facility was a revolving credit facility with SVB, as administrative agent, and a syndicate of lenders to finance working capital and certain permitted acquisitions and investments. The 2017 Facility was available to us to refinance existing debt and for general corporate and working capital purposes including acquisitions, and prior to its termination, had a borrowing capacity of $125.0 million. We had the option to increase the borrowing capacity of the 2017 Facility to $175.0 million with the consent of the lenders. On March 25, 2020, we borrowed $50.0 million under the 2017 Facility as a precautionary measure in order to provide financial flexibility in light of current uncertainty in the financial markets resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAs of December 31, 2020, $110.0 million was outstanding under the 2017 Facility, no letters of credit were outstanding and $15.0 million remained available for borrowing under the 2017 Facility. The 2017 Facility contained various financial and other covenants that required us to maintain a maximum consolidated leverage ratio and a fixed charge coverage ratio, and limited our capacity to incur other indebtedness, liens, make certain payments including dividends, and enter into other transactions without approval of the lenders. The 2017 Facility was secured by substantially all of our assets, including our intellectual property. As of December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with all covenants under the 2017 Facility. The 2017 Facility is discussed in more detail below under \"Debt Obligations.\"\nDividends\nWe did not declare or pay dividends during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 or 2018. We cannot provide any assurance that we will declare or pay cash dividends on our common stock in the future. We currently anticipate that we will retain all of our future earnings, if any, for use in the operation and expansion of our business and we do not anticipate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Additionally, our ability to pay dividends on our common stock was limited by restrictions under the terms of the agreements governing the 2017 Facility. Payment of future cash dividends, if any, will be at the discretion of the board of directors after taking into account various factors, including our financial condition, operating results, current and anticipated cash needs, the requirements of current or then-existing debt instruments and other factors the board of directors deems relevant.\nStock Repurchase Programs\nOn November 29, 2018, our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program, under which we were authorized to purchase up to an aggregate of $75.0 million of our outstanding common stock during the two-year period ended November 29, 2020. On December 3, 2020, our board of directors authorized another stock repurchase program, under which we are authorized to purchase up to an aggregate of $100.0 million of our outstanding common stock during the three-year period ending December 3, 2023. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we repurchased 147,153 shares of our common stock under the program that expired on November 29, 2020 in open market purchases for a total consideration of $5.1 million.\nHistorical Cash Flows\nThe following table sets forth our cash flows for the periods indicated (in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2019 2018\nCash flows from operating activities $ 102,080 $ 47,112 $ 60,710\nCash flows used in investing activities (20,274) (73,414) (13,377)\nCash flows from / (used in) financing activities 52,024 (130) 2,399\nOperating Activities\nCash flows from operating activities have typically been generated from our net income and by changes in our operating assets and liabilities, particularly from accounts receivable and inventory, adjusted for non-cash expense items such as amortization and depreciation, deferred income taxes and stock-based compensation.\nFor 2020, cash flows from operating activities were $102.1 million, compared to $47.1 million for 2019. This $55.0 million increase in cash flows from operating activities was due to a $34.3 million increase in cash from operating assets and liabilities as well as a $23.3 million increase in net income, partially offset by a $2.6 million decrease in non-cash items.\nThe $34.3 million increase in cash from operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to differences in timing of payments of disbursements and collection of receipts totaling $36.9 million, due in part to the $28.0 million payment made during the year ended December 31, 2019 for the agreement reached to settle the legal matter alleging violations of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act ,or TPCA, that did not occur during the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase in cash from\noperating assets and liabilities was partially offset by a $3.7 million change in inventory resulting from additional purchased inventory in 2020 that did not occur in 2019, which is due in part to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and the uncertainty surrounding the potential disruption to our supply chain. The $2.6 million decrease in non-cash and other reconciling items was primarily due to a $24.7 million gain on the sale of an investment in one of our platform partners in 2020 that did not occur in 2019, which was reclassified and presented as cash flows from investing activities. This decrease in noncash and other reconciling items was partially offset by an $8.6 million increase in stock-based compensation resulting from additional grants of stock options and restricted stock units in 2020 and a gain of $6.9 million related to a promissory note with one of our hardware suppliers recorded in 2019 that did not occur in 2020. Additionally, the decrease in non-cash and other reconciling items was also partially offset by a $5.4 million increase in amortization and depreciation primarily from intangible assets that were acquired in connection with the purchase of 85% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of OpenEye on October 21, 2019.\nFor 2019, cash flows from operating activities were $47.1 million, compared to $60.7 million for 2018. This $13.6 million decrease in cash flows from operating activities was due to a $61.4 million decrease in cash from operating assets and liabilities, partially offset by a $31.8 million increase in net income and a $16.0 million increase in non-cash items.\nThe $61.4 million decrease in cash from operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to the $28.0 million expense recorded during 2018 for the agreement reached to settle the legal matter alleging violations of the TCPA, and such settlement amount was subsequently paid during 2019. The decrease in cash from operating assets and liabilities was also due to differences in timing of collection of receipts and payments of disbursements. The $16.0 million increase in non-cash items was primarily due to a $14.1 million change in deferred income taxes, primarily due to the increase in deferred income taxes resulting from the $28.0 million expense recorded during 2018 for the agreement reached to settle the legal matter alleging violations of the TCPA. Additionally, the increase in non-cash items was due to a $7.2 million increase in stock-based compensation resulting from additional grants of stock options and restricted stock units during 2019, partially offset by a gain of $6.9 million recorded during 2019 related to the proceeds from promissory notes and an acquired promissory note received from one of our hardware suppliers.\nInvesting Activities\nOur investing activities typically include acquisitions, capital expenditures, investments in unconsolidated entities, notes receivable issued to companies with offerings complementary to ours and proceeds from the repayment of those notes receivable. Our capital expenditures have primarily been for general business use, including leasehold improvements as we have expanded our office space to accommodate our growth in headcount, computer equipment used internally, and expansion of our network operations centers.\nFor 2020, our cash flows used in investing activities was $20.3 million as compared to $73.4 million in 2019. The $53.1 million decrease in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to our payment of $58.8 million, net of cash acquired, for 85% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of OpenEye in 2019, partially offset by our payment of $26.3 million, net of cash acquired, for 100% of the issued and outstanding ownership interest units of SDS in 2020. Additionally, the decrease in cash used in investing activities was due to $25.7 million in proceeds received from the sale of an investment in one of our platform partners in 2020, which did not occur in 2019, a payment of $22.4 million in 2019 to acquire a promissory note as well as $3.7 million of funding provided to one of our hardware suppliers that did not occur in 2020. The decrease in cash used in investing activities in 2020 as compared to 2019 was partially offset by $30.7 million received from one of our hardware suppliers for the amounts due under various promissory notes in 2019 that did not occur in 2020.\nFor 2019, our cash flows used in investing activities was $73.4 million as compared to $13.4 million in 2018. The $60.0 million increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to our payment of $58.8 million, net of cash acquired, for 85% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of OpenEye. The increase in cash used in investing activities was also due to $22.4 million paid in 2019 for an acquired promissory note related to one of our hardware suppliers, $3.7 million of additional funding provided to the hardware supplier under the Promissory Notes in 2019 and $5.1 million paid for the purchase of land and a commercial building in 2019. The increases in cash used in investing activities were partially offset by $30.7 million received from one of our hardware suppliers for the amounts due under several promissory notes and an acquired promissory note.\nFinancing Activities\nCash generated by financing activities includes borrowings under the 2017 Facility and proceeds from the issuance of common stock from employee stock option exercises and from our employee stock purchase plan. Cash used in financing activities typically includes repurchases of common stock and repayments of debt.\nFor 2020, cash flows from financing activities was $52.0 million compared to cash flows used in financing activities of $0.1 million in 2019. The $52.1 million increase in cash flows used in financing activities was primarily due to the borrowing of $50.0 million under our 2017 Facility in 2020 as well as a $7.8 million increase in cash flows from the issuance of common stock from equity based plans. The increase in cash flows from financing activities in 2020 as compared to 2019 was partially offset by our use of $5.1 million to purchase shares of treasury stock in 2020 that did not occur in 2019.\nFor 2019, cash flows used in financing activities was $0.1 million compared to cash flows from financing activities of $2.4 million in 2018. The $2.5 million change in cash flows used in financing activities was primarily due to a decrease of $2.5 million in the issuance of common stock under equity-based plans.\nContractual Obligations\nPresented below is information about our material contractual obligations and the periods in which those future payments are due as of December 31, 2020. Future events could cause actual payments to differ from these estimates. As of December 31, 2020, the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods (in thousands):\nContractual Obligations 1 Year 2 to 3 Years 4 to 5 Years More Than\n5 Years Total\nDebt:\nPrincipal payments $ - $ 110,000 $ - $ - $ 110,000\nInterest payments1\n1,956 1,490 - - 3,446\nUnused line fee payments 30 24 - - 54\nOperating lease commitments 11,499 20,136 16,060 4,450 52,145\nOther long-term liabilities 444 4,459 1,082 826 6,811\nOther commitments2\n775 308 - - 1,083\nTotal contractual obligations $ 14,704 $ 136,417 $ 17,142 $ 5,276 $ 173,539\n_______________\n(1)The 2017 Facility incurs interest at a variable rate. The projected variable interest payments assume no change in the Eurodollar Base Rate, or LIBOR, from December 31, 2020.\n(2)Represents amounts due under multi-year, non-cancelable contracts with third-party vendors, as well as other commitments.\nThe commitment amounts in the table above are associated with contracts that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum services to be used, fixed, minimum or variable price provisions, and the approximate timing of the actions under the contracts. The table does not include obligations under agreements that we can cancel without a significant penalty.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had no outstanding letters of credit under our 2017 Facility.\nDebt Obligations\nOn October 6, 2017, we entered into a $125.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility, or the 2017 Facility, with SVB, as administrative agent, PNC Bank, National Association, as documentation agent, and a syndicate of lenders. Upon entry into the 2017 Facility, we borrowed $72.0 million, which was used to repay the previously outstanding balance under our previous credit facility. The 2017 Facility was set to mature in October 2022 and included an option to further increase the borrowing capacity to $175.0 million with the consent of the lenders. Costs incurred in connection with the 2017 Facility were capitalized and were being amortized as interest expense over the term of the 2017 Facility. The 2017 Facility was secured by substantially all of our assets, including our intellectual property. On March 25, 2020, we borrowed $50.0 million under the 2017 Facility as a precautionary measure in order to provide financial flexibility in light of current uncertainty in the financial markets resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we repaid $3.0 million and $4.0 million of the outstanding balance of the 2017 Facility, respectively. See Convertible Senior Notes below in this section of this Annual Report for further details on the repayment of all outstanding borrowings under, and the termination of, the 2017 Facility subsequent to December 31, 2020.\nThe outstanding principal balance on the 2017 Facility accrued interest at a rate equal to, at our option, either (1) LIBOR, plus an applicable margin based on our consolidated leverage ratio, or (2) the highest of (a) the Wall Street Journal prime rate, (b) the Federal Funds rate plus 0.50%, or (c) LIBOR plus 1.00% plus an applicable margin based on our consolidated leverage ratio. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we elected for the outstanding principal balance to accrue interest at LIBOR plus 1.50, LIBOR plus 1.75, LIBOR plus 2.00, and LIBOR plus 2.50 when our consolidated leverage ratio is less than 1.00:1.00, greater than or equal to 1.00:1.00 but less than 2.00:1.00, greater than or equal to 2.00:1.00 but less than 3.00:1.00 and greater than or equal to 3.00:1.00, respectively. The 2017 Facility also carried an unused line commitment fee of 0.20%. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the effective interest rate on the credit facilities was 2.65%, 4.45% and 4.13%, respectively.\nThe carrying value of the 2017 Facility was $110.0 million and $63.0 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The 2017 Facility included a variable interest rate that approximated market rates and, as such, we classified the liability as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy and determined that the carrying amount of the 2017 Facility approximated its fair value as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. The 2017 Facility contained various financial and other covenants that required us to maintain a maximum consolidated leverage ratio not to exceed 3.25:1.00 and a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 1.25:1.00. As of December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with all financial and non-financial covenants and there were no events of default. The 2017 Facility also contained customary conditions to borrowings and events of default and contains various negative covenants, including covenants that restrict our ability to dispose of assets, merge with or acquire other entities, incur indebtedness, incur encumbrances, make certain payments including dividends, make investments or engage in transactions with affiliates without approval of the lenders.\nOn November 30, 2018, we amended the 2017 Facility to incorporate the parameters that were required to be met for us to repurchase our outstanding common stock under the stock repurchase program authorized by our board of directors on November 29, 2018.\nConvertible Senior Notes\nOn January 20, 2021, we issued $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 0% convertible senior notes due January 15, 2026 in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers, or the 2026 Notes. The terms of the 2026 Notes are governed by an Indenture, or the Indenture, by and between Alarm.com Holdings, Inc. and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee. The 2026 Notes are senior unsecured obligations that do not bear regular interest and the principal amount of the 2026 Notes will not accrete. The 2026 Notes may bear special interest under specified circumstances related to our failure to comply with our reporting obligations under the Indenture. Special interest, if any, will be payable semiannually in arrears on January 15 and July 15 of each year, beginning on July 15, 2021. We received proceeds from the issuance of the 2026 Notes of $484.3 million, net of $15.7 million of transaction fees and other debt issuance costs.\nWe may not redeem the 2026 Notes prior to January 20, 2024. We may redeem for cash, all or any portion of the 2026 Notes, at our option, on or after January 20, 2024, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2026 Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid special interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date, if the last reported sale price of our common stock has been at least 130% of the conversion price for the 2026 Notes then in effect for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any 30 consecutive trading day period (including the last trading day of such period) ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which we provide notice of redemption. No sinking fund is provided for the 2026 Notes.\nThe 2026 Notes will be convertible at the option of the holders at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding August 15, 2025, only under the following circumstances: (1) during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending on June 30, 2021 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price of our common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price for the 2026 Notes on each applicable trading day; (2) during the five business day period immediately after any ten consecutive trading day period in which, for each trading day of that period, the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of 2026 Notes for such trading day was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of our common stock and the conversion rate for the 2026 Notes on each such trading day; (3) if we call any or all of the 2026 Notes for redemption, at any time prior to the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately preceding the redemption date, but only with respect to the 2026 Notes called (or deemed called) for redemption; or (4) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events as set forth in the Indenture.\nOn or after August 15, 2025, until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date of the 2026 Notes, holders of the 2026 Notes may convert all or any portion of their 2026 Notes at any time, regardless of the foregoing conditions. Upon conversion, we may satisfy our conversion obligation by paying or delivering, as the case may be, cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock, at our election. It is our current intent to settle the principal amount of the 2026 Notes with cash. The initial conversion rate for the 2026 Notes is 6.7939 shares of our common stock per $1,000 principal amount of 2026 Notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of $147.19 per share of our common stock, subject to adjustment under certain circumstances in accordance with the terms of the Indenture. In addition, following certain corporate events that occur prior to the maturity date of the 2026 Notes or if we deliver a notice of redemption in respect of the 2026 Notes, we will, under certain circumstances, increase the conversion rate of the 2026 Notes for a holder who elects to convert its 2026 Notes (or any portion thereof) in connection with such a corporate event or convert its 2026 Notes called (or deemed called) for redemption during the related redemption period (as defined in the Indenture), as the case may be.\nIf we undergo a fundamental change (as defined in the Indenture), subject to certain exceptions and except as described in the Indenture, holders may require us to repurchase for cash all or any portion of their 2026 Notes at a fundamental change\nrepurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2026 Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid special interest, if any, to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date.\nThe Indenture includes customary covenants and sets forth certain events of default after which the 2026 Notes may be declared immediately due and payable and sets forth certain types of bankruptcy or insolvency events of default involving us after which the 2026 Notes become automatically due and payable.\nWe used some of the proceeds to repay the $110.0 million outstanding principal balance under our 2017 Facility and also used some of the proceeds to pay accrued interest, fees and expenses related to the 2017 Facility. We terminated the 2017 Facility effective January 20, 2021. We intend to use the remaining net proceeds from the issuance of the 2026 Notes for working capital and other general corporate purposes, which may include acquisitions or strategic investments in complementary businesses or technologies.\nSince we expect to settle the principal amount on our outstanding 2026 Notes in cash and any excess in cash or shares of our common stock, we will use the treasury stock method for calculating any potential dilutive effect of the conversion spread on diluted net income per share, if applicable. The conversion spread will have a dilutive impact on diluted net income per share of common stock when the average market price of our common stock for a given period exceeds the conversion price of $147.19 per share for the 2026 Notes.\nNon-GAAP Measures\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as our net income before interest expense, interest income, other income, net, provision for / (benefit from) income taxes, amortization and depreciation expense, stock-based compensation expense, secondary offering expense, acquisition-related expense and legal costs and settlement fees incurred in connection with non-ordinary course litigation and other disputes, particularly costs involved in ongoing intellectual property litigation. We do not consider these items to be indicative of our core operating performance. The non-cash items include amortization and depreciation expense, stock-based compensation expense related to stock options and other forms of equity compensation, including, but not limited to, the sale of common stock. We do not adjust for ordinary course legal expenses resulting from maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property portfolio and license agreements. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. See the table below for a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.\nWe have included Adjusted EBITDA in this report because it is a key measure that our management uses to understand and evaluate our core operating performance and trends, to generate future operating plans, to make strategic decisions regarding the allocation of capital and to make investments in initiatives that are focused on cultivating new markets for our solutions. We also use certain non-GAAP financial measures, including Adjusted EBITDA, as performance measures under our executive bonus plan. Further, we believe the exclusion of certain expenses in calculating Adjusted EBITDA facilitates comparisons of our operating performance on a period-to-period basis and, in the case of exclusion of acquisition-related expense and certain historical legal expenses, excludes items that we do not consider to be indicative of our core operating performance. Accordingly, we believe that Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management and board of directors.\nOur use of Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our financial results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are: (a) although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements; (b) Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; (c) Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the potentially dilutive impact of equity-based compensation; (d) Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us; and (e) other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate Adjusted EBITDA or similarly titled measures differently, which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure.\nBecause of these and other limitations, you should consider Adjusted EBITDA alongside our other GAAP-based financial performance measures, net income and our other GAAP financial results. The following table presents a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, for each of the periods indicated (in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2019 2018\nAdjusted EBITDA:\nNet income $ 76,660 $ 53,330 $ 21,524\nAdjustments:\nInterest expense, interest income and other income, net (23,862) (8,483) 503\nProvision for / (benefit from) income taxes 3,500 5,566 (9,825)\nAmortization and depreciation expense 27,520 22,134 21,721\nStock-based compensation expense 29,176 20,603 13,429\nSecondary offering expense 543 - -\nAcquisition-related expense 2,732 2,403 -\nLitigation expense 8,988 12,754 45,729\nTotal adjustments 48,597 54,977 71,557\nAdjusted EBITDA $ 125,257 $ 108,307 $ 93,081",
    "item_7A": "ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nMarket risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates. Our market risk exposure is primarily the result of fluctuations in interest rates, as well as to a lesser extent, foreign exchange rates and inflation.\nThe uncertainty that exists with respect to the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic continues to create significant volatility in the financial markets subsequent to the year ended December 31, 2020.\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe were primarily exposed to changes in short-term interest rates with respect to our cost of borrowing under our 2017 Facility with SVB. We monitor our cost of borrowing under our various facilities, taking into account our funding requirements, and our expectation for short-term rates in the future. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, an increase or decrease in the interest rate on our 2017 Facility with SVB by 100 basis points would increase or decrease our annual interest expense by approximately $1.1 million and $0.6 million, respectively.\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk\nBecause substantially all of our revenue and operating expenses are denominated in U.S. dollars, we do not believe that our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk is material to our business, financial condition or results of operations. If a significant portion of our revenue and operating expenses becomes denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars, we may not be able to effectively manage this risk, and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by translation and by transactional foreign currency conversions.",

We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.\nChanges in Accounting Principles\nAs discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for leases in 2019 and the manner in which it accounts for revenues from contracts with customers in 2018.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management\u2019s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nAs described in Management\u2019s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management has excluded Shooter Detection Systems, LLC from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020 because it was acquired by the Company in a purchase business combination during 2020. We have also excluded Shooter Detection Systems, LLC from our audit of internal control over financial reporting. Shooter Detection Systems, LLC is a wholly owned subsidiary whose total assets and total revenues excluded from management\u2019s assessment and our audit of internal control over financial reporting represent less than 1% and 1%, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the\ncompany are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nAcquisition of Shooter Detection Systems - Valuation of Acquired Developed Technology Intangible Asset\nAs described in Notes 2 and 7 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company acquired Shooter Detection Systems (\u201cSDS\u201d) for total consideration of $26.5 million on December 14, 2020, which resulted in $16.4 million of intangible assets being recorded. Intangible assets recorded by the Company in connection with the SDS acquisition primarily included developed technology of $13.5 million. Management valued the developed technology by applying the multi-period excess earnings method. This valuation requires management to apply significant judgment in estimating the fair value of intangible assets acquired, which involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. Significant assumptions in valuing these acquired developed technology intangible assets include estimates about future expected cash flows from the developed technology, the obsolescence factor, and the discount rate.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of the acquired developed technology intangible asset recorded in the acquisition of SDS is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management in estimating the fair value of the acquired developed technology intangible asset. This in turn led to significant auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating the significant assumptions relating to management\u2019s estimate, such as future expected cash flows from the developed technology, the obsolescence factor, and the discount rate. In addition, the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the acquisition accounting, including controls over management\u2019s valuation of the acquired developed technology intangible asset and controls over development of the future expected cash flows from the developed technology, the obsolescence factor, and the discount rate assumptions utilized in the valuation of the acquired developed technology intangible asset. These procedures also included, among others (i) reading the purchase agreement and (ii) testing management\u2019s process for estimating the fair value of the acquired developed technology intangible asset. Testing management\u2019s process included evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation method, testing the completeness and accuracy of data provided by management used in the valuation, and evaluating the reasonableness of significant assumptions related to the future expected cash flows from the developed technology, the obsolescence factor, and the discount rate. Evaluating the reasonableness of the future expected cash flows from the developed technology involved considering the past performance of the acquired business, as well as economic and industry forecasts. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating the appropriateness of management\u2019s valuation method and the obsolescence factor and discount rate assumptions.\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nMcLean, Virginia\nFebruary 25, 2021\nWe have served as the Company\u2019s auditor since 2009.\nALARM.COM HOLDINGS, INC.\nConsolidated Statements of Operations\n(in thousands, except share and per share data)\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2019 2018\nRevenue:\nSaaS and license revenue $ 393,257 $ 337,375 $ 291,072\nHardware and other revenue 224,746 164,988 129,422\nTotal revenue 618,003 502,363 420,494\nCost of revenue(1):\nCost of SaaS and license revenue 53,539 50,066 44,933\nCost of hardware and other revenue 173,889 133,533 100,782\nTotal cost of revenue 227,428 183,599 145,715\nOperating expenses:\nSales and marketing 75,967 61,815 55,902\nGeneral and administrative 78,643 69,959 95,750\nResearch and development 152,147 114,443 89,204\nAmortization and depreciation 27,520 22,134 21,721\nTotal operating expenses 334,277 268,351 262,577\nOperating income 56,298 50,413 12,202\nInterest expense (2,596) (2,974) (2,918)\nInterest income 870 4,922 2,272\nOther income, net 25,588 6,535 143\nIncome before income taxes 80,160 58,896 11,699\nProvision for / (benefit from) income taxes 3,500 5,566 (9,825)\nNet income 76,660 53,330 21,524\nNet loss attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interest 1,193 201 -\nNet income allocated to participating securities -

Organization\nAlarm.com Holdings, Inc. (referred to herein as Alarm.com, the Company, or we) is the leading platform for the intelligently connected property. We offer a comprehensive suite of cloud-based solutions for the smart residential and commercial property, including interactive security, video monitoring, intelligent automation and energy management. Millions of property owners depend on our technology to intelligently secure, automate and manage their residential and commercial properties. Our solutions are delivered through an established network of over 10,000 trusted service provider partners, who are experts at selling, installing and supporting our solutions. We derive revenue from the sale of our cloud-based Software-as-a-Service, or SaaS, services, license fees, software, hardware, activation fees and other revenue. Our fiscal year ends on December 31.\nNote 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nOur consolidated financial statements include our accounts and those of our majority-owned and controlled subsidiaries after elimination of intercompany accounts and transactions. Equity investments over which we are able to exercise significant influence but do not control the investee are accounted for using the equity method.\nWe determine whether we have a controlling financial interest in an entity by first evaluating whether the entity is a voting interest entity or a variable interest entity, or VIE. Voting interest entities are entities that have sufficient equity and provide equity investor voting rights that give them power to make significant decisions relating to the entity\u2019s operations. The usual condition for a controlling financial interest in a voting interest entity is ownership of a majority voting interest. In VIEs, a controlling financial interest is attained through means other than voting rights and the entities lack one or more of the characteristics of a voting entity.\nWe have unconsolidated equity investments in third-party businesses. Equity investments with readily determinable fair values are recorded at fair value. Equity investments without readily determinable fair values are recorded using the measurement alternative. Under the alternative, we measure investments without readily determinable fair values at cost, less impairment, adjusted for observable price changes from orderly transactions for identical or similar investments. We make a separate election to use the measurement alternative for each eligible investment, and reassess whether an investment qualifies for the alternative at each reporting period. Adjustments resulting from impairment, fair value, or observable price changes are recorded in other income, net in our consolidated statements of operations.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP, requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. As of the date of issuance of these financial statements, we are not aware of any specific event or circumstance that would require us to update our estimates, assumptions and judgments or revise the carrying value of our assets or liabilities. However, our estimates, judgments and assumptions are continually evaluated based on available information and experience and may change as new events occur and additional information is obtained. Because of the use of estimates inherent in the financial reporting process and in light of the continuing uncertainty arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, actual results could differ from those estimates and any such differences may be material. Estimates are used when accounting for revenue recognition, allowances for credit losses, allowance for hardware returns, estimates of obsolete inventory, long-term incentive compensation, the lease term and incremental borrowing rate for leases, stock-based compensation, income taxes, legal reserves, contingent consideration and goodwill and intangible assets.\nReclassifications\nCertain previously reported amounts in the consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2019 have been reclassified to conform to our current presentation, including the addition of a provision for excess and obsolete inventory separate line item, which was previously included in inventory.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nWe consider all highly liquid instruments purchased with an original maturity from the date of purchase of three months or less to be cash equivalents. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we have invested $221.4 million and $93.3 million in cash equivalents in the form of money market funds with one financial institution, respectively. We consider these money market funds to be Level 1 financial instruments (see Note 10).\nALARM.COM HOLDINGS, INC.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements - (Continued)\nDecember 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018\nAccounts Receivable\nAccounts receivable are principally derived from sales to customers located in the United States and Canada. Substantially all of our sales in Canada are transacted in U.S. dollars. Revenue in countries outside of North America accounted for 3%, 3% and 2% of our total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Accounts receivable balances related to service providers partners outside of North America were 7% as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. Our accounts receivable are stated at estimated realizable value.\nNotes Receivable\nNotes receivable are presented net of an allowance for uncollectability, if any. We accrue interest on notes receivable based on the contractual terms of the note. Outstanding notes receivable that are aged 30 days or more from the contractual payment date are considered past due. Notes receivable are evaluated for impairment at least quarterly. Impairment occurs when it is deemed probable that we will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan. Factors considered in determining impairment include payment status, collateral value and the probability of collecting payments when due. See Note 9 for further details on loans provided to one of our distribution partners, suppliers and service provider partners.\nCredit Losses\nThe allowance for credit losses is a valuation account that is deducted from the accounts receivable and notes receivable amortized cost basis to present the net amount expected to be collected. We estimate the allowance balance by applying the loss-rate method using relevant available information from internal and external sources, including historical write-off activity, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Historical credit loss experience provides the basis for the estimation of expected credit losses. Adjustments to historical loss information are made for changes in economic conditions, such as changes in unemployment rates. We use projected economic conditions over a period no more than twelve months based on data from external sources. For periods beyond the twelve-month reasonable and supportable forecast period, we revert to historical loss information immediately.\nThe allowance for credit losses is measured on a pooled basis when similar risk characteristics exist. When assessing whether to measure certain financial assets on a pooled basis, we considered various risk characteristics, including the financial asset type, size and the historical or expected credit loss pattern. These risk characteristics are relevant to accounts receivable and notes receivable. We identified the following two portfolio segments for our accounts receivable: (i) outstanding accounts receivable balances within Alarm.com and certain subsidiaries and (ii) outstanding accounts receivable balances within all other subsidiaries. We identified the following two portfolio segments for our notes receivable: (i) loan receivables and (ii) hardware financing receivables. There were no changes to our portfolio segments since the adoption of Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, 2016-13, \"Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326),\" or Topic 326, and no changes to our policies or practices involving the issuance of notes receivable, customer acquisitions or any other factors that influenced our estimate of expected credit losses. Additionally, there were no significant changes in the amount of write-offs during the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to historical periods. There were no purchases or sales of financial assets during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2018. See Note 9 for further details on our purchase of a secured promissory note in March 2019 that was originally executed by one of our hardware suppliers in favor of another third-party secured creditor.\nExpected credit losses are estimated over the contractual term of the financial assets and we adjust the term for expected prepayments when appropriate. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2018, we recorded credit loss expense of $1.7 million and $3.5 million in general and administrative expense in our consolidated statements of operations, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded a reduction of credit loss expense of $2.1 million in general and administrative expense in our consolidated statements of operations, primarily due to improvements in collections and improvements in the economic conditions used in the calculation of credit losses. The contractual term excludes expected extensions, renewals and modifications because extension and renewal options are unconditionally cancelable by us. Write-offs of the amortized cost basis are recorded to the allowance for credit losses. Any subsequent recoveries of previously written off balances are recorded as a reduction to credit loss expense.\nWe do not accrue interest on notes receivable that are considered impaired or are 90 days or greater past due based on their contractual payment terms. Notes receivable that are 90 days or greater past due are placed on nonaccrual status. Notes receivable may be placed on nonaccrual status earlier if, in management\u2019s opinion, a timely collection of the full principal and interest becomes uncertain. After a note receivable has been placed on nonaccrual status, interest will be recognized when cash is received. A note receivable may be returned to accrual status after all of the customer\u2019s delinquent balances of principal and interest have been settled, and collection of all remaining contractual amounts due is reasonably assured. We have elected not to measure an allowance for credit losses for accrued interest receivables. We write-off any accrued interest on notes receivable that are considered impaired or are 90 days or greater past due based on their contractual payment terms by reversing interest income. The accrued interest receivable as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 was less than $0.1 million and is reflected in other current assets within our consolidated balance sheets and excluded from the amortized cost basis of the notes receivable. We did not write-off any accrued interest receivable during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.\nALARM.COM HOLDINGS, INC.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements - (Continued)\nDecember 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018\nInventory\nOur inventory, which is comprised of raw materials and finished goods, includes materials used to produce our wireless communications network enabled radios, video cameras, video recorders, gunshot detection sensors, home automation system parts and peripherals, is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, and is charged to cost of sales primarily on a first in, first out, or FIFO, basis when the inventory is shipped from our manufacturer and received by our service provider partners. We periodically evaluate our inventory quantities for obsolescence based on criteria such as customer demand and changing technology and record an obsolescence write-off when necessary.\nLeases\nOn January 1, 2019, we adopted ASU 2016-02, \u201cLeases (Topic 842).\u201d We determine if an arrangement contains a lease at the inception of the arrangement. As part of the lease determination process, we assess several factors, including, but not limited to, whether we have the right to control and direct the use of the asset and whether the other party has a substantive substitution right. If we enter into leases that contain multiple components, we identify separate lease components based on whether or not the right to use the underlying assets is distinct and either highly dependent or highly interrelated with other rights in the contract. We also evaluate whether there are any non-lease components in the arrangement. For certain classes of underlying assets, such as data centers, we have elected not to separate non-lease components from lease components. For all other classes of underlying assets, if separate lease and non-lease components are identified, we allocate the consideration in the contract to the lease and non-lease components using the relative stand-alone selling price method at the lease inception.\nMany of our leases include options to renew at our sole discretion. We also have several leases that provide us an option to terminate the lease prior to the end of the lease term. These renewal and termination options are included in the lease term at the commencement date when we are reasonably certain the options will be exercised. When assessing the likelihood of electing these options, we consider the length of the renewal period, market conditions, our expansion plans, the existence of a termination penalty, as well as other factors. Our lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees, restrictive covenants or variable lease payments.\nRight-of-use, or ROU, assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the term of the lease and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments throughout the term of the lease. ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized as of the commencement date of the lease based on the present value of contractual lease payments due over the term of the lease. We use our incremental borrowing rate to determine the present value of the lease payments, as our leases do not state the rate implicit in the lease. Our incremental borrowing rate is determined on a collateralized basis at the commencement date of the lease.\nROU assets and lease liabilities resulting from operating leases are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets. We did not have any finance leases or subleases as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nLease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease and is recorded in general and administrative expense. Some of our leases include tenant improvement allowances, which are recorded when we are reasonably certain to utilize the allowance and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease terms or the asset lives. Leases with an initial lease term of twelve months or less are considered short-term leases. Short-term leases are not recorded on our consolidated balance sheets. Expenses associated with short-term leases are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease and are recorded in general and administrative expense. Short-term lease costs were immaterial for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nRedeemable Noncontrolling Interests\nNoncontrolling interests with redemption features that are not solely within our control are considered redeemable noncontrolling interests. Our redeemable noncontrolling interest relates to our 85% equity ownership interest in PC Open Incorporated, a Washington corporation, doing business as OpenEye (see Note 7). The OpenEye stockholder agreement contains a put option that gives the minority OpenEye stockholders the right to sell their OpenEye shares to us based on the fair value of the shares. The OpenEye stockholder agreement also contains a call option that gives us the right to purchase the remaining OpenEye shares from the minority OpenEye stockholders based on the fair value of the shares. The put and call options can each be exercised beginning in the first quarter of 2023. This redeemable noncontrolling interest is considered temporary equity and we report it between liabilities and stockholders\u2019 equity in the consolidated balance sheets. The amount of the net income or loss attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interests is recorded in the consolidated statements of operations and the accretion of the redemption value is recorded as an adjustment to additional paid-in capital. The redemption value of the of the noncontrolling interest was $10.7 million and $11.2 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nALARM.COM HOLDINGS, INC.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements - (Continued)\nDecember 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018\nInternal-Use Software\nWe capitalize the costs directly related to the development of internal-use software for our platforms during the application development stage of the projects. Such costs primarily include payroll and payroll-related costs for engineers and product development employees directly associated with the development project. Our internal-use software is reported at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation begins once the project is ready for its intended use, which is usually when the code goes into production in weekly software builds on our platforms. We depreciate the asset on a straight-line basis over a period of three years, which is the estimated useful life. We update our software for our SaaS multi-tenant platforms on a weekly basis utilizing continuous agile development methods, which primarily consists of bug-fixes and user interface changes. We evaluate whether a project should be capitalized if it adds significant functionality to our platforms. Maintenance activities or minor upgrades are expensed in the period performed.\nExternal Software\nCosts incurred in researching and developing a computer software product that will be marketed and sold are charged to expense when incurred until technological feasibility is established. Technological feasibility is established upon completion of a detailed program design or, in its absence, completion of a working model (a beta version). After technological feasibility is established, certain payroll and payroll-related costs are capitalized for engineers and product development employees directly associated with the development project. Cost capitalization ceases when the product is available for general release. Our non-hosted software is typically developed in an agile environment with frequent revisions to product release features and functions. Agile development results in a short duration between completion of the detailed program design and beta release. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we did not have any capitalized external software due to the shorter development cycle associated with agile development.\nRevenue Recognition\nOn January 1, 2018, we adopted ASU 2014-09, \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606).\" We derive our revenue from three primary sources: the sale of cloud-based SaaS services on our integrated Alarm.com platform, the sale of licenses and services on our non-hosted software platform, or Software platform, and the sale of hardware products. We sell our platform and hardware solutions to service provider partners that resell our solutions and hardware to residential and commercial property owners, who are the service provider partners\u2019 customers. Our subscribers consist of all of the properties maintained by those residential and commercial property owners to which we are delivering at least one of our solutions. We also sell our hardware to distributors who resell the hardware to service provider partners. We enter into contracts with our service provider partners that establish pricing for access to our platform solutions and for the sale of hardware. These service provider contracts typically have an initial term of one year, with subsequent renewal terms of one year. Our service provider partners typically enter into contracts with our subscribers, which our service provider partners have indicated range from three to five years in length.\nOur hardware includes cellular radio modules that enable access to our cloud-based platforms, as well as video cameras, video recorders, image sensors, gunshot detection sensors and other peripherals. Our service provider partners may purchase our hardware in anticipation of installing the hardware in a residential or commercial property when they create a new subscriber account, or for use in existing subscriber properties. The purchase of hardware occurs in a transaction that is separate and typically in advance of the purchase of our platform services. The performance obligation is primarily satisfied when the hardware is received by our service provider partner or distributor. Service provider partners transact with us to purchase our platform solutions and resell our solutions to a new subscriber, or to upgrade or downgrade the solutions of an existing subscriber, at which time the subscriber\u2019s access to our platform solutions is enabled and the delivery of the services commences. Our performance obligation related to providing our platform solutions is satisfied on a daily basis as the subscriber uses the platform services. The purchase of platform solutions and the purchase of hardware are separate transactions as revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services are transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services. We generate all of our revenue from contracts with customers.\nSaaS and license revenue associated with our contracts is invoiced and revenue is recognized at an amount that corresponds directly with the value of the performance completed to date. Additionally, the consideration received from hardware sales corresponds directly with the stand-alone selling price of the hardware. As a result, we have elected to use the practical expedient related to the amount of transaction price allocated to the unsatisfied performance obligations and therefore, we have not disclosed the total remaining revenue expected to be recognized on all contracts or the expected period over which the remaining revenue would be recognized.\nTo determine the transaction price, we analyze all of the performance obligations included in the contract. We consider the terms of the contract and our customary business practices, which typically do not include financing components or non-cash consideration. We have variable consideration in the form of retrospective volume discounts, rebate incentives, restocking fees and assurance-type warranties. The significant inputs related to variable consideration include the volume and amount of products and services sold historically and expected to be sold in the future, the availability and performance of our services and\nALARM.COM HOLDINGS, INC.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements - (Continued)\nDecember 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018\nthe historical and expected number of returns. Depending on the type of variable consideration and its predictability, we may apply an \"expected value\" approach or a \"most likely amount\" approach. We estimate the variable consideration at the onset of a contract and include the variable consideration within the transaction price if it is probable that a significant reversal of the variable consideration would not occur in the future. When determining whether the amount of variable consideration included in the transaction price should be constrained, we look at the history of hardware purchased and subscribers added by our service provider partners to estimate the likelihood of those service provider partners obtaining the retrospective volume discounts and rebates. At times, our contracts include consideration payable to a customer in the form of fixed discounts or rebates. We record the consideration payable to a customer as a reduction to the transaction price resulting in a reduction to revenue over the service period.\nIf we enter into contracts that contain multiple promised services, we evaluate which of the promised services represent separate performance obligations based on whether or not the promised services are distinct and whether or not the services are separable from other promises in the contract. If these criteria are met, then we allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations using the relative stand-alone selling price method at contract inception.\nIn determining the relative estimated selling prices, we consider market conditions, entity-specific factors and information about the customer or class of customer. Any discount within the contract is allocated proportionately to all of the separate performance obligations in the contract unless the terms of discount relate specifically to the entity\u2019s efforts to satisfy some but not all of the performance obligations.\nFor our standard service provider agreements, we have used a portfolio approach for purposes of revenue recognition, as each agreement has similar characteristics and we do not expect the effects of applying this approach would have a material impact on our financial statements as compared to assessing each agreement individually.\nSaaS and License Revenue\nWe generate the majority of our SaaS and license revenue primarily from monthly fees charged to our service provider partners sold on a per subscriber basis for access to our cloud-based intelligently connected property platform and related solutions. Our fees per subscriber vary based upon the service plan and features utilized.\nUnder the terms of our contractual arrangements with our service provider partners, we bill a monthly fee to our service provider partners in advance of the month of service, with the exception of the initial partial month of service, which is paid in arrears. Due to the limited period of time between receipt of payment and delivery of service, we have not accounted for these advance payments as significant financing components. We typically transfer the promised SaaS services to our customers over time, which is evidenced by the fact that the customers receive and consume the benefits provided by our performance of the services as such services are rendered. As a result, we recognize revenue from SaaS services on a monthly basis as we satisfy our performance obligations. We have demonstrated that we can sell our SaaS offering on a stand-alone basis, as it can be sold separately from hardware and activation services. As there is neither a minimum required initial service term nor a stated renewal term in our contractual arrangements, we recognize revenue over the period of service, which is monthly. Our service provider partners typically incur and pay the same monthly fee per subscriber account for the entire period a subscriber account is active.\nWe offer multiple service level packages for our platform solutions including a range of solutions and a range of a la carte add-ons for additional features. The fee paid by our service provider partners each month for the delivery of our solutions is based on the combination of packages and add-ons enabled for each subscriber. We utilize tiered pricing plans where our service provider partners may receive prospective pricing discounts driven by volume.\nWe also generate SaaS and license revenue from the fees paid to us when we license our intellectual property to third parties for use of our patents. We bill a monthly fee to third parties based on the number of customers that were active during the prior month. We apply the usage-based royalty exception to recognize license revenue because the sole or predominant item to which the royalty relates is the license of intellectual property. Under the usage-based royalty exception, we recognize revenue on a monthly basis over the period of service. In addition, in certain markets, our EnergyHub subsidiary sells its demand response service for an annual service fee, with pricing based on the number of subscribers or amount of aggregate electricity demand made available for a utility\u2019s or market\u2019s control.\nSoftware License Revenue\nOur SaaS and license revenue also includes our software license revenue from monthly fees charged to service providers sold on a per subscriber basis for access to our Software platform. The non-hosted software for interactive security, automation and related solutions is typically deployed and operated by the service provider in its own network operations center. Our agreements for the Software platform solution typically include software and services, such as post-contract customer support, or PCS. Software sales that include multiple elements are typically allocated to the various elements using the relative stand-alone selling price method. We apply the usage-based royalty exception to recognize license revenue associated with software hosted by our customers because the predominant item to which the royalty relates is the license of intellectual property. Under the\nALARM.COM HOLDINGS, INC.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements - (Continued)\nDecember 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018\nusage-based royalty exception, we recognize revenue on a monthly basis over the period during which the services are expected to be performed. Under the terms of our contractual arrangements with our service provider partners, we are entitled to payment of a monthly fee that is billed per subscriber for the month of service. Our software license revenue during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $38.0 million, $43.4 million and $41.3 million, respectively.\nHardware and Other Revenue\nWe generate hardware and other revenue primarily from the sale of video cameras, video recorders and cellular radio modules that provide access to our cloud-based platforms and, to a lesser extent, the sale of other devices, including image sensors, gunshot detection sensors and other peripherals. We primarily transfer hardware to our customers upon delivery to the customer, which corresponds with the time at which the customer obtains control of the hardware. As a result, we recognize hardware and other revenue as we satisfy our performance obligations, which primarily occurs when the hardware is received by our service provider partner or distributor, net of a reserve for estimated returns. There are a few contracts in which we provide shipping and handling services to the customer after control of the hardware transfers to the customer. In these instances, we have elected to account for shipping and handling costs as activities performed to fulfill the promise to transfer hardware to the customer and not as a separate promised service.\nAmounts due from the sale of hardware are payable in accordance with the terms of our agreements with our service provider partners or distributors, and are not contingent on resale to end-users, or to service provider partners in the case of sales of hardware to distributors. Payment for our hardware is typically due within 30 days from shipment, with the exception of certain hardware finance arrangements, which are paid over a 36-month period. Our distributors sell directly to our service provider partners under terms between the two parties.\nWhen determining the amount of consideration we expect to be entitled to for the sale of our hardware, we estimate the variable consideration associated with customer returns. We record a reserve against revenue for hardware returns based on historical returns. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, our reserve against revenue for hardware returns was 1%, 1% and 2% of hardware and other revenue, respectively. We evaluate our hardware reserve on a quarterly basis or if there is an indication of significant changes in return experience. Historically, our returns of hardware have not significantly differed from our estimated reserve. Additionally, we provide warranties related to the intended functionality of the products and services provided and those warranties typically allow for the return of hardware up to one year past the date of sale. We determined that these warranties are not separate performance obligations as they cannot be purchased separately and do not provide a service in addition to an assurance the hardware will function as expected.\nOur hardware and other revenue also includes our revenue from the sale of perpetual licenses that provide our customers in the commercial market the right to use our OpenEye video surveillance software for an indefinite period of time in exchange for a one-time license fee, which is generally paid at contract inception. Our hardware and other revenue also includes our revenue from Shooter Detection Systems from the sale of licenses that provide our customers the right to use our indoor gunshot detection solution in exchange for license fees, which are generally paid at contract inception. Our perpetual licenses and licenses to our indoor gunshot detection solution provide a right to use intellectual property that is functional in nature and has significant stand-alone functionality. Accordingly, for licenses of functional intellectual property, revenue is recognized at the point-in-time when control has been transferred to the customer, which occurs once the software has been made available to the customer.\nHardware and other revenue may also include activation fees charged to some of our service provider partners for activation of a new subscriber account on our platforms, as well as fees paid by service provider partners for our marketing services. Our service provider partners use services on our platforms, such as support tools and applications, to assist in the installation of our solutions in subscriber properties. This installation marks the beginning of the service period on our platforms and, on occasion, we earn activation revenue for fees charged for this service. The activation fee is non-refundable, separately negotiated and specified in our contractual arrangements with our service provider partners and is charged to the service provider partner for each subscriber activated on our platforms. The decision whether to charge an activation fee is based in part on the expected number of subscribers to be added by our service provider partners and as a result, many of our largest service provider partners do not pay an activation fee. Activation fees are not offered on a stand-alone basis separate from our SaaS offering and are billed and received at the beginning of the arrangement. We record activation fees initially as deferred revenue and we recognize these fees ratably over the expected term of the subscribers\u2019 account which we estimate is ten years based on our annual attrition rate. The portion of these activation fees included in current and long-term deferred revenue as of our balance sheet date represents the amounts that will be recognized ratably as revenue over the following twelve months, or longer as appropriate, until the ten-year expected term is complete. The balance of deferred revenue for activation fees was $7.0 million and $8.1 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, which combines current and long-term balances.\nALARM.COM HOLDINGS, INC.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements - (Continued)\nDecember 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018\nCost of Revenue\nOur cost of SaaS and license revenue primarily includes the amounts paid to wireless network providers and, to a lesser extent, the costs of running our network operations centers which are expensed as incurred, as well as patent and royalty costs in connection with technology licensed from third-party providers. Our cost of SaaS and license revenue also includes our cost of software license revenue, which primarily includes the payroll and payroll-related costs of the department dedicated to providing service exclusively to those service providers that host the Software platform. Our cost of software license revenue during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $1.3 million, $1.3 million and $1.7 million, respectively. Our cost of hardware and other revenue primarily includes cost of raw materials, tooling and amounts paid to our third-party manufacturer for production and fulfillment of our cellular radio modules and image sensors, and procurement costs for our video cameras, video recorders and gunshot detection sensors, which we purchase from an original equipment manufacturer, and other devices. Our cost of hardware and other revenue also includes royalty costs in connection with technology licensed from third-party providers.\nWe record the cost of SaaS and license revenue as expenses are incurred, which corresponds to the delivery period of our services to our subscribers. We record the cost of hardware and other revenue primarily when the hardware and other services are delivered to the service provider partner, which occurs when control of the hardware and other services transfers to the service provider partner. Our cost of revenue excludes amortization and depreciation shown in operating expenses.\nContract Asset and Contract Liability Balances\nAt contract inception, we assess the goods and services promised in our contracts with customers and identify a performance obligation for each distinct promise to transfer a good or service, or bundle of goods or services. To identify the performance obligations, we consider all of the goods or services promised in the contract, whether explicitly stated or implied based on customary business practices. We record a contract asset when we satisfy a performance obligation by transferring a promised good or service. Contract assets can be conditional or unconditional depending on whether another performance obligation must be satisfied before payment can be received. We receive payments from our service provider partners based on the billing schedule established in our contracts. All of the accounts receivable presented in the balance sheet represent unconditional rights to consideration. We do not have any assets from contracts containing conditional rights and we do not have any assets from satisfied performance obligations that have not been invoiced.\nWe recognize an asset related to the costs incurred to obtain a contract only if we expect to recover those costs and we would not have incurred those costs if the contract had not been obtained. We recognize an asset from the costs incurred to fulfill a contract if the costs (i) are specifically identifiable to a contract, (ii) enhance resources that will be used in satisfying performance obligations in future and (iii) are expected to be recovered. Our contract assets consist of capitalized commission costs and upfront payments made to a customer. Based on the policy above, we capitalize a portion of our commission costs as an incremental cost of obtaining a contract. When calculating the incremental cost of obtaining a contract, we exclude any commission costs related to metrics that could be satisfied without obtaining a contract, including training-related metrics. We amortize our commission costs over a period of three years, which is consistent with the period over which the products and services related to the commission are transferred to the customer. The three-year period was determined based on our review of historical enhancements and upgrades to our products and services. We applied the portfolio approach to account for the amortization of contract costs as each contract has similar characteristics. Upfront payments made to a customer are capitalized and amortized over the expected period of benefit and are recorded as a reduction to revenue.\nContract liabilities include payments received in advance of performance under the contract, and are realized with the associated revenue recognized under the contract. All of the deferred revenue presented in the balance sheets represents contract liabilities resulting from advance cash receipts from customers or amounts billed in advance to customers from the sale of services. Changes in deferred revenue are due to our performance under the contract as well as to cash received from new contracts for which services have not been provided.\nResearch and Development\nOur research and development costs consist primarily of personnel and related expenses for our employees working on our product development and software and device engineering teams, including salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation, benefits and other personnel costs. Our research and development of new products and services is a multidisciplinary effort across our product management, program management, software engineering, device engineering, quality engineering, configuration management and network operations teams. Also included are non-personnel costs, such as consulting and professional fees paid to third-party development resources as well as acquisition costs of in-process research and development with no alternative future use. We invest substantial resources in research and development to enhance our platforms and applications, support our technology infrastructure, develop new capabilities and conduct quality assurance testing.\nALARM.COM HOLDINGS, INC.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements - (Continued)\nDecember 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018\nFair Value Measurements\nThe accounting standard for fair value measurements provides a framework for measuring fair value and requires disclosures regarding fair value measurements. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received for an asset or the exit price that would be paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. This accounting standard established a fair value hierarchy, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs, where available. The following summarizes the three levels of inputs:\nLevel 1 - Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity can access at the measurement date;\nLevel 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for similar assets and liabilities, either directly or indirectly; quoted prices in markets that are not active; and\nLevel 3 - Unobservable inputs supported by little or no market activity.\nThe carrying amount of financial assets, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximates fair value because of the short maturity and liquidity of those instruments.\nAssets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis - In 2020, 2019 and 2018, we recorded assets for our money market accounts. During parts of 2020 and 2019, we recorded liabilities for a contingent consideration liability related to acquisitions at fair value on a recurring basis.\nAssets Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis - We measure certain assets, including property and equipment, goodwill and intangible and long-lived assets at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. These assets are recognized at fair value when they are deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired. Additionally, equity investments without readily determinable fair values are recognized at fair value on a nonrecurring basis when observable price changes from orderly transactions for identical or similar investments become available.\nConcentration of Credit Risk\nThe financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consists principally of cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivables. All of our cash and cash equivalents are held at financial institutions that management believes to be of high credit quality. Our cash and cash equivalent accounts may exceed federally insured limits at times. We have not experienced any losses on cash and cash equivalents to date. To manage accounts receivable risk, we evaluate the credit worthiness of our service provider partners and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts. The majority of our accounts receivable balance is due from our service provider partners in North America. We assess the concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivables based on one industry and one geographic region and believe that our reserve for uncollectable accounts is appropriate based on our history and this concentration.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe compensate our executive officers, board of directors, employees and consultants with stock-based compensation plans under our 2015 Equity Incentive Plan, or 2015 Plan. We record stock-based compensation expense related to time-based restricted stock units based upon the award\u2019s grant date fair value and use an accelerated attribution method, net of actual forfeitures, in which compensation cost for each vesting tranche in an award is recognized ratably from the service inception date to the vesting date for that tranche. We record stock-based compensation expense related to performance-based restricted stock units based on management\u2019s determination of the probable outcome of the performance conditions and we record a cumulative adjustment in periods in which there is a change in the estimated number of shares expected to vest. Our equity awards generally vest over five years and are settled in shares of our common stock. During 2020, 2019 and 2018, we recognized compensation expense of $29.2 million, $20.6 million and $13.4 million, respectively, and associated income tax benefit of $8.2 million, $5.2 million and $7.6 million, respectively, in connection with our stock-based compensation plans. We account for stock-based compensation arrangements with non-employees based upon the award\u2019s grant date fair value. The fair value of these options is measured using the Black-Scholes option pricing model reflecting the same assumptions as applied to employee options in each of the reported periods, other than the expected life, which is assumed to be the remaining contractual life of the option.\nOur Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or 2015 ESPP, allows eligible employees to purchase shares of our common stock at 90% of the fair market value of the closing price on the purchase date. The maximum number of shares of our common stock that a participant may purchase during any calendar year is limited to the lesser of 10% of the participant's base compensation for that year or the number of shares with a fair market value of $15,000. The 2015 ESPP is considered compensatory for purposes of share-based compensation expense. Compensation expense is recognized for the amount of the discount, net of actual forfeitures, over the six-month purchase period.\nALARM.COM HOLDINGS, INC.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements - (Continued)\nDecember 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018\n401(k) Defined Contribution Plan\nWe adopted the Alarm.com Holdings 401(k) Plan, or the Plan, on April 30, 2009. All of our employees are eligible to participate in the Plan. For the year ended December 31, 2020, our discretionary match was 100% of employee contributions up to 10% of salary and up to a $5,000 maximum match. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, our discretionary match was 100% of employee contributions up to 10% of salary and up to a $4,000 maximum match. We recognized compensation expense of $5.0 million, $3.2 million and $2.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, related to our matching contributions.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe are required to allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date based upon their estimated fair values. The net assets and results of operations of an acquired entity are included in our consolidated financial statements from the acquisition date. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred. Goodwill as of the acquisition date represents the excess of the purchase consideration of an acquired business over the fair value of the underlying net tangible and intangible assets acquired net of liabilities assumed. This valuation requires management to apply significant judgment in estimating the fair value of long-lived and intangible assets acquired, which involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions.\nSignificant estimates and assumptions in valuing intangible assets include estimates about future expected cash flows, discount rates, attrition rates related to certain acquired customer relationships, royalty rates and obsolescence factors related to acquired developed technology and royalty rates relate to acquired trade names.\nDuring the measurement period, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Any adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period are recorded in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings.\nSome acquisitions may include contingent consideration, which is an obligation to make future payments to the seller contingent upon the achievement of future operational or financial targets. We estimated the fair value of the contingent consideration liability by using a Monte Carlo simulation model for determining each of the projected measures by using an expected distribution of potential outcomes. Significant estimates and assumptions in valuing contingent consideration include estimates about future financial results, revenue volatility and the discount rate. The fair value of the contingent consideration is estimated on a quarterly basis and changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration resulting from information that existed subsequent to the acquisition date are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations.\nOn October 21, 2019, we acquired 85% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of OpenEye. Certain stockholders of OpenEye had the right to receive an earn-out payment of up to an additional $11.0 million based upon satisfaction of certain calendar 2020 revenue targets. As of December 31, 2020, the 2020 revenue targets were not met and the fair value of the contingent consideration related to the potential earn-out payment was zero. As of December 31, 2019, the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration related to the potential earn-out payment using a Monte Carlo simulation model was $2.6 million and this amount was recorded in accrued compensation in the consolidated balance sheets.\nGoodwill, Intangible Assets and Long-lived Assets\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of (1) the aggregate of the fair value of consideration transferred in a business combination, over (2) the fair value of assets acquired, net of liabilities assumed. Goodwill is allocated to our reporting units, which are our operating segments or one level below our operating segments. Goodwill is not amortized, but is subject to annual impairment tests. We perform our annual impairment review of goodwill on October 1 and when a triggering event occurs between annual impairment tests. We test our goodwill at the reporting unit level. We perform either a qualitative analysis or a quantitative analysis every year depending on the changes to our goodwill balance as well as changes in our business and the economy. Qualitative factors we consider include, but are not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, company specific events, changes in circumstances and market capitalization. The amount of goodwill impairment is calculated as the amount by which a reporting unit's carrying value exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill.\nFor our 2020 annual impairment review, we performed a qualitative assessment for our Alarm.com reporting unit, our only reporting unit with a goodwill balance. Based on the results of our qualitative assessment, we determined that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting unit was less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. Therefore, we concluded that there was no goodwill impairment as of October 1, 2020. Our assessment was performed as of October 1, 2020, and we have determined there have been no triggering events from our assessment date through December 31, 2020.\nALARM.COM HOLDINGS, INC.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements - (Continued)\nDecember 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018\nIntangible Assets and Long-lived Assets\nIntangible assets are initially valued at fair value using generally accepted valuation methods appropriate for the type of intangible asset. Intangible assets with definite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives. We evaluate the recoverability of our intangible assets with definite lives and long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of intangible assets with definite lives and long-lived assets are measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate. If the asset is considered to be impaired, the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, we determined there were no impairments of our intangible assets with definite lives or long-lived assets.\nAdvertising Costs\nWe expense advertising costs as incurred. Advertising costs totaled $11.9 million, $7.5 million and $11.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Advertising costs are included within sales and marketing expenses on our consolidated statements of operations.\nAccounting for Income Taxes\nWe account for income taxes under the asset and liability method as required by accounting standards codification, or ASC 740, \"Income Taxes,\" which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that are included in the financial statements. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.\nWe record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized. In making such a determination, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent operations. Due to the uncertainty of realization of certain deferred tax assets related to our Canadian net operating losses and research and development tax credits, we established a valuation allowance of $0.3 million during the second quarter of 2019, which remained at $0.3 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. During 2020, we established a valuation allowance on state research and development tax credits of $1.3 million.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and foreign jurisdictions based upon our business operations in those jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating uncertain tax positions. We record uncertain tax positions in accordance with ASC 740-10 on the basis of a two-step process whereby (1) we determine whether it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained based on the technical merits of the position, and (2) with respect to those tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, we recognize the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority. We record interest and penalties as a component of our income tax provision.\nTreasury Stock\nWe account for treasury stock under the cost method and present treasury stock, including any applicable commissions and fees, as a component of stockholders\u2019 equity in the consolidated balance sheets and statements of equity. Treasury stock held by us may be retired or reissued in the future.\nComprehensive Income\nOur comprehensive income for each of the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was equal to our net income disclosed in the consolidated statements of operations.\nEarnings per Share\nOur basic net income per share attributable to common stockholders is calculated by dividing the net income attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period.\nOur diluted net income per share attributable to common stockholders is calculated by giving effect to all potentially dilutive common stock when determining the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding. For purposes of the diluted net\nALARM.COM HOLDINGS, INC.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements - (Continued)\nDecember 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018\nincome per share calculation, options to purchase common stock, restricted stock units and unvested shares issued upon the early exercise of options that are subject to repurchase are considered to be potential common stock.\nWe have issued securities other than common stock that participate in dividends (\"participating securities\"), and therefore utilize the two-class method to calculate net income per share. These participating securities include unvested shares issued upon the early exercise of options that are subject to repurchase which have non-forfeitable rights to participate in any dividends declared on our common stock. The two-class method requires a portion of net income to be allocated to the participating securities to determine the net income attributable to common stockholders. We also have redeemable noncontrolling interest related to our 85% equity ownership interest in OpenEye. When calculating net income attributable to the common stockholders, net loss attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interest should be excluded from net income. As a result, net income attributable to the common stockholders is equal to the net income less (i) dividends paid on unvested shares with any remaining earnings allocated in accordance with the bylaws between the outstanding common and preferred stock and (ii) net loss attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interest as of the end of each period.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nAdopted\nOn June 16, 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued Topic 326 which provides guidance designed to provide financial statement users with more information about the expected credit losses on financial instruments and other commitments to extend credit held by a reporting entity at each reporting date. From November 2018 to February 2020, amendments to Topic 326 were issued to clarify numerous accounting topics. When determining such expected credit losses, the guidance requires companies to apply a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. The amendment was effective for us beginning on January 1, 2020.\nOn January 1, 2020, we adopted Topic 326 by applying the modified retrospective approach to our trade receivables and our notes receivable that were outstanding as of that date, which required us to record the initial effect of Topic 326 as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings on January 1, 2020.\nThe adoption of Topic 326 resulted in the recording of the following amounts on our consolidated balance sheets (in thousands):\nBalance Sheet Caption As of January 1, 2020\nAccumulated deficit $ 816\nAccounts receivable, net (367)\nOther current assets (83)\nOther assets (366)\nThe adoption of Topic 326 did not materially impact our consolidated statements of operations, consolidated statement of equity or our consolidated statements of cash flows.\nOn August 28, 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, \"Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework - Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement,\" which provides guidance designed to improve the effectiveness of fair value measurement disclosures in notes to the financial statements. The update removes several existing disclosure requirements, including, but not limited to: (i) the amount of and reasons for transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, (ii) the policy for timing of transfers between levels and (iii) the valuation processes for Level 3 fair value measurements. The update also adds additional disclosure requirements for public companies, including but not limited to: (i) the changes in unrealized gains and losses for the period included in other comprehensive income for recurring Level 3 fair value measurements held at the end of the reporting period and (ii) the range and weighted average of significant unobservable inputs used to develop Level 3 fair value measurements. The update also modifies and clarifies several existing disclosure requirements. The amendment in this update was effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those fiscal years. On January 1, 2020, we adopted Topic 820 and updated our fair value measurement disclosures (see Note 10). This pronouncement did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements or disclosures.\nOn January 16, 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-1, \"Investments-Equity Securities (Topic 321), Investments-Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323), and Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Clarifying the Interactions between Topic 321, Topic 323, and Topic 815,\" which provides guidance on the interaction between accounting standards related to equity securities, equity method investments and certain derivatives. This amendment clarifies that an entity should consider observable transactions that require it to either apply or discontinue the equity method of accounting for the purposes of applying\nALARM.COM HOLDINGS, INC.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements - (Continued)\nDecember 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018\nthe measurement alternative immediately before applying, or upon discontinuing, the equity method. The amendment also clarifies that an entity should not consider whether, upon the settlement of the forward contract or exercise of the purchased option, individually or with existing investments, the underlying securities would be accounted for under the equity method or the fair value option in accordance with the financial instruments guidance. The amendment in this update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. On January 1, 2020, we adopted this amendment on a prospective basis and the adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nNot Yet Adopted\nOn December 18, 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, \"Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes,\" which simplifies the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions to the general principles in Topic 740. The update also simplifies GAAP for other areas of Topic 740 by clarifying and amending existing guidance to improve consistent application. The amendment in this update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently assessing the impact this pronouncement may have on our consolidated financial statements, but we do not believe the adoption will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements or disclosures.\nOn March 12, 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, \"Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting,\" which provides optional guidance to ease the potential accounting burden associated with transitioning away from reference rates that are expected to be discontinued such as the Eurodollar Base Rate, or LIBOR. The update allows entities to elect not to apply certain modification accounting requirements to contracts affected by the discontinuation of a reference rate if certain criteria are met. The amendment was effective beginning March 12, 2020 and will continue to be effective through December 31, 2022. We are currently assessing the timing of adoption as well as the impact this pronouncement may have on our consolidated financial statements.\nOn August 5, 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, \"Debt-Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging-Contracts in Entity\u2019s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity\u2019s Own Equity,\" which simplifies the accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of liabilities and equity, including convertible instruments and contracts on an entity\u2019s own equity. The new guidance eliminates two of the three models in Subtopic 470-20 that require separating embedded conversion features from convertible instruments. The guidance also addresses how convertible instruments are accounted for in the diluted earnings per share calculation. The amendment in this update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021. Early adoption is permitted, but no earlier than fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020. The guidance allows for either full retrospective adoption or modified retrospective adoption. Although we do not have any financial instruments impacted by this guidance as of December 31, 2020, due to the January 20, 2021 issuance of $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 0% convertible senior notes due January 15, 2026 in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers, we are currently assessing the impact this pronouncement may have on our consolidated financial statements when we adopt the pronouncement on January 1, 2022. See Note 22 for details on the subsequent event related to the convertible senior notes.\nNote 3. Revenue from Contracts with Customers\nContract Assets\nOur contract assets consist of capitalized commission costs and upfront payments made to customers. The current portion of capitalized commission costs and upfront payments made to customers are included in other current assets within our consolidated balance sheets. The non-current portion of capitalized commission costs and upfront payments made to customers are reflected in other assets within our consolidated balance sheets. Our amortization of contract assets during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $3.5 million, $2.4 million and $2.0 million, respectively.\nWe review the capitalized costs for impairment at least annually. Impairment exists if the carrying amount of the asset recognized from contract costs exceeds the remaining amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for providing the goods and services to which such asset relates, less the costs that relate directly to providing those good and services and that have not been recognized as an expense. We did not record an impairment loss on our contract assets during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.\nALARM.COM HOLDINGS, INC.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements - (Continued)\nDecember 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018\nThe changes in our contract assets are as follows (in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2019 2018\nBeginning of period balance $ 4,578 $ 2,881 $ -\nCommission costs and upfront payments to a customer capitalized in period 3,262 4,141 4,864\nAmortization of contract assets (3,534) (2,444) (1,983)\nEnd of period balance $ 4,306 $ 4,578 $ 2,881\nContract Liabilities\nContract liabilities include payments received in advance of performance under the contract and are realized with the associated revenue recognized under the contract.

Property and Equipment, Net\nFurniture, fixtures and office equipment, computer software and hardware, leasehold improvements and real property and improvements are recorded at cost and presented net of depreciation. We record land at historical cost. During the application development phase, we record capitalized development costs in our construction in progress account and then reclass the asset to internal-use software when the project is ready for its intended use, which is usually when the code goes into production. Furniture, fixtures and office equipment and computer software and hardware are depreciated on a straight-line basis over lives ranging from three to five years. Internal-use software is amortized on a straight-line basis over a three-year period. Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease terms or the asset lives. Real property is amortized on a straight-line basis over lives ranging from 15 to 39 years and the improvements related to real property are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the life of the underlying real property or the asset lives.\nThe components of property and equipment, net are as follows (in thousands):\nDecember 31,\n2020 2019\nFurniture, fixtures and office equipment $ 6,811 $ 5,604\nComputer software and hardware 22,805 17,767\nInternal-use software 8,949 8,949\nConstruction in progress 9,777 4,232\nLeasehold improvements 25,546 23,223\nReal property and improvements 4,917 4,917\nLand 1,398 1,398\nTotal property and equipment 80,203 66,090\nAccumulated depreciation (35,407) (27,542)\nProperty and equipment, net $ 44,796 $ 38,548\nDepreciation expense related to property and equipment for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $8.3 million, $5.9 million and $5.7 million, respectively. Amortization expense related to internal-use software of $2.4 million, $1.9 million and $0.8 million was included in those expenses for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. We had no disposals and write-offs of property and equipment that impacted the consolidated statements of operations during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. Within the Alarm.com segment, we disposed of and wrote off $1.4 million of\nALARM.COM HOLDINGS, INC.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements - (Continued)\nDecember 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018\ncapitalized costs to research and development expenses within the consolidated statements of operations primarily related to the design of internal-use software that no longer met the requirements for capitalization during the year ended December 31, 2018. In December 2019, we purchased land and a commercial building located in Liberty Lake, Washington for $5.1 million. This building will be used by OpenEye for sales and training, research and development, warehousing and administrative purposes.\nNote 7. Acquisitions\nAsset Acquisitions\nOn March 31, 2020, Alarm.com Incorporated, one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries, acquired certain assets of an unrelated third party. Substantially all of the acquired assets consisted of in-process research and development, or IPR&D. We believe the acquisition of the IPR&D will further our commitment to make significant investments in innovative research and development in the intelligently connected property market to broaden our suite of solutions.\nIn consideration for the purchase of the IPR&D, we paid $2.1 million in cash on March 31, 2020 and $0.1 million in December 2019, with the remaining $0.7 million expected to be paid the later of approximately 12 months following the acquisition date or upon resolution of any pending indemnification claims, subject to offset for any indemnification obligations. The $2.9 million consideration related to IPR&D was expensed at the time of the asset acquisition and was included in research and development expense in our consolidated statements of operations during 2020, as the IPR&D had no alternative future use.\nOn March 12, 2020, Alarm.com Incorporated, acquired certain assets of an unrelated third party. Substantially all of the acquired assets consisted of in-process research and development, or IPR&D. We believe the acquisition of the IPR&D will strengthen our smart intercom capability, including building access security and convenience within the multiple dwelling unit market for residents, guests and deliveries.\nIn consideration for the purchase of the IPR&D, we paid $1.2 million in cash on March 12, 2020, with the remaining $0.3 million expected to be paid 18 months following the acquisition date, subject to offset for any indemnification obligations. The $1.5 million consideration related to IPR&D was expensed at the time of the asset acquisition and was included in research and development expense in our consolidated statements of operations during 2020, as the IPR&D had no alternative future use.\nOn September 18, 2019, Alarm.com Incorporated acquired certain assets of an unrelated third party. Substantially all of the acquired assets consisted of IPR&D. We believe the acquisition of the IPR&D will strengthen our comprehensive suite of cloud-based solutions.\nIn consideration for the purchase of the IPR&D, we paid $0.9 million in cash on September 18, 2019, with the remaining $0.1 million expected to be paid 18 months following the acquisition date, subject to offset for any indemnification obligations. The $1.0 million consideration related to IPR&D was expensed at the time of the asset acquisition and was included in research and development expense in our consolidated statements of operations during 2019, as the IPR&D had no alternative future use.\nAcquisition of a Business - Shooter Detection Systems\nOn December 14, 2020, Alarm.com Incorporated acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding ownership interest units of Shooter Detection Systems, LLC, or SDS. SDS provides an indoor gunshot detection solution through the Guardian Indoor Active Shooter Detection System, which uses a combination of acoustic and infrared sensors and proprietary algorithms to detect gunshots and communicate shooting incident details to building occupants and security teams. The acquisition of SDS expands our commercial solutions and helps our partners outfit commercial and enterprise customers with the indoor gunshot detection solution.\nIn consideration for the purchase of 100% of the issued and outstanding ownership interest units of SDS, we paid $26.6 million in cash on December 14, 2020. Pursuant to the terms of the unit purchase agreement, following the preliminary determination of the working capital of SDS as of the closing date, the purchase price decreased by $0.1 million. The working capital adjustment is expected to be finalized in the first half of 2021. The purchase price allocation, which is pending the final determination of the working capital, was not finalized as of the filing date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nALARM.COM HOLDINGS, INC.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements - (Continued)\nDecember 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018\nThe table below sets forth the purchase consideration and the preliminary allocation to estimate the fair value of the tangible and intangible net assets acquired (in thousands):\nDecember 14, 2020\nCalculation of Purchase Consideration:\nCash paid, net of working capital adjustment $ 26,514\nTotal consideration $ 26,514\nEstimated Tangible and Intangible Net Assets:\nCash $ 311\nAccounts receivable 1,179\nInventory 917\nOther current assets 240\nProperty and equipment 77\nOperating lease right-of-use assets 384\nOther assets 348\nCustomer relationships 2,362\nDeveloped technology 13,522\nTrade name 512\nAccounts payable (19)\nAccrued expenses (111)\nOperating lease current liabilities (51)\nOperating lease liabilities (333)\nGoodwill 7,176\nTotal estimated tangible and intangible net assets $ 26,514\nGoodwill of $7.2 million reflects the value of acquired workforce and synergies we expect to achieve from expanding our commercial solutions through SDS's indoor gunshot detection solution. The goodwill recognized is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes in future periods. We allocate goodwill to reporting units based on expected benefit from synergies and have preliminarily allocated the goodwill to the Alarm.com segment.\nFair Value of Net Assets Acquired and Intangibles\nIn accordance with ASC 805, SDS constituted a business and the assets and liabilities were recorded at their respective fair values as of December 14, 2020. We developed our estimate of the fair value of intangible net assets using the with-and-without method for customer relationships, the multi-period excess earnings method for the developed technology and the relief-from-royalty method for the trade name.\nCustomer Relationships\nWe recorded the customer relationships intangible separately from goodwill based on determination of the length, strength and contractual nature of the relationship that SDS shared with its customers. We valued the single group of customer relationships using the with-and-without method, an income approach. The significant assumptions used in the with-and-without method include estimates about future expected cash flows from customer contracts and the discount rate.

The significant assumptions used in relief from royalty method include future expected cash flows from the trade name, the royalty rate and the discount rate. We are amortizing the trade names, valued at $0.5 million, on an attribution basis derived from the discounted cash flows of the model over an estimated useful life of five years.\nAcquisition of a Business - OpenEye\nOn October 21, 2019, Alarm.com Incorporated acquired 85% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of OpenEye. OpenEye provides cloud-managed video surveillance solutions for the enterprise commercial market. We believe the acquisition of OpenEye will provide a key element to our comprehensive suite of interactive cloud-based services spanning video, access control, intrusion and automation for domestic and international commercial enterprises.\nIn consideration for the purchase of 85% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of OpenEye, we paid $61.2 million in cash on October 21, 2019, after deducting $2.8 million related to an agreed holdback. Pursuant to the terms of the stock purchase agreement, following the preliminary determination of the working capital of OpenEye as of the closing date, the purchase price increased by $0.2 million. The working capital adjustment was finalized and paid to the stockholders of OpenEye in the second quarter of 2020 along with a portion of the holdback. The remaining amount of the holdback is expected to be paid to the stockholders of OpenEye by the fourth quarter of 2022, subject to offset for any indemnification obligations. An earn-out of up to an additional $11.0 million was payable if certain calendar 2020 revenue targets were met, of which contingent consideration of $2.8 million was recorded as of October 21, 2019. As of December 31, 2020, the 2020 revenue targets were not met and the fair value of the contingent consideration related to the potential earn-out payment decreased to zero.\nThe table below sets forth the purchase consideration and the fair value allocation of the tangible and intangible net assets acquired (in thousands):\nOctober 21, 2019\nCalculation of Purchase Consideration:\nCash paid, net of working capital adjustment $ 61,403\nHoldback consideration 2,820\nContingent consideration 2,793\nTotal consideration $ 67,016\nTangible and Intangible Net Assets:\nCash $ 2,352\nAccounts receivable 5,742\nInventory 4,687\nOther current assets 216\nProperty and equipment 296\nCustomer relationships 19,805\nDeveloped technology 16,583\nTrade name 2,219\nAccounts payable (2,746)\nAccrued expenses (1,017)\nOther current liabilities (1,683)\nDeferred tax liability (9,209)\nDeferred revenue (889)\nRedeemable noncontrolling interest (11,411)\nGoodwill 42,071\nTotal tangible and intangible net assets $ 67,016\nALARM.COM HOLDINGS, INC.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements - (Continued)\nDecember 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018\nGoodwill of $42.1 million reflects the value of acquired workforce and synergies we expect to achieve from integrating OpenEye's cloud-managed video surveillance solutions into our existing comprehensive suite of interactive cloud-based services for domestic and international commercial enterprises. None of the goodwill recognized is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes in future periods. We allocate goodwill to reporting units based on expected benefit from synergies and have allocated the goodwill to the Alarm.com segment.\nThe purchase price allocation for the purchase of 85% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of OpenEye was finalized during the second quarter of 2020. The final fair value of the assets and liabilities reflects an increase of $0.7 million in the deferred tax liability and an increase of $0.7 million in goodwill based on a measurement period adjustment determined upon filing of the pre-acquisition period tax return related to our purchase of 85% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of OpenEye.\nFair Value of Net Assets Acquired and Intangibles\nIn accordance with ASC 805, OpenEye constituted a business and the assets and liabilities were recorded at their respective fair values as of October 21, 2019. We developed our estimate of the fair value of intangible net assets using a multi-period excess earnings method for customer relationships, the relief from royalty method for the developed technology and the relief-from-royalty method for the trade name.\nCustomer Relationships\nWe recorded the customer relationships intangible separately from goodwill based on determination of the length, strength and contractual nature of the relationship that OpenEye shared with its customers. We valued the single group of customer relationships using the multi-period excess earnings method, an income approach. The significant assumptions used in the income approach include estimates about future expected cash flows from customer contracts, the attrition rate and the discount rate. We are amortizing the customer relationships, valued at $19.8 million, on an attribution basis derived from the discounted cash flows of the model over an estimated useful life of 13 years.\nDeveloped Technology\nDeveloped technology primarily consists of intellectual property of proprietary software that is marketed for sale. We valued the developed technology by applying the relief from royalty method, an income approach. The significant assumptions used in the relief from royalty method include estimates about future expected cash flows from the developed technology, the royalty rate, the obsolescence factor and the discount rate. We are amortizing the OpenEye developed technology, valued at $16.6 million, on an attribution method based on the discounted cash flows of the model over an estimated useful life of nine years.\nTrade Name\nWe valued the trade names acquired using a relief from royalty method. The significant assumptions used in the income approach include future expected cash flows from the trade name, the royalty rate and the discount rate. We are amortizing the trade names, valued at $2.2 million, on an attribution basis derived from the discounted cash flows of the model over an estimated useful life of five years.\nRedeemable Noncontrolling Interests\nOur redeemable noncontrolling interest relates to our 85% equity ownership interest in OpenEye. The OpenEye stockholder agreement contains a put option that gives the minority OpenEye stockholders the right to sell their remaining 15% equity ownership interest to us based on the fair value of the shares. The OpenEye stockholder agreement also contains a call option that gives us the right to purchase the remaining OpenEye shares from the minority OpenEye stockholders based on the fair value of the shares. The put and call options can each be exercised beginning in the first quarter of 2023. The redeemable noncontrolling interest was recorded at fair value on October 21, 2019, by applying the income approach using unobservable inputs for projected cash flows, including projected financial results and a discount rate, which are considered Level 3 inputs. This redeemable noncontrolling interest is considered temporary equity and we report it between liabilities and stockholders\u2019 equity in the consolidated balance sheets. The redemption value of the noncontrolling interest was $11.4 million as of October 21, 2019, and decreased to $10.7 million as of December 31, 2020.\nContingent Consideration\nWe accounted for the contingent consideration related to the potential earn-out payment using fair value and established a liability for the future earn-out payment based on an estimation of revenue attributable to perpetual licenses and subscription licenses over the 2020 calendar year. As of October 21, 2019, the fair value of the liability was $2.8 million. As of December 31, 2020, the 2020 revenue targets were not met and the fair value of the contingent consideration related to the potential earn-out\nALARM.COM HOLDINGS, INC.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements - (Continued)\nDecember 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018\npayment decreased to zero.

Other Assets\nPurchases of Patents and Patent Licenses\nFrom time to time, we enter into agreements to purchase patents or patent licenses. In April 2020, we purchased 30 patents for $0.9 million and in October 2020, we purchased one patent for $0.2 million. The carrying value, net of amortization, of our purchased patents and patent licenses was $2.9 million and $2.4 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, $0.7 million and $0.5 million of patent costs were included in other current assets and $2.2 million and $1.9 million of patent costs were included in other assets, respectively. We have $7.0 million of historical cost in purchased patents and patent licenses as of December 31, 2020. We are amortizing the patent costs over the estimated useful lives of the patents, which range from three years to eighteen years. Patent cost amortization of $0.4 million, $0.4 million and $0.5 million was included in cost of SaaS and license revenue in our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Patent cost amortization of $0.2 million, $0.1 million and less than $0.1 million was included in amortization and depreciation in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nLoan to a Distribution Partner\nIn September 2016, we entered into dealer and loan agreements with a distribution partner. The dealer agreement enables the distribution partner to resell our SaaS services and hardware to their subscribers. Under the loan agreements, we agreed to loan the distribution partner up to $4.0 million, collateralized by all assets owned by the distribution partner. The advance period for the loan was amended in August 2017 to begin each year on September 1 and end each year on December 31. Interest on the outstanding principal accrued at a rate per annum equal to the greater of 6.0% or LIBOR, plus 4.0%, as determined on the first date of each annual advance period. The repayment of principal and accrued interest was due in three installments beginning in July and ending in August following the advance period. The maturity date of the loan was August 31, 2019; however, the borrower had the option to extend the term of the loan for two successive terms of one year each.\nIn May 2018, the loan agreement with our distribution partner was amended to convert the entire $4.0 million note receivable outstanding into a $4.0 million term loan. The term loan had a maturity date of July 31, 2022 and required annual principal repayments of $1.0 million on July 31 of each year, commencing on July 31, 2019. The term loan also required monthly interest payments, with interest accruing on the outstanding principal balance at a rate per annum equal to 6.0% through June 30, 2018 and a rate per annum equal to the LIBOR rate on the first of any interest period plus 7.0% beginning on July 1, 2018.\nIn April 2017, we entered into a subordinated credit agreement with an affiliated entity of the distribution partner and loaned the affiliated entity $3.0 million, with a maturity date of November 21, 2022. Interest on the outstanding principal balance accrued at a rate of 8.5% per annum and required monthly interest payments.\nIn June 2020, we amended the term loan with our distribution partner and also amended the subordinated credit agreement with the affiliated entity of the distribution partner. At the time of the amended term loan and subordinated credit agreement in June 2020, the outstanding balance of the term loan was $3.0 million and the outstanding balance of the subordinated credit agreement was $3.0 million. Under the amended terms, the distribution partner paid us $2.0 million in principal for the term loan on June 9, 2020 and the remaining $1.0 million was transferred to the amended subordinated credit agreement with the affiliated entity of the distribution partner. As of December 31, 2020, none of the notes receivable balance related to the amended term loan was outstanding. As of December 31, 2019, $1.0 million of the note receivable balance related to the term loan was included in other current assets in our consolidated balance sheets and $2.0 million of the note receivable balance was included in other assets in our consolidated balance sheets.\nThe amended subordinated credit agreement with the affiliated entity of the distribution partner matures on September 9, 2025 and interest on the outstanding principal balance accrues at a rate of 9.0% per annum and is payable in kind. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, $4.2 million and $3.0 million of the notes receivable balance related to the subordinated credit agreement was included in other assets in our consolidated balance sheets, respectively.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, we recognized $2.4 million, $1.9 million and $1.3 million of revenue from the distribution partners associated with these loans, respectively.\nLoan to and Investment in a Hardware Supplier\nIn October 2018, we entered into a subordinate convertible promissory note with one of our hardware suppliers, or the October 2018 Promissory Note, which was subsequently amended. In March 2019, we entered into a separate secured promissory note with the same hardware supplier, which, together with the October 2018 Promissory Note, we refer to as the Promissory Notes. Under the Promissory Notes, we agreed to provide the hardware supplier loans of up to $7.4 million, collateralized by all assets owned by the supplier.\nALARM.COM HOLDINGS, INC.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements - (Continued)\nDecember 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018\nIn March 2019, we also purchased and acquired a secured promissory note, or the Acquired Promissory Note, that matured on March 30, 2019 and was originally executed between our hardware supplier and another third-party secured creditor. The Acquired Promissory Note had an outstanding balance of $26.6 million as of December 31, 2018, including interest. We paid $16.4 million to the third-party secured creditor in exchange for all of the rights associated with the Acquired Promissory Note, including a security interest and a right to enforce that interest against all assets owned by the hardware supplier. We also paid an additional $6.0 million to the third-party secured creditor in September 2019 based on the outcome of certain contingencies measured as of May 4, 2019. The fair value of the Acquired Promissory Note at the date of purchase was $22.4 million, which represented the initial cash consideration paid in March 2019 and the contingent consideration paid in September 2019.\nOn June 24, 2019, we received a payment of $7.4 million from the supplier for the partial satisfaction of amounts due under the Promissory Notes and the Acquired Promissory Note. On July 15, 2019, we received an additional payment of $25.0 million from the supplier and converted the remaining $5.6 million outstanding notes receivable balance into 9,520,832 shares of Series B preferred stock in the hardware supplier. We concluded that the $5.6 million equity investment, which is included in the Alarm.com segment, does not meet the criteria for consolidation and will be accounted for using the measurement alternative. Under the alternative, we measure investments without readily determinable fair values at cost, less impairment, adjusted for observable price changes from orderly transactions for identical or similar investments. As a result of the payments received, we reversed the $3.3 million reserve related to the October 2018 Promissory Note that was previously recorded during the three months ended December 31, 2018. The reversal of the reserve was recorded as a reduction to general and administrative expense in our consolidated statements of operations during the three months ended June 30, 2019.\nAs a result of the $25.0 million payment received and conversion of the $5.6 million outstanding notes receivable balance into an equity investment on July 15, 2019, we recorded interest of $1.7 million within interest income and a gain of $6.9 million within other income, net, in our consolidated statements of operations during the year ended December 31, 2019, related to the Promissory Notes and the Acquired Promissory Note.\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, there was no remaining outstanding balance of the Promissory Notes and the Acquired Promissory Note. The total equity investment in the hardware supplier was $5.6 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nLoan to a Service Provider Partner\nIn July 2020, we entered into a loan agreement with a service provider partner, under which we agreed to loan the service provider partner up to $2.5 million, collateralized by the assets of the service provider partner. Interest on the outstanding principal accrues at a rate per annum equal to 9.0% and monthly interest and principal payments are required beginning in February 2021. The maturity date of the loan is July 24, 2025. As of December 31, 2020, $1.2 million of principal was outstanding from the service provider partner under the loan agreement.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, we recognized $0.1 million, less than $0.1 million and less than $0.1 million of revenue from the distribution partner associated with these loans, respectively.\nInvestment in a Platform Partner\nIn 2013, we paid $3.5 million in cash to purchase 3,548,820 Series A convertible preferred shares from one of our platform partners. In 2014, we entered into a Series 1 Preferred Stock purchase agreement with the platform partner and another investor. The other investor purchased shares of the platform partner\u2019s Series 1 Preferred Stock. As a result of the purchase, our 3,548,820 shares of Series A convertible preferred shares converted into 3,548,820 shares of common stock.\nBased upon the level of equity investment at risk, the platform partner is a variable interest entity, or VIE. We are not the primary beneficiary of the platform partner VIE because we do not direct the activities of the platform partner that most significantly impact its economic performance. We account for the equity investment in the platform partner using the measurement alternative.\nOn July 31, 2020, the platform partner was acquired by an unrelated third party and, as a result of the sale, we received proceeds of $25.7 million in exchange for our shares of common stock. As a result of the sale, we recorded a gain of $24.7 million within other income, net, in our consolidated statements of operations during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nAs of December 31, 2020, our investment in the platform partner was zero and as of December 31, 2019, our investment in the platform partner was $1.0 million and was included in other assets in our consolidated balance sheets.\nInvestment in a Technology Partner\nIn December 2016, we paid $0.3 million for a convertible promissory note with a technology partner. In April 2018, the $0.3 million convertible promissory note converted into 135,135 shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock. At the time of conversion, we\nALARM.COM HOLDINGS, INC.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements - (Continued)\nDecember 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018\ndetermined there was no value related to the Series A-1 Preferred Stock. Based on observable price changes from orderly transactions for similar investments, we increased the amount of our investment by $0.7 million and recorded a gain within other income, net, in our consolidated statements of operations during the year ended December 31, 2020. Our investment in the technology partner was $0.7 million and zero as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nSubsequent to December 31, 2020, in February 2021, we paid $5.0 million in cash to purchase 1,000,000 shares of Series B-2 Preferred Stock from the same technology partner as part of a financing round that included other investors.\nAllowance for Credit Losses - Notes Receivable\nThe changes in our allowance for credit losses for notes receivable are as follows (in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31, 2020\nLoan\nReceivables Hardware\nFinancing\nReceivables\nBeginning of period balance $ - $ (16)\nImpact of adopting Topic 326 (434) (15)\nRecovery of / (provision for) expected credit losses 360 (1)\nWrite-offs 1 16\nEnd of period balance $ (73) $ (16)\nWe manage our notes receivables using delinquency as a key credit quality indicator.

Our money market assets are valued using quoted prices in active markets.\nThe contingent consideration liability consisted of the potential earn-out payment related to our acquisition of 85% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of OpenEye on October 21, 2019. The earn-out payment was contingent on the satisfaction of certain calendar 2020 revenue targets and had a maximum potential payment of up to $11.0 million. During parts of 2019 and 2020, we accounted for the contingent consideration using fair value and established a liability for the future earn-out payment based on an estimation of revenue attributable to perpetual licenses and subscription licenses over the 2020 calendar year. The contingent consideration liability was valued with significant unobservable inputs, including the revenue volatility and the discount rate. Selecting another revenue volatility or discount rate within an acceptable range would not have resulted in a significant change to the fair value of the contingent consideration liability. As of October 21, 2019, the fair value of the liability was $2.8 million. At each reporting date until December 31, 2020, we remeasured the liability, using the same valuation approach. Changes in the fair value resulting from information that existed subsequent to the acquisition date were recorded in general and administrative expense in our consolidated statements of operations. As of December 31, 2020, the 2020 revenue targets were not met and the fair value of the contingent consideration related to the potential earn-out payment decreased to zero as compared to the initial liability recorded at the acquisition date, primarily due to OpenEye's 2020 actual revenue being less than the projected revenue.\nThe contingent consideration liability was included in other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2019 (see Note 13).\nWe monitor the availability of observable market data to assess the appropriate classification of financial instruments within the fair value hierarchy. Changes in economic conditions or model-based valuation techniques may require the transfer of financial instruments from one fair value level to another. There were no transfers in or out of Level 3 during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. We also monitor the value of the investments for other-than-temporary impairment on a quarterly basis. No other-than-temporary impairments occurred during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.\nNote 11. Leases\nWe lease office space, data centers and office equipment under non-cancelable operating leases with various expiration dates through 2026. In August 2014, we signed a lease for office space in Tysons, Virginia, where we relocated our headquarters to in February 2016. We have subsequently entered into amendments to this lease to provide us with additional office space. In March 2020, we entered into an amendment to the lease for our corporate headquarters, which provides for additional office space, additional parking spaces and additional tenant improvement allowance. In December 2020, we entered into an amendment to the lease for our corporate headquarters to extend the lease term for additional storage space. The lease term ends in 2026, includes a five-year renewal option and a cumulative tenant improvement allowance of $11.8 million, including the $0.7 million tenant improvement allowance within the March 2020 lease amendment.\nALARM.COM HOLDINGS, INC.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements - (Continued)\nDecember 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018\nSupplemental information related to leases is presented in the table below (in thousands, except weighted-average term and discount rate):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2019\nOperating lease cost $ 8,888 $ 7,600\nCash paid for amounts included in the measurement of operating lease liabilities 10,177 8,268\nOperating lease right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for new operating lease liabilities 10,073 7,886\nDecember 31,\n2020 December 31, 2019\nWeighted-average remaining lease term - operating leases 4.9 years 5.7 years\nWeighted-average discount rate - operating leases 3.6 % 4.0 %\nMaturities of lease liabilities are as follows (in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31, Operating Leases(1)\n2021 $ 11,485\n2022 10,460\n2023 9,648\n2024 8,494\n2025 7,539\n2026 and thereafter 4,443\nTotal lease payments 52,069\nLess: imputed interest(2)\n4,399\nPresent value of lease liabilities $ 47,670\n_______________\n(1)Operating lease payments exclude $0.1 million of legally binding minimum lease payments for leases executed but not yet commenced and includes $1.0 million for options to extend lease terms that were reasonably certain of being exercised.\n(2)Imputed interest was calculated using the incremental borrowing rate applicable for each lease.\nPrior to our adoption of Topic 842, rent expense was $6.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.

Debt, Commitments and Contingencies\nThe debt, commitments and contingencies described below would require us, or our subsidiaries, to make payments to third parties under certain circumstances.\nDebt\nOn October 6, 2017, we entered into a $125.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility, or the 2017 Facility, with Silicon Valley Bank, or SVB, as administrative agent, PNC Bank, National Association, as documentation agent, and a syndicate of lenders. Upon entry into the 2017 Facility, we borrowed $72.0 million, which was used to repay the previously outstanding balance under our previous credit facility. The 2017 Facility was set to mature in October 2022 and included an option to further increase the borrowing capacity to $175.0 million with the consent of the lenders. Costs incurred in connection with the 2017 Facility were capitalized and were being amortized as interest expense over the term of the 2017 Facility. The 2017 Facility was secured by substantially all of our assets, including our intellectual property. On March 25, 2020, we borrowed $50.0 million under the 2017 Facility as a precautionary measure in order to provide financial flexibility in light of current uncertainty in the financial markets resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. During the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, we repaid $3.0 million, $4.0 million, and $4.0 million of the outstanding balance of the 2017 Facility, respectively. See Note 22 for further details on the repayment of all outstanding borrowings under, and the termination of, the 2017 Facility subsequent to December 31, 2020.\nThe outstanding principal balance on the 2017 Facility accrued interest at a rate equal to, at our option, either (1) LIBOR, plus an applicable margin based on our consolidated leverage ratio, or (2) the highest of (a) the Wall Street Journal prime rate, (b) the Federal Funds rate plus 0.50%, or (c) LIBOR plus 1.00% plus an applicable margin based on our consolidated leverage ratio. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we elected for the outstanding principal balance to accrue interest at LIBOR plus 1.50%, LIBOR plus 1.75%, LIBOR plus 2.00%, and LIBOR plus 2.50% when our consolidated leverage ratio is less than 1.00:1.00, greater than or equal to 1.00:1.00 but less than 2.00:1.00, greater than or equal to 2.00:1.00 but less than 3.00:1.00 and greater than or equal to 3.00:1.00, respectively. The 2017 Facility also carried an unused line commitment fee of 0.20%. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the effective interest rate on the credit facilities was 2.65%, 4.45% and 4.13%, respectively.\nThe carrying value of the 2017 Facility was $110.0 million and $63.0 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The 2017 Facility included a variable interest rate that approximated market rates and, as such, we classified the liability as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy and determined that the carrying amount of the 2017 Facility approximated its fair value as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. The 2017 Facility contained various financial and other covenants that required us to maintain a maximum consolidated leverage ratio not to exceed 3.25:1.00 and a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 1.25:1.00. As of December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with all financial and non-financial covenants and there were no events of default.\nALARM.COM HOLDINGS, INC.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements - (Continued)\nDecember 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018\nOn November 30, 2018, we amended the 2017 Facility to incorporate the parameters that were required to be met for us to repurchase our outstanding common stock under the stock repurchase program authorized by our board of directors on November 29, 2018 (see Note 14).\nCommitments and Contingencies\nContingent Consideration\nOn October 21, 2019, we acquired 85% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of OpenEye. Certain stockholders of OpenEye had the right to receive an earn-out payment of up to an additional $11.0 million based upon satisfaction of certain calendar 2020 revenue targets. At October 21, 2019, the fair value of the contingent consideration liability was $2.8 million. At each reporting date until December 31, 2020, we remeasured the liability, using the same valuation approach. Changes in the fair value resulting from information that existed subsequent to the acquisition date are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations. As of December 31, 2020, the 2020 revenue targets were not met and the fair value of the contingent consideration related to the potential earn-out payment decreased to zero as compared to the initial liability recorded at the acquisition date, primarily due to OpenEye's 2020 actual revenue being less than the projected revenue. The contingent consideration liability was included in other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2019 (see Note 10).\nIndemnification Agreements\nWe have various agreements that may obligate us to indemnify the other party to the agreement with respect to certain matters. Generally, these indemnification provisions are included in contracts arising in the normal course of business. Although we cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments that may become due under these indemnification agreements, we do not believe any potential liability that might arise from such indemnity provisions is probable or material.\nLetters of Credit\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had no outstanding letters of credit under the 2017 Facility.\nLegal Proceedings\nOn June 2, 2015, Vivint, Inc., or Vivint, filed a lawsuit against us in U.S. District Court, District of Utah, alleging that our technology directly and indirectly infringes six patents that Vivint purchased. Vivint is seeking permanent injunctions, enhanced damages and attorneys' fees. We answered the complaint on July 23, 2015. Among other things, we asserted defenses based on non-infringement and invalidity of the patents in question. On August 19, 2016, the U.S. District Court, District of Utah stayed the litigation pending inter partes review by the U.S. Patent Trial and Appeal Board, or PTAB, of five of the patents in suit. In March 2017, the PTAB issued final written decisions relating to two patents finding all challenged claims unpatentable. In May 2017, the PTAB issued final written decisions relating to the remaining three patents that found certain claims unpatentable, while certain other claims were not found to be unpatentable. Vivint appealed the decisions to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, or the Federal Circuit, and we cross-appealed. In July 2018, the Federal Circuit issued orders affirming the PTAB\u2019s March 2017 decisions that invalidated all challenged claims of two patents. The U.S. District Court, District of Utah lifted the stay on the litigation on June 26, 2017, with Vivint proceeding with its case on four of the six patents in its complaint. No trial date has been set. In September 2017, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or PTO, ordered ex parte reexaminations of certain claims of two of the remaining patents in suit, at our request. On October 30, 2018 and November 5, 2018, the PTO issued final office actions in the pending reexaminations rejecting all claims being examined as unpatentable over the prior art. Nine claims asserted in the litigation were found unpatentable in the PTO rejections. Vivint appealed these rejections to the PTAB on March 29, 2019 and April 4, 2019. The PTAB issued decisions affirming the rejections on February 28, 2020 and May 4, 2020. Vivint appealed one of these decisions to the Federal Circuit on July 1, 2020, and requested rehearing from the PTAB on the other decision. On December 20, 2018, the Federal Circuit issued an order regarding the inter partes review of three of the remaining patents in suit that vacated, reversed and remanded the PTAB\u2019s ruling with regard to the construction of a term (\u201ccommunication device identification code\u201d) as requested by Alarm.com and affirmed the PTAB\u2019s May 2017 rulings invalidating certain of the Vivint patents in all other respects. On July 24, 2019, the PTAB issued further decisions with respect to two of the remaining patents in suit, finding additional claims unpatentable in view of the Federal Circuit\u2019s December 20, 2018 decision. One of the claims asserted in the litigation was found unpatentable in the July 14, 2019 decisions. Vivint appealed the July 24, 2019 decisions to the Federal Circuit on September 25, 2019. The appeal has been fully briefed and is now pending decision. On February 12, 2021, we filed an action in U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Virginia challenging the refusal by the PTO to proceed with additional reexaminations of the remaining patent claims asserted in the lawsuit. The PTO has not yet responded to the complaint.\nShould Vivint prevail in proving Alarm.com infringes one or more of its patent claims, we could be required to pay damages of Vivint\u2019s lost profits and/or a reasonable royalty for sales of our solution. Since all remaining patent claims in the litigation have expired, Vivint shall not be entitled to injunctive relief as a remedy in this matter. While we believe we have valid defenses to Vivint\u2019s claims, any of these outcomes could result in a material adverse effect on our business. Based on currently available information, we have determined a loss is not probable or reasonably estimable at this time.\nALARM.COM HOLDINGS, INC.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements - (Continued)\nDecember 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018\nOn October 22, 2019, EcoFactor, Inc., or EcoFactor, filed a complaint with the U.S. International Trade Commission, or ITC, naming Alarm.com Incorporated and Alarm.com Holdings, Inc., among others, as proposed respondents. The complaint alleges that Alarm.com\u2019s smart thermostats infringe three U.S. patents owned by EcoFactor. EcoFactor is seeking a permanent limited exclusion order and permanent cease and desist order. On November 22, 2019, the ITC instituted an investigation into EcoFactor\u2019s allegations naming Alarm.com Incorporated, Alarm.com Holdings, Inc. and others as respondents. We answered the complaint on December 19, 2019. Among other things, we asserted defenses based on non-infringement and invalidity of the patents in question. An evidentiary hearing was held in November 2020. The administrative law judge presiding over the investigation has set August 20, 2021 as the target date for completion of the investigation.\nOn November 11, 2019, EcoFactor filed a lawsuit against us in U.S. District Court, District of Massachusetts, alleging infringement of the same three patents asserted against us in the ITC. EcoFactor is seeking permanent injunctions, enhanced damages and attorneys' fees. On December 26, 2019, the court issued an order staying the lawsuit pending the conclusion of the related ITC investigation.\nOn May 26, 2020, EcoFactor filed a second lawsuit against us in U.S. District Court, District of Massachusetts, alleging Alarm.com\u2019s products and services infringe four additional U.S. patents owned by EcoFactor. EcoFactor is seeking permanent injunctions, enhanced damages and attorneys' fees. On January 19, 2021, the court issued an order staying the lawsuit until May 19, 2021 in light of the related ITC investigation. On February 12, 2021, Alarm.com requested the PTO reexamine the claims of one of the patents asserted in the lawsuit. The request is pending with the PTO.\nShould EcoFactor prevail in the ITC investigation, Alarm.com thermostats manufactured abroad could be excluded from importation into the United States. Should EcoFactor prevail in its district court lawsuits we could be required to pay damages and/or a reasonable royalty for sales of our solution, we could be enjoined from making, using and selling our solution if a license or other right to continue selling such elements is not made available to us, and we could be required to pay ongoing royalties and comply with unfavorable terms if such a license is made available to us. While we believe we have valid defenses to EcoFactor\u2019s claims, the outcome of these legal claims cannot be predicted with certainty and any of these outcomes could result in an adverse effect on our business. Based on currently available information, we have determined a loss is not probable or reasonably estimable at this time.\nOn July 29, 2020, a putative class action was filed against Alarm.com Incorporated d/b/a ICN Acquisition, among other defendants, by Abante Rooter and Plumbing Inc. and Sidney Naiman in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, alleging violations of the TCPA. The complaint sought statutory damages under the TCPA, injunctive relief, and other relief. The matter was resolved in December 2020. On January 27, 2021, the Court entered an order dismissing the case.\nIn addition to the matters described above, we may be required to provide indemnification to certain of our service provider partners for certain claims regarding our solutions. For example, we are incurring costs associated with the indemnification of our service provider ADT, LLC in ongoing patent infringement suits.\nOn July 13, 2016, Applied Capital, Inc., or Applied Capital, filed a lawsuit against ADT, LLC, the ADT Corporation, and Icontrol Networks, Inc. in U.S. District Court, the District of New Mexico. Applied Capital, Inc v. The ADT Corporation et al., D. New Mexico Case No. 1-16-cv-00815. Icontrol was dismissed without prejudice on May 22, 2017. Applied Capital alleges that ADT\u2019s sales of ADT Pulse directly and indirectly infringes U.S. Patent Nos. 8,378,817 and 9,728,082, which were allegedly purchased by Applied Capital. Applied Capital is seeking damages and attorneys\u2019 fees. ADT answered Applied Capital\u2019s amended complaint on July 16, 2018. Among other things, ADT has asserted defenses based on non-infringement and invalidity of the patents-in-suit. On April 5, 2019, Applied Capital filed a lawsuit for breach of contract against Rodney Fox, the inventor of the patents-in-suit, in the Second Judicial District Court, County of Bernalillo in New Mexico State Court (No. D-202-CV-2019-02841). Mr. Fox counterclaimed, alleging that he is the rightful owner of the patents-in-suit. Based on the dispute of ownership, on October 15, 2019, ADT filed a motion to stay in this matter pending its resolution. Applied Capital and Mr. Fox reached settlement and stipulated to dismissal of the New Mexico State Court action on October 31, 2019. Applied Capital filed its Second Amended Complaint on January 27, 2020 and ADT answered, adding a claim of inequitable conduct, on February 10, 2020. The court issued its claim construction order on August 12, 2019, fact discovery closed on November 12, 2019, expert discovery closed on March 9, 2020, and summary judgment and Daubert motions briefing closed on June 3, 2020 and are pending. The pretrial conference is scheduled for March 22, 2021, and trial is set for June 15, 2021.\nOn July 2, 2020, Portus Singapore Pte. Ltd. and Portus Pty. Ltd., or Portus, sued ADT, LLC d/b/a ADT Security Services in U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas. Portus alleges that ADT\u2019s sales of ADT Pulse directly and indirectly infringe U.S. Patent Nos. 8,914,526 and 9,961,097, which were assigned to Portus. Portus is seeking damages and attorneys\u2019 fees. ADT answered the complaint on August 31, 2020. The claim construction hearing is set for June 11, 2021. Trial is scheduled for April 4, 2022.\nShould the plaintiffs prevail on the claims that one or more elements of ADT\u2019s products infringe, we could be required to indemnify ADT for damages in the form of a reasonable royalty or ADT could be enjoined from making, using and selling our solution if a license or other right to continue selling our technology is not made available to us or we are unable to design\nALARM.COM HOLDINGS, INC.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements - (Continued)\nDecember 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018\naround such patents, and required to pay ongoing royalties and comply with unfavorable terms if such a license is made available to us. The outcome of these legal claims cannot be predicted with certainty. We believe there are valid defenses to the claims made by Applied Capital and Portus. Based on currently available information, we have determined a loss is not probable or reasonably estimable at this time.\nWe may also be a party to litigation and subject to claims incident to the ordinary course of business. Although the results of litigation and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, we currently believe that the final outcome of these ordinary course matters will not have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOther than the preceding matters, we are not a party to any lawsuit or proceeding that, in the opinion of management, is reasonably possible or probable of having a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. We reserve for contingent liabilities based on ASC 450, \"Contingencies,\" when it is determined that a liability, inclusive of defense costs, is probable and reasonably estimable. Litigation is subject to many factors that are difficult to predict, so there can be no assurance that, in the event of a material unfavorable result in one or more claims, we will not incur material costs.\nNote 14. Stockholders' Equity\nAuthorized shares\nWe are authorized to issue two classes of stock, common stock and preferred stock. On June 9, 2015, the board of directors amended and restated our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, effective upon the closing of our IPO on July 1, 2015, and authorized us to issue up to 300,000,000 shares of common stock and 10,000,000 shares of undesignated preferred stock.\nCommon and Preferred Stock\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, there were 49,630,773 and 48,700,963 shares of common stock issued, and 49,483,620 and 48,700,713 shares of common stock outstanding, respectively. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, there were no preferred shares issued and outstanding. Each outstanding share of common stock is entitled to one vote per share.\nStock Repurchase Programs\nOn November 29, 2018, our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program, under which we were authorized to purchase up to an aggregate of $75.0 million of our outstanding common stock during the two-year period ended November 29, 2020. On December 3, 2020, our board of directors authorized another stock repurchase program, under which we are authorized to purchase up to an aggregate of $100.0 million of our outstanding common stock during the three-year period ending December 3, 2023. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we repurchased 147,153 shares of our common stock under the program that expired on November 29, 2020. No shares were purchased under these programs during the years ended 2019 and 2018.\nNote 15. Stock-Based Compensation\nStock-based compensation expense was included in the following line items in the consolidated statements of operations (in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31,\nStock-based compensation expense data: 2020 2019 2018\nSales and marketing $ 3,025 $ 2,075 $ 1,196\nGeneral and administrative 7,996 6,474 4,901\nResearch and development 18,155 12,054 7,332\nTotal stock-based compensation expense $ 29,176 $ 20,603 $ 13,429\nALARM.COM HOLDINGS, INC.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements - (Continued)\nDecember 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018\nThe following table summarizes the components of non-cash stock-based compensation expense (in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2019 2018\nStock options and assumed options $ 3,406 $ 3,783 $ 3,511\nRestricted stock units 25,605 16,627 9,770\nRestricted stock awards - - 1\nEmployee stock purchase plan 165 193 147\nTotal stock-based compensation expense $ 29,176 $ 20,603 $ 13,429\nTax windfall benefit from stock-based awards $ 8,202 $ 5,154 $ 7,581\n2015 Equity Incentive Plan\nWe issue stock options pursuant to our 2015 Plan. The 2015 Plan allows for the grant of stock options to employees and for the grant of nonqualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock awards, restricted stock unit awards, or RSUs, performance-based stock awards, and other forms of equity compensation to our employees, directors and non-employee directors and consultants.\nIn June 2015, our board of directors adopted and our stockholders approved our 2015 Plan pursuant to which we initially reserved a total of 4,700,000 shares of common stock for issuance under the 2015 Plan, which included shares of our common stock previously reserved for issuance under our Amended and Restated 2009 Stock Incentive Plan, or the 2009 Plan. The number of shares of common stock reserved for issuance under the 2015 Plan will automatically increase on January 1 each year, for a period of not more than ten years, commencing on January 1, 2016 through January 1, 2024, by 5.0% of the total number of shares of common stock outstanding on December 31 of the preceding calendar year, or a lesser number of shares as may be determined by the board of directors. As a result of the adoption of the 2015 Plan, no further grants may be made under the 2009 Plan. As of December 31, 2020, 5,887,965 shares remained available for future grant under the 2015 Plan. In December 2020, our board of directors determined that the January 1, 2021 increase in the number of shares reserved for issuance under the 2015 Plan would be 2.5% of the total number of shares of common stock outstanding on December 31, 2020, or 1,237,090 shares. There was no increase to the number of shares of common stock reserved for issuance under the 2015 Plan in the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.\nStock Options\nStock options under the 2015 Plan have been granted at exercise prices based on the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant. Stock options under the 2009 Plan were granted at exercise prices as determined by the board of directors to be the fair market value of our common stock. Our stock options generally vest over a five-year period and each option, if not exercised or forfeited, expires on the tenth anniversary of the grant date.\nCertain stock options granted under the 2015 Plan and previously granted under the 2009 Plan may be exercised before the options have vested. Unvested shares issued as a result of early exercise are subject to repurchase by us upon termination of employment or services at the original exercise price. The proceeds from the early exercise of stock options are initially recorded as a current liability and are reclassified to common stock and additional paid-in capital as the awards vest and our repurchase right lapses. There were zero and 250 unvested shares of common stock outstanding subject to our right of repurchase as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We repurchased zero and 27 of these unvested shares of common stock related to early exercised stock options in connection with employee terminations during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We recorded zero and less than $0.1 million in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets for the proceeds from the early exercise of the unvested stock options as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nWe account for stock-based compensation options based on the fair value of the award as of the grant date. We recognize stock-based compensation expense using the accelerated attribution method, net of actual forfeitures, in which compensation cost for each vesting tranche in an award is recognized ratably from the service inception date to the vesting date for that tranche.\nWe value our stock options using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, which requires the input of subjective assumptions, including the risk-free interest rate, expected term, expected stock price volatility and dividend yield. The risk-free interest rate assumption is based upon observed interest rates for constant maturity U.S. Treasury securities consistent with the expected term of our stock options. The expected term represents the period of time the stock options are expected to be outstanding and is based on the \"simplified method.\" Under the \"simplified method,\" the expected term of an option is presumed to be the mid-point between the vesting date and the end of the contractual term. We use the \"simplified method\" due to the lack\nALARM.COM HOLDINGS, INC.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements - (Continued)\nDecember 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018\nof sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to otherwise estimate the expected term of the stock options. Beginning in November 2019, the expected volatility for options granted is based on historical volatilities of our stock over the estimated expected term of the stock options. The expected volatility for options granted prior to November 2019 was based on historical volatilities of our stock and publicly traded stock of comparable companies over the estimated expected term of the stock options.\nThere were 143,650, 186,500 and 219,450 stock options granted during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. We declared and paid dividends in June 2015 in anticipation of our IPO, which we closed on July 1, 2015. Subsequent to the IPO, we do not expect to declare or pay dividends on a recurring basis. As such, we assume that the dividend rate is 0%.\nThe following table summarizes the assumptions used for estimating the fair value of stock options granted:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2019 2018\nVolatility 39.2 - 42.3%\n39.6 - 42.2%\n41.9 - 60.8%\nExpected term 6.2 - 6.7 years\n6.3 - 7.5 years\n6.3 years\nRisk-free interest rate 0.4 - 1.8%\n1.4 - 2.5%\n2.3 - 3.0%\nDividend rate - % - % - %\nThe following table summarizes stock option activity:\nNumber of\nOptions Weighted\nAverage Exercise\nPrice Per Share Weighted Average\nRemaining\nContractual Life\n(in years) Aggregate\nIntrinsic Value\n(in thousands)\nOutstanding as of December 31, 2019 1,905,751 $ 20.60 6.0 $ 45,344\nGranted 143,650 40.89\nExercised (696,154) 14.70 33,423\nForfeited (8,403) 34.55\nExpired (1,365) 6.65\nOutstanding as of December 31, 2020 1,343,479 $ 25.75 5.7 $ 104,388\nVested and expected to vest as of December 31, 2020 1,343,479 $ 25.75 5.7 $ 104,388\nExercisable as of December 31, 2020 878,901 $ 16.54 4.6 $ 76,382\nThe weighted average grant date fair value for our stock options granted during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $16.79, $25.01 and $19.43, respectively. The total fair value of stock options vested during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $3.6 million, $3.4 million and $3.5 million, respectively. The aggregate intrinsic value of stock options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $33.4 million, $15.1 million and $32.7 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, the total compensation cost related to nonvested awards not yet recognized was $4.1 million, which will be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.5 years. Cash received from exercises of stock options was $10.2 million, $2.5 million and $5.2 million during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nStock Options Assumed from Acquisition\nOn March 8, 2017, we acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of the Connect line of business and all of the outstanding equity interests of the two subsidiaries through which Icontrol Networks, Inc., or Icontrol, conducted its Piper line of business, or the Acquisition, and assumed the Icontrol 2013 Equity Incentive Plan and Icontrol 2003 Stock Plan, or collectively, the Icontrol Plans. The assumed unvested stock options are exercisable for 70,406 shares of Alarm.com common stock. On March 15, 2017, we filed a Form S-8 Registration Statement related to the Acquisition. The registration also covers an additional 2,308,615 shares of common stock that were automatically added to the shares authorized for issuance under the 2015 Plan pursuant to an evergreen provision contained in the 2015 Plan and an additional 461,723 shares of common stock that were automatically added to the shares authorized for issuance under the 2015 ESPP, pursuant to an evergreen provision contained in the 2015 ESPP.\nIn accordance with the terms of the asset purchase agreement, we were obligated to assume the Icontrol Plans, and converted the 2,001,387 unvested employee stock options into 70,406 Alarm.com stock options using a conversion ratio stated\nALARM.COM HOLDINGS, INC.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements - (Continued)\nDecember 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018\nin the agreement to convert the original exercise price and number of options. The fair value of the unvested stock options on the date of the Acquisition was $1.7 million calculated using a Black-Scholes model with a volatility and risk-free interest rate over the expected term of the options and the closing price of the Alarm.com common stock on the date of acquisition. We applied our graded vesting accounting policy to the fair value of these assumed options and determined $1.4 million of the fair value was attributable to pre-combination services and was included as a component of total purchase consideration. The remaining $0.3 million of the fair value was determined to be attributable to post-combination services and will be recognized over the remaining service periods of the stock options.\nThe following table summarizes the assumptions used for estimating the fair value of stock options assumed from the Connect business unit of Icontrol:\nYear Ended December 31,\nVolatility 42.7 - 44.4%\nExpected term 2.5 - 5.0 years\nRisk-free interest rate 1.4 - 2.0%\nDividend rate - %\nThe following table summarizes the assumed stock option activity:\nNumber of\nOptions Weighted\nAverage Exercise\nPrice Per Share Weighted Average\nRemaining\nContractual Life\n(in years) Aggregate\nIntrinsic Value\n(in thousands)\nOutstanding as of December 31, 2019 15,805 $ 7.26 5.7 $ 564\nExercised (8,172) 8.35 391\nOutstanding as of December 31, 2020 7,633 $ 6.09 4.6 $ 743\nVested and expected to vest as of December 31, 2020 7,633 $ 6.09 4.6 $ 743\nExercisable as of December 31, 2020 7,633 $ 6.09 4.6 $ 743\nThe weighted average grant date fair value for the assumed stock options granted during the year ended December 31, 2017 was $4.78. There were no new grants under the assumed Icontrol Plans in 2020, 2019 and 2018. The total fair value of assumed stock options vested during the year ended December 31, 2020 was less than $0.1 million. The total fair value of assumed stock options vested during each of the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 was $0.1 million. The aggregate intrinsic value of assumed stock options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $0.4 million, $0.3 million and $0.7 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, there were no compensation costs related to the nonvested awards not yet recognized. Cash received from exercises of stock options was less than $0.1 million, less than $0.1 million and $0.1 million during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nRestricted Stock Units\nThere was an aggregate of 564,416, 827,764 and 381,545 RSUs granted to certain of our employees during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The time-based RSUs vest over a five-year period from the vesting commencement date, which is generally the grant date. The performance-based RSUs vest when the related performance conditions are met. We account for RSUs based on the fair value of the award as of the grant date. We recognize stock-based compensation expense for time-based RSUs using the accelerated attribution method, net of actual forfeitures, in which compensation cost for each vesting tranche in an award is recognized ratably from the grant date to the vesting date for that tranche. The condition for vesting of the RSUs is based on continued employment. We recognize stock-based compensation expense for performance-based RSUs based on management\u2019s determination of the probable outcome of the performance conditions and we record a cumulative adjustment in periods in which there is a change in the estimated number of shares expected to vest. As of December 31, 2020, the total unrecognized compensation expense related to RSU awards granted amounted to $45.1 million, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.5 years.\nALARM.COM HOLDINGS, INC.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements - (Continued)\nDecember 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018\nThe following table summarizes RSU activity:\nNumber of\nRSUs Weighted\nAverage Grant Date Fair Value Aggregate\nIntrinsic Value\n(in thousands)\nOutstanding as of December 31, 2019 1,386,488 $ 46.52 $ 59,577\nGranted 564,416 51.34\nVested (195,551) 46.19 11,008\nForfeited (58,713) 48.89\nOutstanding as of December 31, 2020 1,696,640 $ 48.08 $ 175,517\nVested and expected to vest as of December 31, 2020 1,696,640 $ 48.08 $ 175,517\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan\nOur board of directors adopted our 2015 ESPP in June 2015. As of December 31, 2020, 1,974,251 shares have been reserved for future grant under the 2015 ESPP, with provisions established to increase the number of shares available on January 1 of each subsequent year for nine years. The annual automatic increase in the number of shares available for issuance under the 2015 ESPP is the lesser of 1% of each class of common stock outstanding as of December 31 of the preceding fiscal year, 1,500,000 shares of common stock, or such lesser number as determined by the board of directors. There was no increase to the number of shares of common stock reserved for issuance under the 2015 ESPP in any of 2018, 2019 or 2020 nor will the number of shares be increased in 2021. The 2015 ESPP allows eligible employees to purchase shares of our common stock at 90% of the fair market value, rounded up to the nearest cent, based on the closing price of our common stock on the purchase date. The maximum number of shares of our common stock that a participant may purchase during any calendar year shall not exceed such number of shares having a fair market value equal to the lesser of $15,000 or 10% of the participant's base compensation for that year.\nThe 2015 ESPP is considered compensatory for purposes of share-based compensation expense due to the 10% discount on the fair market value of the common stock. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, an aggregate of 29,933, 26,811 and 29,131 shares were purchased by employees for which we recognized $0.2 million, $0.2 million and $0.1 million of compensation expense, respectively. Compensation expense is recognized for the amount of the discount, net of actual forfeitures and voluntary withdrawals, over the six-month purchase period.\nNote 16.

Unvested shares have a non-forfeitable right to dividends. Unvested shares issued as a result of early exercise are subject to repurchase by us upon termination of employment or services at the original exercise price. The common stock subject to repurchase is no longer classified as participating securities when shares revert to common stock outstanding as the awards vest and our repurchase right lapses.\nOur redeemable noncontrolling interest relates to our 85% equity ownership interest in OpenEye. The OpenEye stockholder agreement contains a put option that gives the minority OpenEye stockholders the right to sell their OpenEye shares to us based on the fair value of the shares. The OpenEye stockholder agreement also contains a call option that gives us the right to purchase the remaining OpenEye shares from the minority OpenEye stockholders based on the fair value of the shares. The put and call options can each be exercised beginning in the first quarter of 2023. This redeemable noncontrolling interest is considered temporary equity and we report it between liabilities and stockholders\u2019 equity in the consolidated balance sheets. The amount of the net income or loss attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interests is recorded in the consolidated statements of operations.\nNote 17. Significant Service Providers\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, our 10 largest revenue service provider partners accounted for 48%, 52% and 57% of our consolidated revenue. One of our service provider partners within the Alarm.com segment individually represented greater than 15% but not more than 20% of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.\nTwo service provider partners in the Alarm.com segment represented more than 10% of accounts receivable as of December 31, 2020.

Our effective tax rates were below the statutory rate primarily due to research and development tax credits claimed, tax windfall benefits from employee stock-based payment transactions and foreign derived intangible income deductions, partially offset by the impact of state taxes and valuation allowances recorded against state research and development tax credit carryforwards.\nWe recognize a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of available evidence, both positive and negative, it is more likely than not that some portion, or all, of net deferred tax assets will not be realized. Due to the uncertainty of realization of certain deferred tax assets acquired in 2017 related to our Canadian net operating losses and research and development tax credits totaling $0.3 million, we established a valuation allowance of $0.3 million during the second quarter of 2019, which remained at $0.3 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. During 2020, we established a valuation allowance of $1.3 million for state research and development tax credit carryforwards.\nWe apply guidance for uncertainty in income taxes that requires the application of a more likely than not threshold to the recognition and de-recognition of uncertain tax positions. If the recognition threshold is met, this guidance permits us to recognize a tax benefit measured at the largest amount of the tax benefit that, in our judgment, is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement. We recorded an increase to the unrecognized tax benefits of $1.1 million, $0.6 million and $0.8 million primarily for research and development tax credits claimed during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we accrued $0.1 million and $0.2 million of total interest related to unrecognized tax benefits, respectively. We recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.\nWe are not aware of any events that make it reasonably possible that there would be a significant change in our unrecognized tax benefits over the next twelve months. Our cumulative liability for uncertain tax positions was $4.2 million and $3.1 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and if recognized, would reduce our income tax expense and the effective tax rate.\nWe file income tax returns in the United States and Canada. We are no longer subject to U.S. income tax examinations for years prior to 2017, with the exception that operating loss carryforwards generated prior to 2017 may be subject to tax audit adjustment. We are generally no longer subject to state and local income tax examinations by tax authorities for years prior to 2017.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of $4.6 million, which are scheduled to begin to expire in 2030. As of December 31, 2020, we had state net operating loss carryforwards of $1.6 million, which are scheduled to begin to expire in 2034. As of December 31, 2020, we had federal research and development tax credit carryforwards of $2.2 million, on a more likely than not basis, which are scheduled to begin to expire in 2040. As of December 31, 2020, we had state research and development tax credit carryforwards of $4.1 million, on a more likely than not basis, which are scheduled to begin to expire in 2023. The federal net operating loss carryforward arose in connection with the 2013 acquisition of EnergyHub. Utilization of net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to annual limitations due to ownership change limitations as provided by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.\nNote 19. Segment Information\nWe have two reportable segments:\n\u2022Alarm.com segment\nALARM.COM HOLDINGS, INC.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements - (Continued)\nDecember 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018\n\u2022Other segment\nOur chief operating decision maker is our chief executive officer. Management determined the operational data used by the chief operating decision maker is that of the two reportable segments. Management bases strategic goals and decisions on these segments and the data presented below is used to measure financial results.\nOur Alarm.com segment represents our cloud-based and Software platforms for the intelligently connected property and related solutions that contributed 94%, 93% and 93% of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Our Other segment is focused on researching, developing and offering residential and commercial automation solutions and energy management products and services in adjacent markets. Inter-segment revenue includes sales of hardware between our segments.\nManagement evaluates the performance of its segments and allocates resources to them based on operating income / (loss) as compared to prior periods and current performance levels.

There was no software license revenue recorded for the Other segment during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.\nDepreciation and amortization expense was $27.2 million, $22.1 million and $21.4 million for the Alarm.com segment for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Depreciation and amortization expense was $0.3 million, less than $0.1 million and $0.3 million for the Other segment for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

Substantially all our long-lived assets were in North America as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nALARM.COM HOLDINGS, INC.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements - (Continued)\nDecember 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018\nNote 20. Related Party Transactions\nInstallation Partner\nOur installation partner in which we have a 48.2% ownership interest performs installation services for security service providers and also provides installation services for us and certain of our subsidiaries. We account for this investment using the equity method. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, our investment balance in our installation partner was zero. During each of the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, we recorded $0.4 million of cost of hardware and other revenue in connection with this installation partner. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the accounts payable balance to our installation partner was less than $0.1 million.\nAffiliate Lease\nOpenEye leases its production and administration operations facility from a company that is controlled by certain employees of OpenEye, or the Landlord. The one-year lease term expired on October 20, 2020 and was subsequently converted to a month-to-month lease. OpenEye can terminate the lease at any time by providing 30 days' prior written notice and the Landlord can terminate the lease by providing 90 days' prior written notice. Total minimum lease payments over the term of the lease are $0.2 million. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we recorded $0.3 million and less than $0.1 million of rent expense in connection with this lease arrangement. There was no accounts payable balance due to the Landlord under this lease arrangement as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nNote 21. Quarterly Financial Data (unaudited)\nThe following table shows selected unaudited quarterly consolidated statement of operations data for each of our eight most recently completed quarters. In the opinion of management, the information for each of these quarters has been prepared on the same basis as our audited financial statements and include all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments and accruals, necessary for the fair statement of financial information in accordance with GAAP. However, the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted and may continue to disrupt our supply chain for an unknown period of time due to its impact on manufacturing, production and global transportation. The COVID-19 pandemic also disrupted and may intermittently continue to disrupt our sales channels due to restrictions imposed from time to time on our service providers\u2019 ability to meet with residential and commercial property owners who use our solutions. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a global slowdown of economic activity and a recession in the United States and the economic situation remains fluid as parts of the economy appear to be recovering while others continue to struggle. While vaccines have been approved for use in the United States and in many other countries, supplies of the vaccine remain limited and it remains difficult to assess or predict the ultimate duration and economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Historical results are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved in future periods, and operating results for quarterly periods are not necessarily indicative of operating results for a full year, which is increasingly true in periods of extreme uncertainty, such as the uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nInformation about current period and prior period acquisitions that may affect the comparability of the selected financial information presented below is included in Note 7. Information about the $1.7 million of interest recorded within interest income and the $6.9 million of gain recorded within other income, net, during the three months ended September 30, 2019, which relates to the Promissory Notes proceeds and the Acquired Promissory Note proceeds received from one of our hardware suppliers and may affect the comparability of the quarterly financial data presented below, is included in Note 9. Information about the $24.7 million gain on the sale of an investment recorded in other income, net, during the three months ended September 30, 2020, which relates to the sale of an investment in one of our platform partners and may affect the comparability of the quarterly financial data presented below, is included in Note 9.

Subsequent Events\nConvertible Senior Notes\nOn January 20, 2021, we issued $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 0% convertible senior notes due January 15, 2026 in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers, or the 2026 Notes. The terms of the 2026 Notes are governed by an Indenture, or the Indenture, by and between Alarm.com Holdings, Inc. and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee. The 2026 Notes are senior unsecured obligations that do not bear regular interest and the principal amount of the 2026 Notes will not accrete. The 2026 Notes may bear special interest under specified circumstances related to our failure to comply with our reporting obligations under the Indenture. Special interest, if any, will be payable semiannually in arrears on January 15 and July 15 of each year, beginning on July 15, 2021. We received proceeds from the issuance of the 2026 Notes of $484.3 million, net of $15.7 million of transaction fees and other debt issuance costs.\nWe may not redeem the 2026 Notes prior to January 20, 2024. We may redeem for cash, all or any portion of the 2026 Notes, at our option, on or after January 20, 2024, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2026 Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid special interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date, if the last reported sale price of our common stock has been at least 130% of the conversion price for the 2026 Notes then in effect for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any 30 consecutive trading day period (including the last trading day of such period) ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which we provide notice of redemption. No sinking fund is provided for the 2026 Notes.\nThe 2026 Notes will be convertible at the option of the holders at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding August 15, 2025, only under the following circumstances: (1) during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending on June 30, 2021 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price of our common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price for the 2026 Notes on each applicable trading day; (2) during the five business day period immediately after any ten consecutive trading day period in which, for each trading day of that period, the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of 2026 Notes for such trading day was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of our common stock and the conversion rate for the 2026 Notes on each such trading day; (3) if we call any or all of the 2026 Notes for redemption, at any time prior to the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately preceding the redemption date, but only with respect to the 2026 Notes called (or deemed called) for redemption; or (4) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events as set forth in the Indenture.\nOn or after August 15, 2025, until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date of the 2026 Notes, holders of the 2026 Notes may convert all or any portion of their 2026 Notes at any time, regardless of the foregoing conditions. Upon conversion, we may satisfy our conversion obligation by paying or delivering, as the case may be, cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock, at our election. It is our current intent to settle the principal amount of the 2026 Notes with cash. The initial conversion rate for the 2026 Notes is 6.7939 shares of our common stock per $1,000 principal amount of 2026 Notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of $147.19 per share of our common stock, subject to adjustment under certain circumstances in accordance with the terms of the Indenture. In addition, following certain corporate events that occur prior to the maturity date of the 2026 Notes or if we deliver a notice of redemption in respect of the 2026 Notes, we will, under certain circumstances, increase the conversion rate of the 2026 Notes for a holder who elects to convert its 2026 Notes (or any portion thereof) in connection with such a corporate event or convert its 2026 Notes called (or deemed called) for redemption during the related redemption period (as defined in the Indenture), as the case may be.\nIf we undergo a fundamental change (as defined in the Indenture), subject to certain exceptions and except as described in the Indenture, holders may require us to repurchase for cash all or any portion of their 2026 Notes at a fundamental change repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2026 Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid special interest, if any, to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date.\nThe Indenture includes customary covenants and sets forth certain events of default after which the 2026 Notes may be declared immediately due and payable and sets forth certain types of bankruptcy or insolvency events of default involving us after which the 2026 Notes become automatically due and payable.\nWe used some of the proceeds to repay the $110.0 million outstanding principal balance under our 2017 Facility and also used some of the proceeds to pay accrued interest, fees and expenses related to the 2017 Facility. We terminated the 2017 Facility effective January 20, 2021. We intend to use the remaining net proceeds from the issuance of the 2026 Notes for working capital and other general corporate purposes, which may include acquisitions or strategic investments in complementary businesses or technologies.\nALARM.COM HOLDINGS, INC.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements - (Continued)\nDecember 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018\nSince we expect to settle the principal amount on our outstanding 2026 Notes in cash and any excess in cash or shares of our common stock, we will use the treasury stock method for calculating any potential dilutive effect of the conversion spread on diluted net income per share, if applicable. The conversion spread will have a dilutive impact on diluted net income per share of common stock when the average market price of our common stock for a given period exceeds the conversion price of $147.19 per share for the 2026 Notes.\nSchedule II - Valuation and Qualifying Accounts and Reserves\nAlarm.com Holdings, Inc.\nSchedule II\nValuation and Qualifying Accounts and Reserves\n(In thousands)\nDescription Balance at\nBeginning of\nYear Additions\nCharged\nAgainst\nRevenue Additions\nCharged to\nOther\nAccounts (1)\nDeductions Balance at\nEnd of Year\nYear Ended December 31, 2020\nAllowance for credit losses on accounts receivable $ 2,584 $ - $ 2,530 $ (418) $ 4,696\nAllowance for product returns 1,075 1,795 - (1,390) 1,480\nAllowance for credit losses on notes receivable 16 - 90 (17) 89\nDeferred tax valuation allowance 322 - 1,246 - 1,568\nYear Ended December 31, 2019\nAllowance for credit losses on accounts receivable $ 1,425 $ - $ 1,170 $ (11) $ 2,584\nAllowance for product returns 1,915 (123) 105 (822) 1,075\nAllowance for credit losses on notes receivable 3,319 - (3,272) (31) 16\nDeferred tax valuation allowance - - 322 - 322\nYear Ended December 31, 2018\nAllowance for credit losses on accounts receivable $ 1,449 $ - $ 149 $ (173) $ 1,425\nAllowance for product returns 2,471 273 - (829) 1,915\nAllowance for credit losses on notes receivable - - 3,319 - 3,319\n(1) Includes the 2020 impact of the adoption of Topic 326 of $0.4 million for the allowance for credit losses on accounts receivable and $0.4 million for the allowance for credit losses on note receivable (see Note 2).",

    "item_9A": "ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nWe maintain \"disclosure controls and procedures,\" as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the company\u2019s management, including its chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.\nOur management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2020. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2020, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.\nManagement\u2019s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act. Our management, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020 based on the framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on the results of its evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2020.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, has audited our financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020. The report of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP is incorporated by reference into Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOn December 14, 2020, we acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding ownership interest units of Shooter Detection Systems, LLC, or SDS. In accordance with guidance issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission, management's assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting excluded the internal control activities of SDS, which is included in our December 31, 2020 consolidated financial statements, for which total assets and total revenue of SDS represented less than 1% of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during our most recent fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2020 that have materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nInherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls\nOur management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, believes that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and are effective at the reasonable assurance level. However, our management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in\nachieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.",
