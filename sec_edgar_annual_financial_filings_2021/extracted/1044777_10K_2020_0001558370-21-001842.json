In response to the pandemic, the United States and various foreign, state and local governments have, among other actions, imposed travel and business restrictions and required or advised communities in which we do business to adopt stay-at-home orders and social distancing guidelines, causing many businesses, including retail banking branches, to reduce or suspend operating activities. The pandemic and various governments\u2019 responses have caused significant and widespread uncertainty, volatility and disruptions in the U.S. and global economies, including in the regions in which we operate.\nBeginning in the Summer of 2020 and continuing through the year ended December 31, 2020, we experienced lengthened sales cycles and reduced demand for some of our security solutions due to economic uncertainty connected with the COVID-19 pandemic. The most significant impact of the pandemic on our business has been a sharp drop in demand for our hardware authentication products and delays in the implementation of certain software security solutions.\nAs we cannot predict the duration or scope of the pandemic or its impact on the economy, financial markets and our customers, any negative impact to our results cannot be reasonably estimated, but it could be material. We continue to closely monitor the Company\u2019s financial health and liquidity and the impact of the pandemic on the Company. We are able to serve the needs of our customers while taking steps to protect the health and safety of our employees, customers, partners, and communities. See Part I -",
    "item_1A": "Item 1A - Risk Factors\nYou should carefully consider the following risk factors, which we consider the most significant, as well as other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition, there are a number of less significant and other general risk factors that could affect our future results. If any of the events described in the risk factors were to occur, our business, financial condition or operating results could be materially and adversely affected. We have grouped our Risk Factors under captions that we believe describe various categories of potential risk. For the reader\u2019s convenience, we have not duplicated risk factors that could be considered to be included in more than one category.\nSummary of Risk Factors\nWe are providing the following summary of the risk factors contained in this Form 10-K to enhance the readability and accessibility of our risk factor disclosures. We encourage our stockholders to carefully review the full risk factors contained in this Form 10-K in their entirety for additional information regarding the risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results.\nRisks Related to our Business\n\u25cf While we believe the coronavirus could have a negative impact on our financial results in the future, the impact is difficult to assess at this time.\n\u25cf A significant portion of our sales are to a limited number of customers. The loss of substantial sales to any one of them could have an adverse effect on revenues and profits.\n\u25cf The return of a worldwide recession and/or regional economic downturns may further impact our business.\n\u25cf Disruptions in markets or the European Union may affect our liquidity and capital resources.\n\u25cf We could incur substantial accounting related costs if we are unable to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting.\n\u25cf We have a long operating history, but only modest accumulated profit.\n\u25cf We derive revenue from a limited number of products.\n\u25cf The sales cycle for our products and technology is long, and we may incur substantial expenses for sales that do not occur when anticipated.\n\u25cf We have a great dependence on a limited number of suppliers and the loss of their manufacturing capability could materially impact our operations.\n\u25cf We order some hardware components, such as processors, in advance of expected use and often produce finished goods prior to the receipt of executed customer orders. If orders are not received, we could suffer losses related to inventory that cannot be sold at full value.\n\u25cf Our success depends on establishing and maintaining strategic relationships with other companies to distribute our technology and products and, in some cases, for us to incorporate their technology into our products and our products and services.\n\u25cf We may not be able to maintain effective product distribution channels, which could result in decreased revenue.\n\u25cf We depend on our key personnel for the success of our business and the loss of one or more of our key personnel could have an adverse effect on our ability to manage our business or could be negatively perceived in the capital markets.\n\u25cf If we fail to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel, our business may be harmed.\n\u25cf Changes in our effective tax rate may have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\n\u25cf Our worldwide income tax provisions and other tax accruals may be insufficient if any taxing authorities assume taxing positions that are contrary to our positions.\n\u25cf Changes in global tax laws or in their interpretation or enforcement, could have a material adverse effect on our effective tax rate, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\n\u25cf Acquisitions, divestitures and other strategic transactions present many risks, and failure to realize the financial and strategic goals we anticipate could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\n\u25cf Reported revenue may fluctuate widely due to the interpretation or application of accounting rules.\n\u25cf Provisions in various agreements potentially expose us to substantial liability for intellectual property infringement and other losses.\n\u25cf The evolution of our business requires more complex development and go-to-market strategies, which involve significant risk.\nRisks Related to the Market\n\u25cf We face significant competition and if we lose or fail to gain market share our financial results will suffer.\n\u25cf A decrease of average selling prices for our products and services could adversely affect our business.\n\u25cf We may need additional capital in the future and our failure to obtain capital would interfere with our growth strategy.\n\u25cf We experience variations in quarterly operating results and sales are subject to seasonality, both of which may result in a volatile stock price.\n\u25cf Our stock price may be volatile for reasons other than variations in our quarterly operating results.\n\u25cf Our stock repurchase program could affect the price of our common stock and increase volatility and may be suspended or terminated at any time, which may result in a decrease in the trading price of our common stock\n\u25cf A small group of persons control a substantial amount of our common stock and could delay or prevent a change of control.\n\u25cf Certain provisions of our charter and of Delaware law make a takeover of our Company more difficult.\n\u25cf Future issuances of blank check preferred stock may reduce voting power of common stock and may have anti-takeover effects that could prevent a change in control.\n\u25cf Our business could be adversely affected as a result of actions of activist stockholders.\nRisks Related to Technology and Intellectual Property\n\u25cf Technological changes occur rapidly in our industry and our development of new products is critical to maintain our revenue.\n\u25cf Our business could be negatively impacted by cyber security incidents and other disruptions.\n\u25cf We rely upon Amazon Web Services to operate portions of our platform and any disruption of or interference with our use of Amazon Web Services or other vendors\u2019 material would adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition\n\u25cf Some of our products contain third-party, open-source software and failure to comply with the terms of the underlying open-source software licenses could restrict our ability to sell our products or otherwise result in claims against us.\n\u25cf We must continue to attract and retain highly skilled technical personnel for our research and development efforts.\n\u25cf We cannot be certain that our research and development activities will be successful.\n\u25cf Failure to effectively manage our product and service lifecycles could harm our business.\n\u25cf SaaS offerings, which involve various risks, constitute an important part of our business.\n\u25cf We depend significantly upon our proprietary technology and intellectual property and the loss of or successful challenge to our proprietary rights could require us to divert management attention and could reduce revenue and increase our operating costs.\n\u25cf Our patents may not provide us with competitive advantages.\n\u25cf We are subject to warranty and product liability risks.\n\u25cf There is significant government regulation of technology imports and exports and to the extent we cannot meet the requirements of the regulations we may be prohibited from exporting some of our products, which could negatively impact our revenue.\n\u25cf We employ cryptographic technology in our authentication products that uses complex mathematical formulations.\nRisks Related to International Operations\n\u25cf We face a number of risks associated with our international operations, any or all of which could result in a disruption in our business and a decrease in our revenue.\n\u25cf We are subject to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and risks, and improper management of that risk could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial conditions.\n\u25cf Changes in the European regulatory environment regarding privacy and data protection regulations could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.\n\u25cf We must comply with governmental regulations setting environmental standards.\n\u25cf The vote by the United Kingdom (UK) to leave the European Union (EU) could adversely affect our financial results.\n\u25cf We or our suppliers may be impacted by new regulations related to climate change.\n\u25cf The effects of regulations relating to conflict minerals may adversely affect our business.\n\u25cf U.S. investors may have difficulties in making claims for any breach of their rights as holders of shares because some of our assets and key employees are not located in the United States.\n\u25cf Our business in countries with a history of corruption and transactions with foreign governments increase the risks associated with our international activities.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWhile we believe the coronavirus could have a negative impact on our financial results in the future, the impact is difficult to assess at this time.\nThe effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have materially affected how we and our customers are operating our businesses, and the duration and extent to which this will impact our future results of operations and overall financial performance remains uncertain.\nIn December 2019, a novel coronavirus disease (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) was reported and in January 2020, the World Health Organization (\u201cWHO\u201d) declared it a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. On February 28, 2020, the WHO raised its assessment of the COVID-19 threat from high to very high at a global level due to the continued increase in the number of cases and affected countries, and on March 11, 2020, the WHO characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic. A significant outbreak of epidemic, pandemic, or contagious diseases in the human population could result in a widespread health crisis that could adversely affect the broader economies, financial markets and overall demand environment for our products.\nAs a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we temporarily closed our offices in March 2020 (including our corporate headquarters) in many countries except where we have been able to accommodate limited essential employees such as for the shipping of our hardware authentication tokens under revised procedures. We re-opened a limited number of our offices during the third and fourth quarter of 2020 with limited capacity under revised procedures. We are unable to predict further re-openings or whether the initial re-openings will be successful or remain in place. We implemented certain travel restrictions, remote work arrangements and other measures and while our early experience with this new situation has been satisfactory to date, it has disrupted how we normally operate our business and may in the longer term impact our productivity, innovation and effectiveness such that our results are adversely affected. We have shifted certain of our customer events to virtual-only experiences and we may deem it advisable to similarly alter, postpone or cancel entirely additional customer, employee or industry events in the future. Because we operate in multiple international locations, we expect there to be variability and additional complications from differing conditions and inconsistent guidance from numerous public health agencies.\nIn our hardware business, we are exposed to specific risks related to manufacturing, supply chain, shipping and distribution- all of which have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result of COVID-19, we experienced some delays and increased costs related to fulfilling our hardware orders. Such issues have been primarily resolved however we may be unable to satisfy certain customer orders for our products in the future if orders substantially increase and/or supply chain problems emerge. In addition, the global economic uncertainty associated with the COVID-\n19 pandemic has affected many of our customers and we believe one of those effects has been decreased orders of hardware authentication tokens. We are not able to predict at this time whether and to what extent such orders may return or in what specific quantities. This risk is in addition to the other risks associated with our hardware business as stated elsewhere in \u201cRisk Factors.\u201d\nIn our software business, we experienced some increased sales for products used in remote employee access and electronic signature in 2020 that we attribute in part to the COVID-19 pandemic. This increase may have been temporary, and we are unable to predict whether it will continue or decline. Moreover, the conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic can affect the rate of IT spending, the decision to start new IT projects, the timing of existing projects and the priority our customers place on various projects. While these factors may be positive for some of our software solutions such as electronic signature, these factors may be negative for our other software solutions, such as risk analysis software. The COVID-19 pandemic could adversely affect our customers\u2019 ability or willingness to attend our events or to purchase our offerings, delay prospective customers\u2019 purchasing decisions, adversely impact our ability to provide on-site sales meetings or professional services to our customers, delay the provisioning of our offerings, lengthen payment terms, reduce the value or duration of their contracts, or affect attrition rates, all of which could adversely affect our future sales, operating results and overall financial performance. During the Summer of 2020, we began to experience some of the aforementioned scenarios, and this continued through the remainder of 2020, due to, we believe, global economic uncertainty connected with the continued seriousness of the COVID-19 pandemic. While we hope that the negative consequences on our business associated with the COVID-19 pandemic will subside in 2021, we cannot predict the impact with certainty.\nIf the restrictions on our employees, customers and others in the world continue or increase in order to limit the spread of COVID-19, the potential effects could continue and could be exacerbated, and our results of operations and overall financial performance may be harmed. The duration and extent of the impact from the COVID-19 pandemic depends on future developments that cannot be accurately predicted at this time, such as the severity and transmission rate of the virus, the extent and effectiveness of containment actions and the impact of these and other factors on our employees, customers, partners and vendors. If we are not able to respond to and manage the impact of such events effectively, our business will be harmed.\nA significant portion of our sales are to a limited number of customers. The loss of substantial sales to any one of them could have an adverse effect on revenues and profits.\nWe derive a substantial portion of our revenue from a limited number of customers, many of which are financial institutions. The loss of substantial sales to any one of them could adversely affect our operations and results. In fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018, our top 10 largest customers contributed 21%, 29%, and 24%, respectively, of total worldwide revenue.\nThe return of a worldwide recession and/or regional economic downturns may further impact our business.\nOur business is subject to economic conditions that may fluctuate in the major markets in which we operate. Factors that could cause economic conditions to fluctuate include, without limitation, recession, inflation, deflation, interest rates, unemployment, consumer debt levels, general retail or commercial markets and consumer or business purchasing power or preferences.\nIf global economic and financial market conditions remain uncertain and/or weak for an extended period of time, any of the following factors, among others, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations:\n\u25cf slower consumer or business spending may result in reduced demand for our products and services, reduced orders from customers for our products, order cancellations, lower revenues, increased inventories, and lower gross margins;\n\u25cf continued volatility in the global markets and fluctuations in exchange rates for foreign currencies and contracts or purchase orders in foreign currencies could negatively impact our reported financial results and condition;\n\u25cf continued volatility in the prices for commodities and raw materials we use in our products could have a material adverse effect on our costs, gross margins, and ultimately our profitability;\n\u25cf restructurings, reorganizations, consolidations and other corporate events could affect our customers\u2019 budgets and buying cycles, particularly in the banking industry;\n\u25cf if our customers experience declining revenues, or experience difficulty obtaining financing in the capital and credit markets to purchase our products and services, this could result in reduced orders, order cancellations, inability of customers to timely meet their payment obligations to us, extended payment terms, higher accounts receivable, reduced cash flows, greater expense associated with collection efforts and increased bad debt expense;\n\u25cf in the event of a contraction of our sales, dated inventory may result in a need for increased obsolescence reserves;\n\u25cf a severe financial difficulty experienced by our customers may cause them to become insolvent or cease business operations, which could reduce sales, cash collections and revenue streams.\n\u25cf any difficulty or inability on the part of manufacturers of our products or other participants in our supply chain in obtaining sufficient financing to purchase raw materials or to finance general working capital needs may result in delays or non-delivery of shipments of our products.\nWe are unable to predict potential future economic conditions, disruptions in the sovereign debt markets or other financial markets, regional recessions, or the effect of any such disruption or disruptions on our business and results of operations, but the consequences may be materially adverse. We believe that our business in the Banking market in Europe would be impacted most directly by any such disruption and that the consequences may be materially adverse, as approximately 53% of our consolidated revenues originated in the EMEA region in 2020.\nDisruptions in markets or the European Union may affect our liquidity and capital resources.\nWe believe our financial resources are adequate to meet our operating needs. However, disruptions in the sovereign debt markets or other financial markets, the Euro Monetary Union or the European Union, could materially adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources and expose us to additional currency fluctuation risk. Sufficiently adverse effects could cause us to modify our business plans.\nFurthermore, in an adverse economic environment there is a risk that customers may delay their orders until the economic conditions improve further. If a significant number of orders are delayed for an indefinite period of time, our revenue and cash receipts may not be sufficient to meet the operating needs of the business. If this is the case, we may need to significantly reduce our workforce, sell certain of our assets, enter into strategic relationships or business combinations, discontinue some or all of our operations, or take other similar restructuring actions. While we expect that these actions would result in a reduction of recurring costs, they also may result in a reduction of recurring revenue and cash receipts. It is also likely that we would incur substantial non-recurring costs to implement one or more of these restructuring actions.\nWe could incur substantial accounting related costs if we are unable to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting.\nIn response to the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting disclosed as of December 31, 2018, we expended significant resources to improve our internal control over financial reporting and the\neffectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures. We expended significant resources, including accounting related costs and significant management oversight as we corrected the deficiencies. Management has determined that full remediation of the prior deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting that led to this material weakness occurred, disclosed in Item 9A of the annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019. Investments will continue to be made to improve the control environment.\nWe cannot provide absolute assurance that additional material weaknesses, or significant deficiencies, in our internal controls will not be identified in the future. Failure to maintain effective controls or implement new or improved controls could result in significant deficiencies or material weaknesses, affect management evaluations and auditor attestations regarding the effectiveness of our internal controls, failure to meet periodic reporting obligations, and material misstatements in our financial statements. Material misstatement of our financial statements may result in a restatement, loss of investor and customer confidence, a decline in the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock, and potential sanctions or investigations by NASDAQ, the Securities and Exchange Commission or other regulatory authorities. Failure to remedy any material weakness in the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting, or to implement or maintain other effective control systems required of public companies, could also restrict the Company\u2019s future access to the capital markets.\nWe have a long operating history, but only modest accumulated profit.\nAlthough we have reported net income (loss) of $(5.5) million, $8.8 million, and $3.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively, our retained earnings were $173.7 million at December 31, 2020. Over our 25 year operating history, we have operated at a loss for many of those years. Depending on the economic environment\u2019s changing rules and regulations, and our investment strategies, it may be difficult for us to sustain profitability on a GAAP basis. We may choose to invest for long term value which could decrease or eliminate short term profit.\nWe derive revenue from a limited number of products.\nA significant portion of our revenue is derived from the sales of our legacy authentication hardware, software, and related services. We anticipate a substantial portion of future revenue, will be derived from authentication, products and related services. If the sale of these products and services is impeded for any reason and we have not diversified our offerings into more software, our business and results of operations would be negatively impacted. Further, we expect our hardware product sales to decline over the long term in our traditional markets. If the rate of decline is more than expected and the aforementioned diversification is not enough to offset the decline, our results could be uneven and overall could be negative.\nThe sales cycle for our products and technology is long, and we may incur substantial expenses for sales that do not occur when anticipated.\nThe sales cycle for our products, which is the period of time between the identification of a potential customer and completion of the sale, is typically lengthy and subject to a number of significant risks over which we have little control. If revenue falls significantly below anticipated levels, our business would be seriously harmed.\nA typical sales cycle in the financial services market is often six months or more. Larger banking transactions may take up to 18 months or more. Purchasing decisions for our products and services may be subject to delays due to many factors that are not within our control, such as:\n\u25cf Time required for a prospective customer to recognize the need for our products;\n\u25cf Significant expense of many security products and systems;\n\u25cf Customer budgeting process; and\n\u25cf Customer evaluation, testing and approval process.\nAs our operating expenses are based on anticipated revenue levels, a small fluctuation in the timing of sales can cause our operating results to vary significantly between periods.\nWe have a great dependence on a limited number of suppliers and the loss of their manufacturing capability could materially impact our operations.\nIn the event that the supply of components or finished products is interrupted or relations with any of our principal vendors is terminated, there could be increased costs and considerable delay in finding suitable replacement sources to manufacture our hardware products. Our hardware Digipass authentication devices are assembled at facilities located in mainland China. The importation of these products from China exposes us to the possibility of product supply disruption and increased costs in the event of changes in the policies of the Chinese government, political unrest or unstable economic conditions in China or developments in the United States or European Union that are adverse to trade, including enactment of protectionist legislation. In 2019, a portion of our hardware products became subject to tariffs. If such tariffs increase in amount or scope, our financial results could be negatively affected. In part to address these risks of manufacturing in mainland China, in 2020 we launched an initiative to establish limited manaufacturing in the European Union. At this time, we do not know whether this project will be successful or how much this project could mitigate the risks related to Chinese manufacturing. Regardless of the location of manufacturing, we continue to be exposed to supply chain risks and uncertainties related to disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nWe order some hardware components, such as processors, in advance of expected use and often produce finished goods prior to the receipt of executed customer orders. If orders are not received, we could suffer losses related to inventory that cannot be sold at full value.\nIn an attempt to minimize the risk of not having an adequate supply of component parts to meet demand and to take advantage of volume purchasing benefits, especially in situations where we have been notified that key processors will no longer be manufactured, we sometimes purchase multiple years\u2019 supply of parts based on internal forecasts of demand. In addition, to meet customers\u2019 demands for accelerated delivery of product, we sometimes produce finished product for existing customers before we receive the executed order from the customer. Should our forecasts of future demand be inaccurate or if we produce product that is never ordered, we could incur substantial losses related to the realization of our inventory.\nOur success depends on establishing and maintaining strategic relationships with other companies to distribute our technology and products and, in some cases, for us to incorporate their technology into our products and our products and services.\nPart of our business strategy is to enter into strategic alliances and other cooperative arrangements with other companies in our industry. We currently are involved in cooperative efforts with respect to the incorporation of our products into products of others and vice versa, research and development efforts, marketing efforts and reseller arrangements. These relationships are generally non-exclusive, and some of our strategic partners also have cooperative relationships with certain of our competitors. If we are unable to enter cooperative arrangements in the future or if we lose any of our current strategic or cooperative relationships, our business could be harmed. We do not control the time and resources devoted to such activities by parties with whom we have relationships. In addition, we may not have the resources available to satisfy expectations, which may adversely affect these relationships. These relationships may not continue, may not be commercially successful, or may require our expenditure of significant financial, personnel and administrative resources from time to time. Further, certain of our products and services compete with the products and services of our strategic partners.\nWe may not be able to maintain effective product distribution channels, which could result in decreased revenue.\nWe rely on both our direct sales force and an indirect channel distribution strategy for the sale and marketing of our products. We may be unable to attract distributors, resellers and integrators, as planned, that can market our products effectively and provide timely and cost-effective customer support and service. There is also a risk that some or all of our distributors, resellers or integrators may be acquired, may change their business models or may go out of business,\nany of which could have an adverse effect on our business. Further, our distributors, integrators and resellers may sell competing products. The loss of important sales personnel, distributors, integrators or resellers could adversely affect us.\nWe depend on our key personnel for the success of our business and the loss of one or more of our key personnel could have an adverse effect on our ability to manage our business or could be negatively perceived in the capital markets.\nOur success and our ability to manage our business depend, in large part, upon the efforts and continued service of our senior management team. The loss of one or more of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations. It could be difficult for us to find replacements for our key personnel, as competition for such personnel is often intense. Further, such a loss could be negatively perceived in the capital markets, which could reduce the market value of our securities.\nIf we fail to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel, our business may be harmed.\nOur future success depends upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical, sales and managerial personnel. Competition for such personnel is often intense and there can be no assurance that we can attract other highly qualified personnel in the future. If we cannot retain or are unable to hire such key personnel, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be significantly adversely affected.\nChanges in our effective tax rate may have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur future effective tax rates may be adversely affected by a number of factors including the distribution of income among the various countries in which we operate, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets, increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes, including the impairment of goodwill in connection with acquisitions, changes in share-based compensation expense, and changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws and changes in generally accepted accounting principles. Any significant increase in our future effective tax rates could adversely impact net income for future periods; and a reduction in our U.S. tax rate could negatively impact our deferred tax assets which could also adversely impact our net income.\nOur worldwide income tax provisions and other tax accruals may be insufficient if any taxing authorities assume taxing positions that are contrary to our positions.\nSignificant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and other taxes such as sales and VAT taxes. There are many transactions for which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of intercompany agreements to purchase intellectual properties, allocate revenue and costs, and other factors, each of which could ultimately result in changes once the arrangements are reviewed by taxing authorities. Although we believe that our approach to determining the amount of such arrangements is reasonable, we cannot be certain that the final tax authority review of these matters will not differ materially from what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and other tax accruals. Such differences could have a material effect on our income tax provisions or benefits, or other tax accruals, in the period in which such determination is made, and consequently, on our results of operations for such period.\nChanges in global tax laws or in their interpretation or enforcement, could have a material adverse effect on our effective tax rate, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nWe could be materially adversely affected by future changes in tax law or policy (or in their interpretation or enforcement) in the jurisdictions where we operate. These changes could be exacerbated by economic, budget or other challenges facing these jurisdictions. For example, foreign jurisdictions could impose tax rate changes along with additional corporate tax provisions that would disallow or tax perceived \u201cbase erosion\u201d or profit shifting amongst jurisdictions. In addition, aspects of U.S. tax reform may lead foreign jurisdictions to respond by enacting additional tax legislation that results in an adverse effect on our effective tax rate, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nAcquisitions, divestitures and other strategic transactions present many risks, and failure to realize the financial and strategic goals we anticipate could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nWe may evaluate and consider potential strategic transactions, including acquisitions of, or investments in, complementary businesses, technologies, services, products and other assets, divestitures, alliances, joint ventures and other portfolio actions. We also may enter into relationships with other businesses to expand our products and platform, which could involve preferred or exclusive licenses, additional channels of distribution, discount pricing or investments in other companies.\nOur success depends, in part, upon our ability to identify suitable transactions; negotiate favorable contractual terms; comply with applicable regulations and receive necessary consents, clearances and approvals (including regulatory and antitrust clearances and approvals); integrate or separate businesses, operations technology and personnel; realize the full extent of the benefits, cost savings or synergies presented by strategic transactions; minimize potential losses of customers, business partners and key technical and managerial personnel; and minimize indemnities and potential disputes with buyers, sellers and strategic partners. In addition, execution or oversight of strategic transactions may result in the diversion of management attention from our existing business and may present financial, managerial and operational risks, including disruptions in our business because of the allocation of resources to consummate these transactions. Moreover, we might incur asset impairment charges related to acquisitions or divestitures that reduce our earnings.\nWith respect to acquisitions in particular, our failure to successfully structure or manage the transactions could seriously harm our financial condition or operating results. The expected benefits of any acquisition may not be realized. In connection with our recent acquisitions and any future purchases, we could face additional financial and operational risks beyond those described above, including: dilution of our stockholders, if we issue equity to fund these transactions; reduced liquidity, increased debt and higher amortization expenses; assumption of operating losses, increased expenses and liabilities; discovery of unanticipated issues and liabilities; failure to meet expected returns; and difficulty in maintaining financial reporting and internal control processes needed to be compliant with requirements applicable to companies subject to SEC reporting.\nWe also regularly review our portfolio for contributions to our objectives and alignment with our strategy, and we may pursue divestiture activities as a result of these reviews. However, we may not be successful in separating any underperforming or non-strategic assets, and gains or losses on any divestiture of, or lost operating income from, such assets may adversely affect our results of operations. Divestitures could also expose us to unanticipated liabilities or result in ongoing obligations, including transition service obligations and indemnity obligations.\nReported revenue may fluctuate widely due to the interpretation or application of accounting rules.\nOur sales arrangements often include multiple elements, including hardware, services, software, maintenance and support. In addition, we have sold software related arrangements in multiple forms, including perpetual licenses, term-based licenses and SaaS subscriptions, each of which may be treated differently under accounting rules. The accounting rules for such arrangements are complex and subject to change from time to time. The nature of the arrangement can create variations in the timing of revenue recognition.\nProvisions in various agreements potentially expose us to substantial liability for intellectual property infringement and other losses.\nOur agreements with customers, solution partners and channel partners generally include provisions under which we agree to indemnify them for losses suffered or incurred as a result of claims of intellectual property infringement and, in some cases, for damages caused by us to property or persons or for other damages. In addition, we make certain representations and warranties and incur obligations under our contracts in the ordinary course of business, including for items related to data security and potential data privacy breaches. Not all of our potential losses under our contracts are covered by insurance policies, which could increase the impact of any such loss should it occur. Large\nindemnity payments or damages resulting from our contractual obligations could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nThe evolution of our business requires more complex development and go-to-market strategies, which involve significant risk.\nOur increasing focus on developing and marketing a platform of solutions for identity management, authentication, risk analysis, fraud detection, digital business processes and related areas requires different development and go-to-market strategies than our historic hardware authentication business. We are developing, buying and licensing technology weighted toward software solutions and investment in research, development, product management, sales training and senior management. This transformation strategy is currently in progress and brings with it significant risks related to our choice of solutions and our ability to execute the strategy successfully. This strategy requires a greater focus on marketing and selling product suites and software solutions rather than selling hardware products for authentication and transaction signing. Consequently, we are developing, and must continue to develop, new strategies for marketing and selling our offerings. In addition, marketing and selling new solutions to enterprises requires significant investment of time and resources in order to train our employees and educate our customers on the benefits of our new product offerings. These investments can be costly and the additional effort required to educate both customers and our own sales force can distract from efforts to sell existing products and services.\nRisks Related to the Market\nWe face significant competition and if we lose or fail to gain market share our financial results will suffer.\nThe market for security products and services is highly competitive. Our competitors include organizations that provide security products based upon approaches similar to and different from those that we employ. Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial, marketing, technical and other competitive resources than we do. As a result, our competitors may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements, or to devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products.\nA decrease of average selling prices for our products and services could adversely affect our business.\nThe average selling prices for our solution offerings may decline as a result of competitive pricing pressures or a change in our mix of products, software and services. In addition, competition continues to increase in the market segments in which we participate and we expect competition to further increase in the future, thereby leading to increased pricing pressures. Furthermore, we anticipate that the average selling prices and gross profits for our products will decrease over product life cycles. To maintain or realize our revenue and gross margins, we must continue to develop, or purchase and introduce new products and services that incorporate new technologies or increased functionality. If we experience such pricing pressures or fail to deliver new products and services relevant to our markets, our revenue and gross margins could decline, which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may need additional capital in the future and our failure to obtain capital would interfere with our growth strategy.\nOur ability to obtain financing will depend on a number of factors, including market conditions, our operating performance and investor or creditor interest. These factors may make the timing, amount, terms and conditions of any financing unattractive. They may also result in our incurring additional indebtedness or accepting stockholder dilution. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, we may have to forego strategic acquisitions or investments, defer our product development activities, or delay the introduction of new products.\nWe experience variations in quarterly operating results and sales are subject to seasonality, both of which may result in a volatile stock price.\nIn the future, as in the past, our quarterly operating results may vary significantly, resulting in a volatile stock price. Factors affecting our operating results include:\n\u25cf The level of competition;\n\u25cf The size, timing, cancellation or rescheduling of significant orders;\n\u25cf New product announcements or introductions by competitors;\n\u25cf Technological changes in the market for security products including the adoption of new technologies and standards;\n\u25cf Changes in pricing by competitors;\n\u25cf Our ability to develop, introduce and market new products and product enhancements on a timely basis, if at all;\n\u25cf Component costs and availability;\n\u25cf Achievement of significant market share in particular markets followed by declines as buying cycles may be multiple years apart;\n\u25cf The variability of revenue realized from individual customers as their buying patterns can vary significantly from period to period and is affected by the individual solutions purchased and the structure of the contract;\n\u25cf Our success in expanding our sales and marketing programs;\n\u25cf Market acceptance of new products and product enhancements;\n\u25cf Changes in foreign currency exchange rates; and\n\u25cf General economic conditions in the countries in which we operate.\nWe also experience seasonality or variation across the year in our markets. These trends can include the summer months, particularly in Europe, or the second half of the fiscal year is generally higher than the first half in terms of sales.\nOur stock price may be volatile for reasons other than variations in our quarterly operating results.\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to factors, some of which are beyond our control, including the following:\n\u25cf Actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly or annual operating results;\n\u25cf Differences between actual operating results and results estimated by analysts that follow our stock and provide estimates of our results to the market;\n\u25cf Differences between guidance relative to financial results, if given, and actual results;\n\u25cf Changes in market valuations of other technology companies, and cybersecurity companies in particular;\n\u25cf Investor acceptance of our strategies and the perception of our success in executing those strategies;\n\u25cf Announcements by us or our competitors of significant technical innovations, contracts, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n\u25cf Additions or departures of key personnel;\n\u25cf Future sales of common stock;\n\u25cf The inclusion or exclusion of our stock in ETF\u2019s, indices and other benchmarks, and changes made to methodologies connected therewith;\n\u25cf Trading volume fluctuations; and\n\u25cf Reactions by investors to uncertainties in the world economy and financial markets.\nOur stock repurchase program could affect the price of our common stock and increase volatility and may be suspended or terminated at any time, which may result in a decrease in the trading price of our common stock\nOn June 10, 2020, the Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program (\u201cprogram\u201d). Under the program, we are authorized to repurchase shares of our common stock from time to time in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, or otherwise, at prices that the Company deems appropriate and subject to market conditions, applicable law and other factors deemed relevant in the Company\u2019s sole discretion, up to an aggregate purchase price of $50.0 million. The timing and actual number of shares repurchased depend on a variety of factors including the timing of open trading windows, price, corporate and regulatory requirements, and other market conditions. The program does not obligate the Company to repurchase any dollar amount or number of shares of common stock. The authorization is effective until June 10, 2022. Repurchases pursuant to our stock repurchase program could affect our stock price and increase its volatility. The existence of a stock repurchase program could also cause our stock price to be higher than it would be in the absence of such a program and could potentially reduce the market liquidity for our stock. There can be no assurance that any stock repurchases will enhance stockholder value because the market price of our common stock may decline below the levels at which we repurchased shares of common stock. Although our stock repurchase program is intended to enhance long-term stockholder value, short-term stock price fluctuations could reduce the program\u2019s effectiveness.\nA small group of persons control a substantial amount of our common stock and could delay or prevent a change of control.\nMr. T. Kendall Hunt, our founder and former Chairman of the Board, beneficially owns approximately 12% of the outstanding shares of our common stock. In addition, Blackrock, Inc. holds approximately 12% of ownership, Legion Partners Asset Management holds approximately 7% of ownership, The Vanguard Group holds approximately 6% of ownership, Legal & General Investment Management LTD holds approximately 5% of ownership, and Sylebra Capital LTD holds approximately 5% of ownership.\nThe concentration of ownership may have the effect of discouraging, delaying or preventing a change in control and may also have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\nCertain provisions of our charter and of Delaware law make a takeover of our Company more difficult.\nOur corporate charter and Delaware law contain provisions, such as a class of authorized but unissued preferred stock which may be issued by our board without stockholder approval that might enable our management to resist a takeover of our Company. Delaware law also limits business combinations with interested stockholders. These\nprovisions might discourage, delay or prevent a change in control or a change in our management. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions. The existence of these provisions could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.\nFuture issuances of blank check preferred stock may reduce voting power of common stock and may have anti-takeover effects that could prevent a change in control.\nOur corporate charter authorizes the issuance of up to 500,000 shares of preferred stock with such designations, rights, powers and preferences as may be determined from time to time by our Board of Directors, including such dividend, liquidation, conversion, voting or other rights, powers and preferences as may be determined from time to time by the Board of Directors without further stockholder approval. The issuance of preferred stock could adversely affect the voting power or other rights of the holders of common stock. In addition, the authorized shares of preferred stock and common stock could be utilized, under certain circumstances, as a method of discouraging, delaying or preventing a change in control.\nOur business could be adversely affected as a result of actions of activist stockholders.\nAlthough we strive to maintain constructive, ongoing communications with all of our stockholders, and welcome their views and opinions with the goal of enhancing value for all of our stockholders, our stockholders may from time to time engage in proxy solicitations, advance stockholder proposals or otherwise attempt to effect changes or acquire control of the Company. Campaigns by stockholders to effect changes at publicly traded companies are sometimes led by investors seeking to increase short-term stockholder value through actions such as stock repurchases or sales of assets or the entire company. Responding to proxy contests and other actions by activist stockholders can be costly and time-consuming and could divert the attention of our Board of Directors and senior management from the management of our operations and the pursuit of our business strategy.\nAny perceived uncertainties as to our future direction and control, our ability to execute on our strategy or changes to the composition of our Board of Directors or senior management team arising from proposals by activist stockholders or a proxy contest could lead to the perception of a change in the direction of our business or instability that may be exploited by our competitors and/or other activist stockholders, result in the loss of potential business opportunities, result in the loss of our employees and business partners and make it more difficult to pursue our strategic initiatives or attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nFurther, actual or perceived actions of activist stockholders may cause significant fluctuations in our stock price based upon temporary or speculative market perceptions or other factors that do not necessarily reflect the Company\u2019s underlying fundamentals and prospects.\nRisks Related to Technology and Intellectual Property\nTechnological changes occur rapidly in our industry and our development of new products is critical to maintain our revenue.\nThe introduction by our competitors of products embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards could render our existing products obsolete and unmarketable. Our future revenue growth and operating profit will depend in part upon our ability to enhance our current products and develop innovative new solutions to distinguish us from the competition and to meet customers\u2019 changing needs. Security-related product developments and technology innovations by others may adversely affect our competitive position and we may not successfully anticipate or adapt to changing technology, industry standards or customer requirements on a timely basis.\nOur business could be negatively impacted by cyber security incidents and other disruptions.\nOur use of technology is increasing and is critical in at least three primary areas of our business:\n1.Software and information systems that we use to help us run our business more efficiently and cost effectively, which are increasingly cloud-based tools;\n2.The products we have traditionally sold and continue to sell to our customers contain technology that incorporates the use of secret numbers and encryption technology; and\n3.Solutions delivered on a software-as-a-service basis, from both public and private cloud models, which may process and store confidential, personal, health and financial information and which may rely on third parties for some or all of the solution.\nA cyber incident in any of these areas of our business could disrupt our ability to take orders or deliver products or services to our customers, cause us to suffer significant monetary and other losses and significant reputational harm, or substantially impair our ability to grow the business. We expect that there will continue to be hacking attempts intended to capture business information or exploit computing power to impede the performance of our products, to access our customers\u2019 information, or harm our reputation as a company. The processes used by hackers to access or sabotage technology products, services and networks are evolving in sophistication and increasing in frequency. We could experience a security incident due to various causes including intentional or unintentional conduct of our employees, vendors, technology partners and others that have access to or store our information.\nIn July 2011, we discovered a cyber-incident related to DigiNotar B.V. shortly after we purchased the company. The hacking incident at DigiNotar B.V. led to the termination of DigiNotar B.V\u2019s registration as a certification service provider and DigiNotar B.V.\u2019s bankruptcy. Since that time, we have experienced several security incidents, although none have been material. Even though we have established teams, processes and strategies to protect our corporate and solution assets, we may incur losses from such events as a result of unanticipated costs associated with data security incidents.\nIn addition, because we are in the cyber security industry, we could be targeted by hackers more than other companies and if a material cyber security breach occurred related to corporate or customer information, the reputational harm and potential lost future business could be greater than other companies not in our industry. We have taken various measures to strengthen the security of our products and our systems, to establish information security governance procedures and to train our employees. However, we are the subject of a large volume of hacking attempts and our defenses might not always be effective. If a hacking attempt were to be successful and lead to a material data breach, then it could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations, both in the current period and for a significant future period of time.\nWe rely upon Amazon Web Services to operate portions of our platform and any disruption of or interference with our use of Amazon Web Services or other vendors\u2019 material would adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition\nWe outsource portions of our cloud infrastructure to Amazon Web Services, or AWS. Customers of our products need to be able to access our platform at any time, without interruption or degradation of performance. AWS runs its own platform that we access, and we are, therefore, vulnerable to service interruptions at AWS. We have experienced and expect that in the future we may experience interruptions, delays and outages in service and availability from time to time due to a variety of factors, including infrastructure changes, human or software errors, website hosting disruptions and capacity constraints. Capacity constraints could be due to a number of potential causes including technical failures, natural disasters, fraud or security attacks. In addition, if our security, or that of AWS, is compromised, our products or platform are unavailable or our users are unable to use our products within a reasonable amount of time or at all, then our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. In some instances, we may not be able to identify the cause or causes of these performance problems within a period of time acceptable to our customers. It may become increasingly difficult to maintain and improve our platform\nperformance, especially during peak usage times, as our products become more complex and the usage of our products increases. To the extent that we do not effectively address capacity constraints, either through AWS or alternative providers of cloud infrastructure, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected. In addition, any changes in service levels from AWS may adversely affect our ability to meet our customers' requirements.\nAny of the above circumstances or events may harm our reputation, possibly move customers to stop using our products, impair our ability to increase revenue from existing customers, impair our ability to grow our customer base, subject us to financial penalties and liabilities under our service level agreements and otherwise harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. These risks are also present with our other cloud service infrastructure vendors beside AWS. In addition, we also utilize strategic vendors to resell or incorporate third party technology and if these material vendors experienced a data breach, outage in service or other failure, we could be prevented from meeting our customers\u2019 requirements.\nSome of our products contain third-party, open-source software and failure to comply with the terms of the underlying open-source software licenses could restrict our ability to sell our products or otherwise result in claims against us.\nOur products are distributed with software programs licensed to us by third-party authors under open-source licenses, which may include the GNU General Public License, the GNU Lesser Public License, the BSD License and the Apache License. Third-party, open-source programs are typically licensed to us for no fee and the underlying license agreements could require us to make available to users the source code for such programs, as well as the source code for any modifications or derivative works we create based on these third-party, open-source software programs.\nWe do not provide end users a copy of the source code to our proprietary software because we believe that the manner in which our proprietary software is aligned or communicates with the relevant open-source programs does not create a modification, derivative work or extended version of, or a work based on, that open-source program requiring the distribution of our proprietary source code.\nOur ability to commercialize our products by incorporating third-party, open-source software may be restricted because, among other reasons:\n\u25cf the terms of open-source license agreements are unclear and subject to varying interpretations, which could result in unforeseen obligations regarding our proprietary products or claims of infringement;\n\u25cf it may be difficult to determine the developers of open-source software and whether such licensed software infringes another party\u2019s intellectual property rights;\n\u25cf competitors may have equal access to these open source products, which may help them develop competitive products; and\n\u25cf open-source software potentially increases customer support costs because licensees can modify the software and potentially introduce errors, which could also increase the risk of vulnerabilities available to hackers.\nWe must continue to attract and retain highly skilled technical personnel for our research and development efforts.\nThe market for highly skilled technical talent is highly competitive. If we fail to attract, train, assimilate and retain qualified technical personnel for our research and development and product management efforts, we will experience delays or failures in introductions of new or modified products, and services, failures in adequate analysis of technology or acquisitions in the market, loss of clients and market share and a reduction in revenue.\nWe cannot be certain that our research and development activities will be successful.\nWhile management is committed to enhancing our current product offerings and introducing new products, we cannot be certain our research and development activities will be successful. Furthermore, we may not have sufficient financial resources to identify and develop new technologies and bring new products to market in a timely and cost effective manner, and we cannot ensure that any such products will be commercially successful.\nFailure to effectively manage our product and service lifecycles could harm our business.\nAs part of the natural lifecycle of our products and services, we periodically inform customers that products or services will be reaching their end of life or end of availability and will no longer be supported or receive updates and security patches. Failure to effectively manage our product and service lifecycles could lead to customer dissatisfaction and contractual liabilities, which could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nSaaS offerings, which involve various risks, constitute an important part of our business.\nAs we continue to acquire, develop and offer SaaS versions of products, we will need to continue to evolve our processes to meet a number of regulatory, intellectual property, contractual and service compliance challenges. These challenges include compliance with licenses for open source and third party software embedded in our SaaS offerings, maintaining compliance with export control and privacy regulations, including HIPAA and GDPR, protecting our services from external threats, maintaining continuous service levels and data security expected by our customers, preventing inappropriate use of our services and adapting our go-to-market efforts. In addition to using our internal resources, we also utilize third party resources to deliver SaaS offerings, such as third party data hosting vendors. The failure of a third party provider to prevent service disruptions, data losses or security breaches may require us to issue credits or refunds or indemnify or otherwise be liable to customers or third parties for damages that may occur. Additionally, if these third-party providers fail to deliver on their obligations, our reputation could be damaged, our customers could lose confidence in us and our ability to maintain and expand our SaaS offerings. Finally, our SaaS offerings need to be designed to operate at significant transaction volumes. When combined with third party software and hosting infrastructure, our SaaS offerings may not perform as designed which could lead to service disruptions and associated damages.\nWe depend significantly upon our proprietary technology and intellectual property and the loss of or successful challenge to our proprietary rights could require us to divert management attention and could reduce revenue and increase our operating costs.\nFrom time to time, we receive claims that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of others, including claims regarding patents, copyrights, and trademarks. Because of constant technological change in the segments in which we compete, the extensive patent coverage of existing technologies, and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, it is possible that the number of these claims may grow. In addition, former employers of our former, current, or future employees may assert claims that such employees have improperly disclosed to us the confidential or proprietary information of these former employers. Any such claim, with or without merit, could result in costly litigation and distract management from day-to-day operations. If we are not successful in defending such claims, we could be required to stop selling, delay shipments, redesign our products, pay monetary amounts as damages, enter into royalty or licensing arrangements, or satisfy indemnification obligations with our customers. Royalty or licensing arrangements we may seek in such circumstances may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all. We have made and expect to continue making significant expenditures to establish our intellectual property rights and to investigate, defend and settle claims related to the use of technology and intellectual property rights as part of our strategy to manage this risk. In addition, we license and use software from third parties in our business. These third party software licenses may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms or at all, and may expose us to additional liability. This liability, or our inability to use any of this third party software or technology, could result in shipment delays or other disruptions in our business that could materially and adversely affect our operating results.\nWe rely principally on trade secrets to protect much of our intellectual property in cases where we do not believe patent protection is appropriate or obtainable. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. Although our\nemployees are subject to confidentiality obligations, this protection may be inadequate to deter or prevent misappropriation of our confidential information. We may be unable to detect unauthorized use of our intellectual property or otherwise take appropriate steps to enforce our rights. Failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection could adversely affect our competitive business position. If we are unable to prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our copyrights, trademarks or other proprietary information, our competitive position could be adversely affected. In the course of conducting our business, we may inadvertently infringe the intellectual property rights of others, resulting in claims against us or our customers. Our contracts generally indemnify our customers for third-party claims for intellectual property infringement by the services and products we provide. In the past, we have resolved several claims of patent infringement brought against us and a claim brought against a customer related to our technology. None of these claims were material to our financial results but this may not always be the case. The expense of defending these claims may adversely affect our financial results and may not be covered by any insurance policies we maintain. In addition, any such disputes and litigation could divert management attention and harm our reputation in the market.\nOur patents may not provide us with competitive advantages.\nWe hold numerous patents in the United States and in other countries, which cover multiple aspects of our technology. A substantial part of our patents cover the Digipass product line. Our patents expire between now and more than 10 years from now. There can be no assurance that we will continue to develop proprietary products or technologies that are patentable, that any issued patent will provide us with any competitive advantages or will not be challenged by third parties, or that patents of others will not hinder our competitive advantage. Although certain of our technologies are patented, there are other organizations that offer products with comparable functionality that employ different technological solutions and compete with us for market share.\nWe are subject to warranty and product liability risks.\nA malfunction of or design defect in our products which results in a breach of a legal obligation or physical harm or damage from our products could result in tort or warranty claims against us. We seek to reduce the risk of these losses by using qualified engineers in the design, manufacturing and testing of our hardware products, proper development and testing of our software solutions, attempting to negotiate warranty disclaimers and liability limitation clauses in our sales agreements, and maintaining customary insurance coverage. However, these measures may ultimately prove ineffective in limiting our liability for damages.\nIn addition to any monetary liability for the failure of our products, an actual or perceived breach of network or security at one of our customers or publicly known defect or perceived defect in our products could adversely affect the market\u2019s perception of us and our products, and could have an adverse effect on our reputation and the demand for our products. Similarly, an actual or perceived breach of security within our own systems could damage our reputation and have an adverse effect on the demand for our products.\nThere is significant government regulation of technology imports and exports and to the extent we cannot meet the requirements of the regulations we may be prohibited from exporting some of our products, which could negatively impact our revenue.\nOur international sales and operations are subject to risks such as the imposition of government controls, new or changed export license requirements, restrictions on the export of critical technology, trade restrictions and changes in tariffs. If we are unable to obtain regulatory approvals on a timely basis our business may be impacted. Certain of our products are subject to export controls under U.S. law. The list of products and countries for which export approval is required, and the regulatory policies with respect thereto, may be revised from time to time and our inability to obtain required approvals under these regulations could materially and adversely affect our ability to make international sales. Violations of export control and international trade laws could result in penalties, fines, adverse reputational consequences, and other materially adverse consequences. In the past, we voluntarily disclosed a trade control matter to the U.S. government. Although this matter was closed during 2018 with no fines, penalties, or finding of wrongdoing, we cannot guarantee that such issues will not arise in the future. In addition, we cannot predict the future government regulation of aspects of our business and such regulation could be detrimental to our results.\nWe employ cryptographic technology in our authentication products that uses complex mathematical formulations.\nA portion of our products are based on cryptographic technology. With cryptographic technology, a user is given a key that is required to encrypt and decode messages. The security afforded by this technology depends on the integrity of a user\u2019s key and in part on the application of algorithms, which are advanced mathematical factoring equations. These codes may eventually be broken or become subject to government regulation regarding their use, which would render our technology and products less effective. The occurrence of any one of the following could result in a decline in demand for our technology and products:\n\u25cf Any significant advance in techniques for attacking cryptographic systems, including the development of an easy factoring method or faster, more powerful computers;\n\u25cf Publicity of the successful decoding of cryptographic messages or the misappropriation of keys; and\n\u25cf Increased government regulation limiting the use, scope or strength of cryptography.\nRisks Related to International Operations\nWe face a number of risks associated with our international operations, any or all of which could result in a disruption in our business and a decrease in our revenue.\nIn 2020, approximately 88% of our revenue and approximately 73% of our operating expenses were generated/incurred outside of the U.S. In 2019, approximately 89% of our revenue and approximately 72% of our operating expenses were generated/incurred outside of the U.S. In 2018, approximately 91% of our revenue and approximately 71% of our operating expenses were generated/incurred outside of the U.S. A severe economic decline in any of our major foreign markets could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition to exposures to changes in the economic conditions of our major foreign markets, we are subject to a number of risks any or all of which could result in a disruption in our business and a decrease in our revenue. These include:\n\u25cf Inconsistent regulations and unexpected changes in regulatory requirements;\n\u25cf Export controls relating to our technology;\n\u25cf Difficulties and costs of staffing and managing international operations, including maintaining internal controls and closing or restructuring such operations;\n\u25cf Potentially adverse tax consequences;\n\u25cf Wage and price controls or protection;\n\u25cf Uncertain protection for intellectual property rights, contractual rights and collecting accounts receivable;\n\u25cf Imposition of trade barriers;\n\u25cf Differing technology standards;\n\u25cf Uncertain demand for our solutions in individual countries, even if there were past sales;\n\u25cf Linguistic and cultural differences;\n\u25cf A widely distributed workforce;\n\u25cf Difficulty in providing support and training to customers in certain international locations;\n\u25cf Economic and political instability, including uncertainties in market conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic; and\n\u25cf Social unrest, health crises, and cultural barriers or changes.\nWe are subject to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and risks, and improper management of that risk could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial conditions.\nBecause a significant number of our principal customers are located outside the United States, we expect that international sales will continue to generate a significant portion of our total revenue. We are subject to foreign exchange fluctuations and risks because the majority of our product costs are denominated in U.S. Dollars, whereas a significant portion of the sales and expenses of our foreign operating subsidiaries are denominated in various foreign currencies. A decrease in the value of any of these foreign currencies relative to the U.S. Dollar could adversely affect our revenue and profitability in U.S. Dollars of our products sold in these markets. We do not currently hold forward exchange contracts to exchange foreign currencies for U.S. Dollars to offset currency rate fluctuations.\nChanges in the European regulatory environment regarding privacy and data protection regulations could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.\nIn Europe, we are subject to the 1995 European Union (\u201cEU\u201d) Directive on Data Protection (\u201c1995 Data Protection Directive\u201d), which requires EU member states to impose minimum restrictions on the collection and use of personal data that, in some respects, are more stringent, and impose more significant burdens on subject businesses, than current privacy standards in the United States. We may also face audits or investigations by one or more foreign government agencies relating to our compliance with these regulations that could result in the imposition of penalties or fines. The EU member state regulations establish several obligations that organizations must follow with respect to use of personal data, including a prohibition on the transfer of personal information from the EU to other countries whose laws do not protect personal data to an adequate level of privacy or security. In addition, certain member states have adopted more stringent data protection standards. The Company addressed these requirements by certification to the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Frameworks prior to such Frameworks being invalidated in October 2015 by the European Court of Justice. The General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d) replaced the 1995 Data Protection Directive effective May 25, 2018, creating significant impacts on how businesses can collect and process the personal data of EU individuals. We have expended significant resources to comply, but those methods may be subject to scrutiny by data protection authorities in EU member states. The costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, such laws, regulations and policies that are applicable to us may limit our use of personal data and solutions and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.\nWe must comply with governmental regulations setting environmental standards.\nGovernmental regulations setting environmental standards influence the design, components or operation of our products. New regulations and changes to current regulations are always possible and, in some jurisdictions, regulations may be introduced with little or no time to bring related products into compliance with these regulations. Our failure to comply with these regulations may prevent us from selling our products in a certain country. In addition, these regulations may increase our cost of supplying the products by forcing us to redesign existing products or to use more expensive designs or components. In these cases, we may experience unexpected disruptions in our ability to supply customers with products, or we may incur unexpected costs or operational complexities to bring products into compliance. This could have an adverse effect on our revenues, gross profit margins and results of operations and increase the volatility of our financial results.\nWe are subject to the Restriction on the Use of Hazardous Substances Directive 2002/95/EC (also known as the \u201cRoHS Directive\u201d) and the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive (also known as the \u201cWEEE Directive\u201d).\nThese directives restrict the distribution of products containing certain substances, including lead, within applicable geographies and require a manufacturer or importer to recycle products containing those substances.\nThese directives affect the worldwide electronics and electronics components industries as a whole. If we or our customers fail to comply with such laws and regulations, we could incur liabilities and fines and our operations could be suspended.\nThe vote by the United Kingdom (UK) to leave the European Union (EU) could adversely affect our financial results.\nIn June 2016, UK voters approved a referendum to withdraw the UK's membership from the EU, which is commonly referred to as \"Brexit\". We have operations in the UK and the EU, and as a result, we face risks associated with the potential uncertainty and disruptions that may follow Brexit, including with respect to volatility in exchange rates and interest rates and potential material changes to the regulatory regime applicable to our operations in the UK. Brexit could adversely affect European or worldwide political, regulatory, economic or market conditions and could contribute to instability in global political institutions, regulatory agencies and financial markets. Any of these effects of Brexit, and others we cannot anticipate or that may evolve over time, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nWe or our suppliers may be impacted by new regulations related to climate change.\nIn addition to the European environmental regulations noted above, we or our suppliers may become subject to new laws enacted with regards to climate change. In the event that new laws are enacted or current laws are modified in countries in which we or our suppliers operate, our flow of product may be impacted and/or the costs of handling the potential waste associated with our products may increase dramatically, either of which could result in a significant negative impact on our ability to operate or operate profitably.\nThe effects of regulations relating to conflict minerals may adversely affect our business.\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act contains provisions to improve transparency and accountability concerning the supply of certain minerals and derivatives (collectively \u201cConflict Minerals\u201d) which may originate from the conflict zones of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and adjoining countries (collectively, \u201cCovered Countries\u201d). As a result, in August 2012 the SEC established annual disclosure and reporting requirements for companies using Conflict Minerals in their products, including products manufactured by third parties. Like many electronic devices, our hardware products contain Conflict Minerals and are subject to the disclosure and reporting requirements. Compliance with these rules also requires due diligence including country of origin inquiries to determine the sources of Conflict Minerals used in our products.\nAs required, we filed our annual reports related to products manufactured. We reported that we determined we had no reason to believe Conflict Minerals used in our products may have originated in Covered Countries.\nWe may incur continued costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements. These requirements may affect pricing, sourcing and availability of Conflict Minerals used to produce our devices. We may be unable to verify the origin of all Conflict Minerals in our products. We may encounter challenges with customers and stakeholders if we are unable to certify that our products are conflict free.\nU.S. investors may have difficulties in making claims for any breach of their rights as holders of shares because some of our assets and key employees are not located in the United States.\nSeveral of our key employees are full-time or part-time residents of foreign countries, and a substantial portion of our assets and those of some of our key employees are located in foreign countries. As a result, it may not be possible for investors to effect service of process on those persons located in foreign countries, or to enforce judgments against some of our key employees based upon the securities or other laws of jurisdictions in those foreign countries.\nOur business in countries with a history of corruption and transactions with foreign governments increase the risks associated with our international activities.\nWe are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), and other laws that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and their officials and political parties by U.S. and other business entities for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We have operations, deal with and make sales to governmental or quasi-governmental customers in countries known to experience corruption, particularly certain countries in the Middle East, Africa, East Asia and South and Central America, and further expansion of our international selling efforts may involve additional regions. Our activities in these countries create the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by one of our employees, consultants, sales agents or channel partners that could be in violation of various laws, including the FCPA and the U.K. Bribery Act, even though these parties are not always subject to our control. Violations of the FCPA may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, including suspension or debarment from U.S. government contracting, and we may be subject to other liabilities, which could negatively affect our business, operating results and financial condition. Violations of the U.K. Bribery Act may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions and we may be subject to other liabilities that could negatively affect our business operating results and financial condition.",

    "item_3": "Item 3 - Legal Proceedings\nWe are a party to or have intellectual property subject to litigation and other proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business. These types of matters could result in fines, penalties, compensatory or treble damages or non-monetary sanctions or relief. We believe the probability is remote that the outcome of each of these matters, including the legal proceedings described below, will have a material adverse effect on the corporation as a whole, notwithstanding that the unfavorable resolution of any matter may have a material effect on our financial results in any particular interim reporting period. Among the factors that we consider in this assessment are the nature of existing legal proceedings and claims, the asserted or possible damages or loss contingency (if estimable), the progress of the case, existing law and precedent, the opinions or views of legal counsel and other advisers, our experience in similar cases and the experience of other companies, the facts available to us at the time of assessment and how we intend to respond to the proceeding or claim. Our assessment of these factors may change over time as individual proceedings or claims progress.\nAlthough we cannot predict the outcome of legal or other proceedings with certainty, where there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss may have been incurred, U.S. GAAP requires us to disclose an estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of loss or make a statement that such an estimate cannot be made. We follow a process in which we seek to estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of loss, and only if we are unable to make such an estimate do we conclude and disclose that an estimate cannot be made. Accordingly, unless otherwise indicated below in\nour discussion of legal proceedings, a reasonably possible loss or range of loss associated with any individual legal proceeding cannot be estimated.\nWe include various types of indemnification clauses in our agreements. These indemnifications may include, but are not limited to, infringement claims related to our intellectual property, direct damages and consequential damages. The type and amount of such indemnifications vary substantially based on our assessment of risk and reward associated with each agreement. We believe the estimated fair value of these indemnification clauses is minimal, and we cannot determine the maximum amount of potential future payments, if any, related to such indemnification provisions. We have no liabilities recorded for these clauses as of December 31, 2020.\nWe have been involved in an ongoing dispute with a German company, Onespin solutions GmbH, regarding the co-existence of, or alleged infringement with, its trademark in certain jurisdictions for \u201cONESPIN\u201d and our trademark in certain jurisdictions for \u201cONESPAN\u201d. Onespin sells integrated circuit integrity verification solutions for use in the system on chip software development process flow. During the fourth quarter of 2020, we reached a settlement with Onespin on these matters. The amount of the settlement was not material from a financial perspective. We consider this matter to now be closed.\nA complaint was filed on August 20, 2020 against OneSpan and certain of its officers, asserting claims for purported violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d), and SEC Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, based on certain alleged material misstatements and omissions. The case is captioned Almendariz v. OneSpan Inc., et al., No. 1:20-cv-04906 (N.D. Ill.) (the \u201cSecurities Class Action\u201d). Specifically, the plaintiff in the Securities Class Action alleges, among other things, that certain statements about OneSpan\u2019s business were misleading because of defendants\u2019 failure to disclose that OneSpan purportedly had inadequate internal procedures and controls over financial reporting and related disclosures; and OneSpan purportedly downplayed the negative impacts of immaterial errors in its financial statements.\nA complaint, related in subject matter to the Securities Class Action, was filed on October 23, 2020 against certain of OneSpan\u2019s officers and directors, and names OneSpan as a nominal defendant. The case is captioned Klein v. Boroditzky, et al., No. 1:20-cv-06310 (N.D. Ill.) (the \u201cDerivative Action\u201d and, collectively with the Securities Class Action, the \u201cLitigation\u201d). The plaintiff asserts claims for breach of fiduciary duty, abuse of control and corporate waste, as well as a claim for contribution under Sections 10(b) and 21D of the Exchange Act, based on the same alleged wrongdoing pled in the Securities Class Action. We intend to defend against the Litigation vigorously.\nFrom time to time, we have been involved in litigation and claims incidental to the conduct of our business, such as compensation claims from current or former employees in Europe. We expect that to continue.

In response to the pandemic, the United States and various foreign, state and local governments have, among other actions, imposed travel and business restrictions and required or advised communities in which we do business to adopt stay-at-home orders and social distancing guidelines, causing some businesses to adjust, reduce or suspend\noperating activities. The pandemic and the various governments\u2019 response have caused significant and widespread uncertainty, volatility and disruptions in the U.S. and global economies, including in the regions in which we operate.\nFinancial Results and Outlook\nBeginning in the Summer of 2020 and continuing through the year ended December 31, 2020, we experienced lengthened sales cycles and reduced demand for some of our security solutions due to economic uncertainty connected with the COVID-19 pandemic. The most significant impact of the pandemic on our business has been a sharp drop in demand for our hardware authentication products and delays in the implementation of certain software security solutions.\nIn addition, we believe demand for our hardware offerings declined in favor of our mobile and cloud security solutions as customers increasingly adopted digital alternatives in 2020. Finally, we saw strong demand for our hardware solutions in Europe during 2019 that did not repeat in 2020 due to many of our customers complying with banking regulations imposed by Payment Services Directive 2 (\u201cPSD2\u201d). As a result, our hardware revenues for 2020 were substantially below such revenues as compared to 2019.\nIn the current and future periods, we may experience weaker customer demand, requests for discounts or extended payment terms, customer bankruptcies, supply chain disruption, employee staffing constraints and difficulties, government restrictions or other factors that could negatively impact the Company and its business, operations and financial results.\nAs we cannot predict the duration or scope of the pandemic or its impact on economic and financial markets, any negative impact to our results cannot be reasonably estimated, but it could be material. We continue to monitor closely the Company\u2019s financial health and liquidity and the impact of the pandemic on the Company. We are able to serve the needs of our customers while taking steps to protect the health and safety of our employees, customers, partners, and communities. See Part I - Item 1A - Risk Factors of this Form 10-K for additional information regarding the potential impact of COVID-19 on the Company.\nOverview\nWe design, develop and market digital solutions for identity, security, and business productivity that protect and facilitate electronic transactions via mobile and connected devices. We are a global leader in providing anti-fraud and digital transaction management solutions to financial institutions and other businesses. Our solutions secure access to online accounts, data, assets, and applications for global enterprises; provide tools for application developers to easily integrate security functions into their web-based and mobile applications; and facilitate end-to-end financial agreement automation including digital identity verification, electronic signature and electronic notarization. Our core technologies, multi-factor authentication, electronic signature, and transaction signing, strengthen the process of preventing hacking attacks against online and mobile transactions. This allows companies to transact business safely and with an improved customer experience for remote customers.\nWe offer cloud based and on-premises solutions using both open standards and proprietary technologies. Some of our proprietary technologies are patented. Our products and services are used for authentication, fraud mitigation, e-signing transactions and documents, and identity management in Business-to-Business (\u201cB2B\u201d), Business-to-Employee (\u201cB2E\u201d) and Business-to-Consumer (\u201cB2C\u201d) environments. Our target market is business processes using an electronic interface, particularly the Internet, where there is risk of account takeover or new account fraud. Our products can increase security associated with accessing business processes, reduce losses from unauthorized access, help customers comply with regulations, enhance the end-user experience, and reduce the cost of business processes by automating activities previously performed manually.\nOnline and mobile application owners and publishers benefit from our expertise in multi-factor authentication, document signing, transaction signing, application security, remote customer onboarding, and in mitigating hacking attacks. Our convenient and proven security solutions enable low friction and trusted interactions between businesses, employees, and consumers across a variety of online and mobile platforms.\nOur primary growth strategy is to make digital banking more accessible, secure, easy and valuable. Our key growth objectives include:\n\u25cf Expanding our portfolio of services that enable institutions to mitigate fraud, reduce operational costs, comply with regulations, easily on-board customers, and adaptively authenticate transactions and reduce time to deploy;\n\u25cf Automating and securing digital customer journeys to remotely verify identities, mitigate application fraud and secure account opening and transactions;\n\u25cf Increasing sales to existing customers and acquiring new customers;\n\u25cf Driving increased demand for our products in new applications, new markets, and new territories;\n\u25cf Expanding our channel partner ecosystem; and\n\u25cf Strategically acquiring companies that expand our technology portfolio or customer base and increase our recurring revenue.\nOur Business Model\nWe offer our products through a product sales and licensing model or through our services platform, which includes our cloud-based service offerings.\nOur solutions are sold worldwide through our direct sales force, as well as through distributors, resellers, systems integrators, and original equipment manufacturers. Our sales force is able to offer customers a choice of an on-site implementation using our traditional on-premises model or a cloud implementation for some solutions using our services platform.\nIndustry Growth\nEconomic instability related to the COVID-19 pandemic impacted our results for the year ended December 31, 2020. As economic conditions recover, we believe the global markets for authentication, fraud mitigation, agreement automation, and electronic signature solutions will continue to grow driven by dynamic and growing threat environments, increased focus on the digital experience for mobile and online users, new government regulations, and continued growth in electronic commerce. The rate of growth in each country around the world may vary significantly based on local culture, competitive position, economic conditions, and the use of technology.\nEconomic Conditions\nOur revenue may vary significantly with changes in the economic conditions in the countries in which we currently sell products. With our current concentration of revenue in Europe and specifically in the banking and finance vertical market, significant changes in the economic outlook for the European Banking market may have a significant effect on our revenue.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and the various responses of governments around the world have caused significant and widespread uncertainty, volatility and disruptions in the U.S. and global economies, including in the regions in which we operate. See Part I, Item 1A - Risk Factors of this Form 10-K for additional information regarding the potential impact of COVID-19 on the Company.\nCybersecurity Risks\nOur use of technology is increasing and is critical in three primary areas of our business:\n1. Software and information systems that we use to help us run our business more efficiently and cost effectively;\n2. The products we have traditionally sold and continue to sell to our customers for integration into their software applications contain technology that incorporates the use of secret numbers and encryption technology; and\n3. New products and services that we introduced to the market are focused on processing information through our servers or in the cloud.\nWe believe that the risks and consequences of potential incidents in each of the above areas are different.\nIn the case of the information systems we use to help us run our business, we believe that an incident could disrupt our ability to take orders or deliver product to our customers, but such a delay in these activities would not have a material impact on our overall results. To minimize this risk, we actively use various forms of security and monitor the use of our systems regularly to detect potential incidents as soon as possible.\nIn the case of products that we have traditionally sold, we believe that the risk of a potential cyber incident is minimal. We offer our customers the ability to either create the secret numbers themselves or have us create the numbers on their behalf. When asked to create the numbers, we do so in a secure environment with limited physical access and store the numbers on a system that is not connected to any other network, including other OneSpan networks, and similarly, is not connected to the Internet.\nIn the case of our cloud-based solutions, which involve the processing of customer information, we believe a cyber incident could have a material impact on our business. While our revenue from cloud-based solutions comprises a minority of our revenue today, we believe that these solutions will provide substantial future growth. A cyber incident involving these solutions in the future could substantially impair our ability to grow the business and we could suffer significant monetary and other losses and significant reputational harm.\nTo minimize the risk, we review our product security and procedures on a regular basis. Our reviews include the processes and software code we are currently using as well as the hosting platforms and procedures that we employ. We mitigate the risk of cyber incidents through a series of reviews, tests, tools and training. Certain insurance coverages may apply to certain cyber incidents. Overall, we expect the cost of securing our networks will increase in future periods, whether through increased staff, systems or insurance coverage.\nWhile we are not aware of any cyber incidents during the year ended December 31, 2020 that had a significant impact on our business, it is possible that we could experience an incident in future years, which could result in unanticipated costs.\nCurrency Fluctuations\nIn 2020, approximately 88% of our revenue and approximately 73% of our operating expenses were generated/incurred outside of the U.S. In 2019, approximately 89% of our revenue and approximately 72% of our operating expenses were generated/incurred outside of the U.S. In 2018, approximately 91% of our revenue and approximately 71% of our operating expenses were generated/incurred outside of the U.S. As a result, changes in currency exchange rates, especially the Euro exchange rate and the Canadian Dollar exchange rate, can have a significant impact on revenue and expenses.\nWhile the majority of our revenue is generated outside of the U.S., a significant amount of our revenue earned during the year ended December 31, 2020 was denominated in U.S. Dollars. In 2020, approximately 44% of our revenue was denominated in U.S. Dollars, 51% was denominated in Euros and 5% was denominated in other currencies. In 2019,\napproximately 47% of our revenue was denominated in U.S. Dollars, 49% was denominated in Euros and 9% was denominated in other currencies. In 2018, approximately 58% of our revenue was denominated in U.S. Dollars, 30% was denominated in Euros, and 12% was denominated in other currencies.\nIn general, to minimize the net impact of currency fluctuations on operating income, we attempt to denominate an amount of billings in a currency such that it would provide a hedge against the operating expenses being incurred in that currency. We expect that changes in currency rates may also impact our future results if we are unable to match amounts of revenue with our operating expenses in the same currency. If the amount of our revenue in Europe denominated in Euros continues as it is now or declines, we may not be able to balance fully the exposures of currency exchange rates on revenue and operating expenses.\nThe financial position and the results of operations of our foreign subsidiaries, with the exception of our subsidiaries in Switzerland, Singapore and Canada, are measured using the local currency as the functional currency. Accordingly, assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. Dollars using current exchange rates as of the balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates prevailing during the year. Translation adjustments arising from differences in exchange rates generated comprehensive gain of $4.5 million in 2020, comprehensive gain of $1.5 million in 2019 and comprehensive loss of $5.5 million in 2018. These amounts are included as a separate component of stockholders\u2019 equity. The functional currency for our subsidiaries in Switzerland, Singapore and Canada is the U.S. Dollar.\nGains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are included in the consolidated statements of operations in other income (expense). Foreign exchange transaction gains aggregated less than $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. We reported foreign exchange transaction losses of $1.5 million and $0.2 million during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nComponents of Operating Results\nRevenue\nWe generate revenue from the sale of our hardware products, software licenses, subscriptions, maintenance and support, and professional services. We believe comparison of revenues between periods is heavily influenced by the timing of orders and shipments reflecting the transactional nature of significant parts of our business.\n\u25cf Product and license revenue. Product and license revenue includes hardware products and software licenses, which can be provided on a perpetual or term basis.\n\u25cf Service and other revenue. Service and other revenue includes subscription solutions (which is our definition of software-as-a-service solutions), maintenance and support, and professional services.\nCost of Goods Sold\nOur total cost of goods sold consists of cost of product and license revenue and cost of service and other revenue. We expect our cost of goods sold to increase in absolute dollars as our business grows, although it may fluctuate as a percentage of total revenue from period to period.\n\u25cf Cost of product and license revenue. Cost of product and license revenue primarily consists of direct product and license costs.\n\u25cf Cost of service and other revenue. Cost of service and other revenue primarily consists of costs related to subscription solutions, including personnel and equipment costs, and personnel costs of employees providing professional services and maintenance and support.\nGross Profit\nGross profit as a percentage of total revenue, or gross margin, has been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors, including our average selling price, manufacturing costs, the mix of products sold, and the mix of revenue among products, subscriptions and services. We expect our gross margins to fluctuate over time depending on these factors.\nOperating Expenses\nOur operating expenses are generally based on anticipated revenue levels and fixed over short periods of time. As a result, small variations in revenue may cause significant variations in the period-to-period comparisons of operating income or operating income as a percentage of revenue.\nGenerally, the most significant factor driving our operating expenses is headcount. Direct compensation and benefit plan expenses generally represent between 60% and 65% of our operating expenses. In addition, a number of other expense categories are directly related to headcount. We attempt to manage our headcount within the context of the economic environments in which we operate and the investments we believe we need to make for our infrastructure to support future growth and for our products to remain competitive.\nHistorically, operating expenses have been impacted by changes in foreign exchange rates. We estimate the change in currency rates in 2020 compared to 2019 resulted in an increase in operating expenses of approximately $0.7 million in 2020.\nThe comparison of operating expenses can also be impacted significantly by costs related to our stock-based and long-term incentive plans. For full-year 2020, 2019, and 2018, operating expenses included $6.0 million, $5.3 million, and $6.1 million, respectively, related to stock-based and long-term incentive plans. Long-term incentive plan compensation expense includes both cash and stock-based incentives.\n\u25cf Sales and marketing. Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel costs, commissions and bonuses, trade shows, marketing programs and other marketing activities, travel, outside consulting costs, and long-term incentive compensation. We expect sales and marketing expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to invest in sales resources in key focus areas, although our sales and marketing expenses may fluctuate as a percentage of total revenue.\n\u25cf Research and development. Research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs and long-term incentive compensation. We expect research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to invest in our future solutions, although our research and development expenses may fluctuate as a percentage of total revenue.\n\u25cf General and administrative. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs, legal and other professional fees, and long-term incentive compensation. We expect general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollars although our general and administrative expenses may fluctuate as a percentage of total revenue.\n\u25cf Amortization/impairment of intangible assets. Acquired intangible assets are amortized over their respective amortization periods, and are periodically evaluated for impairment.\nInterest Income, Net\nInterest income consists of income earned on our cash equivalents and short term investments. Our cash equivalents and short term investments are invested in short-term instruments at current market rates.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther income (expense), net primarily includes exchange gains (losses) on transactions that are denominated in currencies other than our subsidiaries\u2019 functional currencies, subsidies received from foreign governments in support of our research and development in those countries and other miscellaneous non-operational expenses.\nIncome Taxes\nOur effective tax rate reflects our global structure related to the ownership of our intellectual property (\u201cIP\u201d). All our IP in our traditional authentication business is owned by two subsidiaries, one in the U.S. and one in Switzerland. These two subsidiaries have entered into agreements with most of the other OneSpan entities under which those other entities provide services to our U.S. and Swiss subsidiaries on either a percentage of revenue or on a cost plus basis or both. Under this structure, the earnings of our service provider subsidiaries are relatively constant. These service provider companies tend to be in jurisdictions with higher effective tax rates. Fluctuations in earnings tend to flow to the U.S. company and Swiss company. In 2020, earnings flowing to the U.S. company are expected to be taxed at a rate of 21% to 25%, while earnings flowing to the Swiss company are expected to be taxed at a rate ranging from 11% to 12%, plus Swiss withholding tax of an additional 5%. A Canadian and UK subsidiary currently sell to and service global customers directly. In addition, many of our OneSpan entities operate as distributors for all of our OneSpan products.\nAs the majority of our revenues are generated outside of the U.S., our consolidated effective tax rate is strongly influenced by the effective tax rate of our foreign operations. Changes in the effective rate related to foreign operations reflect changes in the geographic mix of earnings and the tax rates in each of the countries in which it is earned. The statutory tax rate for the primary foreign tax jurisdictions ranges from 11% to 35%.\nThe geographic mix of earnings of our foreign subsidiaries primarily depends on the level of pretax income of our service provider subsidiaries and the benefit realized in Switzerland through the sales of product. The level of pretax income in our service provider subsidiaries is expected to vary based on:\n1. the staff, programs and services offered on a yearly basis by the various subsidiaries as determined by management, or\n2. the changes in exchange rates related to the currencies in the service provider subsidiaries, or\n3. the amount of revenues that the service provider subsidiaries generate.\nFor items 1 and 2 above, there is a direct impact in the opposite direction on earnings of the U.S. and Swiss entities. Any change from item 3 is generally expected to result in a larger change in income in the U.S. and Swiss entities in the direction of the change (increased revenues expected to result in increased margins/pretax profits and conversely decreased revenues expected to result in decreased margins/pretax profits).\nIn addition to the provision of services, the intercompany agreements transfer the majority of the business risk to our U.S. and Swiss subsidiaries. As a result, the contracting subsidiaries\u2019 pretax income is reasonably assured while the pretax income of the U.S. and Swiss subsidiaries varies directly with our overall success in the market.\nIn November 2015, we acquired OneSpan Canada Inc. (formerly eSignLive), a foreign company with substantial IP and net operating losses and other tax carryforwards. The tax benefit of the carryforwards has been fully reserved as realization has not been deemed more likely than not.\nIn May 2018, we acquired Dealflo Limited (\u201cDealflo\u201d), a foreign company with substantial IP and net operating losses. The tax benefit of the loss carryforwards will be reserved to the extent they exceed the deferred tax liabilities recognized upon acquisition as realization has not been deemed more likely than not.\nResults of Operations\nThe following tables summarize our consolidated results of operations for the periods presented.\nRevenue\nRevenue by Product: We generate revenue from the sale of our hardware products, software licenses, subscriptions, professional services, and maintenance and support. Product and license revenue includes hardware products and software licenses. Service and other revenue includes subscription solutions (which is our definition of software-as-a-service solutions), maintenance and support, and professional services.\nYears ended December 31,\nChange\n$\n%\n(in thousands)\nRevenue\nHardware\n$\n81,849\n$\n127,005\n$\n(45,156)\n(36)%\nSoftware licenses\n51,137\n56,308\n(5,171)\n(9)%\nSubscription\n27,788\n22,280\n5,508\n25%\nProfessional services\n5,689\n5,759\n(70)\n(1)%\nMaintenance, support and other\n49,228\n42,132\n7,096\n17%\nTotal revenue\n$\n215,691\n$\n253,484\n$\n(37,793)\n(15)%\nTotal revenue decreased $37.8 million or 15%, during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The overall decrease in revenue was comprised of a $45.2 million decrease in hardware revenue and a $13.7 million decrease in perpetual software license revenue, partially offset by an increase in recurring revenue, which is the portion of our revenue subject to future renewal. Recurring revenue, comprised of subscription, term-based software license, and maintenance, support and other revenue, increased $21.1 million or 26% during the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. Year-over-year revenue comparisons were affected by the one-time positive impact on 2019 revenue from the PSD2 regulation deadline. We also experienced reduced demand for our hardware products and perpetual software licenses due to an uncertain near-term business outlook for certain of our customers as a result of the pandemic.\nProduct and license revenue decreased $50.3 million or 27% during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, which was largely driven by a decrease in hardware sales. Hardware sales increased during the year ended December 31, 2019 related to the PSD2 regulation deadline. The decrease in hardware sales in 2020 is attributed to a reduction in demand following the PSD2 deadline, increased adoption of digital alternatives, and reduced demand due to the pandemic. Perpetual software license sales also decreased during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, which we attribute to our strategy focused on growing recurring software revenue over perpetual licenses combined with softened demand as a result of the pandemic.\nServices and other revenue increased by $12.5 million, or 18% during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 was driven by higher subscription and maintenance revenue.\nWe believe comparison of revenues between periods is heavily influenced by the timing of orders and shipments reflecting the transactional nature of significant parts of our business. As a result of the volatility in our business, we believe that the overall strength of our business is best evaluated over a longer term where the impact of transactions in any given period is not as significant as in a quarter-over-quarter comparison.\nRevenue by Geographic Regions: We classify our sales by customer location in three geographic regions: 1) EMEA, which includes Europe, Middle East and Africa; 2) the Americas, which includes sales in North, Central, and South America; and 3) Asia Pacific (APAC), which also includes Australia, New Zealand, and India. The breakdown of revenue in each of our major geographic areas was as follows:\nYears ended December 31,\n$ Change\n% Change\n(in thousands)\nRevenue\nEMEA\n$ 117,086\n$ 145,942\n($ 28,856)\n(20)%\nAmericas\n53,171\n61,577\n(8,406)\n(14)%\nAPAC\n45,434\n45,965\n(531)\n(1)%\nTotal revenue\n$ 215,691\n$ 253,484\n($ 37,793)\n(15)%\n% of Total Revenue\nEMEA\n54%\n58%\nAmericas\n25%\n24%\nAPAC\n21%\n18%\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, revenue generated in EMEA was $28.9 million or 20% lower than the same period in 2019, driven by lower hardware sales, partially offset by higher maintenance and professional services revenue. Hardware revenue comparisons were affected by the one-time positive impact on 2019 revenue from the PSD2 regulation deadline.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, revenue generated in the Americas was $8.4 million or 14% lower than the same period in 2019, driven by lower hardware and software license revenue, partially offset by higher subscription revenue.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, revenue generated in the Asia Pacific region was $0.5 million or 1% lower than the same period in 2019, driven by lower hardware revenue, partially offset by higher maintenance and professional services revenue.\nCost of Goods Sold and Gross Margin\nYear ended December 31,\n$\n% Change\n(in thousands)\nCost of goods sold\nProduct and license\n$ 41,820\n$ 63,393\n($ 21,573)\n(34)%\nServices and other\n21,619\n18,569\n3,050\n16%\nTotal cost of goods sold\n$ 63,439\n$ 81,962\n($ 18,523)\n(23)%\nGross profit\n$ 152,252\n$ 171,522\n(19,270)\n(11)%\nGross margin\nProduct and license\n69%\n65%\nServices and other\n74%\n74%\nTotal gross margin\n71%\n68%\nThe cost of product and license revenue decreased $21.6 million or 34% during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in cost of product and license was driven by lower hardware sales.\nThe cost of services and other revenue increased by $3.1 million, or 16% during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in cost of services and other revenue is reflective of higher subscription revenue, which has increased cloud-based infrastructure costs.\nGross profit decreased $19.3 million, or 11% during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. Gross profit margin was 71% for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 68% for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in profit margin for the year ended December 31, 2020 was driven by stronger margins for product and license.\nThe majority of our inventory purchases are denominated in U.S. Dollars. Our sales are denominated in various currencies including the Euro. The impact of changes in currency rates are estimated to have increased revenue by $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Had currency rates in 2020 been equal to rates in 2019, the gross profit margins would have been approximately one percentage point lower for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nOperating Expenses\nYear ended December 31,\n$\n% Change\n(in thousands)\nOperating costs\nSales and marketing\n$\n60,856\n$\n61,503\n($ 647)\n(1)%\nResearch and development\n41,194\n42,463\n(1,269)\n(3)%\nGeneral and administrative\n46,338\n43,897\n2,441\n6%\nAmortization of intangible assets\n9,122\n9,470\n(348)\n(4)%\nTotal operating costs\n$\n157,510\n$\n157,333\n$ 177\n0%\nSales and Marketing Expenses\nSales and marketing expenses decreased $0.6 million, or 1% during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. Lower travel spend were partially offset by costs associated with higher headcount during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nAverage full-time sales and marketing employee headcount for year ended December 31, 2020 was 356, compared to 319 for year ended December 31, 2019. Average headcount in 2020 was 12% higher than in 2019.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses decreased $1.3 million, or 3% during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily driven by lower cloud computing costs for our test environment and lower travel costs, partially offset by higher personnel costs.\nAverage full-time research and development employee headcount for year ended December 31, 2020 was 328, compared to 302 for year ended December 31, 2019. Average headcount in 2020 was 9% higher than in 2019.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased $2.4 million, or 6% during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 was driven by higher personnel costs which included additional stock comp due to an increase in eligible participants. The increase in expense was also driven by higher consulting spend, additional expense for subscription software tools and higher bad debt expense driven by a higher allowance for the likely adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Lower travel costs partially offset spend increases.\nAverage full-time general and administrative employee headcount for year ended December 31, 2020 was 125, compared to 113 for the year ended December 31, 2019. Average headcount in 2020 was 11% higher than in 2019.\nAmortization of Intangible Assets\nAmortization of intangible assets for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $9.1 million, compared to $9.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of $0.3 million or 4%. The decrease was driven by certain technology assets becoming fully amortized during the year.\nInterest Income, net\nYear ended December 31,\n$ Change\n% Change\n(in thousands)\nInterest income, net\n$ 404\n$ 747\n($ 343)\n(46)%\nInterest income, net was $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in interest income for 2020 compared to 2019 reflects a decrease in interest rates during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nOther Income, Net\nYear ended December 31,\n$ Change\n% Change\n(in thousands)\nOther income (expense), net\n$ 1,434\n($ 527)\n$ 1,961\n(372)%\nOther income (expense) , net primarily includes exchange gains (losses) on transactions that are denominated in currencies other than our subsidiaries\u2019 functional currencies, subsidies received from foreign governments in support of our research and development in those countries, and other miscellaneous non-operational, non-recurring expenses.\nOther income (expense), net for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $1.4 million, compared to $(0.5) million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Higher income for the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily driven by exchange gains on transactions that are denominated in currencies other than our subsidiaries\u2019 functional currencies.\nProvision for income taxes\nYear ended December 31,\n$\n% Change\n(in thousands)\nProvision for income taxes\n$ 2,035\n$ 6,545\n($ 4,510)\n(69)%\nIncome tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $2.0 million compared to $6.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in expense was attributable to decreased profits in the period excluding losses at entities where we cannot record a tax benefit, as well as a higher uncertain tax positions recorded in 2019 of $1.6 million.\nLoss Carryforwards Available\nAt December 31, 2020, we have gross deferred tax assets of $30.0 million resulting from foreign and state NOL carryforwards of $119.5 million and other foreign deductible carryforwards of $64.7 million. At December 31, 2020, we have a valuation allowance of $19.8 million against deferred tax assets related to certain carryforwards. See Note 13 - Income taxes for more information regarding carryforwards and valuation allowances.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had net cash balances (total cash and cash equivalents) of $88.4 million and short-term investments of $26.9 million. Short term investments consist of U.S. treasury bills and notes, government agency notes, corporate notes and bonds, and high quality commercial paper with maturities at acquisition of more than three months and less than twelve months. At December 31, 2019, we had net cash balances of $84.3 million and short-term investments of $25.5 million.\nWe are in a lease agreement that required a letter of credit in the amount of $0.8 million to secure the obligation. The restricted cash related to this letter of credit is recorded in other non-current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we held $52.0 million of cash and cash equivalents in subsidiaries outside of the United States. Of that amount, $51.4 million is not subject to repatriation restrictions, but may be subject to taxes upon repatriation.\nWe believe that our financial resources are adequate to meet our operating needs over the next twelve months.\nOur cash flows are as follows:\nYear ended December 31,\n(in thousands)\nCash provided by (used in):\nOperating activities\n$ 14,922\n$ 18,244\n1,226\nInvesting activities\n(4,664)\n(9,893)\nFinancing activities\n(7,060)\n(569)\n(970)\nEffect of foreign exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents\n(208)\n(1,556)\nOperating Activities\nCash generated by operating activities is primarily comprised of net income, as adjusted for non-cash items, and changes in operating assets and liabilities. Non-cash adjustments consist primarily of amortization and impairment of intangible assets, depreciation of property and equipment, and stock-based compensation. We expect cash inflows from operating activities to be affected by increases or decreases in sales and timing of collections. Our primary uses of cash from operating activities have been for personnel costs. We expect cash outflows from operating activities to be affected by increases in personnel cost as we grow our business.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, $14.9 million of cash was provided by operating activities. Cash of $18.2 million and $1.2 million was provided by operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nOur working capital at December 31, 2020 was $131.9 million, a decrease of $4.1 million or 3% from $136.0 million at December 31, 2019. The decrease is due to lower accounts receivable and higher deferred revenue, driven by the timing of revenue contracts with customers.\nInvesting Activities\nThe changes in cash flows from investing activities primarily relate to timing of purchases, maturities and sales of investments, purchases of property and equipment, and activity in connection with acquisitions. We expect to continue to purchase property and equipment to support the continued growth of our business as well to continue to invest in our infrastructure and activity in connection with acquisitions.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, cash of $4.7 million and $9.9 million, respectively, was used in investing activities, which was primarily driven by the purchase of property and equipment, as well as purchases of short term investments which were partially offset by the maturity of short term investments.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, cash of $0.2 million was provided by investing activities, which was driven by the maturity of short term investments, partially offset by the purchase of Dealflo and purchase of short term investments.\nFinancing Activities\nThe changes in cash flows from financing activities primarily related to the purchases of common stock under our share repurchase program and tax payments for restricted stock issuances.\nOn June 10, 2020, the Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program (\u201cprogram\u201d), pursuant to which the Company can repurchase up to $50.0 million of issued and outstanding common stock. Share purchases under the program will take place in open market transactions or in privately negotiated transactions and may be made from time to time depending on market conditions, share price, trading volume, and other factors. The timing of the repurchases and the amount of stock repurchased in each transaction is subject to OneSpan\u2019s sole discretion and will depend upon market and business conditions, applicable legal and credit requirements and other corporate considerations. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company repurchased 0.3 million shares of the Company\u2019s stock for $5.0 million in the aggregate at an average cost of $20.10 per share under its repurchase program. The authorization is effective until June 10, 2022 unless the total amount has been used or authorization has been cancelled.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, net cash used in financing activities was $7.1 million, which was comprised of $5.0 million of common stock repurchased and $2.0 million of tax payments for restricted stock issuances.\nCash of $0.6 million and $1.0 million was used in financing activities during the years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. The cash usage was comprised of tax payments for restricted stock issuances in both periods.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe Company has no off-balance sheet arrangements.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nThe following summarizes our contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2020:\nPayments due by period\n2-3\n4-5\nMore than\nTotal\n1 year\nyears\nyears\n5 years\nOperating lease obligations\n$\n15,254\n$\n2,814\n$\n4,646\n$\n2,527\n$\n5,267\nPurchase obligations\n23,921\n20,586\n3,323\n-\nTaxes payable\n7,148\n1,053\n3,027\n3,068\n-\n$\n46,323\n$\n24,453\n$\n10,996\n$\n5,607\n$\n5,267\nWe have purchase obligations of $23.9 million, including $12.7 million of inventory purchase obligations which are expected to be consummated in the next 12 months, $5.8 million of committed hosting arrangements which will be used in the next one to four years, and $5.4 million for other software agreements related to the administration of our business which range from one to five years.\nThe operating lease obligations above do not include common area maintenance (\u201cCAM\u201d) charges or real estate taxes under our operating leases, for which the Company is also obligated. These charges are generally not fixed and can fluctuate from year to year.\nTaxes payable primarily represents deemed repatriation tax from 2017. The Company had $0.5 million, $2.9 million and $0.4 million of unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2020, December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively, which have been set aside in a reserve in accordance with ASC 740 Income Taxes. The amounts are not included in the above table as the timing of payment of such obligations, if any, is not determinable.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations discusses our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.\nOn an on-going basis, management evaluates its estimates and judgments, including those related to bad debts, net realizable value of inventory and intangible assets. Management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Management believes the following critical accounting policies affect significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nOn January 1, 2018, we adopted FASB Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 606, \u201cRevenue from Contracts with Customers\u201d, or \u201cTopic 606\u201d using the modified retrospective method applied to those contracts which were not completed as of January 1, 2018. Results for reporting periods beginning after January 1, 2018 are presented under Topic 606. We recorded a net increase to opening Retained Earnings of $11.9 million, net of tax, as of January 1, 2018 due to the cumulative impact of adopting Topic 606, with the impact primarily related to the accounting impacts of our customer contracts that include a term license to our software, as well as the impact of accounting for costs incurred to obtain our contracts. See Note 6 - Revenue for further details. We determine revenue recognition through the following steps:\n\u25cf Identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer;\n\u25cf Identification of the performance obligations in the contract;\n\u25cf Determination of the transaction price;\n\u25cf Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and\n\u25cf Recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation.\nRevenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those products or services, which excludes any sales incentives and amounts collected on behalf of third parties. Taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction, that are collected by the Company from a customer, are excluded from revenue. Shipping and handling costs associated with outbound freight\nafter control over a product has transferred to a customer are accounted for as a fulfillment cost and are included in cost of goods sold.\nNature of Goods and Services\nWe derive our revenues primarily from Product and License Revenue, which includes hardware products and software licenses, and Services and Other, which is inclusive of software-as-a-service (which we refer to as \u201csubscription\u201d, or \u201cSaaS\u201d), maintenance and support, and professional services.\nProduct Revenue: Revenue from the sale of security hardware is recorded upon shipment, which is the point at which control of the goods are transferred and the completion of the performance obligations, unless there are specific terms that would suggest control is transferred at a later date (e.g. delivery). No significant obligations or contingencies typically exist with regard to delivery, customer acceptance or rights of return at the time revenue is recognized. Customer invoices and subsequent payments normally correspond with delivery.\nLicense Revenue: Revenue from the sale of software licenses is recorded upon the latter of when the customer receives the ability to access the software or when they are legally allowed to use the software. No significant obligations or contingencies exist with regard to delivery, customer acceptance or rights of return at the time revenue is recognized. Contracts with customers for distinct licenses of intellectual property include perpetual licenses, which grant the customer unlimited access to the software, and term licenses which limit the customer\u2019s access to the software to a specific time period. We offer term licenses ranging from one to five years in length. Customer payments normally correspond with delivery for perpetual licenses. For term licenses, payments are either on installment or in advance. In limited circumstances, we integrate third party software solutions into our software products. We have determined that, consistent with our conclusion under prior revenue recognition rules, generally we act as the principal with respect to the satisfaction of the related performance obligation and record the corresponding revenue on a gross basis from these transactions. For transactions in which we do not act as the principal, we would recognize revenue on a net basis. The fees owed to the third parties are recognized as a component of cost of goods sold when the revenue is recognized.\nSubscription Revenue: We generate subscription revenues from our cloud services offerings. Subscription revenues mostly include fees from customers for access to the OneSpan Sign, TID, and Dealflo solutions. Our standard customer arrangements do not provide the customer with the right to take possession of the software supporting the cloud-based application service at any time. As such, these arrangements are considered service contracts and revenue is recognized ratably over the service period of the contract. Customer payments are normally in advance for annual service.\nMaintenance, Support and Other: Maintenance and support agreements generally call for us to provide software updates and technical support, respectively, to customers. The annual fee for maintenance and technical support is recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance and support agreement as this is the period the services are delivered. Customer payments are normally in advance for annual service.\nProfessional Services: Professional services revenues are primarily comprised of implementing, automating and extending business processes, technology infrastructure, and software applications. Professional services revenues are recognized over time as services are rendered, usually over a period of time that is generally less than a few months. Most projects are performed on a time and materials basis, while a portion of revenues is derived from projects performed on a fixed fee. For time and material contracts, revenues are generally recognized and invoiced by multiplying the number of hours expended in the performance of the contract by the contractual hourly rates. For fixed fee contracts, revenues are generally recognized using an input method based on the ratio of hours expended to total estimated hours to complete the services. Customer payments normally correspond with delivery.\nMultiple-Element Arrangements\nIn our typical multiple-element arrangement, the primary deliverables include:\n1.A client component (i.e. an item that is used by the person being authenticated in the form of either a new standalone hardware device or software that is downloaded onto a device that the customer already owns);\n2.Server system software that is installed on the customer\u2019s systems (i.e., software on the server system that verifies the identity of the person being authenticated) or licenses for additional users on the server system software if the server system software had been installed previously; and\n3.Post contract support (PCS) in the form of maintenance on the server system software or support.\nOur multiple-element arrangements may also include other items that are usually delivered\nprior to the recognition of any revenue are incidental to the overall transaction such as initialization of the hardware device, customization of the hardware device itself or the packaging in which it is delivered, deployment services where we deliver the device to our customer\u2019s end-use customer or employee and, in some limited cases, professional services to assist with the initial implementation of a new customer.\nSignificant Judgments\nWe enter into contracts to deliver a combination of hardware devices, software licenses, subscriptions, maintenance and support and, in some situations, professional services. The Company evaluates the nature of the goods or services promised in these arrangements to identify the distinct performance obligations. Determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment depending on the terms and conditions of the respective customer arrangement. When a hardware client device and licenses to server software are sold in a contract, they are treated as a single performance obligation because the software license is deemed to be a component of the hardware that is integral to the functionality of the hardware that is used by our customers for identity authentication. When a software client device is sold in a contract server software, the licenses are considered a single performance obligation to deliver the authentication solution to the customer. In either of these types of arrangements, maintenance and support and professional services are typically distinct separate performance obligations from the hardware or software solutions. Our contracts to deliver subscription services typically do not include multiple performance obligations; however, in certain limited cases customers may purchase professional services that are distinct performance obligations.\nFor contracts that contain multiple performance obligations, the transaction price is allocated to the separate performance obligations based on their estimated relative standalone selling price. Judgment is required to determine the stand-alone selling price (\u201cSSP\u201d) of each distinct performance obligation. We determine SSP for maintenance and support and professional services based on observable inputs; specifically, the range of prices charged to customers to renew annual maintenance and support contracts and the range of hourly rates we charge our customers in standalone professional services contracts. In instances where SSP is not directly observable, and when we sell at a highly variable price range, such as for transactions involving software licenses or subscriptions, we determine the SSP for those performance obligations using the residual method.\nCredit Losses\nWe adopted ASU No. 2016-13, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, on January 1, 2020. As a result of the adoption, we amended the accounting policies for the allowance for credit losses. In accordance with ASU No. 2016-13, the Company evaluates its allowance based on expected losses rather than incurred losses, which is known as the current expected credit loss (\u201cCECL\u201d) model. The allowance is determined using the loss rate approach and is measured on a collective (pool) basis when similar risk characteristics exist. Where financial instruments do not share risk characteristics, they are evaluated on an individual basis. The allowance is based on relevant available information, from internal and external sources, relating to past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts.\nIncome Taxes\nAs a global company, we calculate and provide for income taxes in each tax jurisdiction in which we operate. The provision for income taxes includes the amounts payable or refundable for the current year, the effect of deferred taxes and impacts from uncertain tax positions. Our provision for income taxes is significantly affected by shifts in the geographic mix of our pre-tax earnings across tax jurisdictions, changes in tax laws and regulations, and tax planning opportunities available in each tax jurisdiction.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of our assets and liabilities and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates that will apply to taxable income in the years in which those differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Valuation allowances are established for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. We recognize the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities and in income in the period that includes the enactment date.\nWe recognize tax benefits for tax positions that are more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities. The amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. Unrecognized tax benefits are tax benefits claimed in our income tax returns that do not meet these recognition and measurement standards. Assumptions, judgments, and the use of estimates are required in determining whether the \u201cmore likely than not\u201d standard has been met when developing the provision for income taxes.\nWe recognize the tax impact of including certain foreign earnings in U.S. taxable income as a period cost. We have recognized deferred income taxes for local country income and withholding taxes that could be incurred on distributions of non-U.S. earnings because we do not plan to indefinitely reinvest such earnings.\nWe monitor for changes in tax laws and reflect the impacts of tax law changes in the period of enactment.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nIn September 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (Topic 326), which amends the Board\u2019s guidance on the impairment of financial instruments. The ASU adds an impairment model that is based on expected losses rather than incurred losses, which is known as the current expected credit loss (\u201cCECL\u201d) model. The CECL model applies to most debt instruments (other than those measured at fair value), trade and other receivables, financial guarantee contracts, and loan commitments. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company adopted ASC 326 as of January 1, 2020, using the cumulative-effect transition method with the required prospective approach. The cumulative-effect transition method enables an entity to record an allowance for expected credit losses at the date of adoption without restating comparative periods. The cumulative-effect adjustment for adoption of ASC 326 resulted in a decrease of $0.3 million in Accounts receivable, net of allowances and Retained Earnings as of January 1, 2020.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350) - Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment. This standard eliminates the requirement to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill to measure a goodwill impairment charge (i.e. Step 2 of the current guidance), instead measuring the impairment charge as the excess of the reporting unit's carrying amount over its fair value (i.e. Step 1 of the current guidance). The guidance was effective for us beginning in the first quarter of 2020, and should be applied prospectively. Early adoption is permitted for impairment testing dates after January 1, 2017. We adopted this standard on January 1, 2020 on a prospective basis. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-13, Disclosure Framework - Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement (\u201cASU 2018-13\u201d), which amends ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement. ASU 2018-13 modifies the disclosure requirements for fair value measurements by removing, modifying, or adding certain disclosures. The ASU is effective for annual periods, including interim periods within those annual periods, beginning\nafter December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted for removed or modified disclosures, and delayed adoption of the additional disclosures until their effective date. We adopted this standard on January 1, 2020 on a retrospective basis. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-15, Customer's Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement, which helps entities evaluate the accounting for fees paid by a customer in a cloud computing arrangement (CCA) by providing guidance for determining when an arrangement includes a software license and when an arrangement is solely a hosted CCA service. Under ASU 2018-15, customers will apply the same criteria for capitalizing implementation costs as they would for an arrangement that has a software license. The new guidance also prescribes the balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow classification of the capitalized implementation costs and related amortization expense, and requires additional quantitative and qualitative disclosures. We adopted this standard on January 1, 2020 on a prospective basis. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-14, Compensation-Retirement Benefits-Defined Benefit Plans-General (Topic 715-20): Disclosure Framework-Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Defined Benefit Plans (ASU 2018-14), which modifies the disclosure requirements for defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement plans. ASU 2018-14 is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2020, and earlier adoption is permitted. The adoption of the standard was not materially impactful to our consolidated financial statements and disclosures.\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, Simplification for Accounting for Income Taxes, which removes certain exceptions for recognizing deferred taxes for investments, performing intraperiod allocation and calculating income taxes in interim periods. The ASU also adds guidance to reduce complexity in certain areas, including recognizing deferred taxes for tax goodwill and allocating taxes to members of a consolidated group. ASU 2019-12 was effective beginning January 1, 2021. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our financial statements.\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting. This update provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying generally accepted accounting principles to certain contract modifications and hedging relationships that reference London Inter-bank Offered Rate (LIBOR) or another reference rate expected to be discontinued. The guidance is effective upon issuance and can be applied through December 31, 2022. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements.\nFrom time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the FASB or other standard setting bodies that are adopted by us as of the specified effective date. Unless otherwise discussed, our management believes that the issued standards that are not yet effective will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption.",
    "item_7A": "Item 7A - Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk (In thousands)\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk - In 2020, approximately 88% of our business was conducted outside the United States, primarily in Europe, Latin America and Asia/Pacific. A significant portion of our business operations is transacted in foreign currencies. As a result, we have exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations. We are affected by both foreign currency translation and transaction adjustments. Translation adjustments result from the conversion of the foreign subsidiaries\u2019 balance sheets and income statements to U.S. Dollars at year-end exchange rates and weighted average exchange rates, respectively. Translation adjustments resulting from this process are recorded directly into stockholders\u2019 equity. Transaction adjustments result from currency exchange movements when one of our companies transacts business in a currency that differs from its local currency. These adjustments are recorded as gains or losses in our statements of operations. Our business transactions are spread across numerous countries and currencies. This geographic diversity reduces the risk to our operating results. As noted in Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis above, we attempt to minimize the net impact of currency on operating earnings by denominating an amount of billings in a currency such that it would provide a hedge against the operating expenses being incurred in that currency.\nInterest Rate Risk - We have minimal interest rate risk. We had no debt outstanding at December 31, 2020. Our cash, cash equivalents, and short term investments are invested in short-term instruments at current market rates. If rates were to increase or decrease by one percentage point, the Company\u2019s interest income would increase or decrease approximately $0.3 million annually.",

Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure (i) information required to be disclosed by us in our reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s rules and forms, and (ii) information required to be disclosed by us in our reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based upon that evaluation, our management have concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures are effective as of December 31, 2020, to give reasonable assurance that the information required by us in reports filed under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time period specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nManagement\u2019s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThe management of OneSpan Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the Company\u2019s principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the Company\u2019s board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that: (1) Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (2) Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (3) Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nOur management, led by our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, using the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013).\nManagement\u2019s evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting determined that the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria as of December 31, 2020.\nKPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020 included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and has issued its report on the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, included on page 53 of this annual report.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as that term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended December 31, 2020, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting\nLimitations on the Effectiveness of Controls\nInternal control over financial reporting has inherent limitations. Internal control over financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures. Internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper management override. Because of such limitations, there is a risk that material misstatements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting. However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process. Therefore, it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate.\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Stockholders and Board of Directors\nOneSpan Inc.:\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited OneSpan Inc. and subsidiaries\u2019 (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), stockholders\u2019 equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes and financial statement schedule II (collectively, the consolidated financial statements), and our report dated February 25, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company\u2019s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management\u2019s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become\ninadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ KPMG LLP\nChicago, Illinois\nFebruary 25, 2021",

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2020, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 25, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting.\nChanges in Accounting Principle\nAs discussed in Notes 2 and 11 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has changed its method of accounting for credit losses on financial instruments as of January 1, 2020 due to the adoption of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-13, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, and as discussed in Notes 2 and 12 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its method of accounting for leases as of January 1, 2019 due to the adoption of Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 842, Leases.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company\u2019s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nRevenue from contracts containing software licenses with terms and conditions that are unique to individual contracts\nAs discussed in Notes 2 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company enters into contracts to deliver a combination of hardware devices, software licenses, subscriptions, maintenance and support and, in some situations, professional services. The Company evaluates the nature of the goods and services promised in these arrangements to identify the distinct performance obligations. Certain arrangements contain terms and conditions that are unique to the individual contracts and may vary with regard to the number and type of promises included. The Company recognized total revenue of $215.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nWe identified the evaluation of revenue from contracts containing software licenses with terms and conditions that are unique to individual contracts as a critical audit matter. Specifically, auditor judgment was required to evaluate the Company's identification of performance obligations in such contracts, including for contracts with new customers or contracts that were amended with existing customers.\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the Company\u2019s revenue recognition process. This included controls relating to the identification of performance obligations and evaluation of unique terms and conditions present in individual contracts. We tested a selection of contracts, including contracts with new customers or contracts that were amended with existing customers, by obtaining and reading the underlying contract and accounting analysis to evaluate the Company\u2019s identification performance obligations. Specifically, we evaluated the completeness and accuracy of the Company\u2019s identification of terms and conditions that were unique to the selected contracts and the Company\u2019s determination of the impact of those terms and conditions on revenue recognition.\n/s/ KPMG LLP\nWe have served as the Company\u2019s auditor since 1996.\nChicago, Illinois\nFebruary 25, 2021\nOneSpan Inc.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(in thousands, except per share data)\nASSETS\nCurrent assets\nCash and equivalents\n$\n88,394\n$\n84,282\nShort term investments\n26,859\n25,511\nAccounts receivable, net of allowances of $4,135 in 2020 and $2,524 in 2019\n57,537\n62,405\nInventories, net\n13,093\n19,819\nPrepaid expenses\n7,837\n6,198\nContract assets\n7,202\n5,240\nOther current assets\n6,256\n6,346\nTotal current assets\n207,178\n209,801\nProperty and equipment, net\n11,835\n11,454\nOperating lease right-of-use assets\n11,356\n10,580\nGoodwill\n97,552\n94,612\nIntangible assets, net of accumulated amortization\n27,196\n36,209\nDeferred income taxes\n7,030\n7,863\nContract assets -

OneSpan has operations in Austria, Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Japan, The Netherlands, Singapore, Switzerland, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom (U.K.), and the United States (U.S.).\nIn accordance with ASC 280, Segment Reporting, our operations are reported as a single operating segment. The chief operating decision maker is the Chief Executive Officer who reviews the statement of operations of the Company on a consolidated basis, makes decisions and manages the operations of the Company as a single operating segment.\nImpact of COVID-19 pandemic\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization recognized a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) as a pandemic. In response to the pandemic, the United States and various foreign, state and local governments have, among other actions, imposed travel and business restrictions and required or advised communities in which we do business to adopt stay-at-home orders and social distancing guidelines, causing some businesses to adjust, reduce or suspend operating activities. The pandemic and the various governments\u2019 responses have caused significant and widespread uncertainty, volatility and disruptions in the U.S. and global economies, including in the regions in which we operate.\nBeginning in the Summer of 2020 and continuing through the year ended December 31, 2020, we experienced lengthened sales cycles and reduced demand for some of our security solutions due to economic uncertainty connected with the COVID-19 pandemic. The most significant impact of the pandemic on our business has been a sharp drop in demand for our hardware authentication products and delays in the implementation of certain software security solutions.\nAs we cannot predict the duration or scope of the pandemic or its impact on economic and financial markets, any future negative impact to our results cannot be reasonably estimated, but it could be material. We continue to monitor closely the Company\u2019s financial health and liquidity and the impact of the pandemic on the Company. We are able to serve the needs of our customers while taking steps to protect the health and safety of our employees, customers, partners, and communities.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of OneSpan Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nEstimates and Assumptions\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nNote 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents are stated at cost plus accrued interest, which approximates fair value. Cash equivalents are high-quality short term money market instruments and commercial paper with maturities at acquisition of three months or less. Cash and cash equivalents are held by a number of U.S. and non-U.S. commercial banks and money market investment funds. We are in a lease agreement that required a letter of credit in the amount of $0.8 million to secure the obligation. The restricted cash related to this letter of credit is recorded in other non-current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019.\nShort Term Investments\nThe Company\u2019s short term investments are in debt securities which consist of U.S treasury bills and notes, U.S. government agency notes, corporate notes, and high quality commercial paper with maturities at acquisition of more than three months and less than twelve months. The Company classifies its investments in debt securities as available-for-sale. The Company adopted ASU 2016-13, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, on January 1, 2020, which amended our accounting for available-for-sale debt securities. Credit impairments are recorded through an allowance rather than a direct write-down of the security and are recorded through a charge to the consolidated statement of operations. Unrealized gains or losses not related to credit impairments are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive gain/(loss) in the consolidated balance sheets. The Company reviews available-for-sale debt securities for impairments related to credit losses and other factors each quarter. As of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the unrealized gains and losses were not material.\nCredit Losses\nReasonable assurance of collection is a requirement for revenue recognition. Credit limit adjustments for existing customers may result from the periodic review of outstanding accounts receivable. The Company records trade accounts receivable at invoice values, which are generally equal to fair value.\nThe Company adopted ASU No. 2016-13, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, on January 1, 2020. As a result of the adoption, the Company amended its accounting policies for the allowance for credit losses. In accordance with ASU No. 2016-13, the Company evaluates its allowance based on expected losses rather than incurred losses, which is known as the current expected credit loss (\u201cCECL\u201d) model. The allowance is determined using the loss rate approach and is measured on a collective (pool) basis when similar risk characteristics exist. Where financial instruments do not share risk characteristics, they are evaluated on an individual basis. The allowance is based on relevant available information, from internal and external sources, relating to past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nAt December 31, 2020 and 2019, our financial instruments were cash and equivalents, short term investments, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities. The estimated fair value of our financial instruments has been determined by using available market information and appropriate valuation methodologies, as defined in ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements. The fair values of the financial instruments were not materially different from their carrying amounts at December 31, 2020 and 2019. See Note 10 - Fair Value Measurements for additional detail.\nInventories\nInventories, consisting principally of hardware and component parts, are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined using the first-in-first-out (FIFO) method. We write down inventory when it appears that the carrying cost of the inventory may not be recovered through subsequent sale of the inventory. We analyze the quantity of inventory on hand, the quantity sold in the past year, the anticipated sales volume in the form of sales to new customers as well as sales to previous customers, the expected sales price and the cost of making the sale when\nevaluating the valuation of our inventory. If the sales volume or sales price of a specific model declines significantly, additional write downs may be required.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment is stated at cost. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets ranging from three to ten years. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the lesser of the remaining lease term or 10 years. Additions and improvements are capitalized, while expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred. Gains or losses resulting from sales or retirements are recorded as incurred, at which time related costs and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts.\nAccounting for Leases\nAll of our leases are operating leases.\nUnder ASC 840 - For the Year ended December 31, 2018;\nRent expense on facility leases is charged evenly over the life of the lease, regardless of the timing of actual payments. We relocated one of our principal executive offices from Oakbrook Terrace, Illinois to Chicago, Illinois during 2018 and recognized $0.3 million of lease exit costs in general and administrative expense on the statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2018. Operating lease expense was $4.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nUnder ASC 842 - For the Years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019:\nThe Company adopted ASC Topic 842, Leases as of January 1, 2019, using the modified retrospective approach. Prior period amounts were not adjusted. In addition, the Company elected the following practical expedients:\n\u25cf The package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance within the new standard. The practical expedient package applies to leases commenced prior to adoption of the new standard and permits companies not to reassess whether existing or expired contracts contain a lease, the lease classification, and any initial direct costs for existing leases.\n\u25cf The short-term lease practical expedient, which allowed the Company to exclude short-term leases from recognition in the consolidated balance sheets;\n\u25cf We have lease agreements that contain lease and non-lease components. For automobile leases, we account for lease and non-lease components together. For office leases, we account for these components separately using a relative standalone selling basis; and\n\u25cf We apply the portfolio approach to automobile leases with similar characteristics that commence in the same period.\nThe adoption of this accounting standard resulted in the recording of Operating lease right-of-use (\u201cROU\u201d) assets and Operating lease liabilities of $9.2 million and $11.0 million, respectively, as of January 1, 2019. The difference between the asset and liability is a result of lease incentives, such as tenant improvement allowances, and deferred rent on the balance sheet at transition. The adoption of ASC Topic 842 had no impact on Retained earnings. See Note 12 - Leases for additional information.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of net identifiable assets acquired in a business combination. We assess the impairment of goodwill annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances\nindicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. During the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we assessed the impairment of goodwill in November. Upon becoming a large accelerated filer during the year ended December 31, 2020, we updated our accounting policy and shifted the annual impairment test to October 1, in order to allow for a greater amount of time to analyze our assessment in advance of the Company\u2019s new accelerated filing deadline. The change in date of the annual impairment assessment of goodwill did not have a material impact to the analysis or conclusions during the year ended December 31, 2020, and is unlikely to materially impact our conclusions of the analysis in future years.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company adopted ASU 2017-04, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350) - Simplifying the Test for Goodwill impairment. The guidance simplifies the goodwill impairment test to address concerns related to the existing test\u2019s cost and complexity by eliminating Step 2 of the previous goodwill impairment test, which required a hypothetical purchase price allocation to measure the amount of a goodwill impairment. Under the new guidance, the goodwill impairment test will consist of one step comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. An entity should recognize a goodwill impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit\u2019s fair value.\nThe Company\u2019s impairment assessment begins with a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. The qualitative assessment includes comparing the overall financial performance of the reporting unit against the planned results. Additionally, the reporting unit\u2019s fair value is assessed in light of certain events and circumstances, including macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, and other relevant entity- and reporting unit specific events. The selection and assessment of qualitative factors used to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds the carrying value involves significant judgments. If it is determined under the qualitative assessment that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, then the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is compared with its carrying value. An impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit\u2019s fair value.\nWe operate in one reporting unit and had no goodwill impairment recorded for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018.\nLong-Lived and Intangible Assets\nFinite-lived intangible assets include proprietary technology, customer relationships, and other intangible assets. Intangible assets other than patents with definite lives are amortized over the useful life, generally three to seven years for proprietary technology and five to twelve years for customer relationships. Patents are amortized over the life of the patent, generally 20 years in the U.S. Intangible assets arising from business combinations, such as acquired technology, customer relationships, and other intangible assets, are originally recorded at fair value.\nLong-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment, operating lease right-of-use assets, finite-lived intangible assets being amortized and capitalized software costs for internal use, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the long-lived asset group may not be recoverable. An impairment loss shall be recognized if the carrying amount of a long-lived asset group exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. If it is determined that an impairment loss has occurred, the loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the long-lived asset group exceeds its fair value. Long-lived assets held for sale are reported at the lower of carrying value or fair value less cost to sell.\nEquity Method Investment\nWe apply the equity method of accounting to our investment in Promon AS (Promon), because we exercise significant influence, but not controlling interest, in the investee. Promon is a technology company headquartered in Norway that specializes in mobile app security, whose solutions focus largely on Runtime Application Self-Protection (RASP). We exercise significant influence over Promon as a result of our 17% ownership interest in Promon, our representation on Promon\u2019s Board of Directors, and the significance to Promon of our business activities with them. We\nintegrate Promon\u2019s RASP technology into our software solutions, which are licensed to our customers. Under the equity method of accounting, the Company\u2019s proportionate share of the net earnings (losses) of Promon is reported in other income (expense), net in our consolidated Statements of Operations. The impact of the proportionate share of net earnings (losses) were immaterial for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 as were the relative size of Promon\u2019s assets and operations in relation to the Company\u2019s. The carrying value of our equity method investment is reported in other noncurrent assets in the consolidated Balance Sheets and is reported originally at cost and adjusted each period for the Company\u2019s share of the investee\u2019s earnings (losses) and dividends paid, if any. The Company also assesses the investment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the investment may not be recoverable. There were no qualitative factors that indicated that the carrying value of the investment may not be recoverable. The Company did not record any impairment charges during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 or 2018. The Company recorded $2.5 million and $3.5 million in costs of sales during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively for license fees owed to Promon for use of their software and technology. The Company owed Promon $2.2 million and $2.2 million as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively, which is included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities.\nShare Repurchase Program\nOn June 10, 2020, the Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program (\u201cprogram\u201d), pursuant to which the Company can repurchase up to $50.0 million of issued and outstanding common stock. Share purchases under the program will take place in open market transactions or in privately negotiated transactions and may be made from time to time depending on market conditions, share price, trading volume, and other factors. The timing of the repurchases and the amount of stock repurchased in each transaction is subject to OneSpan\u2019s sole discretion and will depend upon market and business conditions, applicable legal and credit requirements and other corporate considerations. During the year ended December 31, 2020, $5.0 million of issued and outstanding stock was repurchased under the program. The authorization is effective until June 10, 2022 unless the total amount has been used or authorization has been cancelled.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company repurchased 0.3 million shares of the Company\u2019s stock for $5.0 million in the aggregate at an average cost of $20.10 per share under its repurchase program.\nRevenue Recognition\nOn January 1, 2018, we adopted FASB Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 606, \u201cRevenue from Contracts with Customers\u201d, or \u201cTopic 606\u201d using the modified retrospective method applied to those contracts which were not completed as of January 1, 2018. Results for reporting periods beginning after January 1, 2018 are presented under Topic 606. We recorded a net increase to opening Retained Earnings of $11.9 million, net of tax, as of January 1, 2018 due to the cumulative impact of adopting Topic 606, with the impact primarily related to the accounting impacts of our customer contracts that include a term license to our software, as well as the impact of accounting for costs incurred to obtain our contracts. See Note 6 - Revenue for further details. We determine revenue recognition through the following steps:\n\u25cf Identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer;\n\u25cf Identification of the performance obligations in the contract;\n\u25cf Determination of the transaction price;\n\u25cf Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and\n\u25cf Recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation.\nRevenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those products or services, which excludes any sales incentives and amounts collected on behalf of third parties. Taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction, that are collected by the Company from a customer, are excluded from revenue. Shipping and handling costs associated with outbound freight after control over a product has transferred to a customer are accounted for as a fulfillment cost and are included in cost of goods sold.\nNature of Goods and Services\nWe derive our revenues primarily from Product and License Revenue, which includes hardware products and software licenses, and Services and Other, which is inclusive of software-as-a-service (which we refer to as \u201csubscription\u201d, or \u201cSaaS\u201d), maintenance and support, and professional services.\nProduct Revenue: Revenue from the sale of security hardware is recorded upon shipment, which is the point at which control of the goods are transferred and the completion of the performance obligations, unless there are specific terms that would suggest control is transferred at a later date (e.g. delivery). No significant obligations or contingencies typically exist with regard to delivery, customer acceptance or rights of return at the time revenue is recognized. Customer invoices and subsequent payments normally correspond with delivery.\nLicense Revenue: Revenue from the sale of software licenses is recorded upon the latter of when the customer receives the ability to access the software or when they are legally allowed to use the software. No significant obligations or contingencies exist with regard to delivery, customer acceptance or rights of return at the time revenue is recognized. Contracts with customers for distinct licenses of intellectual property include perpetual licenses, which grant the customer unlimited access to the software, and term licenses which limit the customer\u2019s access to the software to a specific time period. We offer term licenses ranging from one to five years in length. Customer payments normally correspond with delivery for perpetual licenses. For term licenses, payments are either on installment or in advance. In limited circumstances, we integrate third party software solutions into our software products. We have determined that, consistent with our conclusion under prior revenue recognition rules, generally we act as the principal with respect to the satisfaction of the related performance obligation and record the corresponding revenue on a gross basis from these transactions. For transactions in which we do not act as the principal, we would recognize revenue on a net basis. The fees owed to the third parties are recognized as a component of cost of goods sold when the revenue is recognized.\nSubscription Revenue: We generate subscription revenues from our cloud services offerings. Subscription revenues mostly include fees from customers for access to the OneSpan Sign, TID, and Dealflo solutions. Our standard customer arrangements do not provide the customer with the right to take possession of the software supporting the cloud-based application service at any time. As such, these arrangements are considered service contracts and revenue is recognized ratably over the service period of the contract. Customer payments are normally in advance for annual service.\nMaintenance, Support and Other: Maintenance and support agreements generally call for us to provide software updates and technical support, respectively, to customers. The annual fee for maintenance and technical support is recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance and support agreement as this is the period the services are delivered. Customer payments are normally in advance for annual service.\nProfessional Services: Professional services revenues are primarily comprised of implementing, automating and extending business processes, technology infrastructure, and software applications. Professional services revenues are recognized over time as services are rendered, usually over a period of time that is generally less than a few months. Most projects are performed on a time and materials basis, while a portion of revenues is derived from projects performed on a fixed fee. For time and material contracts, revenues are generally recognized and invoiced by multiplying the number of hours expended in the performance of the contract by the contractual hourly rates. For fixed fee contracts, revenues are generally recognized using an input method based on the ratio of hours expended to total estimated hours to complete the services. Customer payments normally correspond with delivery.\nMultiple-Element Arrangements\nIn our typical multiple-element arrangement, the primary deliverables include:\n1. A client component (i.e. an item that is used by the person being authenticated in the form of either a new standalone hardware device or software that is downloaded onto a device that the customer already owns);\n2. Server system software that is installed on the customer\u2019s systems (i.e., software on the server system that verifies the identity of the person being authenticated) or licenses for additional users on the server system software if the server system software had been installed previously; and\n3. Post contract support (PCS) in the form of maintenance on the server system software or support.\nOur multiple-element arrangements may also include other items that are usually delivered prior to the recognition of any revenue are incidental to the overall transaction such as initialization of the hardware device, customization of the hardware device itself or the packaging in which it is delivered, deployment services where we deliver the device to our customer\u2019s end-use customer or employee and, in some limited cases, professional services to assist with the initial implementation of a new customer.\nSignificant Judgments\nWe enter into contracts to deliver a combination of hardware devices, software licenses, subscriptions, maintenance and support and, in some situations, professional services. The Company evaluates the nature of the goods or services promised in these arrangements to identify the distinct performance obligations. Determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment depending on the terms and conditions of the respective customer arrangement. When a hardware client device and licenses to server software are sold in a contract, they are treated as a single performance obligation because the software license is deemed to be a component of the hardware that is integral to the functionality of the hardware that is used by our customers for identity authentication. When a software client device is sold in a contract server software, the licenses are considered a single performance obligation to deliver the authentication solution to the customer. In either of these types of arrangements, maintenance and support and professional services are typically distinct separate performance obligations from the hardware or software solutions. Our contracts to deliver subscription services typically do not include multiple performance obligations; however, in certain limited cases customers may purchase professional services that are distinct performance obligations.\nFor contracts that contain multiple performance obligations, the transaction price is allocated to the separate performance obligations based on their estimated relative standalone selling price. Judgment is required to determine the stand-alone selling price (\u201cSSP\u201d) of each distinct performance obligation. We determine SSP for maintenance and support and professional services based on observable inputs; specifically, the range of prices charged to customers to renew annual maintenance and support contracts and the range of hourly rates we charge our customers in standalone professional services contracts. In instances where SSP is not directly observable, and when we sell at a highly variable price range, such as for transactions involving software licenses or subscriptions, we determine the SSP for those performance obligations using the residual method.\nCost of Goods Sold\nIncluded in product and license cost of goods sold are direct product costs and direct costs to deliver and provide software licenses. Cost of goods sold related to service revenues are primarily costs related to subscription solutions, including personnel and equipment costs, and personnel costs of employees providing professional services and maintenance support.\nResearch and Development Costs\nCosts for research and development, principally the design and development of hardware, and the design and development of software prior to the determination of technological feasibility, are expensed as incurred on a project-by-project basis.\nSoftware Development Costs\nSoftware development costs are accounted for in accordance with ASC 985-20, Costs of Software to be Sold, Leased, or Marketed. Research costs and software development costs, prior to the establishment of technological\nfeasibility, determined based upon the creation of a working model, are expensed as incurred. Our software capitalization policy defines technological feasibility as a functioning beta test prototype with confirmed manufacturability (a working model), within a reasonably predictable range of costs. Additional criteria include receptive customers, or potential customers, as evidenced by interest expressed in a beta test prototype, at some suggested selling price. Our policy is to amortize capitalized costs by the greater of (a) the ratio that current gross revenue for a product bears to the total of current and anticipated future gross revenue for that product or (b) the straight-line method over the remaining estimated economic life of the product, generally two to five years, including the period being reported on.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe have stock-based employee compensation plans, described in Note 14 - Stock Compensation. ASC 718, Stock Compensation requires us to estimate the fair value of restricted stock granted to employees, directors and others to record compensation expense equal to the estimated fair value. Compensation expense is recorded on a straight-line basis over the vesting period for time-based awards and performance and market-based awards with cliff vesting provisions and on a graded basis for performance and market-based awards with graded vesting provisions. Forfeitures are recorded as incurred.\nRetirement Benefits\nWe record annual expenses relating to defined benefit pension plans based on calculations which include various actuarial assumptions, including discount rates, assumed asset rates of return, compensation increases, and turnover rates. We review our actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends. The effects of gains, losses, and prior service costs and credits are amortized over the average service life. The funded status, or projected benefit obligation less plan assets, for each plan, is reflected in our consolidated financial statements using a December 31 measurement date.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther income (expense), net primarily includes exchange gains (losses) on transactions that are denominated in currencies other than our subsidiaries\u2019 functional currencies, subsidies received from foreign governments in support of our research and development in those countries and other miscellaneous non-operational expenses. During 2018, the Company recognized a $1.2 million government subsidy from a foreign government in support of our advancement authentication technology, which is included in other income (expense), net on the statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nIncome Taxes\nAs a global company, we calculate and provide for income taxes in each tax jurisdiction in which we operate. The provision for income taxes includes the amounts payable or refundable for the current year, the effect of deferred taxes and impacts from uncertain tax positions. Our provision for income taxes is significantly affected by shifts in the geographic mix of our pre-tax earnings across tax jurisdictions, changes in tax laws and regulations, and tax planning opportunities available in each tax jurisdiction.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of our assets and liabilities and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates that will apply to taxable income in the years in which those differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Valuation allowances are established for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. We recognize the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities and in income in the period that includes the enactment date.\nWe recognize tax benefits for tax positions that are more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities. The amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely\nto be realized upon ultimate settlement. Unrecognized tax benefits are tax benefits claimed in our income tax returns that do not meet these recognition and measurement standards. Assumptions, judgments, and the use of estimates are required in determining whether the \u201cmore likely than not\u201d standard has been met when developing the provision for income taxes.\nWe recognize the tax impact of including certain foreign earnings in U.S. taxable income as a period cost. We have recognized deferred income taxes for local country income and withholding taxes that could be incurred on distributions of non-U.S. earnings because we do not plan to indefinitely reinvest such earnings.\nWe monitor for changes in tax laws and reflect the impacts of tax law changes in the period of enactment.\nForeign Currency Translation and Transactions\nThe financial position and results of operations of the majority of the Company\u2019s foreign subsidiaries are measured using the local currency as the functional currency. Accordingly, assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. Dollars using current exchange rates as of the balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates prevailing during the year. Translation adjustments arising from differences in exchange rates are charged or credited to other comprehensive income (loss). Gains or (losses) resulting from foreign currency transactions were less than $0.1 million, $(1.5) million, and $(0.2) million in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively, and are included in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations.\nThe financial position and results of our operations in Singapore, Switzerland, and Canada are measured in U.S. Dollars. For these subsidiaries, gains and losses that result from foreign currency transactions are included in the consolidated statements of operations in other income (expense), net.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nIn September 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (Topic 326), which amends the Board\u2019s guidance on the impairment of financial instruments. The ASU adds an impairment model that is based on expected losses rather than incurred losses, which is known as the current expected credit loss (\u201cCECL\u201d) model. The CECL model applies to most debt instruments (other than those measured at fair value), trade and other receivables, financial guarantee contracts, and loan commitments. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company adopted ASC 326 as of January 1, 2020, using the cumulative-effect transition method with the required prospective approach. The cumulative-effect transition method enables an entity to record an allowance for expected credit losses at the date of adoption without restating comparative periods. The cumulative-effect adjustment for adoption of ASC 326 resulted in a decrease of $0.3 million in Accounts receivable, net of allowances and Retained Earnings as of January 1, 2020.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350) - Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment. This standard eliminates the requirement to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill to measure a goodwill impairment charge (i.e. Step 2 of the current guidance), instead measuring the impairment charge as the excess of the reporting unit's carrying amount over its fair value (i.e. Step 1 of the current guidance). The guidance was effective for us beginning in the first quarter of 2020, and should be applied prospectively. Early adoption is permitted for impairment testing dates after January 1, 2017. We adopted this standard on January 1, 2020 on a prospective basis. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-13, Disclosure Framework - Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement (\u201cASU 2018-13\u201d), which amends ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement. ASU 2018-13 modifies the disclosure requirements for fair value measurements by removing, modifying, or adding certain disclosures. The ASU is effective for annual periods, including interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted for removed or modified disclosures, and delayed adoption of the additional disclosures until their effective date. We adopted this standard on January 1, 2020 on a retrospective basis. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-15, Customer's Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement, which helps entities evaluate the accounting for fees paid by a customer in a cloud computing arrangement (CCA) by providing guidance for determining when an arrangement includes a software license and when an arrangement is solely a hosted CCA service. Under ASU 2018-15, customers will apply the same criteria for capitalizing implementation costs as they would for an arrangement that has a software license. The new guidance also prescribes the balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow classification of the capitalized implementation costs and related amortization expense, and requires additional quantitative and qualitative disclosures. We adopted this standard on January 1, 2020 on a prospective basis. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-14, Compensation-Retirement Benefits-Defined Benefit Plans-General (Topic 715-20): Disclosure Framework-Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Defined Benefit Plans (ASU 2018-14), which modifies the disclosure requirements for defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement plans. ASU 2018-14 is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2020, and earlier adoption is permitted. The adoption of the standard was not materially impactful to our consolidated financial statements and disclosures.\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, Simplification for Accounting for Income Taxes, which removes certain exceptions for recognizing deferred taxes for investments, performing intraperiod allocation and calculating income taxes in interim periods. The ASU also adds guidance to reduce complexity in certain areas, including recognizing deferred taxes for tax goodwill and allocating taxes to members of a consolidated group. ASU 2019-12 was effective beginning January 1, 2021. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our financial statements.\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting. This update provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying generally accepted accounting principles to certain contract modifications and hedging relationships that reference London Inter-bank Offered Rate (LIBOR) or another reference rate expected to be discontinued. The guidance is effective upon issuance and can be applied through December 31, 2022. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements.\nFrom time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the FASB or other standard setting bodies that are adopted by us as of the specified effective date. Unless otherwise discussed, our management believes that the issued standards that are not yet effective will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption.\nNote 3 - Revision of Previously Issued Financial Statements\nWe have revised amounts reported in previously issued financial statements for the periods presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K related to immaterial errors. The errors relate to certain contracts with customers involving term-based software licenses and related maintenance and support services. The net contract assets that originated from a portion of these contracts in prior periods were not properly accounted for in subsequent periods, which caused overstatements of revenue in prior periods.\nWe evaluated the aggregate effects of the errors to our previously issued financial statements in accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletins No. 99 and No. 108 and, based upon quantitative and qualitative factors, determined that the errors were not material to the previously issued financial statements and disclosures included in our Annual Reports on Form 10-K for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, or for any quarterly periods included therein or through our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2020.\nThe following tables present the effects of the aforementioned revisions on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2019 and our consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), stockholders\u2019 equity and cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nConsolidated Balance Sheet\nDecember 31, 2019\nin thousands\nAs Previously Reported\nAdjustments\nAs Revised\nContract assets\n$\n7,058\n$\n(1,818)\n$\n5,240\nTotal current assets\n211,619\n(1,818)\n209,801\nContract assets - non-current\n3,565\n(210)\n3,355\nTotal assets\n384,570\n(2,028)\n382,542\nShort-term income taxes payable\n7,711\n(301)\n7,410\nTotal current liabilities\n74,113\n(301)\n73,812\nTotal liabilities\n120,549\n(301)\n120,248\nRetained earnings\n181,167\n(1,727)\n179,440\nTotal stockholders' equity\n264,021\n(1,727)\n262,294\nTotal liabilities and stockholders' equity\n384,570\n(2,028)\n382,542\nConsolidated Statements of Operations\nYear Ended December 31, 2019\nYear Ended December 31, 2018\nin thousands\nAs Previously Reported\nAdjustments\nAs Revised\nAs Previously Reported\nAdjustments\nAs Revised\nRevenue\nProduct and license\n$\n184,173\n$\n(860)\n$\n183,313\n$\n152,977\n$\n(923)\n$\n152,054\nServices and other\n70,397\n(226)\n70,171\n59,303\n(21)\n59,282\nTotal revenue\n254,570\n(1,086)\n253,484\n212,280\n(944)\n211,336\nGross Profit\n172,608\n(1,086)\n171,522\n147,467\n(944)\n146,523\nOperating income\n15,275\n(1,086)\n14,189\n(944)\n(920)\nIncome before income taxes\n15,495\n(1,086)\n14,409\n3,553\n(944)\n2,609\nProvision for income taxes\n6,706\n(161)\n6,545\n(293)\n(142)\n(435)\nNet Income\n8,789\n(925)\n7,864\n3,846\n(802)\n3,044\nConsolidated Statements of Comprehensive Loss\nYear Ended December 31, 2019\nYear Ended December 31, 2018\nin thousands\nAs Previously Reported\nAdjustments\nAs Revised\nAs Previously Reported\nAdjustments\nAs Revised\nNet income\n$\n8,789\n$\n(925)\n$\n7,864\n$\n3,846\n$\n(802)\n$\n3,044\nComprehensive income (loss)\n8,781\n(925)\n7,856\n(873)\n(802)\n(1,675)\nConsolidated Statements of Stockholders\u2019 Equity\nTotal Stockholders' Equity\nin thousands\nAs Previously Reported\nAdjustments\nAs Revised\nBalance at December 31, 2017\n$\n237,930\n$\nN/A\n$\nN/A\nNet income (loss)\n3,846\n(802)\n3,044\nBalance at December 31, 2018\n$\n252,441\n$\n(802)\n$\n251,639\nNet income (loss)\n8,789\n(925)\n7,864\nBalance at December 31, 2019\n$\n264,021\n$\n(1,727)\n$\n262,294\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows\nYear ended December 31, 2019\nYear ended December 31, 2018\nin thousands\nAs Previously Reported\nAdjustments\nAs Revised\nAs Previously Reported\nAdjustments\nAs Revised\nCash flows from operating activities:\nNet income\n$\n8,789\n$\n(925)\n$\n7,864\n$\n3,846\n$\n(802)\n$\n3,044\nChanges in operating assets and liabilities:\nContract assets\n1,085\n1,740\n(3,110)\n(2,167)\nIncome taxes payable\n(160)\n(2,541)\n(141)\n(2,682)\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n18,244\n-\n18,244\n1,226\n-\n1,226\nNote 4 - Inventories, net\nInventories, net, consisting principally of hardware and component parts, are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value.

Dealflo, formerly a privately-held company based in the United Kingdom, provides identity verification and end-to-end financial agreement solutions. Upon acquisition, Dealflo became a wholly-owned subsidiary of OneSpan.\nDealflo\u2019s total purchase price consideration was $53.9 million, net of $5.7 million of cash acquired. The total purchase price consideration includes $53.1 million of cash paid to acquire the remaining 99% interest in Dealflo, as well as $0.8 million of fair value of our previous 1% ownership interest. Upon the adoption of ASU 2016-01 on January 1, 2018 the book value of this ownership interest was increased by $0.5 million to record the equity investment at $0.8 million within our consolidated financial statements.\nThis acquisition is accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed to be recognized at their fair values on the acquisition date.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded certain measurement period adjustments to amounts previously reported, comprised primarily of a $1.8 million increase to the deferred tax liability and a $0.6 million increase to other current assets. The effect of the measurement period adjustments recorded before the measurement period ended during the year ended December 31, 2019 have been determined as if such adjustments had been accounted for at the acquisition date. The net effect of the measurement period adjustments increased goodwill by $1.1 million. The measurement period adjustments did not result in material income statement effects for the year ended December 31, 2019. The measurement period closed on May 30, 2019.\nThe following table summarizes our final allocation of the purchase price consideration based on the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition (net of cash acquired):\nTotal\n(in thousands)\nAcquired tangible assets\n$\n2,700\nAcquired identifiable intangible assets\n17,900\nLiabilities assumed\n(6,041)\nGoodwill\n39,295\nTotal purchase price consideration\n$\n53,854\nThe excess of purchase consideration over net assets assumed was recorded as goodwill, which represents the strategic value assigned to Dealflo, including expected benefits from synergies resulting from the acquisition, as well as the knowledge and experience of the workforce in place. In accordance with applicable accounting standards, goodwill is not amortized and will be tested for impairment at least annually, or more frequently, if certain indicators are present. Goodwill and intangible assets related to this acquisition are not deductible for foreign tax purposes.\nBased on the final results of the acquisition valuation, $17.9 million of the purchase price consideration has been allocated to identifiable intangible assets. The following table summarizes the major classes of intangible assets, as well as the estimated weighted-average amortization periods:\nEstimated Fair Value\nWeighted Average Amortization Period\nIdentifiable Intangible Assets\n(in thousands)\n(Years)\nCustomer relationships\n$\n11,800\nTechnology\n5,900\nTrademarks\n$\n17,900\nThe results of operations of Dealflo subsequent to the acquisition date have been included in the consolidated statement of operations of the years ended December 31, 2020, December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018. The acquisition related costs directly attributable to the business combination of $1.1 million, including professional fees, and other direct expenses, were expensed as incurred and included in general and administrative expense in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nUnaudited Pro Forma Financial Information\nThe following presents the unaudited pro forma combined results of operations of the Company with Dealflo for the year ended December 31, 2018, assuming Dealflo was acquired at the beginning of 2017, and after giving effect to certain pro forma adjustments. Pro forma adjustments for the year ended December 31, 2018 reflect estimated amortization expense for intangible assets purchased of $1.3 million, the elimination of $0.2 million of revenue related to intercompany transactions, and the elimination of $1.1 million of non-recurring acquisition-related costs.\nThese unaudited pro forma results are not necessarily indicative of the actual consolidated results of operations had the acquisition actually occurred on January 1, 2017 or of future results of operations of the consolidated entities (in thousands except per share data):\nYear ended December 31,\n(in thousands)\nRevenue\n$\n218,903\nNet loss\n(6,966)\nBasic net loss per share\n(0.17)\nDiluted net loss per share\n(0.17)\nShares used in computing basic and diluted net loss per share\n39,932\nNote 6 - Revenue\nWe recognize revenue in accordance with ASC 606 \u201cRevenue from Contracts with Customers\u201d (\u201cTopic 606\u201d), as described below.\nDisaggregation of Revenues\nThe following tables present our revenues disaggregated by major products and services, geographical region and timing of revenue recognition.

These contract assets are transferred to receivables when the right to billing occurs, which is normally over 3-5 years. The contract liabilities primarily relate to the advance consideration received from customers for subscription and maintenance services. Revenue is recognized for these services over time.\nAs a practical expedient, we do not adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of a significant financing component when we expect, at contract inception, that the period between our transfer of a promised product or service to a customer and when the customer pays for that product or service will be one year or less. We do not typically include extended payment terms in our contracts with customers.\nRevenue recognized during the year ended December 31, 2020 included $35.0 million that was included on the December 31, 2019 balance sheet in contract liabilities. Deferred revenue increased in the same period due to timing of annual renewals.\nTransaction price allocated to the remaining performance obligations\nThe following table includes estimated revenue expected to be recognized in the future related to performance obligations that are unsatisfied (or partially unsatisfied) at the end of the reporting period.\nin thousands\nBeyond 2023\nTotal\nFuture revenue related to current unsatisfied performance obligations\n$\n19,942\n$\n13,565\n$\n9,529\n$\n6,461\n$\n49,497\nThe Company applies practical expedients and does not disclose information about remaining performance obligations (a) that have original expected durations of one year or less, or (b) where revenue is recognized as invoiced.\nCosts of obtaining a contract\nThe Company incurs incremental costs related to commissions, which can be directly tied to obtaining a contract. Under Topic 606, the Company capitalizes commissions associated with certain new contracts and amortizes the costs over a period of benefit based on the transfer of goods or services that we have determined to be up to seven years. We determined the period of benefit by taking into consideration our customer contracts, our technology and other factors, including customer attrition. Commissions are earned upon invoicing to the customer. For contracts with\nmultiple year payment terms, as the commissions that are payable after year 1 are payable based on continued employment, they are expensed when incurred. Commissions and amortization expense are included in Sales and Marketing expenses on the consolidated statements of operations.\nApplying the practical expedient, the Company recognizes the incremental costs of obtaining contracts as an expense when incurred if the amortization period for the assets that the Company otherwise would have recognized is one year or less. These costs are included in Sales and Marketing expense in the consolidated statements of operations.\nThe following tables provide information related to the capitalized costs and amortization recognized in the current and prior period:\nin thousands\nDecember 31, 2020\nDecember 31, 2019\nDecember 31, 2018\nCapitalized costs to obtain contracts, current\n$\n1,222\n$\n$\nCapitalized costs to obtain contracts, non-current\n$\n5,464\n$\n3,222\n$\n2,150\nYear ended December 31,\nin thousands\nAmortization of capitalized costs to obtain contracts\n$\n$\nImpairments of capitalized costs to obtain contracts\n$\n-\n$\n-\nNote 7 - Goodwill\nGoodwill activity for the two years ended December 31, 2020 consisted of the following:\nin thousands\nNet balance at December 31, 2018\n$\n91,841\nAdjustment to provisional estimate of acquisition date fair values\n1,128\nNet foreign currency translation\n1,643\nNet balance at December 31, 2019\n$\n94,612\nNet foreign currency translation\n2,940\nNet balance at December 31, 2020\n$\n97,552\nCertain portions of goodwill are denominated in local currencies and are subject to currency fluctuations.

The fair value hierarchy is based on inputs to valuation techniques that are used to measure fair value that are either observable or unobservable. Observable inputs reflect assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability based on market data obtained from independent sources while unobservable inputs reflect a reporting entity\u2019s pricing base upon its own market assumptions.\nThe Company classifies its investments in debt securities as available-for-sale. As described in Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, the January 1, 2020 adoption of ASU 2016-13, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, amended our accounting for available-for-sale debt securities. We review available-for-sale debt securities for impairments related to losses and other factors each quarter. The unrealized gains and losses on the available-for-sale debt securities were not material as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019.\nThe estimated fair value of our financial instruments has been determined by using available market information and appropriate valuation methodologies, as defined in ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements. The fair value hierarchy consists of the following three levels:\n\u25cf Level 1 - Inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n\u25cf Level 2 - Inputs are quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in an active market, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable and market-corroborated inputs which are derived primarily from or corroborated by observable market data.\n\u25cf Level 3 - Inputs are derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or value drivers are unobservable.\nThe following tables summarize assets that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019:\nFair Value Measurement at Reporting Date Using\nin thousands\nDecember 31, 2020\nQuoted Prices in Active Markets for Identical Assets (Level 1)\nSignificant Other Observable Inputs (Level 2)\nSignificant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3)\nAssets:\nU.S. Treasury Notes\n$\n4,951\n-\n$\n4,951\n-\nCorporate Notes / Bonds\n$\n8,780\n-\n$\n8,780\n-\nCommercial Paper\n$\n4,098\n-\n$\n4,098\n-\nU.S. Treasury Bills\n$\n5,292\n-\n$\n5,292\n-\nU.S. Government Agencies\n$\n3,738\n-\n$\n3,738\n-\nFair Value Measurement at Reporting Date Using\nin thousands\nDecember 31, 2019\nQuoted Prices in Active Markets for Identical Assets (Level 1)\nSignificant Other Observable Inputs (Level 2)\nSignificant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3)\nAssets:\nU.S. Treasury Notes\n$\n9,225\n-\n$\n9,225\n-\nCorporate Notes / Bonds\n$\n8,169\n-\n$\n8,169\n-\nCommercial Paper\n$\n3,482\n-\n$\n3,482\n-\nU.S. Treasury Bills\n$\n2,385\n-\n$\n2,385\n-\nU.S. Government Agencies\n$\n2,249\n-\n$\n2,249\n-\nNote 11 - Allowance for Credit Losses\nAs described in Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, the January 1, 2020 adoption of ASU 2016-13, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, amended our accounting policies for the allowance for credit losses.\nThe change in the allowance for credit losses during the year ended December 31, 2020 were as follows:\nin thousands\nBalance at December 31, 2019\n$\n2,524\nImpact of ASU 2016-13 adoption\nBalance at January 1, 2020\n2,812\nProvision\n2,306\nWrite-offs\n(994)\nNet foreign currency translation\nBalance at December 31, 2020\n$\n4,135\nA higher allowance for credit losses was recorded during the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily due to the adverse impact the COVID-19 pandemic has had on factors that affect our estimate of future credit losses.\nNote 12 - Leases\nAs mentioned in Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, the Company adopted ASC Topic 842, Leases on January 1, 2019, using the modified retrospective approach. The adoption of this accounting standard resulted in the recording of operating lease right-of-use (\u201cROU\u201d) assets of $9.2 million in Operating lease right-of use assets, and operating lease liabilities of $2.5 million and $8.5 million in Other accrued expenses and Long-term lease liabilities, respectively, as of January 1, 2019, to capture the cumulative effect of the standard. The difference between the asset and liability is a result of lease incentives, such as tenant improvement allowances, and deferred rent on the balance sheet at transition.\nThe Company leases certain real estate and automobiles. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less (\u201cshort-term leases\u201d) are not recorded on the consolidated balance sheet; the Company recognizes lease expense for these leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. All of our leases are operating leases.\nOperating lease right-of-use (\u201cROU\u201d) assets and operating lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term at commencement date. Because most of the Company\u2019s leases do not provide an implicit rate of return, the Company uses its imputed collateralized rate based on the information available at the commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. Operating lease ROU assets are comprised of the lease liability plus prepaid rents and are reduced by lease incentives or deferred rents. The Company has lease agreements with non-lease components which are not bifurcated.\nSome of our leases include one or more options to renew, with renewal terms that can extend the lease from one to five years. The exercise of a lease renewal option typically occurs at the discretion of both parties. Certain leases also include options to purchase the leased property at fair value. For purposes of calculating operating lease liabilities, lease terms are deemed not to include options to extend the lease termination until it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option.

Valuation allowances are reviewed on a regular basis and adjustments made as appropriate. The increase in the valuation allowance in 2020 reflects NOLs, other deduction carryforwards, and credits for which the realization is not more likely than not. The change in the valuation allowance also reflects other factors including, but not limited to, changes in our assessment of our ability to use existing NOLs and other deduction carryforwards, changes in currency rates, and adjustments to reflect differences between the actual returns filed and the estimates we made at financial reporting dates. For all other deferred tax assets, the Company believes it is more likely than not that the results of future operations will generate sufficient taxable income to realize the deferred tax assets.\nOur policy is to record interest and penalties on income taxes as income tax expense. We provided less than $0.1 million in 2020, $0.2 million in 2019 and less than $0.1 million during 2018.\nASC 740, Income Taxes sets a \u201cmore likely than not\u201d criterion for recognizing the tax benefit of uncertain tax positions.

We are subject to examination of our income tax returns by the IRS and other tax authorities. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we concluded an audit with the Belgian tax authorities which covered income tax returns filed for the years 2015-2018, and entered into a settlement agreement with the Belgian tax authorities covering tax years through 2016. There was no assessment for 2017 and 2018. While we believe the positions we took were supportable under Belgian tax law, in lieu of extending the audit process or pursuing litigation, we negotiated a settlement agreement.\nWe believe that an adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. However, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. If any issues addressed in our tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with management's expectations, we could be required to adjust our provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs. Included in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2020 is $0.5 million, of tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate.\nWe estimate that our unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2020 could decrease by as much as $0.5 million in the next 12 months.\nOur primary tax jurisdictions and the earliest tax year subject to audit are presented in the following table.\nAustralia\nAustria\nBelgium\nCanada\nNetherlands\nSingapore\nSwitzerland\nUnited Kingdom\nUnited States\nNote 14 - Stock Compensation Plans (sharecounts in thousands)\nThe Company has a share-based compensation plan, the OneSpan Inc. 2019 Omnibus Incentive Plan (\u201cPlan\u201d), which was approved by its Shareholders in June 2019 under which the Board of Directors may grant share-based awards including restricted stock units (RSUs) and performance restricted stock units (PSUs).\nThe Plan may provide performance incentives to employees and non-employee directors, consultants and other key persons of the Company.

Diluted earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding and includes the dilutive effect of common stock equivalents to the extent they are not anti-dilutive. Because the Company is in a net loss position for the year ended December 31, 2020, diluted net loss per share for this\nperiod excludes the effects of all common stock equivalents, which are anti-dilutive.

The plan allows voluntary employee contributions and discretionary employer contributions. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, we expensed contributions of $0.3 million, $0.3 million, and $0.3 million, respectively.\nNon-U.S. Plans\nWe are subject to national mandatory pension systems and other compulsory plans, or make contributions to social pension funds based on local regulations. When our obligation is limited to the payment of the contribution into these plans or funds, the recognition of such liabilities is not required.\nIn addition, we have, in some countries, defined benefit plans consisting of final retirement salary and committed pension payments.\nIn Switzerland, the pension plan is a cash balance plan where contributions are expressed as a percentage of the pensionable salary. Contributions to Swiss plans are paid by the employees and the employer. The pension plan guarantees the amount accrued on the members\u2019 savings accounts, as well as a minimum interest on those savings accounts. The plan assets are held in guaranteed investment contracts.\nWe also maintain a pension plan for our Belgian employees, in compliance with Belgian law. Contributions to Belgium plans are paid by the employees and the employer. Certain features of the plans require them to be categorized as defined benefit plans under ASC 715 due to Belgian social legislation, which prescribed a minimum annual return of 1.6% on employer contributions and 1.6% for employee contributions. The plan assets are held in guaranteed investment contracts.\nThe Company also includes a liability related to obligations to provide retirement benefits to employees who retire from the Company\u2019s French subsidiary, as required by law. Per French regulations, each employee is entitled to a lump sum payment upon retirement based on years of service and salary at retirement. Benefit rights vest upon the statutory retirement age of 62.

The increase in benefit obligations at December 31, 2019 compared to December 31, 2018 was primarily driven by a decrease in actuarial losses.\nOur investment policy meets our responsibility under local social legislation and aligns plan assets with liabilities, while minimizing risk. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, plan assets are invested in guaranteed investment contracts. Fair value of guaranteed investment contracts is surrender value. Fair value for the year ended December 31, 2020 was determined using Level 3 inputs as defined by ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements. Changes in our plan assets are attributable to benefit payments and contributions as we have not actively traded our assets during the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019.\nOther\nThe accumulated benefit obligation for the plans were $25.1 million and $20.3 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nThe Company expects to pay approximately $1.0 million of contributions over the next twelve months.\nThe amounts reclassified out of other comprehensive income during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 were not material.\nActuarial Assumptions\nCertain actuarial assumptions such as the discount rate and the long-term rate of return on plan assets have a significant effect on the amounts reported for net periodic cost and the benefit obligation. The assumed discount rates reflect the prevailing market rates of a universe of high-quality, non-callable, corporate bonds currently available that, if the obligation were settled at the measurement date, would provide the necessary future cash flows to pay the benefit obligation when due. In determining the long-term return on plan assets, the Company considers long-term rates of return of comparable low risk investments, such as Euro AA bonds.\nThe following weighted-average assumptions between all plans were utilized in the pension calculations:\nAs of December 31,\n(%)\nDiscount rates\n0.05\n-\n0.60\n0.15\n-\n0.70\nInflation\n0.90\n-\n1.80\n1.00\n-\n2.00\nExpected return on plan assets\n1.25\n-\n2.00\n1.25\n-\n2.00\nRate of salary increases\n1.90\n-\n2.80\n2.00\n-\n2.80\nProjected future pension benefits as of December 31, 2020:\n$\nBeyond\n5,135\nNote 17 - Geographic, Customer and Supplier Information\nWe classify our sales by our customers\u2019 locations in three geographic regions: 1) EMEA, which includes Europe, the Middle East, and Africa; 2) the Americas, which includes sales in North, Central, Latin and South America and Canada; and 3) Asia Pacific, which includes Australia and India.\nWe have recast the below revenue and gross profit amounts for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 for immaterial errors, consistent with the impacts disclosed in Note 3 - Revision of Previously Issued Financial Statements.\nEurope,\nMiddle East,\nAfrica (EMEA)\nAmericas\nAsia Pacific\nTotal\nRevenue\n$\n117,086\n$\n53,171\n$\n45,434\n$\n215,691\nGross profit\n82,649\n37,532\n32,071\n152,252\nLong-lived assets\n7,482\n14,968\n23,191\nRevenue\n$\n145,942\n$\n61,577\n$\n45,965\n$\n253,484\nGross profit\n98,753\n41,667\n31,102\n171,522\nLong-lived assets\n8,085\n13,240\n22,034\nRevenue\n$\n102,349\n$\n54,979\n$\n54,008\n$\n211,336\nGross profit\n70,960\n38,118\n37,445\n146,523\nLong-lived assets\n7,665\n4,247\n12,067\nFor the years 2020, 2019, and 2018, our top 10 customers contributed 21%, 29% and 24%, respectively, of total worldwide revenue. The majority of our hardware products are assembled by four independent factories in Southern China.\nNote 18 - Commitments and Contingencies\nThe company leases office space and automobiles under operating lease agreements. See Note 11 - Leases for future minimum rental payments required under non-cancelable leases.\nAt December 31, 2020, we have purchase obligations of $23.9 million, including $12.7 million of inventory purchase obligations which are expected to be consummated in the next 12 months, $5.8 million of committed hosting arrangements which will be used in the next one to four years, and $5.4 million for other software agreements related to the administration of our business which range from one to five years.\nWe are a party to or have intellectual property subject to litigation and other proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business. These types of matters could result in fines, penalties, compensatory or treble damages or non-monetary sanctions or relief. We believe the probability is remote that the outcome of each of these matters, including the legal proceedings described below, will have a material adverse effect on the corporation as a whole, notwithstanding that the unfavorable resolution of any matter may have a material effect on our financial results in any particular interim reporting period. Among the factors that we consider in this assessment are the nature of existing legal proceedings and claims, the asserted or possible damages or loss contingency (if estimable), the progress of the case, existing law and precedent, the opinions or views of legal counsel and other advisers, our experience in similar cases and the experience of other companies, the facts available to us at the time of assessment and how we intend to respond to the proceeding or claim. Our assessment of these factors may change over time as individual proceedings or claims progress.\nAlthough we cannot predict the outcome of legal or other proceedings with certainty, where there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss may have been incurred, U.S. GAAP requires us to disclose an estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of loss or make a statement that such an estimate cannot be made. We follow a process in which we seek to estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of loss, and only if we are unable to make such an estimate do we conclude and disclose that an estimate cannot be made. Accordingly, unless otherwise indicated below in our discussion of legal proceedings, a reasonably possible loss or range of loss associated with any individual legal proceeding cannot be estimated.\nWe include various types of indemnification clauses in our agreements. These indemnifications may include, but are not limited to, infringement claims related to our intellectual property, direct damages and consequential damages. The type and amount of such indemnifications vary substantially based on our assessment of risk and reward associated with each agreement. We believe the estimated fair value of these indemnification clauses is minimal, and we cannot determine the maximum amount of potential future payments, if any, related to such indemnification provisions. We have no liabilities recorded for these clauses as of December 31, 2020.\nWe have been involved in an ongoing dispute with a German company, Onespin solutions GmbH, regarding the co-existence of, or alleged infringement with, its trademark in certain jurisdictions for \u201cONESPIN\u201d and our trademark in certain jurisdictions for \u201cONESPAN\u201d. Onespin sells integrated circuit integrity verification solutions for use in the system on chip software development process flow. During the fourth quarter of 2020, we reached a settlement with Onespin on these matters. The amount of the settlement was not material from a financial perspective. We consider this matter to now be closed.\nA complaint was filed on August 20, 2020 against OneSpan and certain of its officers, asserting claims for purported violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d), and SEC Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, based on certain alleged material misstatements and omissions. The case is captioned Almendariz v. OneSpan Inc., et al., No. 1:20-cv-04906 (N.D. Ill.) (the \u201cSecurities Class Action\u201d). Specifically, the plaintiff in the Securities Class Action alleges, among other things, that certain statements about OneSpan\u2019s business were misleading because of defendants\u2019 failure to disclose that OneSpan purportedly had inadequate internal procedures and controls over financial reporting and related disclosures; and OneSpan purportedly downplayed the negative impacts of immaterial errors in its financial statements.\nA complaint, related in subject matter to the Securities Class Action, was filed on October 23, 2020 against certain of OneSpan\u2019s officers and directors, and names OneSpan as a nominal defendant. The case is captioned Klein v. Boroditzky, et al., No. 1:20-cv-06310 (N.D. Ill.) (the \u201cDerivative Action\u201d and, collectively with the Securities Class Action, the \u201cLitigation\u201d). The plaintiff asserts claims for breach of fiduciary duty, abuse of control and corporate waste, as well as a claim for contribution under Sections 10(b) and 21D of the Exchange Act, based on the same alleged wrongdoing pled in the Securities Class Action. We intend to defend against the Litigation vigorously.\nFrom time to time, we have been involved in litigation and claims incidental to the conduct of our business, such as compensation claims from current or former employees in Europe. We expect that to continue. Excluding matters specifically disclosed above, we are not a party to any lawsuit or proceeding that, in management\u2019s opinion, is likely to have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition or results of operations.\nNote 19 - Quarterly Results of Operations (unaudited)\nThe quarterly results of operations are as follows:\nFirst\nSecond\nThird\nFourth\nQuarter\nQuarter\nQuarter\nQuarter\n(1)\nTotal revenues\n$\n56,370\n$\n54,954\n$\n51,439\n$\n52,928\nGross profit\n40,300\n36,729\n35,961\n39,262\nOperating costs\n39,475\n38,416\n38,316\n41,303\nOperating income (loss)\n(1,687)\n(2,355)\n(2,041)\nProvision (benefit) for income taxes\nNet income (loss)\n(2,023)\n(1,678)\n(1,756)\nNet income/(loss) per share:\nBasic\n$\n(0.00)\n$\n(0.05)\n$\n(0.04)\n$\n(0.04)\nDiluted\n$\n(0.00)\n$\n(0.05)\n$\n(0.04)\n$\n(0.04)\n(1)\n(1)\n(1)\n(1)\nTotal revenues\n$\n47,095\n$\n56,167\n$\n79,691\n$\n70,531\nGross profit\n31,056\n38,287\n53,022\n49,157\nOperating costs\n37,096\n40,565\n35,937\n43,735\nOperating income (loss)\n(6,040)\n(2,278)\n17,085\n5,422\nProvision (benefit) for income taxes\n(400)\n3,855\n2,336\nNet income (loss)\n(6,056)\n(2,511)\n11,847\n4,585\nNet income/(loss) per share:\nBasic\n$\n(0.15)\n$\n(0.06)\n$\n0.30\n$\n0.11\nDiluted\n$\n(0.15)\n$\n(0.06)\n$\n0.30\n$\n0.11\n*\n(1) We have revised the revenue, gross profit, operating income (loss), provision (benefit) for income taxes, net income (loss), and net income (loss) per share amounts reported in previously issued financial statements for immaterial errors.
