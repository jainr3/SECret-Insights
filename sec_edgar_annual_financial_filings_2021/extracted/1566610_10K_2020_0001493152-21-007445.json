    "item_1": "ITEM 1. BUSINESS\nOverview\nWe are a Software-as-a-Service (\u201cSaaS\u201d) applications platform developer. Our platform is comprised of a suite of interactive, video-based sales enablement business software products marketed on a subscription basis. Our applications, available in both mobile and desktop versions, are offered as a fully integrated suite, as well as on a standalone basis, and include verbCRM, our white-labelled Customer Relationship Management (\u201cCRM\u201d) application for large, sales-based enterprises; verbTEAMS, our CRM application for small- and medium-sized businesses and solopreneurs; verbLEARN, our Learning Management System application, and verbLIVE, our Live Stream eCommerce application.\nOur Technology\nOur suite of applications can be distinguished from other sales enablement applications because our applications utilize our proprietary interactive video technology as the primary means of communication between sales and marketing professionals and their customers and prospects. Moreover, the proprietary data collection and analytics capabilities of our applications inform our users on their devices in real time, when and for how long their prospects have watched a video, how many times such prospects watched it, and what they clicked on, which allows our users to focus their time and efforts on \u2018hot leads\u2019 or interested prospects rather than on those that have not seen such video or otherwise expressed interest in such content. Users can create their hot lead lists by using familiar, intuitive \u2018swipe left/swipe right\u2019 on-screen navigation. Our clients report that these capabilities provide for a much more efficient and effective sales process, resulting in increased sales conversion rates. We developed the proprietary patent-pending interactive video technology, as well as several other patent-issued and patent-pending technologies that serve as the unique foundation for all our platform applications.\nOur Products\nverbCRM combines the capabilities of CRM lead-generation, content management, and in-video ecommerce capabilities in an intuitive, yet powerful tool for both inexperienced as well as highly skilled sales professionals. verbCRM allows users to quickly and easily create, distribute, and post videos to which they can add a choice of on-screen clickable icons which, when clicked, allow viewers to respond to the user\u2019s call-to-action in real-time, in the video, while the video is playing, without leaving or stopping the video. For example, our technology allows a prospect or customer to click on a product they see featured in a video and impulse buy it, or to click on a calendar icon in the video to make an appointment with a salesperson, among many other novel features and functionalities designed to eliminate or reduce friction from the sales process for our users. The verbCRM app is designed to be easy to use and navigate, and takes little time and training for a user to begin using the app effectively. It usually takes less than four minutes for a novice user to create an interactive video from our app. Users can add interactive icons to pre-existing videos, as well as to newly created videos shot with practically any mobile device. verbCRM interactive videos can be distributed via email, text messaging, chat app, or posted to popular social media directly and easily from our app. No software download is required to view Verb interactive videos on virtually any mobile or desktop device, including smart TVs.\nverbLEARN is an interactive, video-based learning management system that incorporates all of the clickable in-video technology featured in our verbCRM application and adapts them for use by educators for video-based education. verbLEARN is used by enterprises seeking to educate a large sales team or a customer base about new products, or elicit feedback about existing products. It also incorporates Verb\u2019s proprietary data collection and analytics capabilities that inform users in real time when and for how long the viewers watched the video, how many times they watched it, and what they clicked on, in addition to adding gamification features that enhance the learning aspects of the application.\nverbLIVE builds on popular video-based platforms such as Facebook Live, Zoom, WebEx, and Go2Meeting, among others, by adding Verb\u2019s proprietary interactive in-video ecommerce capabilities - including an in-video Shopify shopping cart integrated for Shopify account holders - to our own live stream video broadcasting application. verbLIVE is a next-generation live stream platform that allows hosts to utilize a variety of novel sales-driving features, including placing interactive icons on-screen that appear on the screens of all viewers, providing in-video click-to-purchase capabilities for products or services featured in the live video broadcast, in real-time, driving friction-free selling. verbLIVE also provides the host with real-time viewer engagement data and interaction analytics. verbLIVE is entirely browser-based, allowing it to function easily and effectively on all devices without requiring the host or the viewers to download software, and is secured through end-to-end encryption. A mobile app-based version of verbLIVE, with enhanced features, is currently in development and is expected to be released in early second quarter of 2021.\nverbTEAMS is our interactive, video-based CRM for small-and medium-sized businesses and solopreneurs. verbTEAMS also incorporates verbLIVE as a bundled application. verbTEAMS incorporates self-sign-up, self-onboarding, self-configuring, content management system capabilities, user level administrative capabilities, and high-quality analytics capabilities in both mobile and desktop platforms that sync with one another. It also has a built-in one-click sync capability with Salesforce.\nImpact of COVID-19 on Our Business and Industry\nIn the three months ended June 30, 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in significant uncertainty and volatility in a wide variety of industries and markets, including in our industry, and prompted many federal, state, local, and foreign governments to implement various lock-down measures in an attempt to contain the spread and mitigate the impact of the disease. The initial implementation of such lock-down measures, and their re-introduction in response to a nation-wide resurgence of COVID-19 cases in late-2020, resulted in business closures, work stoppages, slowdowns and delays, work-from-home policies, travel restrictions and the cancellation or postponement of events.\nDespite recent approval and initial distribution of vaccines, both the pandemic and the containment and mitigation measures have had, and are likely to continue to have, an adverse impact on the global and U.S. economies, the severity and duration of which are uncertain. It is likely that government stabilization efforts will only partially mitigate the consequences to the economy. As such, both the pandemic and containment and mitigation measures may adversely affect our business, operations and financial condition by, among other things, reducing demand for our applications, impairing the productivity of our workforce, and reducing our access to capital. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will impact our business, financial conditions, and results of operations in the future remains uncertain and will be affected by a number of factors. These include the duration and extent of the pandemic, the duration and extent of imposed or recommended containment and mitigation measures, the extent, duration, and effective execution of government stabilization and recovery efforts, including those from the successful distribution of effective vaccines.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic may have long-term effects on the nature of the office environment and remote working. This may present operational and workplace culture challenges that may adversely affect our business. However, we are committed to our employees returning to the workplace in the long-term. Throughout the year ended December 31, 2020 and through the filing of this Annual Report, we have encouraged safe practices designed to stem the infection and spread of COVID-19 within our workforce and beyond and to maintain the mental health and well-being of our employees. Beginning in March 2020, in an effort to protect our employees and comply with applicable government orders, we restricted non-essential employee travel and transitioned our employees to a remote work environment. We currently expect the majority of our employees will continue working remotely at least through the second quarter of 2021. Our workforce has continued to effectively develop and support our product and service offerings notwithstanding the current environment.\nWe began the year ended December 31, 2020 with healthy demand for our products and services, many of which are designed to enable our customers to manage their businesses virtually. In the three months ended June 30, 2020, we experienced some uncertainty regarding whether there would be variability in demand for the services we provide on our platform after lock-down measures were implemented. We expect demand variability for our products and services may continue as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic; however, our sales team reported a higher level of interest in our products and services during the year ended December 31, 2020. Although the impact has not been material to date, a prolonged downturn in economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our customers and demand for our services.\nWe continue to actively communicate with and listen to our customers to ensure we are responding to their needs in the current environment with innovative solutions that will not only be beneficial now but also over the long-term. We monitor developments related to COVID-19 and remain flexible in our response to the challenges presented by the pandemic. To mitigate the adverse impact COVID-19 may have on our business and operations, we implemented a number of measures in the year ended December 31, 2020 to protect the health and safety of our employees, as well as to strengthen our financial position. These efforts include eliminating, reducing, or deferring non-essential expenditures, as well as complying with local and state government recommendations to protect our workforce.\nThe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic may also exacerbate other risks discussed in this Annual Report. For a complete description of the material risks we currently face, refer to the section entitled \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in this Annual Report.\nVerb Partnerships and Integrations\nWe have completed and deployed the integration of verbLIVE into Salesforce and passed their security review process. In recent weeks we launched a joint marketing campaign with Salesforce to introduce the verbLIVE plug-in functionality to current Salesforce users. A verbCRM sync application for Salesforce users is currently being utilized by at least one of our large enterprise clients and the verbLIVE plug-in is now being offered to all Salesforce users on a monthly subscription fee basis.\nWe have completed the integration of verbCRM into systems offered by 17 of the most popular direct sales back-office system providers, such as Direct Scale, Exigo, By Design, Thatcher, Multisoft, Xennsoft, and Party Plan. Direct sales back-office systems provide many of the support functions required for direct sales operations, including payroll, customer genealogy management, statistics, rankings, and earnings, among other direct sales financial tracking capabilities. The integration into these back-office providers, facilitated through our own API development, allows single sign-on convenience for users, as well as enhanced data analytics and reporting capabilities for all users. We believe that our integration into these back-end platforms accelerates the adoption of verbCRM by large direct sales enterprises that rely on these systems and as such, we believe this represents a competitive advantage.\nWe are currently working to introduce an integration of our interactive video technology into Microsoft Outlook followed by a broad-scale launch in early 2021, pursuant to and in accordance with our existing Microsoft partnership agreement. We expect to follow the Microsoft Outlook integration with the integration into other Microsoft Office 365 products.\nNon-Digital Products and Services\nHistorically, we have also provided certain non-digital services to some of our enterprise clients such as printing and fulfillment services. We designed and printed welcome kits and starter kits for their marketing needs and provided fulfillment services, which consisted of managing the preparation, handling and shipping of our client\u2019s custom-branded merchandise they use for marketing purposes at conferences and other events. We also managed the fulfillment of our clients\u2019 product sample packs that verbCRM users order through the app for automated delivery and tracking to their customers and prospects.\nHowever, on May 20, 2020, we executed a contract with Range Printing (\u201cRange\u201d), a company in the business of providing enterprise class printing, sample assembly, warehousing, packaging, shipping, and fulfillment services. Pursuant to the contract, through an automated process we have established for this purpose, Range will receive orders for samples and merchandise from us as and when we receive them from our clients and users, and print, assemble, store, package and ship such samples and merchandise on our behalf. The Range contract provides for a revenue share arrangement based upon the specific services to be provided by Range that is designed to maintain our relationship with our clients by continuing to service their non-digital needs, while eliminating the labor and overhead costs associated with the provision of such services by us. The transition to Range Printing is now complete.\nOur Market\nOur client base consists primarily of multi-national direct sales enterprises to whom we provide white-labeled, client-branded versions of our products. Our clients also include large professional associations and educational institutions, including school districts, auto sales, auto leasing, insurance, real estate, home security, not-for-profits, as well as clients in the health care industry, and the burgeoning CBD industry, among other business sectors. As of March 26, 2021, we provide subscription-based application services to approximately 140 enterprise clients for use in over 60 countries, in over 48 languages, which collectively account for a user base generated through more than 1.9 million downloads of our verbCRM application. Among the new business sectors targeted for this year are pharmaceutical sales, government institutions, small businesses and individual entrepreneurs.\nRevenue Generation\nWe generate revenue from the following sources:\n\u25cf recurring subscription fees paid by enterprise users and affiliates;\n\u25cf recurring subscription fees paid by non-enterprise, small business, and individual users;\n\u25cf recurring subscription fees paid by users who access in-app purchases of various premium services, features, functionality, and upgrades;\n\u25cf recurring subscription fees paid by users who access in-app purchases of third-party software provider apps in our forthcoming app store;\n\u25cf recurring subscription fees paid by users of Salesforce and Microsoft among others with whom we have executed partnership agreements, for access to our applications that we either have integrated or intend to integrate into these platforms, including recurring subscription fees paid by users who subscribe to bundled service offerings from these partners and/or their respective value-added resellers;\n\u25cf recurring subscription fees paid by users for all of the foregoing products and services generated through our recently launched Japan operations;\n\u25cf recurring subscription fees paid by users generated through our forthcoming reseller and affiliate distribution programs; and\n\u25cf Fees paid by enterprise clients for non-digital products and services through our Range Printing venture.\nDistribution Methods\nWe distribute our services through the following methods:\n\u25cf Prospective customers and clients can subscribe to our applications on a monthly or annual contract through a simple, web-based sign-up form accessible on our website (https://www.verb.tech), as well as through interactive sign-up links that we distribute via email, text messaging and through social media;\n\u25cf Enterprise users that subscribe to our verbCRM software service can distribute custom-branded sign-up links to their internal and external staff via email or other electronic means;\n\u25cf We have entered into partnership agreements with other CRM providers to incorporate our interactive video technology into such other CRM providers\u2019 software platforms to be offered to their existing and prospective client base for an additional monthly recurring fee, which fee is shared with us. In January 2018, we entered into such an agreement with Oracle America, Inc. to integrate our interactive video technology into their NetSuite platform on a revenue-share basis. In February 2018, we entered into a similar agreement with Adobe Marketo to integrate our interactive video technology into their platform on a revenue-share basis. On January 23, 2019, we entered into an agreement with Microsoft to integrate our interactive video technology into Microsoft\u2019s Office 365 services product line, beginning with its email platform Outlook and their internal communications platform TEAMS. On February 4, 2019, we entered into a revenue share partnership agreement with Salesforce.com to integrate our interactive video technology into the Salesforce.com CRM platform.\n\u25cf We have entered into license and partnership agreements with digital marketing companies and advertising agencies to resell our Verb interactive video technology to their existing and prospective client bases for monthly fees which fees are shared with us. In March 2018, we entered into such an agreement with DR2Marketing, LLC to use and resell our applications to their clients on a revenue-share basis;\n\u25cf We expect to enter into partnership agreements with large cloud services providers, to bundle our application with such providers\u2019 other applications offered to their existing and prospective global customer base in order to generate greater utilization fees from such customers\u2019 need for more data storage and bandwidth required by video-based applications. For example, under our agreement with Microsoft, their value-added cloud services resellers may choose to bundle our application for resale to their respective customer bases; and\n\u25cf We employ a direct sales team, as well as outside sales consultants.\nOur Japan Operations\nIn April 2020, we commenced local language sales, sales support, customer support, and marketing operations in Japan. In order to ensure compliance with Japan\u2019s laws, rules and regulations, our operations were established pursuant to, and in accordance with, an exclusive reseller agreement with an existing Tokyo-based Japanese corporation operated by a team with over 30-years\u2019 experience in the Japan direct sales industry. They operate and market our applications in Japan under the Verb brand.\nJapan represents the 3rd largest global economy and the 5th largest direct sales market. There are approximately four million direct sales representatives in Japan which accounted for approximately $16B in 2018 direct sales revenue. More than 50% of our current U.S.-based enterprise clients have a substantial number of sales representatives in Japan that currently do not subscribe to our application, with five of those clients generating the majority of their revenue from their Japan-based sales. We believe the in-country sales, sales support, and customer service we can provide through native language speaking staff in Japan represents a significant opportunity for us to grow our applications subscription business and enhance our clients\u2019 Japan initiatives. Since we began operations, we have executed verbCRM subscription agreements with 6 Japanese enterprise clients. As of December 31, 2020, Japan isn\u2019t a significant source of revenue.\nWe are exploring a similar expansion opportunity in Korea, which has the 3rd largest direct sales market in the world.\nOur Historical Background\nWe are a Nevada corporation originally formed as a limited liability company in 2012 as Cutaia Media Group, LLC, or CMG. In May 2014, CMG merged into bBooth, Inc., and in October 2014, bBooth, Inc. changed its name to bBooth (USA), Inc.\nIn October 2014, bBooth (USA), Inc. was acquired by Global System Designs, Inc. In connection with the acquisition, Global Systems Design, Inc. changed its name to bBooth, Inc.\nIn April 2017, we changed our name from bBooth, Inc. to nF\u00fcsz, Inc, and in February 2019 we changed our name from nF\u00fcsz, Inc. to Verb Technology Company, Inc.\nOn February 1, 2019, we implemented a 1-for-15 reverse stock split of our common stock, $0.0001 par value per share, or common stock. As a result of the reverse stock split, every fifteen shares of our pre-split common stock were combined and reclassified into one share of our common stock. Our consolidated financial statements have been recast to reflect the 1-for-15 reverse stock split of our common stock.\nIn April 2019, we acquired Sound Concepts Inc. (\u201cSound Concepts\u201d) pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger. As a result of the merger, Sound Concepts merged with and into our wholly owned subsidiary, NF Acquisition Company, LLC. Upon completion of the merger, NF Acquisition Company, LLC changed its name to Verb Direct, LLC (\u201cVerb Direct\u201d).\nOn September 4, 2020, Verb Acquisition Co., LLC (\u201cVerb Acquisition\u201d), a subsidiary of the Company, entered into a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement (the \u201cPurchase Agreement\u201d) with Ascend Certification, LLC, dba SoloFire (\u201cSoloFire\u201d).\nOur common stock and common stock purchase warrants trade on The NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbols \u201cVERB\u201d and \u201cVERBW,\u201d respectively. Our Internet website address is https://www.verb.tech.\nMarketing\nWe utilize our own proprietary interactive video platform as the foundation of our ongoing marketing initiatives. Our initiatives include, among other things, daily, broad-based social media engagement by a dedicated team of full-time employees and outside consultants; management of our interactive video-based website; and interactive video-based email campaigns and television commercials. In addition, the 17 direct sales back office systems providers with whom we have integrated verbCRM, market our applications to their customers and prospects in exchange for finders\u2019 fees.\nCompetition\nCRM software generated more than $48.2 billion in sales revenue throughout the world in 2018, has grown to become the largest software segment, overtaking data management software, and is expected to reach more than $80 billion in sales revenue by 2025. We compete in the CRM applications industry, as well as in the video conferencing/webinar industry. We believe that CRM applications that incorporate our proprietary Verb interactive video technology provide significant competitive advantages over the CRM applications that do not. Salesforce, Microsoft, Oracle, SAP, and Adobe, the long-term leaders in the CRM sector, collectively account for approximately 41% of industry sales. These companies, as well as many others, have numerous differences in feature sets and functionality, but all share certain basic attributes. Most of them were designed before the advent and proliferation of mobile phones, social media, and the technology behind the current ubiquity of video over the internet and more recently on mobile devices. While many of them have attempted to incorporate video capabilities into their respective CRM platforms, sometimes in \u2018\u2018bolt-on\u2019\u2019 fashion, we do not believe any of them has done so in a manner that is as effective as our interactive in-video ecommerce platform that allows users to place clickable calls-to-action right in the video, including into users\u2019 pre-existing sales and product videos. In addition, Verb\u2019s interactive videos are viewable on both mobile and desktop devices regardless of operating system and without the need to download a proprietary player or program.\nWe also compete in the video webinar and ecommerce solution provider sectors. The webinar sector is dominated by Zoom, WebEx, and Go2Meeting, among others. The ecommerce solution provider sector is dominated by Shopify, among others. However, we believe our verbLIVE application provides a superior solution for users seeking to use video webinars as a sales tool because our in-video clickable icons provide seamless in-video ecommerce capabilities that are not offered by either Zoom (or other large webinar providers) or Shopify. We believe verbLIVE represents a unique solution that combines the best features of Zoom and Shopify in a single application, offering users a more friction-free and effective selling experience. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the market share, marketing strength, and established positions in the marketplace of our competitors may prevent us from obtaining a large share of these markets.\nIntellectual Property\nOur policy is to protect our technology through, among other things, a combination of patents, trade secrets and copyrights. We primarily rely upon trade secrets and copyrighted proprietary software, code, and know-how to protect our interactive video technology platform and associated applications. We have taken security measures to protect our trade secrets and proprietary know-how, to the extent possible. Our means of protecting our proprietary rights may not prove to be adequate and our competitors may independently develop technology or products that are similar to ours or that compete with ours. Trade secret and copyright laws afford only limited protection for our technology and products. The laws of many countries do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the United States. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. Third parties may also design around our proprietary rights, which may render our protected technology and products less valuable, if the design around is favorably received in the marketplace.\nWe recently filed a provisional patent application with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (\u201cPTO\u201d) with respect to providing interactive video streams involving interactive buttons which we utilize in our video products. However, our provisional patent application may not result in the issuance of a patent, or may result in narrow claims, which may limit the protection we are attempting to obtain. We also hold a number of granted patents in two families with pending continuations. A first family relates to systems and methods for enhanced networking, conversion tracking, and conversion attribution. This family contains two issued patents (U.S. Pat. No. 9,792,380, issued October 17, 2017; and U.S. Pat. No. 10,467,317, issued Nov. 5, 2019) and a pending continuation. A second family relates to systems and methods for generating a custom campaign. This family contains one issued patent (U.S. Pat. No. 10,643,247, issued May 5, 2020) and a pending continuation. These existing patents and any future patents that may be issued to us, may not protect commercially important aspects of our technology. Furthermore, the validity and enforceability of such patents may be challenged by third parties, which may result in our patents being invalidated or modified by the PTO, various legal actions against us, the need to develop or obtain alternative technology and/or obtain appropriate licenses under third party patents, which may not be available on acceptable terms or at all.\nThird parties may independently develop technology that is not covered by our patents, that is similar to, or competes with, our technology. In addition, our intellectual property may be infringed or misappropriated by third parties, particularly in foreign countries where the laws and governmental authorities may not protect our proprietary rights as effectively as those in the United States.\nThere is a risk that our means of protecting our intellectual property rights may not be adequate, and weaknesses or failures in this area could adversely affect our business or reputation, financial condition, and/or operating results.\nWe control access to our proprietary technology by entering into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors, and confidentiality agreements with third parties. Despite our precautions, we cannot assure you that our technology platform and products do not infringe patents held by others or that they will not in the future. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others, or to defend against claims of infringement, invalidity, misappropriation, or other claims.\nResearch and Development\nWe incurred $7,933,000 and $4,312,000 of research and development expenses during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. These expenses were incurred for the development of our interactive video-based sales enablement platform and associated applications.\nSuppliers\nWhile most of our design, development, and engineering team is U.S.-based, we currently utilize a small group of dedicated full-time and part-time off-shore experienced professionals for some of the coding and maintenance of our software. We believe we have mitigated the risks associated with managing an external team of software development professionals by incorporating experienced internal management and oversight, as well as appropriate systems, protocols, controls, and procedures to ensure the protection and integrity of all our applications. We have also ensured access to additional qualified professionals to provide like or complementary services on an as-needed basis.\nDependence on Key Customers\nBased on our current business and anticipated future activities as described in this Annual Report, we do not have any customers that represent more than 10% of our 2020 revenue.\nGovernment Regulation\nOur software and services are subject to certain legal, regulatory and other requirements. These laws are complex and evolving. Various U.S. federal and state laws govern many of our business activities, including, without limitation, the processing of payments and handling of consumer information. Despite our significant efforts to comply with all applicable requirements, there can be no guarantee that our efforts will be sufficient or that existing laws, rules or other requirements will not be interpreted, revised, augmented or rewritten in a way that adversely affects our regulated business activities, which comprise a significant majority of our overall business. For additional information related to these risk-related issues, refer to the section entitled \u201cRisk Factors\u201d within this Annual Report.\nEmployees\nAs of March 26, 2020, we had 104 full-time statutory employees, four part-time employees, and 59 independent contractors. We engage independent contractors on an as-needed-basis to provide specific expertise in areas of software design, development and coding, content creation, audio and video editing, video production services, and other business functions, including marketing and accounting. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have had no labor-related work stoppages and believe our relationship with our employees, consultants, and consultants, both full-time and part-time, is satisfactory.\nWe believe our people are at the heart of our success and our customers\u2019 success. We endeavor to not only attract and retain talented employees, but also to provide a challenging and rewarding environment to motivate and develop our valuable human capital. We look to our talented employees to lead and foster various initiatives that support our company culture including those related to diversity, equity and inclusion. In addition, we rely heavily on our talented team to execute our growth plans and achieve our long-term strategic objectives.\nWe provide competitive compensation and benefits for our employees. Our compensation packages may include base salary, commission or annual performance-based bonuses, and stock-based compensation. We also offer general employee medical, dental, and vision insurance, health savings and flexible spending accounts, mental health resources, paid time off, paid family leave, life and disability insurance, and 401(k) plan matching contributions. These programs and our overall compensation packages seek to attract and retain talented employees.\nWe take the health and welfare of our employees very seriously, and have encouraged safe practices designed to stem the infection and spread of COVID-19 within our workforce and beyond and to maintain the mental health and well-being of our employees. Beginning in March 2020, in an effort to protect our employees and comply with applicable government orders, we restricted non-essential employee travel and transitioned our employees to a remote work environment. We currently expect the majority of our employees will continue working remotely at least through the second quarter of 2021. We are committed to our employees returning to the workplace in the long-term.",
    "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nOur short and long-term success is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, many of which involve factors that are difficult to predict or beyond our control. As a result, investing in the Company\u2019s common stock involves substantial risk. The Company\u2019s stockholders should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, in addition to the other information contained in or incorporated by reference into this Annual Report, as well as the other information we file with the SEC from time to time. The risks described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also impair our business operations and financial results. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected. In such case, the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment. Our filings with the SEC also contain forward-looking statements that involve risks or uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated or contemplated by these forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors, including the risks we face described below, as well as other variables that could affect our operating results. Past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe have incurred significant net losses and cannot assure you that we will achieve or maintain profitable operations.\nWe have incurred recurring losses since inception. Our net loss was $24,956,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020 and $15,918,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019. We may continue to incur significant losses in the future for a number of reasons, including unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, and delays, and other unknown events.\nWe anticipate that our operating expenses will increase substantially in the foreseeable future as we undertake increased technology and production efforts to support our business and increase our marketing and sales efforts to drive an increase in the number of customers and clients utilizing our services. These expenditures may make it more difficult to achieve and maintain profitability. In addition, our efforts to grow our business may be more expensive than we expect, and we may not be able to generate sufficient revenue to offset increased operating expenses. If we are forced to reduce our expenses, our growth strategy could be compromised. To offset these anticipated increased operating expenses, we will need to generate and sustain significant revenue levels in future periods in order to become profitable, and, even if we do, we may not be able to maintain or increase our level of profitability.\nAccordingly, we cannot assure you that we will achieve sustainable operating profits as we continue to expand our infrastructure, restructure our balance sheet, further develop our marketing efforts, and otherwise implement our growth initiatives. Any failure to achieve and maintain profitability would have a materially adverse effect on our ability to implement our business plan, our results and operations, and our financial condition, and could cause the value of our common stock, to decline, resulting in a significant or complete loss of your investment.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm\u2019s reports for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 have raised substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a \u201cgoing concern.\u201d\nOur independent registered public accounting firm indicated in its report on our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. A \u201cgoing concern\u201d opinion indicates that the financial statements have been prepared assuming we will continue as a going concern and do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets, or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result if we do not continue as a going concern. Therefore, you should not rely on our consolidated balance sheet as an indication of the amount of proceeds that would be available to satisfy claims of creditors, and potentially be available for distribution to stockholders, in the event of liquidation. The presence of the going concern note to our financial statements may have an adverse impact on the relationships we are developing and plan to develop with third parties as we continue the commercialization of our products and could make it challenging and difficult for us to raise additional financing, all of which could have a material adverse impact on our business and prospects and result in a significant or complete loss of your investment.\nThere is no assurance that we will ever be profitable or that debt or equity financing will be available to us in the amounts, on terms, and at times deemed acceptable to us, if at all. The issuance of additional equity securities by us would result in a significant dilution in the equity interests of our current stockholders. Obtaining commercial loans, assuming those loans would be available, would increase our liabilities and future cash commitments. If we are unable to obtain financing in the amounts and on terms deemed acceptable to us, we may be unable to continue our business, as planned, and as a result may be required to scale back or cease operations for our business, the results of which would be that our stockholders would lose some or all of their investment. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result should we be unable to continue as a going concern.\nOur ability to grow and compete in the future will be adversely affected if adequate capital is not available to us or not available on terms favorable to us.\nWe have limited capital resources. We have financed our operations entirely through equity investments by founders and other investors and the incurrence of debt, and we expect to continue to finance our operations in the same manner in the foreseeable future. Our ability to continue our normal and planned operations, to grow our business, and to compete in our industry will depend on the availability of adequate capital. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain additional funding from those or other sources when or in the amounts needed, on acceptable terms, or at all. If we raise capital through the sale of equity, or securities convertible into equity, it would result in dilution to our then-existing stockholders, which could be significant depending on the price at which we may be able to sell our securities. If we raise additional capital through the incurrence of additional indebtedness, we would likely become subject to further covenants restricting our business activities, and holders of debt instruments may have rights and privileges senior to those of our then-existing stockholders. In addition, servicing the interest and principal repayment obligations under debt facilities could divert funds that would otherwise be available to support development of new programs and marketing to current and potential new clients. If we are unable to raise capital when needed or on attractive terms, we could be forced to delay, reduce, or eliminate development of new programs or future marketing efforts, or reduce or discontinue our operations. Any of these events could significantly harm our business, financial condition, and prospects.\nThe success of our business is dependent upon our ability to maintain and expand our customer base and our ability to convince our customers to increase the use of our services and/or platform. If we are unable to expand our customer base and/or the use of our services and/or platform by our customers declines, our business will be harmed.\nOur ability to expand and generate revenue depends, in part, on our ability to maintain and expand our relationships with existing customers and convince them to increase their use of our platform. If our customers do not increase their use of our platform, then our revenue may not grow and our results of operations may be harmed. It is difficult to predict customers\u2019 usage levels accurately and the loss of customers or reductions in their usage levels may have a negative impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. If a significant number of customers cease using, or reduce their usage of, our platform, then we may be required to spend significantly more on sales and marketing than we currently plan to spend in order to maintain or increase revenue. These additional expenditures could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Most of our customers do not have long-term contractual financial commitments to us and, therefore, most of our customers could reduce or cease their use of our platform at any time without penalty or termination charges.\nThe market in which we operate is intensely competitive and, if we do not compete effectively, our operating results could be harmed.\nThe market for CRM applications is intensely competitive and rapidly changing, barriers to entry are relatively low, and many of our competitors, including Salesforce.com, Microsoft, Oracle, SAP SE, and Adobe, which collectively account for approximately 41% of industry sales, have greater name recognition, longer operating histories, and larger marketing budgets, as well as substantially greater financial, technical, and other resources, than we do. In addition, many of our potential competitors have established marketing relationships and access to larger customer bases, and have major distribution agreements with consultants, system integrators, and resellers. As a result, our competitors may be able to respond more effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards, or customer requirements. Furthermore, because of these advantages, even if our products and services are more effective than the products and services that our competitors offer, potential customers might accept competitive products and services in lieu of purchasing our products and services. If we do not compete effectively against our current and future competitors, our operating results could be harmed.\nWe may not be able to increase the number of our strategic relationships or grow the revenues received from our current strategic relationships.\nWe have entered into certain strategic relationships with other marketing and CRM platforms, such as Oracle NetSuite and Adobe Market, to incorporate and integrate our interactive video technology, and are actively seeking additional strategic relationships. There can be no assurance, however, that these strategic relationships will result in material revenues for us or that we will be able to generate any other meaningful strategic relationships. If we are not able to increase the number of our strategic relationships or grow the revenues received from our current strategic relationships, our operating results could be harmed.\nWe may not be able to develop enhancements and new features to our existing service or acceptable new services that keep pace with technological developments.\nIf we are unable to develop enhancements to, and new features for, our sales enablement applications that keep pace with rapid technological developments, such as verbLIVE, our business will be harmed. The success of enhancements, new features, and services depends on several factors, including the timely completion, introduction, and market acceptance of the feature or edition. Failure in this regard may significantly impair our revenue growth or harm our reputation. We may not be successful in either developing these modifications and enhancements or in timely bringing them to market at a competitive price or at all. Furthermore, uncertainties about the timing and nature of new network platforms or technologies, or modifications to existing platforms or technologies, could increase our research and development expenses. Any failure of our service to operate effectively with future network platforms and technologies could reduce the demand for our service, result in customer dissatisfaction, and harm our business.\nOur ability to deliver our services is dependent on third party Internet providers.\nThe Internet\u2019s infrastructure is comprised of many different networks and services that, by design, are highly fragmented and distributed. This infrastructure is run by a series of independent, third-party organizations that work together to provide the infrastructure and supporting services of the Internet under the governance of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Numbers and Names (\u201cICANN\u201d) and the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (\u201cIANA\u201d), which is now related to ICANN.\nThe Internet has experienced, and will continue to experience, a variety of outages and other delays due to damages to portions of its infrastructure, denial-of-service attacks, or related cyber incidents. These scenarios are not under our control and could reduce the availability of the Internet to us or our customers for delivery of our services. Any resulting interruptions in our services or the ability of our customers to access our services could result in a loss of potential or existing customers and harm our business.\nSecurity breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information and expose us to liability, which would cause our business and reputation to suffer.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information, proprietary business information of our customers, including, credit card and payment information, and personally identifiable information of our customers and employees. The secure processing, maintenance, and transmission of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy. As such, we are subject to federal, state, provincial and foreign laws regarding privacy and protection of data. Some jurisdictions have enacted laws requiring companies to notify individuals of data security breaches involving certain types of personal data and our agreements with certain customers require us to notify them in the event of a security incident. Evolving regulations regarding personal data and personal information, in the European Union and elsewhere, including, but not limited to, the General Data Protection Regulation, and the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, especially relating to classification of IP addresses, machine identification, location data and other information, may limit or inhibit our ability to operate or expand our business. Such laws and regulations require or may require us or our customers to implement privacy and security policies, permit consumers to access, correct or delete personal information stored or maintained by us or our customers, inform individuals of security incidents that affect their personal information, and, in some cases, obtain consent to use personal information for specified purposes.\nWe believe that we take reasonable steps to protect the security, integrity and confidentiality of the information we collect, use, store, and disclose, and we take steps to strengthen our security protocols and infrastructure, however, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance, or other disruptions. We also could be negatively impacted by software bugs or other technical malfunctions, as well as employee error or malfeasance. Advanced cyber-attacks can be multi-staged, unfold over time, and utilize a range of attack vectors with military-grade cyber weapons and proven techniques, such as spear phishing and social engineering, leaving organizations and users at high risk of being compromised. Any such access, disclosure, or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, regulatory penalties, a disruption of our operations, damage to our reputation, a loss of confidence in our business, early termination of our contracts and other business losses, indemnification of our customers, liability for stolen assets or information, increased cybersecurity protection and insurance costs, financial penalties, litigation, regulatory investigations and other significant liabilities, any of which could materially harm our business any of which could adversely affect our business, revenues, and competitive position.\nOur success depends, in part, on the capacity, reliability, and security of our information technology hardware and software infrastructure, as well as our ability to adapt and expand our infrastructure.\nThe capacity, reliability, and security of our information technology hardware and software infrastructure are important to the operation of our current business, which would suffer in the event of system failures. Likewise, our ability to expand and update our information technology infrastructure in response to our growth and changing needs is important to the continued implementation of our new service offering initiatives. Our inability to expand or upgrade our technology infrastructure could have adverse consequences, including the delayed provision of services or implementation of new service offerings, and the diversion of development resources. We rely on third parties for various aspects of our hardware and software infrastructure. Third parties may experience errors or disruptions that could adversely impact us and over which we may have limited control. Interruption and/or failure of any of these systems could disrupt our operations and damage our reputation, thus adversely impacting our ability to provide our products and services, retain our current users, and attract new users. In addition, our information technology hardware and software infrastructure may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, misuse, computer viruses, or other events that could have a security impact. If one or more of such events occur, our customer and other information processed and stored in, and transmitted through, our information technology hardware and software infrastructure, or otherwise, could be compromised, which could result in significant losses or reputational damage. We may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify our protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures, and we may be subject to litigation and financial losses, any of which could substantially harm our business and our results of operations.\nWe are dependent on third parties to, among other things, maintain our servers, provide the bandwidth necessary to transmit content, and utilize the content derived therefrom for the potential generation of revenues.\nWe depend on third-party service providers, suppliers, and licensors to supply some of the services, hardware, software, and operational support necessary to provide some of our products and services. Some of these third parties do not have a long operating history or may not be able to continue to supply the equipment and services we desire in the future. If demand exceeds these vendors\u2019 capacity, or if these vendors experience operating or financial difficulties or are otherwise unable to provide the equipment or services we need in a timely manner, at our specifications and at reasonable prices, our ability to provide some products and services might be materially adversely affected, or the need to procure or develop alternative sources of the affected materials or services might delay our ability to serve our users. These events could materially and adversely affect our ability to retain and attract users, and have a material negative impact on our operations, business, financial results, and financial condition.\nWe may not be able to find suitable software developers at an acceptable cost.\nWe currently rely on certain key suppliers and vendors in the coding and maintenance of our software. We will continue to require such expertise in the future. Due to the current demand for skilled software developers, we run the risk of not being able to find or retain suitable and qualified personnel at an acceptable price, or at all. Without these developers, we may not be able to further develop and maintain our software, which is the most important aspect of our business development.\nThe success of our business is highly correlated to general economic conditions.\nDemand for our products and services is highly correlated with general economic conditions, as a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from discretionary spending by individuals, which typically declines during times of economic instability. Declines in economic conditions in the United States or in other countries in which we operate, including declines as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and may operate in the future may adversely impact our financial results. Because such declines in demand are difficult to predict, we or our industry may have increased excess capacity as a result. An increase in excess capacity may result in declines in prices for our products and services. Our ability to grow or maintain our business may be adversely affected by sustained economic weakness and uncertainty, including the effect of wavering consumer confidence, high unemployment, and other factors. The inability to grow or maintain our business would adversely affect our business, financial conditions, and results of operations, and thereby an investment in our common stock.\nOur failure to adequately protect our intellectual property rights could diminish the value of our products, weaken our competitive position and reduce our revenue, and infringement claims asserted against us or by us, could have a material adverse effect.\nWe regard the protection of our intellectual property, which includes patents, trade secrets, copyrights, trademarks and domain names, as critical to our success. We strive to protect our intellectual property rights by relying on federal, state and common law rights, as well as contractual restrictions. We enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors, and confidentiality agreements with parties with whom we conduct business in order to limit access to, and disclosure and use of, our proprietary information. However, these contractual arrangements and the other steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property may not prevent the misappropriation of our proprietary information or deter independent development of similar technologies by others.\nWe have two patents related to our system for providing access to, storing and distributing content, and we recently filed a provisional patent application with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (\u201cPTO\u201d), with respect to our interactive video technology. We have one patent related to methods for generating a custom campaign, and one continuation with respect to the same. Our provisional patent application may not result in the issuance of a patent, or certain claims may be rejected or may need to be narrowed, which may limit the protection we are attempting to obtain. In addition, our existing patents and any future patents that may be issued to us, may not protect commercially important aspects of our technology. Furthermore, the validity and enforceability of our patents may be challenged by third parties, which may result in our patents being invalidated or modified by the PTO, various legal actions against us, the need to develop or obtain alternative technology, and/or obtain appropriate licenses under third party patents, which may not be available on acceptable terms or at all.\nWe have registered domain names and trademarks in the United States and may also pursue additional registrations both in and outside the United States. Effective trade secret, copyright, trademark, domain name and patent protection is expensive to develop and maintain, both in terms of initial and ongoing registration requirements and the costs of defending our rights. We may be required to protect our intellectual property in an increasing number of jurisdictions, a process that is expensive and may not be successful or which we may not pursue in every location.\nMonitoring unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult and costly. Our efforts to protect our proprietary rights may not be adequate to prevent misappropriation of our intellectual property. Further, we may not be able to detect unauthorized use of, or take appropriate steps to enforce, our intellectual property rights. In addition, our competitors may independently develop similar technology. The laws in the United States and elsewhere change rapidly, and any future changes could adversely affect us and our intellectual property. Our failure to meaningfully protect our intellectual property could result in competitors offering services that incorporate our most technologically advanced features, which could seriously reduce demand for our products. In addition, we may in the future need to initiate infringement claims or litigation. Litigation, whether we are a plaintiff or a defendant, can be expensive, time-consuming and may divert the efforts of our technical staff and managerial personnel, which could harm our business, whether or not such litigation results in a determination that is unfavorable to us. In addition, litigation is inherently uncertain, and thus we may not be able to stop its competitors from infringing upon our intellectual property rights.\nNatural disasters and other events beyond our control could materially adversely affect us.\nNatural disasters or other catastrophic events may cause damage or disruption to our operations, international commerce and the global economy, and thus could have a strong negative effect on us. Our business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters, fire, power shortages, pandemics and other events beyond our control. Although we maintain crisis management and disaster response plans, such events could make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver our services to our customers and could decrease demand for our services.\nOur future success depends on our key executive officers and our ability to attract, retain, and motivate qualified personnel.\nOur future success largely depends upon the continued services of our executive officers and management team, especially our Chief Executive Officer, Chairman of our board of directors, and President, Mr. Rory J. Cutaia. If one or more of our executive officers are unable or unwilling to continue in their present positions, we may not be able to replace them readily, if at all. Additionally, we may incur additional expenses to recruit and retain new executive officers. If any of our executive officers joins a competitor or forms a competing company, we may lose some or all of our customers. Finally, we do not maintain \u201ckey person\u201d life insurance on any of our executive officers. Because of these factors, the loss of the services of any of these key persons could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations, and thereby an investment in our stock.\nOur continuing ability to attract and retain highly qualified personnel will also be critical to our success because we will need to hire and retain additional personnel as our business grows. There can be no assurance that we will be able to attract or retain highly qualified personnel. We face significant competition for skilled personnel in our industries. This competition may make it more difficult and expensive to attract, hire, and retain qualified managers and employees. Because of these factors, we may not be able to effectively manage or grow our business, which could adversely affect our financial condition or business. As a result, the value of your investment could be significantly reduced or completely lost.\nRisks Related to an Investment in Our Securities\nRaising additional capital, including through future sales and issuances of our common stock, warrants or the exercise of rights to purchase common stock pursuant to our equity incentive plan could result in additional dilution of the percentage ownership of our stockholders, could cause our share price to fall and could restrict our operations.\nWe expect that significant additional capital will be needed in the future to continue our planned operations, including any potential acquisitions, hiring new personnel and continuing activities as an operating public company. To the extent we seek additional capital through a combination of public and private equity offerings and debt financings, our stockholders may experience substantial dilution. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interest of our existing stockholders may be diluted, and the terms may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our stockholders. Debt and receivables financings may be coupled with an equity component, such as warrants to purchase shares of our common stock, which could also result in dilution of our existing stockholders\u2019 ownership. The incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased fixed payment obligations and could also result in certain restrictive covenants, such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business. A failure to obtain adequate funds may cause us to curtail certain operational activities, including sales and marketing, in order to reduce costs and sustain the business, and would have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nIn addition, we have granted options to purchase shares of our common stock pursuant to our equity incentive plans and have registered 16,000,000 shares of common stock underlying options and shares granted pursuant to our equity incentive plans. Sales of shares issued upon exercise of options granted under our equity compensation plans may result in material dilution to our existing stockholders, which could cause our price of our common stock to fall.\nOur issuance of additional shares of preferred stock could adversely affect the market value of our common stock, dilute the voting power of common stockholders and delay or prevent a change of control.\nOur board of directors have the authority to cause us to issue, without any further vote or action by the stockholders, up to an additional 14,994,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series, to designate the number of shares constituting any series, and to fix the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions thereof, including dividend rights, voting rights, rights and terms of redemption, redemption price or prices and liquidation preferences of such series. As of March 26, 2021, we had 1,706 shares of preferred stock outstanding that are convertible into 1,550,909 shares of common stock.\nThe issuance of shares of preferred stock with dividend or conversion rights, liquidation preferences or other economic terms favorable to the holders of preferred stock could adversely affect the market price for our common stock by making an investment in the common stock less attractive. For example, investors in the common stock may not wish to purchase common stock at a price above the conversion price of a series of convertible preferred stock because the holders of the preferred stock would effectively be entitled to purchase common stock at the lower conversion price causing economic dilution to the holders of common stock.\nFurther, the issuance of shares of preferred stock with voting rights may adversely affect the voting power of the holders of our other classes of voting stock either by diluting the voting power of our other classes of voting stock if they vote together as a single class, or by giving the holders of any such preferred stock the right to block an action on which they have a separate class vote even if the action were approved by the holders of our other classes of voting stock. The issuance of shares of preferred stock may also have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of our company without further action by the stockholders, even where stockholders are offered a premium for their shares.\nThe market price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be, subject to substantial volatility.\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including;\n\u25cf volatility in the trading markets generally and in our particular market segment;\n\u25cf limited trading of our common stock;\n\u25cf actual or anticipated fluctuations in our results of operations;\n\u25cf the financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in those projections, or our failure to meet those projections;\n\u25cf announcements regarding our business or the business of our customers or competitors;\n\u25cf changes in accounting standards, policies, guidelines, interpretations, or principles;\n\u25cf actual or anticipated developments in our business or our competitors\u2019 businesses or the competitive landscape generally;\n\u25cf developments or disputes concerning our intellectual property or our offerings, or third-party proprietary rights;\n\u25cf announced or completed acquisitions of businesses or technologies by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf new laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business;\n\u25cf any major change in our board of directors or management;\n\u25cf sales of shares of our common stock by us or by our stockholders;\n\u25cf lawsuits threatened or filed against us; and\n\u25cf other events or factors, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism, pandemics (such as the COVID-19 pandemic) or responses to these events.\nStatements of, or changes in, opinions, ratings, or earnings estimates made by brokerage firms or industry analysts relating to the markets in which we operate or expect to operate could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. In addition, the stock market as a whole, as well as our particular market segment, has from time to time experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations, which may affect the market price for the securities of many companies, and which often have appeared unrelated to the operating performance of such companies. Any of these factors could negatively affect our stockholders\u2019 ability to sell their shares of common stock at the time and price they desire.\nA decline in the price of our common stock could affect our ability to raise further working capital, which could adversely impact our ability to continue operations.\nA prolonged decline in the price of our common stock could result in a reduction in the liquidity of our common stock and a reduction in our ability to raise capital. We may attempt to acquire a significant portion of the funds we need in order to conduct our planned operations through the sale of equity securities; thus, a decline in the price of our common stock could be detrimental to our liquidity and our operations because the decline may adversely affect investors\u2019 desire to invest in our securities. If we are unable to raise the funds we require for all of our planned operations, we may be forced to reallocate funds from other planned uses and may suffer a significant negative effect on our business plan and operations, including our ability to develop new products or services and continue our current operations. As a result, our business may suffer, and we may be forced to reduce or discontinue operations. We also might not be able to meet our financial obligations if we cannot raise enough funds through the sale of our common stock and we may be forced to reduce or discontinue operations.\nBecause we do not intend to pay any cash dividends on our shares of common stock in the near future, our stockholders will not be able to receive a return on their shares unless and until they sell them.\nWe intend to retain a significant portion of any future earnings to finance the development, operation and expansion of our business. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the near future. The declaration, payment, and amount of any future dividends will be made at the discretion of our board of directors, and will depend upon, among other things, the results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition, operating and capital requirements, and other factors as our board of directors considers relevant. There is no assurance that future dividends will be paid, and, if dividends are paid, there is no assurance with respect to the amount of any such dividend. Unless our board of directors determines to pay dividends, our stockholders will be required to look to appreciation of our common stock to realize a gain on their investment. There can be no assurance that this appreciation will occur.\nBecause our directors and executive officers are among our largest stockholders, they can exert significant control over our business and affairs and have actual or potential interests that may depart from those of investors.\nCertain of our executive officers and directors own a significant percentage of our outstanding capital stock. We estimate our executive officers and directors and their respective affiliates beneficially owned approximately 10.1% of our outstanding voting stock as of March 26, 2021. The holdings of our directors and executive officers may increase further in the future upon vesting or other maturation of exercise rights under any of the options or warrants they may hold or in the future be granted, or if they otherwise acquire additional shares of our common stock. The interests of such persons may differ from the interests of our other stockholders. As a result, in addition to their board seats and offices, such persons will have significant influence and control over all corporate actions requiring stockholder approval, irrespective of how our other stockholders may vote, including the following actions:\n\u25cf\nto elect or defeat the election of our directors;\n\u25cf to amend or prevent amendment to our articles of incorporation or bylaws;\n\u25cf to effect or prevent a merger, sale of assets or other corporate transaction; and\n\u25cf to control the outcome of any other matter submitted to our stockholders for a vote.\nThis concentration of ownership by itself may have the effect of impeding a merger, consolidation, takeover, or other business consolidation, or discouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer for our common stock, which in turn could reduce our stock price or prevent our stockholders from realizing a premium over our stock price.\nOur common stock has been categorized as \u201cpenny stock,\u201d which may make it more difficult for investors to sell their shares of common stock due to suitability requirements.\nThe SEC has adopted regulations which generally define a \u201cpenny stock\u201d to be any equity security that has a market price (as defined) less than $5.00 per share or an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. Our securities are covered by the penny stock rules, which impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell to persons other than established customers and \u201caccredited investors\u201d. The term \u201caccredited investor\u201d refers generally to institutions with assets in excess of $5,000,000 or individuals with a net worth in excess of $1,000,000 or annual income exceeding $200,000 or $300,000 jointly with their spouse. The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document in a form prepared by the SEC that provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer\u2019s account. The bid and offer quotations, and the broker-dealer and salesperson compensation information, must be given to the customer orally or in writing prior to effecting the transaction and must be given to the customer in writing before or with the customer\u2019s confirmation. In addition, the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from these rules, the broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser\u2019s written agreement to the transaction. These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market for the stock that is subject to these penny stock rules. Consequently, these penny stock rules may affect the ability of broker-dealers to trade our securities. We believe that the penny stock rules discourage investor interest in and limit the marketability of our common stock.\nThe Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. has adopted sales practice requirements that historically may have limited a stockholder\u2019s ability to buy and sell our common stock, which could depress the price of our common stock.\nIn addition to the \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules described above, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (\u201cFINRA\u201d) has adopted rules that require that, in recommending an investment to a customer, a broker-dealer must have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that customer. Prior to recommending speculative low-priced securities to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer\u2019s financial status, tax status, investment objectives, and other information. Under interpretations of these rules, FINRA believes that there is a high probability that speculative low-priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers. Thus, the FINRA requirements historically has made it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that their customers buy our common stock, which could limit your ability to buy and sell our common stock, have an adverse effect on the market for our shares, and thereby depress our price per share of common stock.\nThe elimination of monetary liability against our directors, officers, and employees under Nevada law and the existence of indemnification rights for our obligations to our directors, officers, and employees may result in substantial expenditures by us and may discourage lawsuits against our directors, officers, and employees.\nOur articles of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions permitting us to eliminate the personal liability of our directors and officers to us and our stockholders for damages for the breach of a fiduciary duty as a director or officer to the extent provided by Nevada law. In addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with our directors and officers to provide such indemnification rights. We may also have contractual indemnification obligations under any future employment agreements with our officers. The foregoing indemnification obligations could result in us incurring substantial expenditures to cover the cost of settlement or damage awards against directors and officers, which we may be unable to recoup. These provisions and the resulting costs may also discourage us from bringing a lawsuit against directors and officers for breaches of their fiduciary duties and may similarly discourage the filing of derivative litigation by our stockholders against our directors and officers even though such actions, if successful, might otherwise benefit us and our stockholders.\nAnti-takeover effects of certain provisions of Nevada state law hinder a potential takeover of us.\nNevada has a business combination law that prohibits certain business combinations between Nevada corporations and \u201cinterested stockholders\u201d for three years after an \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d first becomes an \u201cinterested stockholder,\u201d unless the corporation\u2019s board of directors approves the combination in advance. For purposes of Nevada law, an \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d is any person who is (i) the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of ten percent or more of the voting power of the outstanding voting shares of the corporation or (ii) an affiliate or associate of the corporation and at any time within the three previous years was the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of ten percent or more of the voting power of the then-outstanding shares of the corporation. The definition of the term \u201cbusiness combination\u201d is sufficiently broad to cover virtually any kind of transaction that would allow a potential acquirer to use the corporation\u2019s assets to finance the acquisition or otherwise to benefit its own interests rather than the interests of the corporation and its other stockholders.\nThe potential effect of Nevada\u2019s business combination law is to discourage parties interested in taking control of us from doing so if these parties cannot obtain the approval of our board of directors. Both of these provisions could limit the price investors would be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.\nOur bylaws contain an exclusive forum provision, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees or agents.\nOur bylaws provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the state and federal courts in the State of Nevada shall be the exclusive forum for any litigation relating to our internal affairs, including, without limitation: (a) any derivative action brought on behalf of us, (b) any action asserting a claim for breach of fiduciary duty to us or our stockholders by any current or former officer, director, employee, or agent of us, or (c) any action against us or any current or former officer, director, employee, or agent of us arising pursuant to any provision of the Nevada Revised Statutes, the articles of incorporation, or the bylaws.\nFor the avoidance of doubt, the exclusive forum provision described above does not apply to any claims arising under the Securities Act or Exchange Act. Section 27 of the Exchange Act creates exclusive federal jurisdiction over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations thereunder, and Section 22 of the Securities Act creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Act or the rules and regulations thereunder.\nThe choice of forum provision in our bylaws may limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that they find favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees or agents, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers, employees and agents even though an action, if successful, might benefit our stockholders. The applicable courts may also reach different judgments or results than would other courts, including courts where a stockholder considering an action may be located or would otherwise choose to bring the action, and such judgments or results may be more favorable to us than to our stockholders. With respect to the provision making the state and federal courts in the State of Nevada the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions, stockholders who do bring a claim in the state and federal courts in the State of Nevada could face additional litigation costs in pursuing any such claim, particularly if they do not reside in or near Nevada. Finally, if a court were to find this provision of our bylaws inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could have a material adverse effect on us.",

This discussion includes forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties, such as our plans, objectives, expectations, and intentions. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties such as our plans, estimates, and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements below. Factors that could cause or contribute to those differences in our actual results include, but are not limited to, those discussed below and those discussed elsewhere within this Annual Report, particularly in the section entitled \u201cCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and the Item entitled \u201cRisk Factors.\u201d\nOverview\nWe are a Software-as-a-Service (\u201cSaaS\u201d) applications platform developer. Our platform is comprised of a suite of interactive video-based sales enablement business software products marketed on a subscription basis. Our applications, available in both mobile and desktop versions, are offered as a fully integrated suite, as well as on a standalone basis, and include verbCRM, our white-labelled Customer Relationship Management (\u201cCRM\u201d) application for large sales-based enterprises; verbTEAMS, our CRM application for small-and medium-sized businesses and solopreneurs; verbLEARN, our Learning Management System application, and verbLIVE, our Live Stream eCommerce application.\nOur Technology\nOur suite of applications can be distinguished from other sales enablement applications because our applications utilize our proprietary interactive video technology as the primary means of communication between sales and marketing professionals and their customers and prospects. Moreover, the proprietary data collection and analytics capabilities of our applications inform our users on their devices in real time , when and for how long their prospects have watched a video, how many times such prospects watched it, and what they clicked on, which allows our users to focus their time and efforts on \u2018hot leads\u2019 or interested prospects rather than on those that have not seen such video or otherwise expressed interest in such content. Users can create their hot lead lists by using familiar, intuitive \u2018swipe left/swipe right\u2019 on-screen navigation. Our clients report that these capabilities provide for a much more efficient and effective sales process, resulting in increased sales conversion rates. We developed the proprietary patent-pending interactive video technology, as well as several other patent-issued and patent-pending technologies that serve as the unique foundation for all our platform applications.\nOur Products\nverbCRM combines the capabilities of CRM lead-generation, content management, and in-video ecommerce capabilities in an intuitive, yet powerful tool for both inexperienced as well as highly skilled sales professionals. verbCRM allows users to quickly and easily create, distribute, and post videos to which they can add a choice of on-screen clickable icons which, when clicked, allow viewers to respond to the user\u2019s call-to-action in real-time, in the video, while the video is playing, without leaving or stopping the video. For example, our technology allows a prospect or customer to click on a product they see featured in a video and impulse buy it, or to click on a calendar icon in the video to make an appointment with a salesperson, among many other novel features and functionalities designed to eliminate or reduce friction from the sales process for our users. The verbCRM app is designed to be easy to use and navigate, and takes little time and training for a user to begin using the app effectively. It usually takes less than four minutes for a novice user to create an interactive video from our app. Users can add interactive icons to pre-existing videos, as well as to newly created videos shot with practically any mobile device. verbCRM interactive videos can be distributed via email, text messaging, chat app, or posted to popular social media directly and easily from our app. No software download is required to view Verb interactive videos on virtually any mobile or desktop device, including smart TVs.\nverbLEARN is an interactive, video-based learning management system that incorporates all of the clickable in-video technology featured in our verbCRM application and adapts them for use by educators for video-based education. verbLEARN is used by enterprises seeking to educate a large sales team or a customer base about new products, or elicit feedback about existing products. It also incorporates Verb\u2019s proprietary data collection and analytics capabilities that inform users in real time when and for how long the viewers watched the video, how many times they watched it, and what they clicked on, in addition to adding gamification features that enhance the learning aspects of the application.\nverbLIVE builds on popular video-based platforms such as Facebook Live, Zoom, WebEx, and Go2Meeting, among others, by adding Verb\u2019s proprietary interactive in-video ecommerce capabilities - including an in-video Shopify shopping cart integrated for Shopify account holders - to our own live stream video broadcasting application. verbLIVE is a next-generation live stream platform that allows hosts to utilize a variety of novel sales-driving features, including placing interactive icons on-screen that appear on the screens of all viewers, providing in-video click-to-purchase capabilities for products or services featured in the live video broadcast, in real-time, driving friction-free selling. verbLIVE also provides the host with real-time viewer engagement data and interaction analytics. verbLIVE is entirely browser-based, allowing it to function easily and effectively on all devices without requiring the host or the viewers to download software, and is secured through end-to-end encryption. A mobile app-based version of verbLIVE, with enhanced features, is currently in development and is expected to be released in early second quarter of 2021.\nverbTEAMS is our interactive, video-based CRM for small-and medium-sized businesses and solopreneurs. verbTEAMS also incorporates verbLIVE as a bundled application. verbTEAMS incorporates self-sign-up, self-onboarding, self-configuring, content management system capabilities, user level administrative capabilities, and high-quality analytics capabilities in both mobile and desktop platforms that sync with one another. It also has a built-in one-click sync capability with Salesforce.\nVerb Partnerships and Integrations\nWe have completed and deployed the integration of verbLIVE into Salesforce and passed their security review process. In recent weeks we launched a joint marketing campaign with Salesforce to introduce the verbLIVE plug-in functionality to current Salesforce users. A verbCRM sync application for Salesforce users is currently being utilized by at least one of our large enterprise clients and the verbLIVE plug-in is now being offered to all Salesforce users on a monthly subscription fee basis.\nWe have completed the integration of verbCRM into systems offered by 17 of the most popular direct sales back-office system providers, such as Direct Scale, Exigo, By Design, Thatcher, Multisoft, Xennsoft, and Party Plan. Direct sales back-office systems provide many of the support functions required for direct sales operations, including payroll, customer genealogy management, statistics, rankings, and earnings, among other direct sales financial tracking capabilities. The integration into these back-office providers, facilitated through our own API development, allows single sign-on convenience for users, as well as enhanced data analytics and reporting capabilities for all users. We believe that our integration into these back-end platforms accelerates the adoption of verbCRM by large direct sales enterprises that rely on these systems and as such, we believe this represents a competitive advantage.\nWe are currently working to introduce an integration of our interactive video technology into Microsoft Outlook followed by a broad-scale launch in early 2021, pursuant to and in accordance with our existing Microsoft partnership agreement. We expect to follow the Microsoft Outlook integration with the integration into other Microsoft Office 365 products.\nNon-Digital Products and Services\nHistorically, we have also provided certain non-digital services to some of our enterprise clients such as printing and fulfillment services. We designed and printed welcome kits and starter kits for their marketing needs and provided fulfillment services, which consisted of managing the preparation, handling and shipping of our client\u2019s custom-branded merchandise they use for marketing purposes at conferences and other events. We also managed the fulfillment of our clients\u2019 product sample packs that verbCRM users order through the app for automated delivery and tracking to their customers and prospects.\nHowever, in May 2020, we executed a contract with Range Printing (\u201cRange\u201d), a company in the business of providing enterprise class printing, sample assembly, warehousing, packaging, shipping, and fulfillment services. Pursuant to the contract, through an automated process we have established for this purpose, Range will receive orders for samples and merchandise from us as and when we receive them from our clients and users, and print, assemble, store, package and ship such samples and merchandise on our behalf. The Range contract provides for a revenue share arrangement based upon the specific services to be provided by Range that is designed to maintain our relationship with our clients by continuing to service their non-digital needs, while eliminating the labor and overhead costs associated with the provision of such services by us. The transition to Range Printing is now virtually complete.\nOur Market\nOur client base consists primarily of multi-national direct sales enterprises to whom we provide white-labeled, client-branded versions of our products. Our clients also include large professional associations, educational institutions, including school districts, auto sales, auto leasing, insurance, real estate, home security, not-for-profits, as well as clients in the health care industry, and the burgeoning CBD industry, among other business sectors. As of March 26, 2021, we provide subscription-based application services to approximately 140 enterprise clients for use in over 60 countries, in over 48 languages, which collectively account for a user base generated through more than 1.9 million downloads of our verbCRM application. Among the new business sectors targeted for this year are pharmaceutical sales, government institutions, small businesses and individual entrepreneurs.\nRevenue Generation\nWe generate revenue from the following sources:\n\u25cf recurring subscription fees paid by enterprise users and affiliates;\n\u25cf recurring subscription fees paid by non-enterprise, small business, and individual users;\n\u25cf recurring subscription fees paid by users who access in-app purchases of various premium services, features, functionality, and upgrades;\n\u25cf recurring subscription fees paid by users who access in-app purchases of third-party software provider apps in our forthcoming app store;\n\u25cf recurring subscription fees paid by users of Salesforce and Microsoft among others with whom we have executed partnership agreements, for access to our applications that we either have integrated or intend to integrate into these platforms, including recurring subscription fees paid by users who subscribe to bundled service offerings from these partners and/or their respective value-added resellers;\n\u25cf recurring subscription fees paid by users for all of the foregoing products and services generated through our recently launched Japan operations;\n\u25cf recurring subscription fees paid by users generated through our forthcoming reseller and affiliate distribution programs; and\n\u25cf Fees paid by enterprise clients for non-digital products and services through our Range Printing venture.\nRecent Developments\nverbLIVE Marketing and Monetization Strategies\nSalesforce\nverbLIVE is available to Salesforce users in the Salesforce App Exchange Marketplace under the Salesforce partner program. For a monthly subscription fee of $24.99 per user per month, every Salesforce user that subscribes will have the ability to click on their contacts icon in their Salesforce dashboard and from the drop-down menu they will see a verbLIVE icon. By clicking that, Salesforce users will be able to launch their own verbLIVE live stream ecommerce session and invite people to participate directly from their Salesforce contacts list. We worked with Salesforce to develop a marketing campaign to promote verbLIVE within the Salesforce ecosystem that launched in October 2020.\nverbLIVE Pre-Sales\nAs previously disclosed, 17 of our existing clients have signed up for verbLIVE during the pre-launch marketing last quarter. We believe that these corporate clients have a combined potential individual user base of 465,350 users which represent the total addressable market among the existing clients that have already signed on. Historically, our penetration rates among our existing corporate clients vary but on the low end it is approximately 10%. Adopting that 10% rate, we believe that we have the potential to attract 46,000 users to subscribe and pay for verbLIVE. Currently, we charge $9.99 to $14.99 per user per month for verbLIVE depending on the features and package for existing verbCRM users, though at launch, we may charge a lower price, including a free trial period. Applying the lower price of $9.99 per user and a penetration rate of 10% for this analysis, we believe that we could potentially capture approximately $0.5 million of SaaS recurring revenue per month - or approximately $5.5 million of annual recurring revenue. We are encouraged by the fact that many of these prospective users already have our verbCRM app on their mobile device which allows us to send very targeted marketing messages promoting verbLIVE, including video demonstrations explaining what verbLIVE could do for their business. In addition, our platform is already integrated into many of our clients\u2019 back-office providers making adoption for these clients and users much faster and easier. This is a small part of our internal modeling and should not be interpreted by anyone as a guarantee of performance or results. Notwithstanding the foregoing, which is an example only, our current projected usage models forecast far greater numbers than the 10% penetration rates for our existing signed customers, which we projected earlier this year, and much greater numbers still when we add anticipated adoption rates from the as yet untapped market outside our existing business.\nFor the quarter ended September 30, 2020, we reported that we were working diligently to ramp up capacity before a larger launch to ensure that we do not face service outages from overloaded servers. Notwithstanding these efforts, we may nevertheless experience server overloads as it is difficult to predict the rate of adoption and usage. We have begun final testing on the platform enhancements that have been designed and built to accommodate tens of thousands of simultaneous live streams, logins, viewers, and interactions on a global basis. Upon satisfactory completion of the testing, we will begin satisfying our existing back-log of current verbCRM users as discussed above.\nWe also intend to release a new small business-focused version of our interactive video CRM application, that incorporates verbLIVE which we expect to release before year-end. This new application, called verbTEAMS, is designed to appeal to a larger target market than our verbCRM application as it incorporates self-sign-up, self-onboarding, self-configuring, content management system capabilities, user level administrative capabilities, and high quality analytics capabilities in both mobile and desktop platforms that sync with one another. It also has a built-in one-click synch capability with Salesforce. verbTEAMS is designed for small businesses and entrepreneurs with a feature set we believe is highly scalable and unique in the marketplace, that will be very competitive with the most popular CRM systems available today.\nSoloFire Acquisition\nIn September 2020 we completed the acquisition of Ascend Certification, LLC, dba SoloFire (\u201cSoloFire\u201d). SoloFire develops and markets leading SaaS-based sales enablement applications for sales representatives of medical device, diagnostics and life sciences companies. SoloFire\u2019s platform empowers sales and marketing teams by allowing them to efficiently find, show, share and track regulatory and industry compliant, accurate and up-to-date content. With SoloFire, content can be locally stored, making it accessible without Wi-fi or mobile data, which is often a challenge in hospital environments. The sales tools can be tailored to a company\u2019s unique medical products, while creating personalized sales conversations with physicians and other stakeholders. In addition, insights from in-depth analytics capabilities enable sales and marketing teams to identify and replicate the content that most resonates with clients, driving higher conversion rates. We have begun combining VERB\u2019s sales enablement solutions, including our interactive video and interactive livestream ecommerce features, with the SoloFire mobile and desktop applications to provide even more powerful tools for this exciting new target market.\nImpact of COVID-19 on Our Business and Industry\nIn the three months ended June 30, 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in significant uncertainty and volatility in a wide variety of industries and markets, including in our industry, and prompted many federal, state, local, and foreign governments to implement various lock-down measures in an attempt to contain the spread and mitigate the impact of the disease. The initial implementation of such lock-down measures, and their re-introduction in response to a nation-wide resurgence of COVID-19 cases in late-2020, resulted in business closures, work stoppages, slowdowns and delays, work-from-home policies, travel restrictions and the cancellation or postponement of events.\nDespite recent approval and initial distribution of vaccines, both the pandemic and the containment and mitigation measures have had, and are likely to continue to have, an adverse impact on the global and U.S. economies, the severity and duration of which are uncertain. It is likely that government stabilization efforts will only partially mitigate the consequences to the economy. As such, both the pandemic and containment and mitigation measures may adversely affect our business, operations and financial condition by, among other things, reducing demand for our applications, impairing the productivity of our workforce, and reducing our access to capital. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will impact our business, financial conditions, and results of operations in the future remains uncertain and will be affected by a number of factors. These include the duration and extent of the pandemic, the duration and extent of imposed or recommended containment and mitigation measures, the extent, duration, and effective execution of government stabilization and recovery efforts, including those from the successful distribution of effective vaccines.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic may have long-term effects on the nature of the office environment and remote working. This may present operational and workplace culture challenges that may adversely affect our business. However, we are committed to our employees returning to the workplace in the long-term. Throughout the year ended December 31, 2020 and through the filing of this Annual Report, we have encouraged safe practices designed to stem the infection and spread of COVID-19 within our workforce and beyond and to maintain the mental health and well-being of our employees. Beginning in March 2020, in an effort to protect our employees and comply with applicable government orders, we restricted non-essential employee travel and transitioned our employees to a remote work environment. We currently expect the majority of our employees will continue working remotely at least through the second quarter of 2021. Our workforce has continued to effectively develop and support our product and service offerings notwithstanding the current environment.\nWe began the year ended December 31, 2020 with healthy demand for our products and services, many of which are designed to enable our customers to manage their businesses virtually. In the three months ended June 30, 2020, we experienced some uncertainty regarding whether there would be variability in demand for the services we provide on our platform after lock-down measures were implemented. We expect demand variability for our products and services may continue as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic; however, our sales team reported a higher level of interest in our products and services during the year ended December 31, 2020. Although the impact has not been material to date, a prolonged downturn in economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our customers and demand for our services.\nWe continue to actively communicate with and listen to our customers to ensure we are responding to their needs in the current environment with innovative solutions that will not only be beneficial now but also over the long-term. We monitor developments related to COVID-19 and remain flexible in our response to the challenges presented by the pandemic. To mitigate the adverse impact COVID-19 may have on our business and operations, we implemented a number of measures in the year ended December 31, 2020 to protect the health and safety of our employees, as well as to strengthen our financial position. These efforts include eliminating, reducing, or deferring non-essential expenditures, as well as complying with local and state government recommendations to protect our workforce.\nResults of Operations\nFiscal Year Ended December 31, 2020 compared to the Fiscal Year Ended December 31, 2019\nThe following is a comparison of the results of our operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nYear Ended December 31,\nYear Ended December 31,\nChange\nRevenue\nSaaS recurring subscription revenue $ 5,114,000 $ 2,815,000 2,299,000\nOther digital revenue 1,384,000 1,425,000 (41,000 )\nDesign, printing, and fulfillment 2,744,000 3,913,000 (1,169,000 )\nShipping 723,000 947,000 (224,000 )\nTotal revenue 9,965,000 9,100,000 865,000\nCost of Revenue\nDigital 1,416,000 660,000 756,000\nDesign, printing, and fulfillment 2,701,000 3,273,000 (572,000 )\nShipping 684,000 937,000 (253,000 )\nTotal cost of revenue 4,801,000 4,870,000 (69,000 )\nGross margin 5,164,000 4,230,000 934,000\nOperating expenses\nResearch and development 7,933,000 4,312,000 3,621,000\nDepreciation and amortization 1,510,000 1,042,000 468,000\nGeneral and administrative 20,458,000 14,710,000 5,748,000\nTotal operating expenses 29,901,000 20,064,000 9,837,000\nLoss from operations (24,737,000 ) (15,834,000 ) (8,903,000 )\nOther income (expense), net\nOther income (expense) 102,000 (11,000 ) 113,000\nFinancing costs (248,000 ) (1,625,000 ) 1,377,000\nInterest expense - amortization of debt discount (493,000 ) (1,658,000 ) 1,165,000\nChange in fair value of derivative liability 574,000 1,862,000 (1,288,000 )\nDebt extinguishment, net - 1,536,000 (1,536,000 )\nInterest expense (153,000 ) (186,000 ) 33,000\nTotal other expense, net (218,000 ) (82,000 ) (136,000 )\nIncome tax provision 1,000 2,000 (1,000 )\nNet loss (24,956,000 ) (15,918,000 ) 9,038,000\nDeemed dividend to Series A preferred stockholders (3,951,000 ) - (3,951,000 )\nNet loss to common stockholders $ (28,907,000 ) $ (15,918,000 ) $ (12,989,000 )\nRevenue\nTotal revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $10.0 million, compared to $9.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in revenue is attributed to the addition of new clients and the expansion of existing clients for access to one or more of our suite of software products on our sales enablement platform. Those products now include verbCRM, verbLEARN, verb TEAMS, and verbLIVE. The revenue we derive from these products is divided into two main categories: digital revenue and non-digital revenue. Within the digital revenue category, we have two forms of revenue. The first is SaaS recurring digital revenue based on contract-based subscriptions to our products and platform services. The second is non-SaaS, non-recurring digital revenue which is revenue generated by use of our apps and in-app purchases, such as sampling and other services obtained through the app. Non-digital revenue is revenue we generate from non-app, non-digital sources through ancillary services we provide as an accommodation to our clients and customers. These include printing and shipping services which we now outsource to a strategic partner as part of a cost reduction plan we instituted in 2020.\nTotal digital revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $6.5 million, compared to $4.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This consisted of SaaS recurring subscription-based revenue associated with our verbCRM, verbLEARN, and verbTEAMS applications of $5.1 million compared to $2.8 million in 2019. There was no revenue for verbLIVE in 2020 as it was launched commercially in 2021. Non-subscription digital revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 was virtually flat compared to December 31, 2019.\nTotal non-digital revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $3.5 million, compared to $4.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Total non-digital revenue for 2020 consisted of revenue generated from the design and printing of welcome kits/starter kits that our clients use for new sales reps, fulfillment of various custom products our clients use for marketing purposes and at conferences of $2.7 million; and shipping fees associated with client welcome kits and fulfillment of $723,000.\nThe table below sets forth our quarterly revenues from the quarter ended March 31, 2019 through the quarter ended December 31, 2020, which reflects the trend of revenue since our acquisition of Verb Direct in April 2019:\n2019 Quarterly Revenue 2020 Quarterly Revenue\nQ1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4\nSaaS recurring subscription revenue $ 9,000 $ 858,000 $ 953,000 $ 995,000 1,057,000 1,274,000 1,478,000 1,305,000 *\nOther digital revenue - 596,000 485,000 344,000 400,000 406,000 360,000 218,000\nTotal digital revenue $ 9,000 $ 1,454,000 $ 1,438,000 $ 1,339,000 1,457,000 1,680,000 1,838,000 1,523,000\nDesign, printing, and fulfillment - 1,784,000 1,164,000 965,000 728,000 713,000 836,000 467,000\nShipping - 495,000 271,000 181,000 169,000 259,000 186,000 109,000\nTotal non-digital revenue $ - $ 2,279,000 $ 1,435,000 $ 1,146,000 897,000 972,000 1,022,000 576,000\nGrand total $ 9,000 $ 3,733,000 $ 2,873,000 $ 2,485,000 2,354,000 2,652,000 2,860,000 2,099,000\n* The decrease in digital revenue is primarily attributed to the impact of COVID-19 on many of our customers, which magnified what is traditionally a business slowdown during holiday season. We also experienced an unusual loss of several customers which had a direct impact on our 4th quarter recurring revenue. Notably, however, as the year drew to a close, as of December 31, 2020, we had begun to see a meaningful uptick and return to more normalized business and sales activity with 14 new clients under contract that will launch in 2021, at which time we will recognize that revenue. Overall, we signed 62 new clients in 2020, representing approximately $3.0 million of minimum contract value.\nCost of Revenue\nTotal cost of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $4.8 million, compared to $4.9 million for 2019. The decrease in cost of revenue is primarily attributed by lower non-digital revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 versus December 31, 2019 offset by an increase in digital cost of revenue attributed to additional enterprise customers on the platform and increased users within our existing customer base.\nGross Margin\nThe shift in resources to our SaaS recurring subscription revenue reflects an increase in gross margin to 52% for the year ended December 31, 2020 versus 46% for the year ended December 31, 2019. The shift had a material impact on as gross margin increased $934,000, while gross revenue increased $865,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020 versus December 31, 2019.\nOperating Expenses\nResearch and development expenses were $7.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $4.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Research and development expenses primarily consisted of fees paid to employees and vendors contracted to perform research projects and develop technology. The increase in research and development is attributed the development of verbLIVE, plus enhancements to verbCRM and our core platform to facilitate native integrations with Salesforce, Microsoft, and other channel partners.\nDepreciation and amortization expenses were $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase is associated with an additional three months of amortization in 2020 related to the intangible asset recorded as part of the acquisition of Verb Direct in April 2019, amortization of SoloFire intangible assets, and amortization of leasehold improvements related to our California office.\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $20.5 million, as compared to $14.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in general and administrative expenses is primarily related to general and administration expenses attributed to an increase in stock compensation expense of $1.9 million, an additional quarter of operations in 2020 for Verb Direct of $1.1 million, expenses from SoloFire of $809,000 primarily driven by retention bonuses, plus increases to support growth driven by labor related costs of $697,000, professional services of $631,000, marketing and promotion of $493,000, and increased facility costs associated with our California office of $175,000.\nOther income (expense), net, for the year ended December 31, 2020 was ($218,000), which was attributed to interest expense for amortization of debt discount of ($493,000), financing costs of ($248,000), and interest expense of ($153,000), offset by a change in the fair value of derivative liability of $574,000 and other income (expense), net of $102,000. Other income (expense), net, for the year ended December 31, 2019 was ($82,000), which was attributed to interest expense for amortization of debt discount of ($1.7) million, financing costs of ($1.6) million, interest expense of ($186,000), other income (expense), net of ($11,000), offset by a change in the fair value of derivative liability of $1.9 million, and debt extinguishment of $1.5 million.\nUse of Non-GAAP Measures - Modified EBITDA\nIn addition to our results under generally accepted accounted principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d), we present Modified EBITDA as a supplemental measure of our performance. However, Modified EBITDA is not a recognized measurement under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income, income from operations or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of liquidity. We define Modified EBITDA as net income (loss), plus interest expense, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, financing costs and changes in fair value of derivative liability.\nManagement considers our core operating performance to be that which our managers can affect in any particular period through their management of the resources that affect our underlying revenue and profit generating operations that period. Non-GAAP adjustments to our results prepared in accordance with GAAP are itemized below. You are encouraged to evaluate these adjustments and the reasons we consider them appropriate for supplemental analysis. In evaluating Modified EBITDA, you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments in this presentation. Our presentation of Modified EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items.\nYear Ended\nDecember 31, 2020 December 31, 2019\nNet loss $ (24,956,000 ) $ (15,918,000 )\nAdjustments\nOther expense (102,000 ) 11,000\nStock compensation expense 6,119,000 4,178,000\nFinancing costs 248,000 1,625,000\nAmortization of debt discount 493,000 1,658,000\nChange in fair value of derivative liability (574,000 ) (1,862,000 )\nDebt extinguishment, net - (1,536,000 )\nInterest expense 153,000 186,000\nDepreciation and amortization 1,510,000 1,042,000\nIncome tax provision 1,000 2,000\nTotal EBITDA adjustments 7,848,000 5,304,000\nModified EBITDA $ (17,108,000 ) $ (10,614,000 )\nThe $6.5 million decrease in modified EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the same period in 2019, resulted from increased research and development, expenses related to SoloFire primarily driven by retention bonuses, an increase in professional services primarily attributed to the acquisition of SoloFire, labor related costs to support growth, marketing and promotion, increased facility costs associated with our California office, and twelve months of Verb Direct general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 versus the nine months of Verb Direct results in 2019, offset by an increase in gross margin.\nWe present Modified EBITDA because we believe it assists investors and analysts in comparing our performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance. In addition, we use Modified EBITDA in developing our internal budgets, forecasts and strategic plan; in analyzing the effectiveness of our business strategies in evaluating potential acquisitions; and in making compensation decisions and in communications with our board of directors concerning our financial performance. Modified EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, which includes, among others, the following:\n\u25cf Modified EBITDA does not reflect our cash expenditures, or future requirements, for capital expenditures or contractual commitments;\n\u25cf Modified EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;\n\u25cf Modified EBITDA does not reflect future interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on our debts; and\n\u25cf Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and Modified EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nGoing Concern\nWe have incurred operating losses and negative cash flows from operations since inception. We incurred a net loss of $24,956,000 during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020. We also utilized cash in operations of $16,294,000 during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020. As a result, our continuation as a going concern is dependent on our ability to obtain additional financing until we can generate sufficient cash flows from operations to meet our obligations. We intend to continue to seek additional debt or equity financing to continue our operations.\nOur consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which implies we may not continue to meet our obligations and continue our operations for the next twelve months. Our continuation as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to obtain necessary debt or equity financing to continue operations until we begin generating positive cash flow. In addition, our independent registered public accounting firm, in its report on our December 31, 2020 consolidated financial statements, has raised substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nThere is no assurance that we will ever be profitable or that debt or equity financing will be available to us in the amounts, on terms, and at times deemed acceptable to us, if at all. The issuance of additional equity securities by us would result in a significant dilution in the equity interests of our current stockholders. Obtaining commercial loans, assuming those loans would be available, would increase our liabilities and future cash commitments. If we are unable to obtain financing in the amounts and on terms deemed acceptable to us, we may be unable to continue our business, as planned, and as a result may be required to scale back or cease operations for our business, the results of which would be that our stockholders would lose some or all of their investment. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result should we be unable to continue as a going concern.\nOverview\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had cash of $1,815,000. We estimate our operating expenses for the next twelve months may continue to exceed any revenue we generate, and we may need to raise capital through either debt or equity offerings to continue operations. Due to market conditions and the early stage of our operations, there is considerable risk that we will not be able to raise such financings at all, or on terms that are not dilutive to our existing stockholders. We can offer no assurance that we will be able to raise such funds. If we are unable to raise the funds we require for all of our planned operations, we may be forced to reallocate funds from other planned uses and may suffer a significant negative effect on our business plan and operations, including our ability to develop new products and continue our current operations. As a result, our business may suffer, and we may be forced to reduce or discontinue operations.\nIn April 2019, we closed our public offering that provided us with gross proceeds of approximately $20,500,000 before deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other estimated offering expenses payable by us. The proceeds were used to pay the $15,000,000 cash portion of the acquisition price for Sound Concepts (now, Verb Direct), pay principal and interest amounts outstanding under convertible debt in the amount of $2,025,000, pay commissions and other offering expenses related to the public offering in the amount of $2,100,000, and pay other operating expenses.\nOn August 14, 2019, we entered into a purchase agreement with investors, pursuant to which we agreed to issue and sell up to an aggregate of 6,000 shares of our Series A Preferred Stock and the warrants to purchase an aggregate of up to 3.87 million shares of common stock (an amount equivalent to the number of shares of common stock into which the Series A Preferred Stock is initially convertible). Each share of Series A Preferred Stock is convertible, at any time and from time to time from and after the issuance date, at the holder\u2019s option into that number of shares of common stock equal to the stated value per share (or $1,000) divided by the conversion price (initially, $1.55); thus, initially, each share of Series A Preferred Stock is convertible into approximately 645 shares of common stock. The warrants have an initial exercise price of $1.88 per share, subject to customary adjustments, are exercisable from and after six months after the date of issuance, and will expire five years from the date of issuance. We closed the offering on August 14, 2019, and issued 5,030 shares of Series A Preferred Stock and issued warrants to purchase up to 3,245,162 shares of common stock in connection therewith. We received gross proceeds equal to $5,030,000\nOn February 5, 2020, we initiated our private placement, which is for the sale and issuance of up to five million shares of our common stock at a per-share price of $1.20, which amount represents a 20% discount to the $1.50 closing price of our common stock on that day, and is memorialized by a subscription agreement.\nOn March 31, 2020 we closed our private placement. In total we issued 4,237,833 shares of common stock and netted $4.4 million after fees and expenses.\nOn April 17, 2020, we received loan proceeds in the amount of approximately $1,218,000 under the Paycheck Protection Program (\u201cPPP\u201d). The PPP, established as part of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act, provides for loans to qualifying businesses for amounts up to 2.5 times of the average monthly payroll expenses of the qualifying business. The loans and accrued interest are forgivable after eight weeks as long as the borrower uses the loan proceeds for eligible purposes, including payroll, benefits, rent and utilities, and maintains its payroll levels. The amount of loan forgiveness will be reduced if the borrower terminates employees or reduces salaries during the eight-week period. Subsequent to December 31, 2020 the entire note and accrued interest was forgiven.\nOn July 24, 2020, the Company concluded its public offering pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-239055) and issued and sold 12,545,453 shares of common stock (which included 1,636,363 shares of common stock sold pursuant to the exercise by the underwriters of an overallotment option). The net proceeds to the Company, after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and direct offering expenses was $12,337,000\nOn March 15, 2021 the Company completed a registered direct offering with institutional investors for the purchase and sale of 9,375,000 shares of common stock at a purchase price of $1.60 per share. Net proceeds were approximately $14,000,000\nThe following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nYear Ended\nDecember 31, 2020 December 31, 2019\nCash used in operating activities $ (16,294,000 ) $ (8,118,000 )\nCash used in investing activities (88,000 ) (14,589,000 )\nCash provided by financing activities 17,214,000 23,056,000\nIncrease in cash $ 832,000 $ 349,000\nCash Flows - Operating\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, our cash flows used in operating activities amounted to $16.3 million, compared to cash used for the year ended December 31, 2019 of $8.1 million.

The term of the agreement extends until the advances are paid in full. We may pay off either note for $446,000 if paid within 30 days of funding; for $465,000 if paid between 31 and 60 days of funding; or for $484,000 if paid within 61 to 90 days of funding.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP, which require that we make certain assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenue and expenses during each reporting period.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods. Significant estimates include valuation of derivative liability, valuation of debt and equity instruments, share-based compensation arrangements and long-lived assets. Amounts could materially change in the future.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nThe Company evaluates its financial instruments to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives. For derivative financial instruments that are accounted for as liabilities, the derivative instrument is initially recorded at its fair value and is then re-valued at each reporting date, with changes in the fair value reported in the consolidated statements of operations. The classification of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is evaluated at the end of each reporting period. Derivative instrument liabilities are classified in the balance sheet as current or non-current based on whether or not net-cash settlement of the derivative instrument could be required within 12 months of the balance sheet date.\nWe use Level 2 inputs for our valuation methodology for the derivative liabilities as their fair values were determined by using a Binomial pricing model. Our derivative liabilities are adjusted to reflect fair value at each period end, with any increase or decrease in the fair value being recorded in results of operations as adjustments to fair value of derivatives.\nShare Based Payment\nWe issue stock options, common stock, and equity interests as share-based compensation to employees and non-employees. We account for our share-based compensation to employees in accordance with FASB ASC 718 \u201cCompensation - Stock Compensation.\u201d Stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date, based on the estimated fair value of the award, and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period. We value stock compensation based on the market price on the measurement date.\nWe value stock options using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Assumptions used in the Black-Scholes model to value options issued during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 are as follows:\nYear Ended\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\nDecember 31,\nExpected life in years\n3.0, 4.0 and 5.0\n1.0, 2.0 and 5.0\nStock price volatility\n255%-271 %\n180%-414 %\nRisk free interest rate\n0.17-0.39 %\n1.51-2.75 %\nExpected dividends\n%\n%\nForfeiture rate\n21.2 - 21.3 %\n22.48 %\nThe risk-free interest rate was based on rates established by the Federal Reserve Bank. We use the historical volatility of our common stock to estimate the future volatility for our common stock. The expected dividend yield was based on the fact that we have not customarily paid dividends in the past and do not expect to pay dividends in the future.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nFor a summary of our recent accounting policies, please refer to Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to Financial Statements commencing on page of this Annual Report for management\u2019s discussion as to the impact of recent accounting pronouncements.",

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nWe maintain disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC\u2019s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nWe carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d- 15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of December 31, 2020. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2020.\nManagement\u2019s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Internal control over financial reporting is a process, including policies and procedures, designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Our management assessed our internal control over financial reporting using the criteria in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013), issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (\u201cCOSO\u201d). Our system of internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.\nRemediation of Material Weakness in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nBased on our evaluation under the framework issued by COSO, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was ineffective as of December 31, 2019 based on such criteria. Deficiencies existed in the design or operation of our internal control over financial reporting that adversely affected our internal controls and that may be considered to be material weaknesses. The matters involving internal controls and procedures that our management considered to be material weaknesses were:\n(i) inadequate segregation of duties and effective risk assessment; and\n(ii) insufficient staffing resulting in financial statement closing process.\nDuring fiscal 2020, we have taken remediation measures to address the material weaknesses relating to our internal control over financial reporting. Such remediation activities included the following:\n(i) adoption and implementing the NetSuite ERP (enterprise resource planning) and accounting system;\n(ii) updating the documentation of our internal control processes, including performing a formal risk assessment of our financial reporting processes; and\n(iii) implementing procedures to ensure segregation of duties and hiring additional resources to ensure appropriate review and oversight.\nAs a result of the remediation activities and controls in place as of December 31, 2020 described above, we have remediated the previously disclosed material weaknesses.\nA control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met under all potential conditions, regardless of how remote, and may not prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOther than the controls implemented to remediate the material weaknesses noted above, there were no additional, there were no additional changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the year ended December 31, 2020 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.",

Accordingly, we do not currently have any specific or minimum criteria for the election of nominees to our board of directors and we do not have any specific process or procedure for evaluating such nominees. Our board of directors assesses all candidates, whether submitted by management or stockholders, and makes recommendations for election or appointment. If stockholders wish to recommend candidates directly to our board, they may do so by sending communications to our president at the address on the cover page of this Annual Report.

However, due to our stage of development and our need to deal with other urgent priorities, the board has not yet implemented such a process of assessment.",

The material terms of the Incentive Plan are summarized below.\nOn September 2, 2020, our board of directors approved an additional 8,000,000 shares of our common stock to be authorized for awards granted under the Incentive Plan, and on October 16, 2020, our stockholders approved the additional 8,000,000 shares of our common stock to be authorized for awards granted under the Incentive Plan.\nGeneral\nThe purpose of the Incentive Plan is to enhance stockholder value by linking the compensation of our officers, directors, key employees, and consultants to increases in the price of our common stock and the achievement of other performance objections and to encourage ownership in our company by key personnel whose long-term employment is considered essential to our continued progress and success. The Incentive Plan is also intended to assist us in recruiting new employees and to motivate, retain, and encourage such employees and directors to act in our stockholders\u2019 interest and share in our success.\nTerm\nThe Incentive Plan became effective upon approval by our stockholders and will continue in effect from that date until it is terminated in accordance with its terms.\nAdministration\nThe Incentive Plan may be administered by our board of directors, a committee designated by it, and/or their respective delegates. Currently, our Compensation Committee administers the Incentive Plan. The administrator has the power to determine the directors, employees, and consultants who may participate in the Incentive Plan and the amounts and other terms and conditions of awards to be granted under the Incentive Plan. All questions of interpretation and administration with respect to the Incentive Plan will be determined by the administrator. The administrator also will have the complete authority to adopt, amend, rescind, and enforce rules and regulations pertaining to the administration of the Incentive Plan; to correct administrative errors; to make all other determinations deemed necessary or advisable for administering the Incentive Plan and any award granted under the Incentive Plan; and to authorize any person to execute, on behalf of us, all agreements and documents previously approved by the administrator, among other items.\nEligibility\nAny of our directors, employees, or consultants, or any directors, employees, or consultants of any of our affiliates (except that with respect to incentive stock options, only employees of us or any of our subsidiaries are eligible), are eligible to participate in the Incentive Plan.\nAvailable Shares\nSubject to the adjustment provisions included in the Incentive Plan, a total of 16,000,000 shares of our common stock are authorized for awards granted under the Incentive Plan. Shares subject to awards that have been canceled, expired, settled in cash, or not issued or forfeited for any reason (in whole or in part), will not reduce the aggregate number of shares that may be subject to or delivered under awards granted under the Incentive Plan and will be available for future awards granted under the Incentive Plan.\nTypes of Awards\nWe may grant the following types of awards under the Incentive Plan: stock awards; options; stock appreciation rights; stock units; or other stock-based awards.\nStock Awards. The Incentive Plan authorizes the grant of stock awards to eligible participants. The administrator determines (i) the number of shares subject to the stock award or a formula for determining such number, (ii) the purchase price of the shares, if any, (iii) the means of payment for the shares, (iv) the performance criteria, if any, and the level of achievement versus these criteria, (v) the grant, issuance, vesting, and/or forfeiture of the shares, (vi) restrictions on transferability, and such other terms and conditions determined by the administrator.\nOptions. The Incentive Plan authorizes the grant of non-qualified and/or incentive options to eligible participants, which options give the participant the right, after satisfaction of any vesting conditions and prior to the expiration or termination of the option, to purchase shares of our common stock at a fixed price. The administrator determines the exercise price for each share subject to an option granted under the Incentive Plan, which exercise price cannot be less than the fair market value (as defined in the Incentive Plan) of our common stock on the grant date. The administrator also determines the number of shares subject to each option, the time or times when each option becomes exercisable, and the term of each option (which cannot exceed ten (10) years from the grant date).\nStock Appreciation Rights. The Incentive Plan authorizes the grant of stock appreciation rights to eligible participants, which stock appreciation rights give the participant the right, after satisfaction of any vesting conditions and prior to the expiration or termination of the stock appreciation right, to receive in cash or shares of our common stock the excess of the fair market value (as defined in the Incentive Plan) of our common stock on the date of exercise over the exercise price of the stock appreciation right. All stock appreciation rights under the Incentive Plan shall be granted subject to the same terms and conditions applicable to options granted under the Incentive Plan. Stock appreciation rights may be granted to awardees either alone or in addition to or in tandem with other awards granted under the Incentive Plan and may, but need not, relate to a specific option granted under the Incentive Plan.\nStock Unit Awards and Other Stock-Based Awards. In addition to the award types described above, the administrator may grant any other type of award payable by delivery of our common stock in such amounts and subject to such terms and conditions as the administrator determines in its sole discretion, subject to the terms of the Incentive Plan. Such awards may be made in addition to or in conjunction with other awards under the Incentive Plan. Such awards may include unrestricted shares of our common stock, which may be awarded, without limitation (except as provided in the Incentive Plan), as a bonus, in payment of director fees, in lieu of cash compensation, in exchange for cancellation of a compensation right, or upon the attainment of performance goals or otherwise, or rights to acquire shares of our common stock from us.\nAward Limits\nSubject to the terms of the Incentive Plan, the aggregate number of shares that may be subject to all incentive stock options granted under the Incentive Plan cannot exceed the total aggregate number of shares that may be subject to or delivered under awards under the Incentive Plan. Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Incentive Plan to the contrary, the aggregate grant date fair value (computed as specified in the Incentive Plan) of all awards granted to any non-employee director during any single calendar year shall not exceed 300,000 shares during 2019 and, thereafter, 200,000 shares.\nNew Plan Benefits\nThe amount of future grants under the Incentive Plan is not determinable, as awards under the Incentive Plan will be granted at the sole discretion of the administrator. We cannot determinate at this time either the persons who will receive awards under the Incentive Plan or the amount or types of such any such awards.\nTransferability\nUnless determined otherwise by the administrator, an award may not be sold, pledged, assigned, hypothecated, transferred, or disposed of in any manner other than by beneficiary designation, will, or by the laws of descent or distribution, including but not limited to any attempted assignment or transfer in connection with the settlement of marital property or other rights incident to a divorce or dissolution, and any such attempted sale, assignment, or transfer shall be of no effect prior to the date an award is vested and settled.\nTermination of Employment or Board Membership\nAt the grant date, the administrator is authorized to determine the effect a termination from membership on the board of directors by a non-employee director for any reason or a termination of employment (as defined in the Incentive Plan) due to disability (as defined in the Incentive Plan), retirement (as defined in the Incentive Plan), death, or otherwise (including termination for cause (as defined in the Incentive Plan)) will have on any award. Unless otherwise provided in the award agreement:\n\u25cf Upon termination from membership on our board of directors by a non-employee director for any reason other than disability or death, any option or stock appreciation right held by such director that (i) has not vested and is not exercisable as of the termination effective date will be subject to immediate cancellation and forfeiture or (ii) is vested and exercisable as of the termination effective date shall remain exercisable for one year thereafter, or the remaining term of the option or stock appreciation right, if less. Any unvested stock award, stock unit award, or other stock-based award held by a non-employee director at the time of termination from membership on our board of directors for a reason other than disability or death will immediately be cancelled and forfeited.\n\u25cf Upon termination from membership on our board of directors by a non-employee director due to disability or death will result in full vesting of any outstanding option or stock appreciation rights and vesting of a prorated portion of any stock award, stock unit award, or other stock based award based upon the full months of the applicable performance period, vesting period, or other period of restriction elapsed as of the end of the month in which the termination from membership on our board of directors by a non-employee director due to disability or death occurs over the total number of months in such period. Any option or stock appreciation right that vests upon disability or death will remain exercisable for one year thereafter, or the remaining term of the option or stock appreciation right, if less. In the case of any stock award, stock unit award, or other stock-based award that vests on the basis of attainment of performance criteria (as defined in the Incentive Plan), the pro rata vested amount will be based upon the target award.\n\u25cf Upon termination of employment due to disability or death, any option or stock appreciation right held by an employee will, if not already fully vested, become fully vested and exercisable as of the effective date of such termination of employment due to disability or death, or, in either case, the remaining term of the option or stock appreciation right, if less. Termination of employment due to disability or death shall result in vesting of a prorated portion of any stock award, stock unit award, or other stock based award based upon the full months of the applicable performance period, vesting period, or other period of restriction elapsed as of the end of the month in which the termination of employment due to disability or death occurs over the total number of months in such period. In the case of any stock award, stock unit award, or other stock-based award that vests on the basis of attainment of performance criteria, the pro-rata vested amount will be based upon the target award.\n\u25cf Any option or stock appreciation right held by an awardee at retirement that occurs at least one year after the grant date of the option or stock appreciation right will remain outstanding for the remaining term of the option or stock appreciation right and continue to vest; any stock award, stock unit award, or other stock based award held by an awardee at retirement that occurs at least one year after the grant date of the award shall also continue to vest and remain outstanding for the remainder of the term of the award.\n\u25cf Any other termination of employment shall result in immediate cancellation and forfeiture of all outstanding awards that have not vested as of the effective date of such termination of employment, and any vested and exercisable options and stock appreciation rights held at the time of such termination of such termination of employment shall remain exercisable for 90 days thereafter or the remaining term of the option or stock appreciation right, if less. Notwithstanding the foregoing, all outstanding and unexercised options and stock appreciation rights will be immediately cancelled in the event of a termination of employment for cause.\nChange of Control\nIn the event of a change of control (as defined in the Incentive Plan), unless other determined by the administrator as of the grant date of a particular award, the following acceleration, exercisability, and valuation provisions apply:\n\u25cf On the date that a change of control occurs, all options and stock appreciation rights awarded under the Incentive Plan not previously exercisable and vested will, if not assumed, or substituted with a new award, by the successor to us, become fully exercisable and vested, and if the successor to us assumes such options or stock appreciation rights or substitutes other awards for such awards, such awards (or their substitutes) shall become fully exercisable and vested if the participant\u2019s employment is terminated (other than a termination for cause) within two years following the change of control.\n\u25cf Except as may be provided in an individual severance or employment agreement (or severance plan) to which an awardee is a party, in the event of an awardee\u2019s termination of employment within two years after a change of control for any reason other than because of the awardee\u2019s death, retirement, disability, or termination for cause, each option and stock appreciation right held by the awardee (or a transferee) that is vested following such termination of employment will remain exercisable until the earlier of the third anniversary of such termination of employment (or any later date until which it would have remained exercisable under such circumstances by its terms) or the expiration of its original term. In the event of an awardee\u2019s termination of employment more than two years after a change of control, or within two years after a change of control because of the awardee\u2019s death, retirement, disability, or termination for cause, the regular provisions of the Incentive Plan regarding employment termination (described above) will govern (as applicable).\n\u25cf On the date that a change of control occurs, the restrictions and conditions applicable to any or all stock awards, stock unit awards, and other stock-based awards that are not assumed, or substituted with a new award, by the successor to us will lapse and such awards will become fully vested. Unless otherwise provided in an award agreement at the grant date, upon the occurrence of a change of control without assumption or substitution of the awards by the successor, any performance-based award will be deemed fully earned at the target amount as of the date on which the change of control occurs. All stock awards, stock unit awards, and other stock-based awards shall be settled or paid within 30 days of vesting. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the change of control would not qualify as a permissible date of distribution under Section 409A(a)(2)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code, and the regulations thereunder, the awardee shall be entitled to receive the award from us on the date that would have applied, absent this provision. If the successor to us does assume (or substitute with a new award) any stock awards, stock unit awards, and other stock-based awards, all such awards shall become fully vested if the participant\u2019s employment is terminated (other than a termination for cause) within two years following the change of control, and any performance based award will be deemed fully earned at the target amount effective as of the termination of employment.\n\u25cf The administrator, in its discretion, may determine that, upon the occurrence of a change of control of us, each option and stock appreciation right outstanding will terminate within a specified number of days after notice to the participant, and/or that each participant receives, with respect to each share subject to such option or stock appreciation right, an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of such share immediately prior to the occurrence of such change of control over the exercise price per share of such option and/or stock appreciation right; such amount to be payable in cash, in one or more kinds of stock or property (including the stock or property, if any, payable in the transaction), or in a combination thereof, as the administrator, in its discretion, determines and, if there is no excess value, the administrator may, in its discretion, cancel such awards.\n\u25cf An option, stock appreciation right, stock award, stock unit award, or other stock-based award will be considered assumed or substituted for if, following the change of control, the award confers the right to purchase or receive, for each share subject to the option, stock appreciation right, stock award, stock unit award, or other stock-based award immediately prior to the change of control, the consideration (whether stock, cash, or other securities or property) received in the transaction constituting a change of control by holders of shares for each share held on the effective date of such transaction (and if holders were offered a choice of consideration, the type of consideration chosen by the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares); provided, however, that, if such consideration received in the transaction constituting a change of control is not solely shares of common stock of the successor company, the administrator may, with the consent of the successor company, provide that the consideration to be received upon the exercise or vesting of an option, stock appreciation right, stock award, stock unit award, or other stock-based award, for each share subject thereto, will be solely shares of common stock of the successor company with a fair market value substantially equal to the per-share consideration received by holders of shares in the transaction constituting a change of control. The determination of whether fair market value is substantially equal shall be made by the administrator in its sole discretion and its determination will be conclusive and binding.\nTax and Accounting Considerations\nAmong the factors it considers when making executive compensation decisions, the Compensation Committee considers the anticipated tax and accounting impact to us (and to our executive officers) of various payments, equity awards and other benefits.\nThe Compensation Committee considers the impact of the provisions of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, or the Code, as amended by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\u201cTCJA\u201d). That section generally limits the deductibility of compensation paid by a publicly held company to \u201ccovered employees\u201d for a taxable year to $1.0 million. Effective for taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2018, \u201ccovered employees\u201d generally include our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and other highly compensated executive officers. Effective for taxable years beginning prior to January 1, 2018, an exception to this deduction limit applied to \u201cperformance-based compensation,\u201d such as cash incentive and stock option awards, that satisfied certain criteria. This exception to the Section 162(m) deduction limit for \u201cperformance-based compensation\u201d was repealed by the TCJA. Thus, except for certain \u201cperformance-based compensation\u201d payable pursuant to written contracts that were in effect on November 2, 2017 and that are not modified in any material respect on or after that date, effective for taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2018 our tax deduction with regard to compensation of \u201ccovered employees\u201d is limited to $1.0 million per taxable year with respect to each executive officer. With respect to cash and equity awards that were in effect on November 2, 2017, and that are not modified in any material respect on or after that date, the Committee is mindful of the benefit to us and our stockholders of the full deductibility of compensation and have taken steps so that both the cash incentive and stock option awards that we granted may qualify for deductibility under Section 162(m) of the Code. However, awards that we granted that were intended to qualify as \u201cperformance-based compensation\u201d may not necessarily qualify for such status under Section 162(m) of the Code. With respect to cash incentive and equity awards that we may grant in the future, we do not anticipate that the $1.0 million deduction limitation set forth in Section 162(m) of the Code will have a material impact on our results of operations.\nThe Compensation Committee also considers the impact of Section 409A of the Code, and in general, our executive plans and programs are designed to comply with the requirements of that section so as to avoid possible adverse tax consequences that may result from noncompliance.\nWe account for equity awards in accordance with the requirements of Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification, or FASB ASC, Topic 718, Stock Compensation.\nOur Change of Control and Severance Agreements do not allow for excise tax gross up payments.\nAmendment and Termination\nThe administrator may amend, alter, or discontinue the Incentive Plan or any award agreement, but any such amendment is subject to the approval of our stockholders in the manner and to the extent required by applicable law. In addition, without limiting the foregoing, unless approved by our stockholders and subject to the terms of the Incentive Plan, no such amendment shall be made that would (i) increase the maximum aggregate number of shares that may be subject to awards granted under the Incentive Plan, (ii) reduce the minimum exercise price for options or stock appreciation rights granted under the Incentive Plan, or (iii) reduce the exercise price of outstanding options or stock appreciation rights, as prohibited by the terms of the Incentive Plan without stockholder approval.\nNo amendment, suspension, or termination of the Incentive Plan will impair the rights of any participant with respect to an outstanding award, unless otherwise mutually agreed between the participant and the administrator, which agreement must be in writing and signed by the participant and us, except that no such agreement will be required if the administrator determines in its sole discretion that such amendment either (i) is required or advisable in order for us, the Incentive Plan, or the award to satisfy any applicable law or to meet the requirements of any accounting standard or (ii) is not reasonably likely to diminish the benefits provided under such award significantly, or that any such diminution has been adequately compensated, except that this exception shall not apply following a change of control. Termination of the Incentive Plan will not affect the administrator\u2019s ability to exercise the powers granted to it hereunder with respect to awards granted under the Incentive Plan prior to the date of such termination.\nOutstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal Year-End\nThe following table sets forth, for each named executive officer, certain information concerning outstanding restricted stock awards as of December 31, 2020:\nName Number of securities underlying unvested restricted stock awards\n(#) Fair Value\n($)\nVest date\nRory J.

Per the terms of the note agreement, at Mr. Cutaia\u2019s discretion, he may convert up to 30%, or $375,000, of outstanding principal, plus accrued interest thereon, into shares of common stock at a conversion rate of $1.05 per share. As of December 31, 2018, the total outstanding balance of the note amounted to $825,000.\nOn May 4, 2017, we entered into an extension agreement with Mr. Cutaia to extend the maturity date of the note from April 1, 2017 to August 1, 2018. In consideration, we issued Mr. Cutaia a three-year warrant to purchase 1,755,192 shares of common stock at a price of $0.355 per share with a fair value of $517,000. All other terms of the note remain unchanged. We determined that the extension of the note\u2019s maturity resulted in a debt extinguishment for accounting purposes since the fair value of the warrants granted was more than 10% of the original value of the convertible note. As result, we recorded the fair value of the new note which approximates the original carrying value $1,199,000 and expensed the fair value of the warrants granted of $517,000 as debt extinguishment costs. As of December 31, 2018, total outstanding balance of the note amounted to $825,000.\nOn August 8, 2018, we entered into an extension agreement with Mr. Cutaia to extend the maturity date of the note to February 8, 2021. All other terms of the note remain unchanged. In connection with the extension, we granted to Mr. Cutaia a three-year warrant to purchase up to 163,113 shares of common stock at a price of $7.35 per share with a fair value of $1,075,000. As of December 31, 2019, total outstanding balance of the note amounted to $825,000.\nSubsequent to December 31, 2020, the Company extended the note to February 8, 2023.\nOn December 18, the Company paid a $100,000 principal payment.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the outstanding balance of the note amounted to $725,000.\n(2) On December 1, 2015, we issued a note payable to a former member of our board of directors, in the amount of $112,000, representing unpaid consulting fees as of November 30, 2015. The note is unsecured, bears interest at a rate of 12% per annum, and matured in April 2017.\nAs of December 31, 2020, and the date of this Annual Report, the note is past due. We are currently in negotiations with the note holder to settle the note payable.\n(3) On April 4, 2016, we issued a convertible note to Mr. Cutaia, in the amount of $343,000, to consolidate all advances made by Mr. Cutaia to us from December 2015 through March 2016. The note bears interest at a rate of 12% per annum, is secured by our assets, and originally matured on December 4, 2018. Pursuant to the terms of the note, a total of 30% of the note principal, or $103,000, can be converted into shares of common stock at a conversion price of $1.05 per share. As of December 31, 2018, the outstanding balance of the note was $240,000.\nOn September 30, 2018, pursuant to the terms of the note, Mr. Cutaia converted 30% of the principal balance, or $103,000, into 98,093 restricted shares of our common stock at $1.05 per share.\nOn December 4, 2018, we entered into an extension agreement with Mr. Cutaia to extend the maturity date of the note to June 4, 2021. All other terms of the note remain unchanged. In connection with the extension, we granted to Mr. Cutaia a three-year warrant to purchase up to 353,000 shares of common stock at a price of $5.10 per share with a fair value of $111,000.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the outstanding balance of the note amounted to $240,000.\nDeferred Compensation to Related Parties\nNote\nIssuance Date\nMaturity Date\nInterest Rate\nOriginal Borrowing\nLargest Aggregate Amount Outstanding Since January 1,\nAmount Outstanding as of December 31,\nInterest Paid Since January 1,\nInterest Paid Since January 1,\nNotes 1 & 2(1)\nDecember 23, 2019\nJanuary 10, 2021\n%\n$ 278,000\n$ 278,000\n$ 278,000\n$ -\n$ -\nNotes 1 & 2(1)\nDecember 23, 2019\nJanuary 10, 2021\n%\n278,000\n278,000\n278,000\n-\n-\nNotes 3 & 4(2)\nDecember 23, 2019\nJanuary 10, 2022\n%\n243,000\n243,000\n243,000\n-\n-\nNotes 3 & 4(2)\nDecember 23, 2019\nJanuary 10, 2022\n%\n243,000\n243,000\n243,000\n-\n-\nTotal deferred compensation - related parties\n$ 1,042,000\n$ 1,042,000\n$ -\n$ -\n(1) On December 23, 2019, we awarded Mr. Cutaia, Chief Executive Officer, and Mr. Clayborne, Chief Financial Officer, annual incentive compensation of $430,000 and 125,000, respectively.

FORM 10-K SUMMARY\nNone.\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors\nVerb Technology Company, Inc.\nAmerican Fork, UT\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Verb Technology Company, Inc. (the \u201cCompany\u201d) as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in stockholders\u2019 equity (deficit), and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the \u201cconsolidated financial statements\u201d). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nGoing Concern\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1, the Company has incurred recurring operating losses and used cash in operations since inception. These matters raise substantial doubt about the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern. Management\u2019s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 1 to the financial statements. These consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company\u2019s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (\u201cPCAOB\u201d) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments.\nThe communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nGoodwill Impairment Assessment\nAs described in Notes 2 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company\u2019s consolidated goodwill balance was $20,060,000 as of December 31, 2020. Management conducts impairment testing at the reporting unit level on an annual basis as of December 31 or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate a potential impairment. Reporting units are tested for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to their respective carrying amounts. Management primarily uses discounted cash flow methods to estimate the fair value, which require the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including future revenues, projected margins and capital spending, terminal growth rates, and discount rates.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the goodwill impairment assessment is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management to estimate the fair value of the reporting units, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing audit procedures and evaluating audit evidence related to management\u2019s significant assumptions related to future revenues, projected margins and capital spending, terminal growth rates, and discount rates. In addition, the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included, among others, (i) testing management\u2019s process for developing the fair value of the reporting units, (ii) evaluating the appropriateness of the discounted cash flow models utilized, (iii) testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the models, (iv) performing an independent market corroboration calculation, and (iv) evaluating the significant assumptions used by management related to future revenues, projected margins and capital spending, terminal growth rates, and discount rates. Evaluating management\u2019s assumptions related to future revenues and projected margins and capital spending involved evaluating whether the assumptions used by management were reasonable considering the current and past performance of the reporting units, third-party industry data, and whether these assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in the evaluation of the Company\u2019s discounted cash flow models and the terminal growth rates and discount rates assumptions.\nAcquisition of Ascend Certification\nAs described further in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, on September 4, 2020, the Company completed the acquisition of Ascend Certification, LLC. ( dba \u201cSolofire\u201d) for a purchase price of $4,950,000. The Company has accounted for the acquisition under the acquisition method of accounting which requires the assets acquired and liabilities assumed to be recorded at fair value as of the transaction date, for which the Company utilized a valuation report from a third-party valuation firm. As of December 31, 2020, the fair value estimates for intangible assets and goodwill are labeled provisional as the valuation reports have not been finalized as of December 31, 2020. We identified the estimation of the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the acquisition of Solofire as a critical audit matter.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that the estimation of the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the acquisition of Solofire was a critical audit matter are that there was a high estimation uncertainty due to significant judgements with respect to the selection of the valuation methodologies applied by the third party valuation firm, the assumptions used to estimate the future revenues and cash flows, including revenue growth rates, royalty rates, attrition rates, forecasted costs, weighted average costs of capital and future market conditions in the determination of the fair value of the intangible assets acquired. In addition, the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\nOur audit procedures responsive to the estimation of the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the acquisition of Solofire included the following procedures, among others:\n\u25cf We evaluated management\u2019s and the valuation specialist\u2019s identification of assets acquired and liabilities assumed.\n\u25cf We assessed the reasonableness of the fair value measurements prepared by management and their third-party valuation specialists, including the discount rates, revenue growth rates and projected profit margins used in valuing the intangible assets.\n\u25cf We evaluated the reasonableness of the methodologies used to value the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and whether such approaches were appropriate given the nature of the item being valued.\n\u25cf Evaluated the qualifications of the third-party firm engaged by the Company based on their credentials and experience.\n\u25cf Evaluated the accuracy and completeness of the financial statement presentation and disclosure of the acquisition.\nWe have served as the Company\u2019s auditor since 2017.\n/s/ Weinberg & Company, P.A.\nWeinberg & Company, P.A\nLos Angeles, California\nMarch 31, 2021\nVERB TECHNOLOGY COMPANY, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\nDecember 31, 2020 December 31, 2019\nASSETS\nCurrent assets:\nCash $ 1,815,000 $ 983,000\nAccounts receivable, net of allowance of $361,000 and $230,000, respectively 919,000 1,271,000\nInventory, net of allowance of $51,000 and $2,000, respectively 34,000 103,000\nPrepaid expenses 900,000 236,000\nTotal current assets 3,668,000 2,593,000\nRight-of-use assets 2,730,000 3,275,000\nProperty and equipment, net of accumulated depreciation of $338,000 and $164,000, respectively 862,000 720,000\nIntangible assets, net of accumulated amortization of $2,310,000 and $975,000, respectively (including provisional intangible assets of $1,042,000 at December 31, 2020) 5,153,000 5,365,000\nGoodwill (including provisional goodwill of $3,723,000 at December 31, 2020) 20,060,000 16,337,000\nOther assets 69,000 69,000\nTotal assets $ 32,542,000 $ 28,359,000\nLIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY\nCurrent liabilities:\nAccounts payable and accrued expenses $ 5,097,000 $ 4,338,000\nAccrued officers\u2019 salary 822,000 207,000\nAccrued interest (including $102,000 and $82,000 payable to related parties) 114,000 82,000\nAdvance on future receipts, net of discount of $67,000 and $274,000, respectively 110,000 732,000\nNotes payable -

DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS\nOrganization\nReferences in this document to the \u201cCompany,\u201d \u201cVerb,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cus,\u201d or \u201cour\u201d are intended to mean Verb Technology Company, Inc., individually, or as the context requires, collectively with its subsidiary on a consolidated basis.\nCutaia Media Group, LLC (\u201cCMG\u201d) was organized as a limited liability company under the laws of the State of Nevada on December 12, 2012. On May 19, 2014, CMG merged into bBooth, Inc. and bBooth, Inc., thereafter, changed its name to bBooth (USA), Inc., effective as of October 16, 2014. The operations of CMG and bBooth (USA), Inc., became known as, and are referred to in this Annual Report as, \u201cbBoothUSA.\u201d\nOn October 16, 2014, bBoothUSA was acquired by Global System Designs, Inc. (\u201cGSD\u201d), pursuant to a Share Exchange Agreement entered into with GSD (the \u201cShare Exchange Agreement\u201d). GSD was incorporated in the State of Nevada on November 27, 2012. The acquisition was accounted for as a reverse merger transaction. In connection with the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Share Exchange Agreement, GSD\u2019s management was replaced by bBoothUSA\u2019s management, and GSD changed its name to bBooth, Inc.\nOn April 21, 2017, we changed our corporate name from bBooth, Inc. to nF\u00fcsz, Inc. The name change was effected through a parent/subsidiary short-form merger of nF\u00fcsz, Inc., our wholly-owned Nevada subsidiary, formed solely for the purpose of the name change, with and into us.\nOn February 1, 2019, we changed our corporate name from nF\u00fcsz, Inc. to Verb Technology Company, Inc. The name change was effected through a parent/subsidiary short-form merger of Verb Technology Company, Inc., our wholly-owned Nevada subsidiary, formed solely for the purpose of the name change, with and into us.\nOn February 4, 2019, we implemented a 1-for-15 reverse stock split (the \u201cReverse Stock Split\u201d) of our common stock, $0.0001 par value per share (the \u201cCommon Stock\u201d). As a result of the Reverse Stock Split, every fifteen (15) shares of our pre-Reverse Stock Split Common Stock were combined and reclassified into one share of our Common Stock. The number of shares of Common Stock subject to outstanding options, warrants, and convertible securities were also reduced by a factor of fifteen as of February 1, 2019. The par value per share of our Common Stock was not affected by the Reverse Stock Split. All shares and per share amounts have been retroactively restated as if the reverse split occurred at the beginning of the earliest period presented.\nOn April 12, 2019, we acquired Sound Concepts Inc. (\u201cSound Concepts\u201d). The acquisition was intended to augment and diversify Verb\u2019s internet and SaaS business (see Note 3).\nOn September 4, 2020, Verb Acquisition Co., LLC (\u201cVerb Acquisition\u201d), a subsidiary of the Company, entered into a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement (the \u201cPurchase Agreement\u201d) with Ascend Certification, LLC, dba SoloFire (\u201cSoloFire\u201d) for the acquisition of Solofire. The acquisition was intended to augment and diversify Verb\u2019s internet and SaaS business (see Note 3).\nNature of Business\nWe are a Software-as-a-Service (\u201cSaaS\u201d) applications platform developer. Our platform is comprised of a suite of interactive video-based sales enablement business software products marketed on a subscription basis. Our applications, available in both mobile and desktop versions, are offered as a fully integrated suite, as well as on a standalone basis, and include verbCRM, our Customer Relationship Management application, verbLEARN, our Learning Management System application, and verbLIVE, our Live Stream eCommerce application.\nWe also provided certain non-digital services to some of our enterprise clients such as printing and fulfillment services. We designed and printed welcome kits and starter kits for their marketing needs and provided fulfillment services, which consisted of managing the preparation, handling and shipping of our client\u2019s custom-branded merchandise they use for marketing purposes at conferences and other events, and product sample packs that verbCRM users order through the app for automated delivery and tracking to their customers and prospects. We use the term \u201cclient\u201d and \u201ccustomer\u201d interchangeably.\nGoing Concern\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. As reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, during the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company incurred a net loss of $24,956,000 and used cash in operations of $16,294,000. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date of the financial statements being issued. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company\u2019s ability to raise additional funds and implement its business plan. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.\nSubsequent to December 31, 2020, the Company generated cash in the aggregate of $15,480,000 from the sale of our common stock as part of a public offering and exercise of stock options and warrants. In addition, the Company also received cash of $4.4 million from advances from the sale of future receipts (see Note 20). Our continuation as a going concern is dependent on our ability to obtain additional financing until we can generate sufficient cash flows from operations to meet our obligations. We intend to continue to seek additional debt or equity financing to continue our operations. There is no assurance that we will ever be profitable or that debt or equity financing will be available to us. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result should we be unable to continue as a going concern.\nCOVID-19\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization declared coronavirus COVID-19 a global pandemic. This contagious disease outbreak, which has continued to spread, has adversely affected workforces, customers, economies, and financial markets globally. It has also disrupted the normal operations of many businesses. This outbreak could decrease spending, adversely affect demand for the Company\u2019s products, and harm the Company\u2019s business and results of operations. In the three months ended June 30, 2020, we experienced some uncertainty regarding whether there would be variability in demand for the services we provide on our platform after lock-down measures were implemented. We expect demand variability for our products and services may continue as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic; however, our sales team reported a higher level of interest in our products and services during the year ended December 31, 2020. Although the impact has not been material to date, a prolonged downturn in economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our customers and demand for our services. The Company has not observed any impairments of its assets or a significant change in the fair value of its assets due to the COVID-19 pandemic. At this time, it is not possible for the Company to predict the duration or magnitude of the adverse results of the outbreak and its effects on the Company\u2019s business or results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company has been following the recommendations of local health authorities to minimize exposure risk for its employees, including the temporary closure of its corporate office and having employees work remotely. Most vendors have transitioned to electronic submission of invoices and payments.\n2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Verb Technology Company, Inc., Verb Direct, LLC, and Verb Acquisition Co., LLC. Intercompany accounts have been eliminated in the consolidation.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported periods. Significant estimates include assumptions made in analysis of reserves for allowance of doubtful accounts, inventory, assumptions made in purchase price allocations, impairment testing of long-term assets, realization of deferred tax assets, determining fair value of derivative liabilities, and valuation of equity instruments issued for services. Amounts could materially change in the future.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company derives its revenue primarily from providing application services through the SaaS application, digital marketing and sales support services, from the sale of customized print products and training materials, branded apparel, and digital tools, as demanded by its customers. The subscription revenue from the application services are recognized over the life of the estimated subscription period. The Company also charges certain customers setup or installation fees for the creation and development of websites and phone application. These fees are accounted as part of deferred revenue and amortized over the estimated life of the agreement. Amounts related to shipping and handling that are billed to customers are reflected as part of revenue, and the related costs are reflected in cost of revenue in the accompanying Statements of Consolidated Operations.\nThe Company recognizes revenue in accordance with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (\u201cASC 606\u201d). The underlying principle of ASC 606 is to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers at the amount expected to be collected. ASC 606 creates a five-step model that requires entities to exercise judgment when considering the terms of contract(s), which includes (1) identifying the contract(s) or agreement(s) with a customer, (2) identifying our performance obligations in the contract or agreement, (3) determining the transaction price, (4) allocating the transaction price to the separate performance obligations, and (5) recognizing revenue as each performance obligation is satisfied. Pursuant to ASC 606, revenue is recognized when performance obligations under the terms of a contract are satisfied, which occurs for the Company upon shipment or delivery of products or services to our customers based on written sales terms, which is also when control is transferred. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for transferring the products or services to a customer.\nThe products sold by us are distinctly individual. The products are offered for sale solely as finished goods, and there are no performance obligations required post-shipment for customers to derive the expected value from them. Other than promotional activities, which can vary from time to time but nevertheless are entirely within the Company\u2019s control, contracts with customers contain no incentives or discounts that could cause revenue to be allocated or adjusted over time.\nThe control of products we sell transfers to our customers upon shipment from our facilities, and our performance obligations are satisfied at that time. Shipping and handling activities are performed before the customer obtains control of the goods and, therefore, represent a fulfillment activity rather than promised goods to the customer. Payment for sales are generally made by check, credit card, or wire transfer. Historically, we have not experienced any significant payment delays from customers.\nWe allow returns within 30 days of purchase from end-users. Our customers may return purchased products to us under certain circumstances.\nA description of our principal revenue generating activities is as follows:\n1. Digital Revenue which is divided into two main categories:\na. SaaS recurring digital revenue based on contract-based subscriptions to our verb app products and platform services which include verbCRM, verbLEARN, verbLIVE, and verbTeams. The revenue is recognized over the subscription period.\nb. Non-SaaS, non-recurring digital revenue, which is revenue generated by the use of our app products and in-app purchases, such as sampling and other services obtained through the app. The revenue for samples is recognized upon completion and shipment, while the design fees are recognized when the service has been rendered and the app is delivered to the customer.\n2. Non-digital revenue, which is revenue we generate from non-app, non-digital sources through ancillary services we provide as an accommodation to our clients and customers. These services, which we now outsource to a strategic partner as part of a cost reduction plan we instituted in 2020, include:\na. Design, printing services, and fulfillment. The revenue is recognized upon completion and shipment of products or fulfillment to the customer.\nb. Shipping services. The revenue is recognized when the corresponding products or fulfillment are shipped.\nRevenues during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were all generated from the United States of America.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue primarily consists of the salaries of certain employees, purchase price of consumer products, digital content costs, packaging supplies, and customer shipping and handling expenses. Shipping costs to receive products from our suppliers are included in our inventory and recognized as cost of revenue upon sale of products to our customers.\nConcentration of Credit and Other Risks\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist of cash and accounts receivable. Cash is deposited with a limited number of financial institutions. The balances held at any one financial institution at times may be in excess of Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (\u201cFDIC\u201d) insurance limits of up to $250,000.\nThe Company extends limited credit to customers based on an evaluation of their financial condition and other factors. The Company generally does not require collateral or other security to support accounts receivable. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts and sales credits. The Company believes that any concentration of credit risk in its accounts receivable is substantially mitigated by the Company\u2019s evaluation process, relatively short collection terms and the high level of credit worthiness of its customers.\nThe Company\u2019s concentration of credit risk includes its concentrations from key customers and vendors. The details of these significant customers and vendors are presented in the following table for year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nYear Ended\nYear Ended\nDecember 31, 2020\nDecember 31, 2019\nVerb\u2019s largest customers are presented below as a percentage of Verb\u2019s aggregate:\nRevenues\nNone\nmajor customer accounted for 13% of revenues\nAccounts receivable\nNone\nNone\nVerb\u2019s largest vendors are presented below as a percentage of Verb\u2019s aggregate:\nPurchases\nmajor vendor accounted for 40% of accounts payable individually and in aggregate\nNone\nAccounts payable\nmajor vendors accounted for 10% and 28% of accounts payable individually and 38% in aggregate\nmajor vendor accounted for 14% of accounts payable individually and in aggregate\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are recorded at historical cost and depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives of approximately five years once the individual assets are placed in service.\nLeases\nWe lease certain corporate office space and office equipment under lease agreements with monthly payments over a period of 36 to 94 months. Pursuant to ASC 840, Leases, lease assets are presented as operating lease right-of-use assets and the related liabilities are presented as lease liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets (see Note 5).\nLong-Lived Assets\nThe Company evaluates long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their net book value may not be recoverable. When such factors and circumstances exist, the Company compares the projected undiscounted future cash flows associated with the related asset or group of assets over their estimated useful lives against their respective carrying amount. Impairment, if any, is based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value, based on market value when available, or discounted expected cash flows, of those assets and is recorded in the period in which the determination is made. No impairment of long-lived assets was required for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes under Financial Accounting Standards Board\u2019s (\u201cFASB\u201d) ASC 740 \u201cIncome Taxes.\u201d Under the asset and liability method of ASC 740, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The deferred tax assets of the Company relate primarily to operating loss carry-forwards for federal income tax purposes. A full valuation allowance for deferred tax assets has been provided because the Company believes it is not more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized. Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on the Company generating sufficient taxable income in future periods.\nThe Company periodically evaluates its tax positions to determine whether it is more likely than not that such positions would be sustained upon examination by a tax authority for all open tax years, as defined by the statute of limitations, based on their technical merits. The Company accrues interest and penalties, if incurred, on unrecognized tax benefits as components of the income tax provision in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. As of December 31, 2020, and 2019, the Company has not established a liability for uncertain tax positions.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nThe Company evaluates its financial instruments to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives. For derivative financial instruments that are accounted for as liabilities, the derivative instrument is initially recorded at its fair value and is then re-valued at each reporting date, with changes in the fair value reported in the consolidated statements of operations. The classification of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is evaluated at the end of each reporting period. Derivative instrument liabilities are classified in the balance sheet as current or non-current based on whether or not net-cash settlement of the derivative instrument could be required within 12 months of the balance sheet date.\nThe Company uses Level 2 inputs for its valuation methodology for the derivative liabilities as their fair values were determined by using a Binomial pricing model. The Company\u2019s derivative liabilities are adjusted to reflect fair value at each period end, with any increase or decrease in the fair value being recorded in results of operations as adjusted to fair value of derivatives.\nShare Based Payment\nThe Company issues stock options and warrants, shares of Common Stock, and equity interests as share-based compensation to employees and non-employees. The Company accounts for its share-based compensation in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board\u2019s (\u201cFASB\u201d) ASC 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation. Stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date, based on the estimated fair value of the award, and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period.\nThe Company values stock options using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Assumptions used in the Black-Scholes model to value options issued during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 are as follows:\nYear Ended\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\nDecember 31,\nExpected life in years\n3.0, 4.0 and 5.0\n1.0, 2.0 and 5.0\nStock price volatility\n255%-271 %\n180%-414 %\nRisk free interest rate\n0.17-0.39 %\n1.51-2.75 %\nExpected dividends\n%\n%\nForfeiture rate\n21.2 - 21.3 %\n22.48 %\nThe risk-free interest rate was based on rates established by the Federal Reserve Bank. The Company uses the historical volatility of its Common Stock to estimate the future volatility for its Common Stock. The expected dividend yield was based on the fact that the Company has not paid dividends in the past and does not expect to pay dividends in the future.\nResearch and Development Costs\nResearch and development costs consist of expenditures for the research and development of new products and technology. These costs are primarily expenses to vendors contracted to perform research projects and develop technology for the Company\u2019s cloud-based, Verb interactive video CRM SaaS platform.\nNet Loss Per Share\nBasic net loss per share is computed by using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net loss per share is computed giving effect to all dilutive potential shares of Common Stock that were outstanding during the period. Dilutive potential shares of Common Stock consist of incremental shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of stock options. No dilutive potential shares of Common Stock were included in the computation of diluted net loss per share because their impact was anti-dilutive.\nAs of December 31, 2020, and 2019, the Company had total outstanding options of 6,031,775 and 4,233,722, respectively, and warrants of 13,351,251 and 10,930,991, respectively, and outstanding restricted stock awards of 2,185,946 and 1,486,354, respectively, and 2,642,159 shares common shares potentially issuable from our Class B Units that were issued in August 2020, were excluded from the computation of net loss per share because they are anti-dilutive.\nAcquisitions and Business Combinations\nThe Company allocates the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and separately identified intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. Such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Significant estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows from, acquired technology, trade-marks and trade names, useful lives, and discount rates. Management\u2019s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. During the measurement period, which is the period needed to gather all information necessary to make the purchase price allocation, not to exceed one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings.\nGoodwill\nIn accordance with FASB ASC Topic No. 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other, the Company reviews the recoverability of the carrying value of goodwill at least annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate a potential impairment. The Company\u2019s impairment testing is performed annually at December 31 (its fiscal year end). Recoverability of goodwill is determined by comparing the fair value of Company\u2019s reporting unit to the carrying value of the underlying net assets in the reporting units. If the fair value of a reporting unit is determined to be less than the carrying value of its net assets, goodwill is deemed impaired and an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying value of goodwill exceeds the difference between the fair value of the reporting unit and the fair value of its other assets and liabilities. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, management determined there were no indications of impairment.\nIntangible Assets with Finite Useful Lives\nWe have certain finite lived intangible assets that were initially recorded at their fair value at the time of acquisition. These intangible assets consist of developed technology. Intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful life of five years.\nWe review all finite lived intangible assets for impairment when circumstances indicate that their carrying values may not be recoverable. If the carrying value of an asset group is not recoverable, we recognize an impairment loss for the excess carrying value over the fair value in our consolidated statements of operations. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019 there was no impairment of intangible assets.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe Company follows the guidance of FASB ASC 820 and ASC 825 for disclosure and measurement of the fair value of its financial instruments. FASB ASC 820 establishes a framework for measuring fair value under GAAP and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. To increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures, ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three (3) broad levels. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs.\nThe three (3) levels of fair value hierarchy defined by ASC 820 are described below:\nLevel 1: Quoted market prices available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date.\nLevel 2: Pricing inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date.\nLevel 3: Pricing inputs that are generally observable inputs and not corroborated by market data.\nThe carrying amount of the Company\u2019s financial assets and liabilities, such as cash and cash equivalents, prepaid expenses, and accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate their fair value due to their short-term nature. The carrying values financing obligations approximate their fair values due to the fact that the interest rates on these obligations are based on prevailing market interest rates. The Company uses Level 2 inputs for its valuation methodology for the derivative liabilities.\nSegments\nThe Company has acquired two operating subsidiaries, Verb Direct and Ascend Certification (see Note 3) with various revenue channels. Operations of these two subsidiaries are integrated since they have similar customer base and the Company having a single sales team, marketing department, customer service department, operations department, finance and accounting department to support its operations. In accordance with the \u201cSegment Reporting\u201d Topic of the ASC, the Company\u2019s chief operating decision maker (the Company\u2019s Chief Executive Officer) determined that there is only one reporting unit or segment.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Credit Losses - Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (\u201cASC 326\u201d). The standard significantly changes how entities will measure credit losses for most financial assets, including accounts and notes receivables. The standard will replace today\u2019s \u201cincurred loss\u201d approach with an \u201cexpected loss\u201d model, under which companies will recognize allowances based on expected rather than incurred losses. Entities will apply the standard\u2019s provisions as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective. As small business filer, the standard will be effective for us for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2022. Management is currently assessing the impact of adopting this standard on the Company\u2019s financial statements and related disclosures.\nOther recent accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB, including its Emerging Issues Task Force, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d) did not or are not believed by management to have a material impact on the Company\u2019s present or future consolidated financial statements.\n3. ACQUISITIONS\na. ACQUISITION OF VERB DIRECT\nOn April 12, 2019, Verb completed its previously announced acquisition of Verb Direct through a two-step merger, consisting of merging Merger Sub 1 with and into Sound Concepts, with Sound Concepts surviving the \u201cfirst step\u201d of the merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Verb (and the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub 1 then having ceased) and, immediately thereafter, merging Sound Concepts (as of the closing of the first step, then known as Verb Direct, Inc.) with and into Merger Sub 2, with Merger Sub 2 surviving the \u201csecond step\u201d of the merger, such that, upon the conclusion of the \u201csecond step\u201d of the merger, the separate corporate existence of Verb Direct, Inc. (formerly Sound Concepts) then having ceased and Merger Sub 2 continued its limited liability company existence under Utah law as the surviving entity and as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Verb, then known as Verb Direct. On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the merger, each share of Sound Concepts Capital Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time, was cancelled in exchange for cash payment by Verb of an aggregate of $15,000,000, and the issuance of an aggregate of 3,327,791 restricted shares of Verb\u2019s Common Stock. The Acquisition Cash Payment was paid using a portion of the net proceeds Verb received as a result of the public offering of the units. Pursuant to the requirements of current accounting guidance, Verb valued the acquisition shares at $7,820,000, the fair value of the shares at the closing date of the transaction.\nThe acquisition was intended to augment and diversify Verb\u2019s internet and SaaS business. Key factors that contributed to the recorded goodwill and intangible assets in the aggregate of $22,677,000 were the opportunity to consolidate and complement existing operations of Verb, certain software and customer list, and the opportunity to generate future synergies within the internet and SaaS business.\nThe allocation of the purchase price was determined with the assistance of a valuation specialist. The following table summarizes the assets acquired, liabilities assumed and purchase price allocation:\nAssets Acquired:\nOther current assets $ 2,004,000\nProperty and equipment 58,000\nOther assets 1,302,000 $ 3,364,000\nLiabilities Assumed:\nCurrent liabilities (2,153,000 )\nLong-term liabilities (1,068,000 ) (3,221,000 )\nIntangible assets\n6,340,000\nGoodwill\n16,337,000\nPurchase Price\n$ 22,820,000\nThe goodwill recognized in connection with the acquisition is primarily attributable to anticipated synergies from future growth and is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes. Goodwill is not amortized but will be tested for impairment on an annual basis.\nThe intangible assets, which consist mostly of developed technology of $4,700,000 are being amortized over 5-years, customer relationships of $1,200,000 are being amortized on an accelerated basis over its estimated useful life of 5 years and domain names of $440,000 are determined to have infinite lives but will be tested for impairment on an annual basis.\nb. ACQUISITION OF ASCEND CERTIFICATION\nOn September 4, 2020, Verb Acquisition Co., LLC (\u201cVerb Acquisition\u201d), a subsidiary of the Company, entered into a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement (the \u201cPurchase Agreement\u201d) with Ascend Certification, LLC, dba SoloFire (\u201cSoloFire\u201d), the sellers party thereto (collectively, the \u201cSellers\u201d), and Steve Deverall, solely in his capacity as the seller representative, under which Sellers agreed to sell their entire interest in SoloFire, representing all of the outstanding limited liability company membership interests of SoloFire, to Verb Acquisition for a base purchase price of $5,700,000, subject to certain post-closing adjustments totaling $750,000 for an adjusted purchase price of $4,950,000. As a result, Verb Acquisition issued to the Sellers an amended promissory note of $1,885,000 and 2,642,159 Class B Units of Verb Acquisition which are exchangeable for 2,642,159 shares of Verb\u2019s Common Stock with an estimated fair value of $3,065,000 (see Note 16) for a total purchase price of $4,950,000. The promissory note is unsecured, bears interest at a rate of 0.14% per annum and will mature in October 2020. The amended promissory note was paid in full on October 1, 2020.\nThe acquisition was intended to augment and diversify Verb\u2019s SaaS business. Key factors that contributed to the recorded provisional goodwill and intangible assets in the aggregate of $4,845,000 were the opportunity to consolidate and complement existing operations of Verb, certain software and customer list, and the opportunity to generate future synergies within the SaaS business.\nVerb is required to allocate the purchase price to the acquired tangible assets, identifiable intangible assets, and assumed liabilities based on their fair values. As of December 31, 2020, management has not yet finalized the purchase price allocation. The fair values of the assets acquired, as set forth below, are considered provisional and subject to adjustment as additional information is obtained through the purchase price measurement period (a period of up to one year from the closing date). Any prospective adjustments would change the fair value allocation as of the acquisition date. The Company is still in the process of reviewing underlying models, assumptions and discount rates used in the valuation of provisional goodwill and intangible assets. The following table summarizes the provisional fair value of the assets assumed and liabilities acquired and the provisional purchase price allocation on the date of acquisition:\nAssets Acquired:\nCash\n$ 229,000\nAccounts receivable\n207,000\n$ 436,000\nLiabilities Assumed:\nCurrent liabilities\n(241,000 )\nLong-term liabilities\n(90,000 )\n(331,000 )\nIntangible assets (provisional)\n1,122,000\nGoodwill (provisional)\n3,723,000\nPurchase Price\n$ 4,950,000\nThe provisional goodwill recognized in connection with the acquisition is primarily attributable to anticipated synergies from future growth and is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes. Goodwill is not amortized but will be tested for impairment on an annual basis.\nThe provisional intangible assets, which consist of developed technology of $1,000,000 are being amortized over 5-years, customer relationships of $70,000 are being amortized over 3 years, non-competition clause of $50,000 is being amortized over 3 years, and domain names of $2,000 are determined to have infinite lives but will be tested for impairment on an annual basis.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company recorded amortization expense of $1,335,000 and $975,000, respectively, related to the intangibles discussed above. The following table summarizes the amortization expense for both Verb Direct and Ascend to be recorded in future periods for intangible assets that are subject to amortization and excludes intangible assets with infinite life (i.e. domain names) of $442,000:\nYear ending Amortization\n$ 1,435,000\n1,375,000\n1,302,000\n465,000\n2025 and thereafter 133,000\nTotal amortization $ 4,710,000\nThe following unaudited pro forma statements of operations present the Company\u2019s pro forma results of operations after giving effect to the purchase of Verb Direct and Verb Acquisition based on the historical financial statements of the Company, Verb Direct, and Verb Acquisition.

RIGHT-OF-USE ASSETS AND OPERATING LEASE LIABILITIES\nThe Company leases certain warehouse, corporate office space and equipment under an operating lease agreement. We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Lease assets are presented as operating lease right-of-use assets and the related liabilities are presented as lease liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets pursuant to ASC 842, Leases.\nOperating lease right-of-use (\u201cROU\u201d) assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. ROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Generally, the implicit rate of interest in lease arrangements is not readily determinable and the Company utilizes its incremental borrowing rate in determining the present value of lease payments. The Company\u2019s incremental borrowing rate is a hypothetical rate based on its understanding of what its credit rating would be. The operating lease ROU asset includes any lease payments made and excludes lease incentives.\nThe components of lease expense and supplemental cash flow information related to leases for the period are as follows:\nPeriod Ended\nDecember 31, 2020\nPeriod Ended\nDecember 31, 2019\nLease cost\nOperating lease cost (included in general and administration in the Company\u2019s statement of operations) $ 520,000 $ 499,000\nOther information\nCash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities $ 577,000 $ 366,000\nWeighted average remaining lease term - operating leases (in years) 4.54 5.25\nAverage discount rate - operating leases 4.0 % 4.0 %\nDecember 31, 2020\nDecember 31, 2019\nOperating leases\nRight-of-use assets\n$ 2,730,000\n$ 3,275,000\nShort-term operating lease liabilities\n$ 596,000\n$ 391,000\nLong-term operating lease liabilities\n2,943,000\n3,591,000\nTotal operating lease liabilities\n$ 3,539,000\n$ 3,982,000\nYear ending Operating Leases\n776,000\n751,000\n773,000\n472,000\n2025 and thereafter 1,189,000\nTotal lease payments 3,961,000\nLess: Imputed interest/present value discount (422,000 )\nPresent value of lease liabilities $ 3,539,000\n6.

Pursuant to the terms of the agreement the unaffiliated third-party auto withdrew an aggregate of $6,000 from the Company\u2019s operating account each banking day. The term of the agreement extended until the advances are paid in full. The notes did not bear any interest, however, the interest was imputed at a rate of 28% based on the face value of the note. These advances were secured by the Company\u2019s tangible and intangible assets.\nThe Company accounted these advances on future receipts as a liability pursuant to current accounting guidelines. As a result, the Company recorded a liability of $1,012,000 to account for the future receipts sold and a debt discount of $285,000 to account for the difference between the future receipts sold and the cash received. The debt discount was being amortized over the term of the agreement. As of December 31, 2019, outstanding balance of the advances amounted to $1,006,000 and the unamortized debt discount of $274,000.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company paid the entire amount due of $1,006,000 and amortized the corresponding debt discount for $274,000.\nNote 3 and 4\nOn June 30, 2020, the Company received two secured advances from the same unaffiliated third party totaling $728,000 for the purchase of future receipts/revenues of $1,012,000. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement the unaffiliated third-party will auto withdraw an aggregate of $6,000 from the Company\u2019s operating account each banking day. The term of the agreement extends until the advances are paid in full. The notes did not bear any interest, however, the interest was imputed at a rate of 28% based on the face value of the note. The Company may pay off either note for $446,000 if paid within 30 days of funding; for $465,000 if paid between 31 and 60 days of funding; or for $484,000 if paid within 61 to 90 days of funding. These advances are secured by the Company\u2019s tangible and intangible assets. As a result, the Company recorded a liability of $1,012,000 to account for the future receipts sold and a debt discount of $284,000 to account for the difference between the future receipts sold and the cash received. The debt discount is being amortized over the term of the agreement.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company paid $835,000 of the balance outstanding and amortized $218,000 of the debt discount. As of December 31, 2020 outstanding balance of the notes amounted to $177,000 and the unamortized balance of the debt discount was $67,000.\n7.

NOTES PAYABLE\nThe Company has the following outstanding notes payable as of December 31, 2020:\nNote Issuance Date Maturity Date Interest\nRate Balance at\nDecember 31, 2020\nNote A April 17, 2020 April 17, 2022 1.00 % $ 1,218,000\nNote B May 15, 2020 May 15, 2050 3.75 % 150,000\nNote C May 1, 2020 May 1, 2022 3.75 % 90,000\nNote D September 4, 2020 October 1, 2020 0.14 % -\nTotal notes payable\n$ 1,458,000\n(A) On April 17, 2020, the Company received loan proceeds in the amount of $1,218,000 under the Paycheck Protection Program (\u201cPPP\u201d). The PPP, established as part of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (\u201cCARES Act\u201d), provides for loans to qualifying businesses for amounts up to 2.5 times of the average monthly payroll expenses of the qualifying business. The loans and accrued interest are forgivable after the earlier of (i) 24 weeks after the loan disbursement date and (ii) December 31, 2020 as long as the borrower uses the loan proceeds for eligible purposes, including payroll, benefits, rent and utilities, and maintains its payroll levels.\nThe unforgiven portion of the PPP loan is payable over two years at an interest rate of 1%, with a deferral of payments for the first six months. The Company intends to use the proceeds for purposes consistent with the PPP. While the Company currently believes that its use of the loan proceeds will meet the conditions for forgiveness of the loan, we cannot assure you that we will not take actions that could cause the Company to be ineligible for forgiveness of the loan, in whole or in part. As for the potential loan forgiveness, once the PPP loan is, in part or wholly, forgiven and a legal release is received, the liability would be reduced by the amount forgiven and a gain on extinguishment would be recorded. The terms of the PPP loan provide for customary events of default including, among other things, payment defaults, breach of representations and warranties, and insolvency events. The Company was in compliance with the terms of the PPP loan as of December 31, 2020.\nOn January 4, 2020 the entire note and accrued interest was forgiven and will be accounted as a gain in fiscal 2021.\n(B) On May 15, 2020, the Company executed an unsecured loan with the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) under the Economic Injury Disaster Loan program in the amount of $150,000. The loan is secured by all tangible and intangible assets of the Company and payable over 30 years at an interest rate of 3.75% per annum. Installment payments, including principal and interest, will begin on May 15, 2021.\nAs part of the loan, the Company also received an advance of $10,000 from the SBA. While the SBA refers to this program as an advance, it was written into law as a grant. This means that the amount given through this program does not need to be repaid. As a result, the Company accounted this $10,000 as part of \u201cOther Income\u201d in the accompanying Statement of Operations.\n(C) As a result of the acquisition of Solofire in September 2020, the Company assumed Solofire\u2019s PPP loan of $90,000 it obtained in May 2020 under the Paycheck Protection Program (\u201cPPP\u201d) (see discussion \u201ca\u201d). The Company is currently in the process of applying for the forgiveness of the PPP loan.\n(D) On September 4, 2020, Verb Acquisition issued a note payable to the owners of SoloFire, in the amount of $1,885,000, as adjusted, as part of the consideration related to the acquisition of SoloFire. The note bears interest at a rate of 0.14% per annum, and was paid in full on October 1, 2020.\n10. CONVERTIBLE SERIES A PREFERRED STOCK and WARRANT OFFERING\nOn August 14, 2019, we entered into the SPA with the Preferred Purchasers, pursuant to which we agreed to issue and sell to the Preferred Purchasers up to an aggregate of 6,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock (which, at the initial conversion price, are convertible into an aggregate of up to approximately 3.87 million shares of Common Stock) and the August Warrants to purchase up to an equivalent number of shares of Common Stock. We closed the offering on August 14, 2019, and issued 5,030 shares of Series A Preferred Stock and granted the August Warrants to purchase up to 3,245,162 shares of Common Stock in connection therewith. We received proceeds of $4,688,000, net of direct costs of $342,000. The offering was made in reliance upon an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d), pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) thereof, and Rule 506 promulgated thereunder, as a transaction by an issuer not involving any public offering.\nThe SPA grants the Preferred Purchasers a right to participate, up to a certain amount, in subsequent financings for a period of 24 months. The SPA also prohibits us from entering into any agreement to issue, or announcing the issuance or proposed issuance, of any shares of Common Stock or Common Stock equivalents for a period of 90 days after the date that the registration statement, registering the shares issuable upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock and exercise of the August Warrants, is declared effective. We are also prohibited, until the date that the Preferred Purchasers no longer collectively hold at least 20% of the then-outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock issued pursuant to the SPA, from entering into an agreement to effect any issuance by us of Common Stock or Common Stock equivalents involving certain variable rate transactions. We also cannot enter into agreements related to \u201cat-the-market\u201d transactions for a period of 12 months. At the later of (i) the date that the August Warrants are fully exercised, and (ii) 12 months from the date of the SPA, we cannot draw down on any existing or future agreement with respect to \u201cat-the-market\u201d transactions if the sale of the shares in such transactions has a per share purchase price that is less than $3.76 (two times the exercise price of the Warrants).\nOn September 16, 2019, we filed a registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC to register the shares of Common Stock underlying the Series A Preferred Stock and the August Warrants. The registration statement was declared effective on September 19, 2019. We have agreed to keep such registration statement continuously effective for a period of 24 months.\nEach share of Series A Preferred Stock is convertible, at any time and from time to time from and after the issuance date, at the holder\u2019s option in to that number of shares of Common Stock equal to the stated value per share (or $1,000) divided by the conversion price (initially, $1.55); thus, initially, each share of Series A Preferred Stock is convertible into approximately 645 shares of Common Stock. In certain circumstances, the Series A Preferred Stock is mandatorily convertible into shares of Common Stock after the Company obtains stockholder approval to issue a number of shares of Common Stock in excess of 19.99% and the closing price of the Common Stock is 100% greater than the then-base conversion price on each trading day for any 20 trading days during a consecutive 30-trading-day period.\nThe holders of the Series A Preferred Stock have no voting rights. However, we cannot, without the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the then-outstanding shares of the Series A Preferred Stock, (a) alter or change adversely the rights, preferences, or restrictions given to the Series A Preferred Stock or alter or amend the Certificate of Designation, (b) authorize or create any class of stock ranking as to dividends, redemption, or distribution of assets upon a liquidation senior to, or otherwise pari passu with, the Series A Preferred Stock, (c) amend our Articles of Incorporation, or other charter documents in any manner that materially and adversely affects any rights of the holders, (d) increase the number of authorized shares of Series A Preferred Stock, or (e) enter into any agreement with respect to any of the foregoing.\nThe holders of Series A Preferred Stock cannot convert the Series A Preferred Stock if, after giving effect to the conversion, the number of shares of our Common Stock beneficially held by the holder (together with such holder\u2019s affiliates) would be in excess of 4.99% (or, upon election by a holder prior to the issuance of any shares, 9.99% of the number of shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately after giving effect to the issuance of any shares of Common Stock issuance upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock held by the holder). The conversion price of the Series A Preferred Stock is subject to certain customary adjustments, including upon certain subsequent equity sales and rights offerings.\nWe are also prevented from issuing shares of Common Stock upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock or exercise of the August Warrants, which, when aggregated with any shares of Common Stock issued on or after the issuance date and prior to such conversion date or exercise date, as applicable (i) in connection with any conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock issued pursuant to the SPA, (ii) in connection with the exercise of any August Warrants issued pursuant to the SPA, and (iii) in connection with the exercise of any warrants issued to any registered broker-dealer as a fee in connection with the issuance of the securities pursuant to the SPA, would exceed 4,459,725 shares of Common Stock (the \u201c19.99% Cap\u201d). This prohibition will terminate upon the approval by our stockholders of a release from such 19.99% Cap.\nThe August Warrants have an initial exercise price of $1.88 per share, subject to customary adjustments, are exercisable six months after the date of issuance, and will expire five years from the date of issuance. The exercise price is subject to certain customary adjustments, including upon certain subsequent equity sales and rights offerings. In addition, the August Warrants also included a fundamental transaction provision that could give rise to an obligation to pay cash to the warrant holder. As a result, the August Warrants are accounted as derivative liability with a fair value upon issuance in 2019 of $6,173,000, of which, $4,688,000 was recorded as a reduction to additional paid in capital while the remaining fair value of $1,485,000 was accounted for as a financing cost during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, in preparation for private placement offering, the Company separately negotiated with certain Series A stockholders to waive their rights in order not to ratchet down the conversion price of their Series A preferred shares. In return for the waiver, the Company granted these Series A stockholders warrants to purchase 2,303,861 shares of Common Stock valued at $3,951,000 (see Note 12).\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, 2,390 and 634 shares of Preferred Stock were converted into 1,768,909 and 409,032 shares of Common Stock. As of December 31, 2020, 1,706 shares Series A Preferred stock are outstanding.\n11. DERIVATIVE LIABILITY\nUnder authoritative guidance used by the FASB on determining whether an instrument (or embedded feature) is indexed to an entity\u2019s own stock, instruments that do not have fixed settlement provisions are deemed to be derivative instruments. The Company issued certain convertible note whose conversion price contains reset provisions based on a discounted future market price. However, since the number of shares to be issued is not explicitly limited, the Company is unable to conclude that enough authorized and unissued shares are available to settle the conversion option. In addition, the Company also granted certain warrants that included a fundamental transaction provision that could give rise to an obligation to pay cash to the warrant holder.\nAs a result, the conversion feature of the notes and the fundamental transaction clause of these warrants are accounted for as a derivative liability in accordance with ASC 815 and are being re-measured every reporting period with the change in value reported in the statement of operations.\nThe derivative liabilities were valued using a Binomial pricing model with the following average assumptions:\nDecember 31, 2020 Upon\nIssuance 2020\nDecember 31, 2019 Upon\nIssuance 2019\nStock Price $ 1.65 $ 1.70 $ 1.55 $ 4.78\nExercise Price $ 1.41 $ 1.55 $ 1.88 $ 3.76\nExpected Life 3.17 5.0 3.53 2.75\nVolatility 107 % 212 % 216 % 192 %\nDividend Yield 0 % 0 % 0 % 0 %\nRisk-Free Interest Rate 0.23 % 2.47 % 1.64 % 1.99 %\nWarrants $ 8,266,000 $ 3,951,000 $ 5,048,000 $ 6,173,000\nConvertible Notes - - - 388,000\nTotal Fair Value $ 8,266,000 $ 3,951,000 $ 5,048,000 $ 6,561,000\nThe expected life of the note and warrants was based on the remaining contractual term of the instruments. The Company uses the historical volatility of its Common Stock to estimate the future volatility for its Common Stock. The expected dividend yield was based on the fact that the Company has not paid dividends in the past and does not expect to pay dividends in the future. The risk-free interest rate was based on rates established by the Federal Reserve Bank.\nAs of December 31, 2018, the outstanding fair value of the derivative liability amounted to $2,576,000.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recorded derivative liabilities of $388,000 as a result of the issuance of a convertible note and $6,173,000 as a result of the issuance of the August Warrants issued as part of the Company\u2019s Series A Preferred Stock offering, or an aggregate of $6,561,000. The Company recorded a charge of ($1,862,000) to account for the changes in the fair value of these derivative liabilities for the year ended December 31, 2019. In addition, the Company also recorded a gain on debt extinguishment of $2,227,000 to account for the extinguishment of derivative liabilities associated with the settlement of all convertible debt accounted as derivative liability. At December 31, 2019, the fair value of the derivative liability amounted to $5,048,000.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded a derivative liability of $3,951,000 as a result of the issuance of 2,303,861 warrants to acquire common stock to Series A Preferred stockholders that contained a fundamental transaction clause (see Note 12). The Company recorded a charge of ($574,000) to account for the changes in the fair value of these derivative liabilities during year ended December 31, 2020. In addition, 95,000 shares of the Series A warrants that were accounted as derivative liability were exercised. As result, the Company computed the fair value of the corresponding derivate liability one last time which amounted to $159,000 and the pursuant to current accounting guidelines, the extinguishment was accounted as part of equity.\nAt December 31, 2020, the fair value of the derivative liability amounted to $8,266,000. The details of derivative liability transactions for the year ended December 31, 2020 are as follows:\nDecember 31, 2020 December 31, 2019\nBeginning balance $ 5,048,000 $ 2,576,000\nFair value upon issuance of notes payable and/or warrants 3,951,000 6,561,000\nChange in fair value (574,000 ) (1,862,000 )\nExtinguishment (159,000 ) (2,227,000 )\nEnding balance $ 8,266,000 $ 5,048,000\n12. COMMON STOCK\nThe following were Common Stock transactions during the year ended December 31, 2020:\nSale of common stock from private placement\nOn February 5, 2020, the Company initiated a private placement, which is for the sale and issuance of up to five million shares of its Common Stock at a per-share price of $1.20, which amount represents a 20% discount to the $1.50 closing price of the Company\u2019s Common Stock on that day.\nThe Company\u2019s private placement is exempt from the registration requirements of Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d), in reliance on Section 4(a)(2) thereof and/or Rule 506 of Regulation D and Regulation S thereunder, each as promulgated by the SEC. The Company\u2019s private placement was managed by the Company; however, in connection with the closings, the Company paid a non-U.S. based consultant (i) as a cash fee, an aggregate amount of $499,000 (or 10% of the gross proceeds of the closings), (ii) as a non-accountable expense allowance, an aggregate of $100,000 (or 2% of the gross proceeds of the closings), (iii) five-year warrants, exercisable for an aggregate of up to 416,199 shares of the Company\u2019s Common stock at a cash-only exercise price of $1.92 per share, and (iv) 100,000 shares of the Company\u2019s Common Stock. The Company made the above-referenced payments only in respect of that portion of the gross proceeds from the closings for investors introduced to the Company by the consultant. In addition, the Company also incurred various expenses totaling $42,000 that are directly related to this private placement.\nAs a result of this private placement, from February through April 2020, a total of 4,237,833 shares of Common Stock were sold in exchange for cash proceeds of $4,444,000, net of direct fees and expenses in the aggregate of $641,000.\nIn preparation for this private placement offering, the Company separately negotiated with certain Series A stockholders to waive their rights in order not to ratchet down the conversion price of their Series A preferred shares (see Note 10). In return for the waiver, the Company granted these Series A stockholders warrants to purchase 2,303,861 shares of Common Stock. The warrants are exercisable in August 2020, expire in 5 years and are exercisable at $1.20 per share, as adjusted. The exercise price is subject to certain customary adjustments, including subsequent equity sales and rights offerings. In addition, the warrants also included a fundamental transaction provision that could give rise to an obligation to pay cash to the warrant holder. As a result of this fundamental transaction provision, the warrants were accounted as derivative liability with a fair value upon issuance of $3,951,000 upon issuance. The Company accounted the fair value of $3,951,000 as a deemed dividend since if the down round provision of the Series A preferred shares had occurred, it would have been accounted as a deemed dividend due to it providing additional value to the Series A stockholders.\nSale of common stock from public offering\nOn July 24, 2020, the Company concluded its public offering pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-239055) and issued and sold 12,545,453 shares of Common Stock (which included 1,636,363 shares of Common Stock sold pursuant to the exercise by the underwriters of an overallotment option).

As of December 31, 2020, the total unrecognized stock-based compensation expense was $4,146,000, which is expected to be recognized as part of operating expense through December 2024.\nThe following were stock options transactions during the year ended December 31, 2019:\nOn December 23, 2019, the Company amended the exercise price of stock options of certain employees and consultants granted in prior period to purchase 1,340,333 shares of common stock to $1.36 per share. As a result of this amendment, the Company determined the fair value of these stock options before and after the amendment using the Black-Scholes Option Pricing model. The incremental difference of the fair value before and after the amendment amounted to $32,000, of which, $12,000 was recorded as part of stock based compensation expenses and the remaining $20,000 will be recognized as part of operating expense through July 2023 based upon its vesting.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company granted stock options to employees and consultants to purchase a total 2,531,971 shares of Common Stock for services rendered. The options have an average exercise price of $2.07 per share, expire between one and five years, vest starting from grant date through four years. The total fair value of these options at grant date was approximately $4,564,000 using the Black-Scholes Option Pricing model. The total stock compensation expense recognized relating to the vesting of stock options for the year ended December 31, 2019 amounted to $1,961,000.\nThe fair value of the share option awards was estimated using the Black-Scholes method based on the following weighted-average assumptions:\nYears Ended December 31,\nRisk-free interest rate\n0.17% - 0.39 %\n1.51%-2.75 %\nAverage expected term (years)\nyears\nyears\nExpected volatility\n255.23 - 270.57 %\n180%-413.83 %\nExpected dividend yield\n-\n-\nThe risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of measurement corresponding with the expected term of the share option award; the expected term represents the weighted-average period of time that share option awards granted are expected to be outstanding giving consideration to vesting schedules and historical participant exercise behavior; the expected volatility is based upon historical volatility of the Company\u2019s Common Stock; and the expected dividend yield is based on the fact that the Company has not paid dividends in the past and does not expect to pay dividends in the future.\n15.

Class A Units - During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company created an separate class of equity instrument called Class A Units. Concurrently, the Company formed a wholly owned subsidiary, Verb Acquisition, and issued 100 Class A units as part of the organization of Verb Acquisition. The Class A Units have the following rights and privileges:\n1. Class A units are a standalone financial instrument;\n2. Priority on distributions;\n3. Ability to remove the manager;\n4. Drag-along rights;\n5. Power to dissolve Verb Acquisition provided that a majority of the Class B Units also approve the dissolution;\n6. Ability to appoint a liquidator to wind up the affairs of Verb Acquisition;\n7. Entitled to distributions;\n8. Approve board appointments; and\n9. Approve any amendments to Verb Acquisition\u2019s operating agreement, provided that a majority of the Class B Units also approve the amendment.\nb. Class B Units - During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company created a separate class of an equity instrument called Class B Units. Concurrently, our wholly owned subsidiary, Verb Acquisition, issued 2,642,159 Class B Units as part of its acquisition of SoloFire (see Note 3). The Class B Units have the following rights and privileges:\n1. Class B units are a standalone financial instrument;\n2. Exchangeable for shares of the Company\u2019s Common Stock at a conversion rate of 1 to 1;\n3. Power to dissolve Verb Acquisition, provided that a majority of the Class A Units also approve the dissolution;\n4. Entitled to profit distributions;\n5. Approve board appointments made by the Class A Units; and\n6. Approve any amendments to Verb Acquisition\u2019s operating agreement, provided that a majority of the Class A Units also approve the amendment.\nAs the Class B Units are exchangeable for the Company\u2019s Common Stock, for valuation purposes, the Company determined to use the trading price of the Company\u2019s Common Stock at the date of the acquisition of SoloFire which amounted to $3,065,000. Subsequent to December 31, 2020 all Class B units were exchanged into Verb Technology Common Stock.\n17. INCOME TAXES\nSignificant components of the Company\u2019s deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows:\nDecember 31, 2020\nDecember 31, 2019\nNet operating loss carry-forwards\n$ 13,350,000\n$ 7,591,000\nShare based compensation\n(457,000 )\n(635,000 )\nNon-cash interest and financing expenses\n(177,000 )\n(472,000 )\nOther temporary differences\n(569,000 )\n(63,000 )\nLess: Valuation allowance\n(12,147,000 )\n(6,421,000 )\nDeferred tax assets, net\n$ -\n$ -\nThe items accounting for the difference between income taxes computed at the federal statutory rate and the provision for income taxes were as follows:\nDecember 31, 2020\nDecember 31, 2019\nStatutory federal income tax rate\n(21.0 )%\n(21.0 )%\nState taxes, net of federal benefit\n(6.9 )%\n(6.9 )%\nNon-deductible items\n(1.0 )%\n(1.0 )%\nChange in valuation allowance\n28.9 %\n28.9 %\n0.0 %\n0.0 %\nASC 740 requires that the tax benefit of net operating losses carry forwards be recorded as an asset to the extent that management assesses that realization is \u201cmore likely than not.\u201d Realization of the future tax benefits is dependent on the Company\u2019s ability to generate sufficient taxable income within the carry forward period. Because of the Company\u2019s recent history of operating losses, management believes that recognition of the deferred tax assets arising from the above-mentioned future tax benefits is currently not likely to be realized and, accordingly, has provided a 100% valuation allowance against the asset amounts.\nAny uncertain tax positions would be related to tax years that remain open and subject to examination by the relevant tax authorities. The Company has no liabilities related to uncertain tax positions or unrecognized benefits as of the year end December 31, 2020 or 2019. The Company has not accrued for interest or penalties associated with unrecognized tax liabilities.\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \u201cTCJ Act\u201d) was enacted into law. The TCJ Act provides for significant changes to the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d), that impact corporate taxation requirements, such as the reduction of the federal tax rate for corporations from 35% to 21% and changes or limitations to certain tax deductions.\nThe Company is currently assessing the extensive changes under the TCJ Act and its overall impact on the Company; however, based on its preliminary assessment of the reduction in the federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% to become effective on January 1, 2018, the Company currently expects that its effective tax rate for 2018 will be between 20% and 23%. Such estimated range is based on management\u2019s current assumptions with respect to, among other things, the Company\u2019s earnings, state income tax levels and tax deductions. The Company\u2019s actual effective tax rate in 2019 may differ from management\u2019s estimate.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company had federal and state net operating loss carry forwards of approximately $28.7 million, which may be available to offset future taxable income for tax purposes. These net operating losses carry forwards begin to expire in 2034. This carry forward may be limited upon the ownership change under IRC Section 382. IRS Section 382 places limitations (the \u201cSection 382 Limitation\u201d) on the amount of taxable income which can be offset by net operating loss carry forwards after a change in control (generally greater than 50% change in ownership) of a loss corporation. Generally, after a change in control, a loss corporation cannot deduct operating loss carry forwards in excess of the Section 382 Limitation. Due to these \u201cchange in ownership\u201d provisions, utilization of the net operating loss may be subject to an annual limitation regarding their utilization against taxable income in future periods. The Company has not concluded its analysis of Section 382 through December 31, 2020 but believes the provisions will not limit the availability of losses to offset future income.\nThe Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and the state of Nevada. The tax regulations within each jurisdiction are subject to interpretation of related tax laws and regulations and require significant judgment to apply. As of December 31, 2020, tax years 2015 through 2018 remain open for IRS audit. The Company has received no notice of audit from the IRS for any of the open tax years.\n18. ACCRUED OFFICERS\u2019 SALARY\nAccrued officers\u2019 salary consists of unpaid salaries for the Company\u2019s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, who are also the owner of approximately 8.3% of the Company\u2019s outstanding shares of Common Stock.\nAs of December 31, 2020, and 2019, accrued officers\u2019 salary amounted to $822,000 and $207,000, respectively.\n19. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nEmployment Agreements\nOn December 20, 2019, we entered into an Executive Employment Agreement with Mr. Cutaia (the \u201cEmployment Agreement\u201d), which terminates and replaces his original employment agreement dated November 1, 2014, as subsequently amended by an amendment dated October 30, 2019. The Employment Agreement sets forth the terms and conditions of Mr. Cutaia\u2019s employment. The Employment Agreement is for a four-year term, and can be extended for additional one-year periods. In addition to certain payments due to Mr. Cutaia upon termination of employment, the Employment Agreement contains customary non-competition, non-solicitation, and confidentiality provisions. Mr. Cutaia is entitled to an annual base salary of $430,000, which shall not be subject to reduction during the initial term, but will be subject to annual reviews and increases, if and as approved in the sole discretion of our Board, after it has received and reviewed advice from the Compensation Committee (who may or may not utilize the services of its outside compensation consultants, as it shall determine under the circumstances). In addition, Mr. Cutaia is eligible to receive performance-based cash and/or stock bonuses upon attainment of performance targets established by our Board in its sole discretion, after it has received and reviewed advice from the Compensation Committee (who may or may not utilize the services of its outside compensation consultants, as it shall determine under the circumstances). The Company shall make annual equity grants to Mr. Cutaia as determined by our Board in its sole discretion, after it has received and reviewed advice from the Compensation Committee (who may or may not utilize the services of its outside compensation consultants, as it shall determine under the circumstances). Finally, Mr. Cutaia is eligible for certain other benefits, such as health, vision, and dental insurance, life insurance, and 401(k) matching.\nThe Employment Agreement provides that Mr. Cutaia is entitled to the following severance package in the event he is \u201cterminated without cause,\u201d \u201cterminated for good reason,\u201d or \u201cterminated upon permanent disability\u201d: (i) monthly payments of $35,833 or such sum equal to his monthly base compensation at the time of the termination, whichever is higher, for a period of 36 months from the date of such termination and (ii) reimbursement for COBRA health insurance costs for 18 months from the date of such termination and, thereafter, reimbursement for health insurance costs for Mr. Cutaia and his family during the immediately subsequent 18-month period. In addition, all of Mr. Cutaia\u2019s then-unvested RSAs or other awards will immediately vest, without restriction, and any unearned and unpaid bonus compensation, expense reimbursement, and all accrued vacation, personal, and sick days, and related items shall be deemed earned, vested, and paid immediately. For purposes of the Employment Agreement, \u201cterminated without cause\u201d means if Mr. Cutaia were to be terminated for any reason other than a discharge for cause or due to Mr. Cutaia\u2019s death or permanent disability. For purposes of the Employment Agreement, \u201cterminated for good reason\u201d means the voluntary termination of the Employment Agreement by Mr. Cutaia if any of the following were to occur without his prior written consent, which consent cannot be unreasonably withheld considering our then-current financial condition, and, in each case, which continues uncured for 30 days following receipt by us of Mr. Cutaia\u2019s written notice: (i) there is a material reduction by us in (A) Mr. Cutaia\u2019s annual base salary then in effect or (B) the annual target bonus, as set forth in the Employment Agreement, or the maximum additional amount up to which Mr. Cutaia is eligible pursuant to the Employment Agreement; (ii) we reduce Mr. Cutaia\u2019s job title and position such that Mr. Cutaia (A) is no longer our Chief Executive Officer; (B) is no longer our Chairman of the Board; or (C) is involuntarily removed from our Board; or (iii) Mr. Cutaia is required to relocate to an office location outside of Orange County, California, or outside of a 30-mile radius of Newport Beach, California. For purposes of the Employment Agreement, \u201cterminated upon permanent disability\u201d means if Mr. Cutaia were to be terminated because he is then unable to perform his duties due to a physical or mental condition for (i) a period of 120 consecutive days or (ii) an aggregate of 180 days in any 12-month period.\nOn July 29, 2020, the Compensation Committee approved a 3% salary increase for Mr. Cutaia resulting in an annual salary of $490,000.\nLitigation\na. EMA Financial, LLC\nOn April 24, 2018, EMA Financial, LLC, or EMA, commenced an action against the Company, styled as EMA Financial, LLC, a New York limited liability company, Plaintiff, against nFUSZ, Inc., Defendant, United States District Court, Southern District of New York, case number 1:18-cv-03634-NRB. The complaint set forth four causes of action and sought money damages, injunctive relief, liquidated damages, and declaratory relief related to the Company\u2019s refusal to agree to EMA\u2019s interpretation of a cashless exercise provision in a common stock warrant it granted to EMA in December 2017. The Company interposed several counterclaims, including a claim for reformation of the underlying agreements to reflect the Company\u2019s interpretation of the cashless exercise provision. Both parties moved for summary judgment. On March 16, 2020, the United States District Court entered a decision agreeing with the Company\u2019s position, denying EMA\u2019s motion for declaratory judgement on its interpretation of the cashless exercise formula, and stating, inter alia, that \u201cthe Agreements read in their entirety reveal that nFUSZ, Inc.\u2019s position regarding the proper cashless exercise formula is the only sensible one and that the cashless exercise formula must be enforced accordingly.\u201d On December 22, 2020, the court entered a Memorandum and Order partly granting, and partly denying, EMA\u2019s motion for summary judgment on damages, awarding damages only in respect to the value of the warrant shares EMA would have received if it had used the proper formula in its March 2018 warrant exercise notice, plus certain prejudgment interest and per diem interest. On January 21, 2021, the court entered a final judgment in favor of EMA, in the amount of $463,571.98. The court did not award EMA any attorneys\u2019 fees or expenses. While the court ruled in the Company\u2019s favor by dismissing the majority of EMA\u2019s suit, the Company does not agree with the court\u2019s finding that EMA\u2019s March 28, 2018 notice of exercise was not defective. On February 17, 2021, the Company\u2019s counsel filed a notice of appeal to appeal the court\u2019s judgment to the United States District Court for the Second Circuit. EMA filed a notice of cross-appeal and a hearing or briefing for this case is scheduled in June 2021. The Company has established an appropriate reserve to pay for the approximately $464,000 judgment entered against it in this litigation.\nb. Former Employee\nThe Company is currently in a dispute with a former employee of its predecessor bBooth, Inc. who has interposed a breach of contract claim in which he alleges that he is entitled to approximately $300,000 in unpaid bonus compensation from 2015. The Company does not believe his claims have any merit as they are contradicted by documentary evidence, and barred by the applicable statute of limitations, and barred by a release executed by the former employee when the Company purchased all of his shares of stock more than 4 years ago in January 2016. On February 9, 2021, the former employee\u2019s counsel filed a motion for summary judgment, or in the alternative, summary adjudication against the Company. The Company does not believe the court will grant this motion and it has instructed its counsel to continue its efforts in seeking a dismissal of the former employee\u2019s claims.\nc. Class Action\nOn July 9, 2019, a purported class action complaint was filed in the United States District Court, Central District of California, styled SCOTT C. HARTMANN, Individually and on Behalf of All Others Similarly Situated, Plaintiff, v. VERB TECHNOLOGY COMPANY, INC., and RORY J. CUTAIA, Defendant, Case Number 2:19-CV-05896 (the \u201cHartmann Class Action\u201d). The complaint purported to be brought on behalf of a class of persons or entities who purchased or otherwise acquired the Company\u2019s common stock between January 3, 2018 and May 2, 2018, and alleged violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, arising out of the January 3, 2018, announcement by the Company of its agreement with Oracle America, Inc. The complaint sought unspecified costs and damages. The Company believes the complaint is without merit.\nOn May 15, 2020, we executed a binding Memorandum of Understanding with the lead plaintiff in the class action lawsuit to settle that action and release the claims asserted therein, the terms of which were confidential and subject to several contingencies, including, without limitation, court approval. On October 27, 2020, the court granted preliminary approval of the class action settlement. On February 18, 2021, the court entered a final order and judgment approving the class action settlement and dismissed the Hartmann Class Action with prejudice. The stipulation of settlement approved (the \u201cStipulation of Settlement\u201d) by the court on February 18, 2021 provided for, amongst other things, a full and final release, settlement, and discharge of all claims arising from the Hartmann Class Action in consideration of the Company\u2019s payment of a $640,000 settlement amount, which is payable over 12 months. Furthermore, amongst other things, the Stipulation of Settlement provided that (1) the Company denied each and all of the claims alleged by plaintiffs, (2) the Company denied any allegation of wrongdoing, fault, liability, violation of the law, or damage whatsoever arising out of its conduct, (3) the Company denied that it or any of its officers, directors, or employees made any material misstatements or omissions, (4) the Company maintained that it had a meritorious defense to all claims alleged in the Hartmann Class Action, and (5) the Company agreed that the basis of us entering into the Stipulation of Settlement was to avoid the uncertainties, burden, and expense of further litigation and to put the claims arising from the Hartmann Class Action to rest, finally and forever. The Company believes that the settlement of the Hartmann Class Action approved by the court is favorable to the Company and ultimately benefits its shareholders.\nThe Company has established an appropriate reserve to account for the $75,000 settlement of the Hartmann Class Action.\nd. Derivative Action\nOn September 27, 2019, a derivative action was filed in the United States District Court, Central District of California, styled Richard Moore, Individually and on Behalf of All Others Similarly Situated, Plaintiff, v. Verb Technology Company, Inc., and Rory J. Cutaia, James P. Geiskopf, and Jeff Clayborne, Defendants, Case Number 2:19-CV-08393-AB-SS (the \u201cMoore Derivative Action\u201d). The Moore Derivative Action also arises out of the January 3, 2018, announcement by the Company of its agreement with Oracle America, Inc. The Moore Derivative Action alleges claims for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, and waste of corporate assets due to the costs associated with the defense of the above referenced class action complaint. The derivative complaint seeks a declaration that the individual defendants have breached their duties, unspecified damages, and certain purportedly remedial measures. The Company contends that the class action is without merit and as such, this derivative action, upon which it relies, is likewise without merit.\nOn November 5, 2020, the Company executed a binding settlement term sheet with the lead plaintiff in the derivative action to settle that action and release all claims asserted therein, the terms of which were confidential and subject to several contingencies, including, without limitation, court approval. On March 1, 2021, the court preliminarily approved the settlement of the Moore Derivative Action. The stipulation and agreement of settlement preliminarily approved (the \u201cStipulation and Agreement of Settlement\u201d) by the court on March 1, 2021 provided for, amongst others things, a full and final release, settlement, and discharge of all claims arising from the Moore Derivative Action in consideration of the Company\u2019s agreement to institute certain changes and/or modifications to its corporate governance and business ethics practices and plaintiff\u2019s counsel receiving its attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses, which amounted to $75,000. Furthermore, amongst other things, the Stipulation and Agreement of Settlement preliminarily approved by the court provided that (1) the Company denied each and every claim alleged by plaintiff, and (2) the Company denied any allegation of wrongdoing, fault, and liability, (3) the Company denied committing any violation of the law or breach of fiduciary duty, and (4) the Company concluded that it is desirable that the Moore Derivative Action be settled on the terms and subject to the conditions of the Stipulation and Settlement Agreement to avoid the ongoing cost and distraction of litigation. The Company believes that the settlement of the Moore Derivative Action preliminarily approved by the court is favorable to the Company and ultimately benefits its shareholders. The court intends to set a hearing for the final approval of the settlement of the Moore Derivative Action approximately 60 days after March 1, 2021.\nThe Company knows of no material proceedings in which any of its directors, officers, or affiliates, or any registered or beneficial stockholder is a party adverse to the Company or any of its subsidiaries or has a material interest adverse to the Company or any of its subsidiaries.\nThe Company believes it has adequately reserved for all litigation within its financial statements.\nBoard of Directors\nThe Company has committed an aggregate of $450,000 in board fees to its five board members over the term of their appointment for services to be rendered. Board fees are accrued and paid monthly. The members will serve on the board until the annual meeting for the year in which their term expires or until their successors has been elected and qualified.\nTotal board fees expensed and paid in 2020 totaled $426,000. As of December 31, 2020, total board fees to be recognized in 2021 amounted to $450,000 and will be recognized once the service has been rendered.\n20.
