    "item_1": "item 1. business\nOverview\nAnaplan is a cloud-native enterprise SaaS company and a market leader in Connected Planning, empowering global enterprises to orchestrate transformative business performance. Leaders across industries rely on the Anaplan platform-powered by our proprietary Hyperblock\u00ae technology-to connect teams, systems, and insights from across their organizations to continuously adapt to change, transform how they operate, and reinvent value creation. The Anaplan platform enables businesses to be more agile, make better decisions and to plan and execute their ongoing digital transformation to compete in today\u2019s digital economy.\nOur cloud platform empowers enterprises to orchestrate complex scenario planning and conduct continuous forecasting to systematically identify possibilities, seize opportunities, and reduce risk. Users of our platform can view and assess the impact of assumptions on plans and key performance indicators in real time and across multiple business dimensions. Powered by our proprietary Hyperblock\u00ae technology, our platform\u2019s in-memory data storage and calculation capabilities deliver calculations on a massive amount of data in real time and provide a single source of information for planning, ensuring the consistency, quality, and integrity of the data utilized. Our platform also allows customers to leverage intelligent forecasting capabilities backed by machine learning to understand future market drivers, analyze the impact of hypothetical planning scenarios, and quickly pinpoint accurate forecasts. Customers can harness actionable intelligence from these predictive tools that may help them achieve a competitive advantage. Our platform\u2019s multi-dimensional modeling features enable our customers to plan with large data sets that integrate internal historical data with external market-driven data to derive finely tuned forecasts. These modeling capabilities provide the flexibility our customers need to plan at enterprise scale and improve decision-making across their enterprises with any number of users. Our platform puts the power of planning directly in the hands of its users with agile collaboration tools, and a highly responsive and secure user experience that spans across devices, personalized views and reporting. The dynamic structure of our platform allows enterprises to break down traditional silos across the planning processes in ways that can improve decision-making and generate transformative business value.\nWe put the success of our customers at the center of our culture, strategy, and investments. As a leader in Connected Planning that enables digital transformation initiatives, we have deep domain expertise and have developed a robust Connected Planning ecosystem to enable our customers to more effectively unlock the potential of our platform. Our Connected Planning ecosystem includes skilled Anaplan users and dedicated professionals from Certified Model Builders and Solution Architects to Certified Master Anaplanners, spread throughout both our customer and partner communities. This ecosystem continues to grow organically as demand for our platform grows and our customers and partners encourage their users to enhance their Anaplan expertise. By aligning our thought leadership, Connected Planning ecosystem, worldwide development and delivery capabilities, and local sales and service resources, our Customer First strategy drives exceptional value throughout our customers\u2019 Connected Planning and digital transformation journeys. We view our Customer First strategy as core to capturing our Connected Planning vision and driving continued expansion in the use of our platform.\nOur customers often initially adopt our platform within a specific business function for one or more planning use cases, but also because our platform has the potential to be used as an enterprise-wide integrated planning and forecasting tool and as part of a broader digital transformation initiative. We use a \u201cland and expand\u201d sales strategy to capitalize on this potential. Once customers see the benefits of our platform for their initial use cases, they often increase the number of users, add new use cases, and expand to additional lines of business, divisions, and geographies. We call this the Honeycomb\u2122 effect. This expansion often generates a natural network effect in which the value of our platform to customers increases as more use cases are adopted, more users are connected, and greater amounts of data are incorporated in our platform.\nAs of January 31, 2021, over 1,600 customers were using our platform. The success of our \u201cland and expand\u201d strategy is validated by the expansion we have experienced in the use of our platform by our largest customers and by our dollar-based net expansion rates. Our top 25 customers by average annual recurring revenue as of January 31, 2021, had average annual recurring revenue of approximately $4.2 million, compared to the average annual recurring revenue represented by their initial purchase of approximately $0.4 million. In addition, our annual dollar-based net expansion rate for Anaplan was 114%, 122% and 123% at the end of fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d for a description of how we calculate our dollar-based net expansion rate. The number of customers with greater than $250,000 of annual recurring revenue was 453, 353, and 248 as of the end of fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. We monitor this metric, and believe it is a useful tool to investors, as an indicator of the scale of customer adoption and expansion of our platform. While achieving and maintaining incremental sales to existing customers requires increasingly sophisticated and costly sales efforts, we believe the introduction of new solutions, features and functionality to our platform, and customers realizing benefits through their initial adoption of our platform, means we have significant opportunities to further expand the use of our platform by our existing customers as well as to attract additional customers.\nWe have a robust partner ecosystem that includes strategic consulting, systems integration, and technology firms. Our strategic consulting and systems integration partners are an essential part of our go-to-market strategy. These partners promote our platform as their clients examine how to plan more effectively or seek digital transformation through organizational change or improved business processes. They also help us scale our sales and implementation delivery capacity globally by leveraging their trained staff, and provide a broad range of expertise to our clients and deep subject-matter expertise in the implementation of specific use cases. We also work closely with our technology partners to extend our technology platform leadership, execute on our ambitious technology roadmap, and go-to-market jointly with these technology partners. We develop solutions with our technology partners that expand the intelligence, scale, and extensibility of our platform and accelerate customer adoption, expansion and lifetime value. We continue to focus on building depth in our partner ecosystem and expanding the breadth and depth of resources within our partners.\nFor financial information regarding our business, see \u201cPart II-Item 7 - Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d of this Annual Report and our consolidated audited financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nOur Platform\nOur cloud platform is flexible, scalable, and collaborative. It is designed to address the end-to-end Connected Planning needs of all organizations and to enable them to plan and execute digital transformations. Our platform has the power and functionality to address the most complex planning challenges of the largest global enterprises.

Our platform allows our customers to rapidly achieve productivity gains and cost savings, which can result in high returns on investment. Key aspects of our platform include:\n\u2022\nPlanning and Modeling. Our platform empowers customers to quickly and easily build models to address the most complex business challenges. Powered by our proprietary Hyperblock\u00ae technology, our platform\u2019s innovative in-memory architecture delivers ultra-fast calculations on a massive amount of data. It allows customers to rapidly run alternative scenarios to understand the impact of changes in business assumptions on plans and key performance indicators in real time. Our in-memory data storage capabilities provide a single source of information for planning, ensuring the consistency, quality, and integrity of the data utilized. With Anaplan HyperModelTM, our customers can further expand upon our powerful multi-dimensional modeling capabilities, and are able to plan at a greater set of dimensions, forecast further into the future, and incorporate larger volumes of meaningful data. These functionalities allow users to view and assess the impact of assumptions on plans and key performance indicators in real time and across multiple business dimensions.\n\u2022\nIntelligence. Our platform leverages advanced predictive analytics capabilities, including Anaplan PlanIQ\u2122 which delivers artificial intelligence (\u201cAI\u201d) and machine learning (\u201cML\u201d)-based forecasting to help business users optimize their plans. PlanIQ is a user-friendly offering that can absorb a wide array of data, make an intelligent prediction, and help users quickly select the best course of action, which may provide our customers with a competitive advantage. Our platform also offers a user interface-driven linear programming optimization engine that quickly analyzes billions of possible outcomes and makes a recommendation of the best path forward. In addition, Anaplan Predictive Insights helps predict the intent of buyers of our customers by analyzing internal data along with AI and ML classifications of external data.\n\u2022\nUser Experience. Our platform puts the power of planning directly in the hands of its users with agile collaboration tools and a highly responsive and secure user experience that spans across devices, personalized views and reporting. Customers can rapidly build and easily modify and manage sophisticated models to address their specific needs without coding, resulting in a more rapid return on their time and investment with a seamless and personalized experience across devices. Customers can connect people, data, and plans to collaborate across the organization in real time without transferring data between point solutions and spreadsheets. The user experience has built-in collaboration capabilities, such as sharing, commenting, and notify actions, and notifications that users can leverage across any device to speed decision-making. Our modern user interface includes highly customized views and reports that facilitate personalized experiences for every user of the platform. As a result, our platform is designed to deliver integrated business planning and a collaborative, intuitive, and engaging user experience at strategic and operational levels across all lines of business.\n\u2022\nEnterprise Scale. Our platform is designed for planning at enterprise scale. It allows our customers to connect stakeholders across their enterprise leading to enhanced visibility and improved decision-making. The modular nature of our platform lets decision-makers in different business units model their unique organizational structure, but also allows our customers to connect these models to compare and connect planning across business units and to enable executives to plan across their entire organization. Our platform also includes enterprise-grade governance tools, including application lifecycle management capabilities, that enable customers to effectively manage the development, testing, deployment, and ongoing maintenance of models without disrupting the production environment. These tools also allow administrators to view changes between versions of an application and separately designate ownership of production of an application from the development of the application. In addition, a\ndetailed logging capability provides administrators with full visibility into how and when models are being accessed and by whom, ensuring operational integrity.\n\u2022\nExtensibility. Our platform enables our customers to model and optimize a vast array of processes within their organizations utilizing data from many sources. Our suite of extensible and interoperable capabilities, including Anaplan CloudWorks\u2122, allow our customers to easily integrate our platform with homegrown, cloud, and third-party systems and data. Anaplan CloudWorksTM orchestrates integrations with both internal and external sources with an easy-to-use interface so users can conduct more agile planning with the data they need. Users can use Anaplan CloudWorksTM to configure, manage, schedule, and automate integrations. Our customers can also leverage Transactional APIs to easily interact with model data and properties. Our platform also integrates with the products of leading enterprise software vendors, including our technology partners, with open API standards-based data sharing capabilities. Our platform also enables companies to collaborate with users outside of our platform framework, such as trading partners in a supply chain. Customers can gain actionable intelligence by accessing data from both within and outside of the organization.\n\u2022\nSecurity. Our customers can benefit from the robust security features built into our platform, including data encryption, user access and identity management. Data at rest is stored in a proprietary, non-readable binary format and subject to full-disk AES-256 encryption. We also support TLS 1.2 for protection of encryption in transit. Backups also use AES-256 encryption. A bring your own key, or BYOK, option enables our customers to own and manage their own encryption keys if required for compliance needs. The administration console provides a centralized place to manage, audit, and control users, roles, and access. Our Self-Service SAML provides an easy way for our customers to configure and manage their single sign on capabilities in line with their organization\u2019s specific policies.\nOur Solutions\nOur customers often initially adopt our platform within a specific business function for one or more planning use cases, but also because our platform has the potential to be used as an enterprise-wide integrated planning and forecasting tool and as part of a broader digital transformation initiative. The dynamic structure of our platform allows our customers to break down traditional silos between enterprise financial and operational planning processes which can improve decision-making across enterprises and deliver new levels of transformative business value. While the use cases for our platform are unbounded, our customers typically use our platform for:\n\u2022\nSales.

Managing marketing planning and operations, including global budget planning, campaign spend management, and performance management across brands, channels, and customers with internal, vendor and network teams.\nOur Growth Strategy\nOur goal is to make Anaplan the platform of choice for end-to-end Connected Planning for customers with the most complex planning needs. Key elements of our growth strategy include:\n\u2022\nDrive New Customer Acquisition. While we have enjoyed rapid customer growth, we believe we are still in the very early stages of penetrating our addressable market. We strive to make our platform the preferred planning foundation for enterprises seeking digital transformation, which we believe have the largest communities of potential users and face the most complex planning challenges. As companies across the globe are digitizing their business processes and maturing their digital transformation efforts, they are trying to be more efficient in managing their resources and increasingly are finding value in our platform to drive large scale digital transformation of the enterprise planning process. We believe these complex organizations have the greatest potential for expanded use of our platform and have needs that are particularly well addressed by the comprehensive capabilities of our platform. We seek to deliver strategic value to the C-suite with the ability to provide a line-of-sight connecting every function, asset, capacity, risk and resource across the enterprise which creates a dynamic view of financial implications and guides better business outcomes. We utilize our partner ecosystem to provide leverage to our sales team in targeting and selling our platform to enterprise customers.\n\u2022\nExpand within Existing Customers. We aim to drive Connected Planning across the entire organization to help our customers benefit from the full value of our platform. Our platform is often initially adopted within a specific line of business, including in finance, sales, supply chain, marketing, human resources, and operations, for one or more planning use cases. Once customers see the benefits of our platform for their initial use cases, they often increase the number of users, add new use cases, and expand to additional lines of business, divisions, and geographies as they continue unlocking the agile enterprise planning and operating model across functional boundaries. This expansion often generates a natural network effect in which the value of our platform increases as more use cases are adopted, more users are connected, and greater amounts of data are incorporated in our platform. We work closely with our customers and strategic partners to drive adoption of our platform by existing users through joint deployments, by improving consistency across deployments, and encouraging usage of our platform by end users during initial adoption of our platform and during expands. The value of the digital transformation capabilities often becomes greater as the use of our platform expands within an organization.\n\u2022\nContinue to Expand Globally. We have a significant opportunity to further expand globally and we intend to continue to invest in the use of our platform around the world. We continue to make substantial investments in building our global sales and marketing, service delivery, and customer support capabilities and have a strong and growing presence globally. In fiscal 2021, approximately 46% of our revenue was generated outside of the United States, demonstrating the importance of our global operations. We anticipate that new partnerships will expand the reach of our platform and give us access to new geographies.\n\u2022\nBroaden and Deepen our Partner Ecosystem. Our partner ecosystem extends our geographic coverage, accelerates the usage and adoption of our platform, promotes thought leadership, and enables more efficient delivery of service solutions. We continue to augment and deepen our relationships with global and regional partners, including strategic and advisory consulting firms, systems integration, and technology firms. We believe our partners\u2019 scale and route to market can significantly contribute to our ability to penetrate our addressable market, extend our geographic coverage and accelerate the usage and adoption of our platform. We anticipate that new partnerships will help customers accelerate their digital transformation journey through access to expanded infrastructure.\n\u2022\nContinue to Innovate and Extend our Technology Platform Leadership. We continue to extend the functionality and breadth of our platform. We have a well-defined technology roadmap to introduce new features and functionality to our platform that we believe will enhance our ability to generate revenue by broadening the appeal of our platform to potential new customers as well as increasing the opportunities for further expanding the use of our platform by existing customers. We work closely with our technology partners, including our new public cloud partners, to execute on our technology roadmap through solutions that leverage our technology and the technologies of our partners. These solutions can allow customers to extend value across our planning platform with other applications used for areas such as customer relationship management, marketing, information technology system management, and business intelligence. We are investing to further enhance the user interface, functionality, interoperability, extensibility, usability and intelligence of our platform, including in artificial intelligence and machine learning to further expand the predictive capabilities of our platform.\nOur Customers\nAs of January 31, 2021, we served over 1,600 customers in 57 countries.\nOur customers include leading businesses in diverse industries, including banking, capital markets, consumer products, government agencies, healthcare, insurance, life science, media, professional services, retail, technology, telecom, as well as transportation. No individual customer represented more than 10% of our revenue in fiscal 2021.\nOur Human Capital Management\nEmployees\nAs a market leader in Connected Planning, Anaplan is building a global connected workforce; adding over 300 employees in fiscal 2021. To realize our potential, we seek employees who are committed to solving challenging problems in a dynamic environment. As of January 31, 2021, we had over 1,900 employees worldwide, including more than 1,000 employees in the United States, and our remaining employees outside of the United States working in 18 different countries.\nAnaplan\u2019s Values\nAt Anaplan, we live our values every day. We believe our values shape our company culture and guide our decisions. Our values are an important part of the employee journey - beginning during the hiring process and continuing during AnaplanGO, our comprehensive onboarding program, and embedded in our various employee development and recognition programs. We believe that how work gets done is as important as what work gets done.\nDiversity, Inclusion & Belonging\nAnaplan thrives on diversity and inclusion. We believe in an experience in which all individuals are respected and valued, regardless of gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, religion, ethnicity, age, neurodiversity, disability status, citizenship, or any other aspect which makes people unique. We believe that our diverse workforce and inclusive work environment makes Anaplan a more innovative and collaborative company - creating better outcomes for our customers and stakeholders.\nOur commitment to building and maintaining a diverse and inclusive workplace starts with our corporate leadership. Anaplan\u2019s Board of Directors is a gender and ethnically diverse group, with members bringing their own unique perspectives to Anaplan. Anaplan\u2019s executive management team, which includes members from different gender and ethnic backgrounds, has championed diversity, inclusion and belonging, fostering an environment where our employees can bring their most creative, engaged and collaborative self to work each day.\nAnaplan strives to be an employer of choice for a diverse workforce through our talent attraction, development, and retention efforts. To foster an inclusive environment, we offer unconscious bias training for all employees, as well as expert-led company-wide conversations on diversity, inclusion and belonging. Our employee rewards programs are designed to achieve parity, while benefits programs are designed to be both comprehensive and flexible.\nWe support a community of employee resource groups (\u201cERGs\u201d) that bring together employees with shared interests, experiences, or characteristics for discussions, development, and service. These groups include:\n\u2022\nBEAD (Black Employees of African Descent)\n\u2022\nWIN (Women\u2019s Interest Network)\n\u2022\nAnaplan PRIDE (LGBTQ)\n\u2022\nNeurodiversity Network\n\u2022\nASIAPLAN\n\u2022\nAnaplanable (Accessibility)\nEmployee Development & Training\nWe develop employees by providing access to training, tools, and experiences for career progression. Through the Anaplan Academy, we provide employees with the opportunity to build technical and functional skills - including on the Anaplan platform - through on-demand and live courses with experts. We recognize that we need to develop agile and empathetic leaders, so our management training is designed to build leadership skills within our manager community, focused on managing for growth.\nCompensation & Benefits\nWe offer market-competitive compensation and benefits packages designed to attract and retain talented employees. Our compensation program is designed to pay for performance through variable incentive pay and promote ownership through equity awards and participation in our Employee Stock Purchase Plan. Our benefits programs are created to support employees and their families in the moments that matter the most.\nCOVID-19 Response\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Anaplan quickly shifted to a remote work environment, to support the safety of our employees, their respective households and our customers. We offered our employees additional resources, including a remote working stipend, office equipment loans, and reimbursement for phone and internet services to facilitate continued connectivity and productivity. Anaplan created flexible work programs, enabling employees to work a varied or reduced schedule while maintaining benefits. Throughout the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic we have maintained a focus on mental well-being, and offered expanded mental health resources, caregiver resources, wellness days (company-wide paid days off), and Focus Fridays (no meeting days). We have modified our offices in preparation for an eventual reopening of such facilities by adding safety partitions and filtration systems, and instituted new cleaning protocols and other precautions, to help protect the health of our employees when they return to our offices.\nOur Go-to-Market and Connected Planning Ecosystem\nWe sell our platform primarily through our direct sales team targeting customers with complex planning needs. Our customers often initially adopt our platform within a specific business function for one or more planning use cases. Our customers also adopt our platform because it has the potential to be used as an enterprise-wide integrated planning and forecasting tool and as part of a broader digital transformation initiative.\nOur robust partner ecosystem serves as an integral part of our go-to-market strategy and an extension of our direct sales force. Our strategic consulting and systems integration partners provide us with a significant source of lead generation and implementation leverage. These partners act as strategic advisors to senior executives in corporate, functional, and process transformation initiatives of organizations. They often promote our platform as their clients examine how to plan more effectively or seek digital transformation through organizational change or improved business processes. We also rely on partners with deep subject-matter expertise in the implementation of specific use cases who can facilitate implementations for our customers. Our partners also help to drive thought leadership in promoting Connected Planning and digital transformation. We continue to focus on building depth in our partner ecosystem and expanding the depth of resources within that system.\nOnce our customers see the initial value of our platform, we use a \u201cland and expand\u201d sales strategy to encourage our customers to increase the number of users, add new use cases, and expand to additional lines of business, divisions, and geographies. In order to facilitate our \u201cland and expand\u201d sales strategy, we work closely with our customers and partners to drive adoption of our platform amongst the users of our platform. We do this through joint deployments, by improving consistency across deployments and encouraging usage of our platform by end users during initial adoption of our platform and during expands. To accelerate the adoption of our platform, we provide rapid learning models and templatized Connected Planning and performance orchestration solutions on our App Hub marketplace. We intend to continue showcasing innovative solutions and use cases co-created by our partners and Master Anaplanners on the App Hub. To increase model builder engagement and feature usage, we plan\nto continue to improve how users find, use, share and enjoy personalized training apps and product onboarding content via the App Hub.\nOur customers and partners are passionate about our platform. As demand for trained users of our platform continues to grow, so too does our Connected Planning ecosystem, which includes skilled Anaplan users and dedicated professionals, including Certified Model Builders and Solutions Architects and Certified Master Anaplanners, spread throughout both our customer and partner communities. This ecosystem continues to grow organically as our customers and partners encourage their users to enhance their Anaplan expertise and these experienced users enable our customers and partners to more effectively unlock the potential of our Connected Planning platform. To facilitate this growth, we continue to invest in the Anaplan Academy. The Anaplan Academy creates and delivers resources about our platform, including the latest innovations and best practices, for our Connected Planning ecosystem. We have created a program for select users to receive status as Master Anaplanners. These individuals have volunteered their own time to become identified experts on our platform and frequently promote Anaplan within their organizations and evangelize the benefits of our platform to prospective customers. Our partner community has committed to expanding the number of Master Anaplanners on their teams to address the ongoing need from our customers.\nWe host an annual Anaplan Connected Planning Xperience, or CPX, user conference to connect existing and potential customers, share best practices, and reinforce our brand. Through CPX virtual and in-person events, we provide thought leadership, training, and community to our customers, including business decision-makers and Anaplan users, to encourage them to optimize and expand Anaplan across their enterprises.\nResearch and Development\nOur research and development team is focused on maintaining and improving our resilient platform and enabling customers to derive insights for decision-making and accelerate business agility. We have a research and development culture that seeks to deliver high-quality enhancements to the flexibility, scalability, intelligence, performance, security, reliability, extensibility and usability of our platform and is focused on maintaining and improving our resilient platform. Our research and development organization is primarily responsible for design, development, testing, and delivery of our products and platform in addition to enabling scalable integration and extension of our platform. We focus our efforts on developing core technologies, as well as further enhancing the usability, functionality, intelligence, mobility, reliability, performance, and flexibility of our platform. Our research and development team enables our strategic innovation for our customer and partner solutions. We strive to achieve interoperability and extensibility with flexible integrations, connectors and APIs while providing robust protection through data encryption, identity management and user access.\nWe have a global workforce with research and development hubs in the United Kingdom, Israel, and San Francisco, California. We hire skilled engineers, data scientists, and other talent from a variety of industries with expertise in developing mission-critical applications for customers with the most complex planning needs.\nCompetition\nThe market for Connected Planning and digital transformation solutions is new and characterized by rapid technology innovation. To our knowledge, there are no other companies that service the breadth of use cases or the varying enterprise needs that we do. In many cases, our primary competition is manual, often spreadsheet-driven, processes and custom-built approaches. In addition, we compete with certain applications of large software companies, including legacy vendors such as Oracle Corporation (Oracle), SAP AG (SAP), Workday, Inc. (Workday), and International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) that offer on-premises applications sold on a perpetual license and maintenance basis, as well as cloud software versions adapted from on-premises applications. These software companies have offered, and may continue to offer, new applications through acquisitions or organic development that more directly compete with some of our many individual use cases. We also compete with vendors of point solution applications focused on a specific department or use case, such as sales performance management, financial planning, and supply chain planning. We could also face competition from new market entrants, some of whom may be our current technology partners.\nWe believe the principal competitive factors in our market include the following:\nTechnology and platform capabilities, including:\n\u2022\nenterprise-grade scalability;\n\u2022\nbreadth of capabilities within a single modeling environment;\n\u2022\nintuitive and user-friendly interface;\n\u2022\nin-memory computing capability;\n\u2022\nability to support broad collaboration in real-time;\n\u2022\nmulti-tenant cloud-based architecture;\n\u2022\nsecurity;\n\u2022\ndata governance and administration;\n\u2022\nrich and dynamic analytics and reporting;\n\u2022\nability to integrate with other data and applications;\n\u2022\npredictive algorithms and modeling capabilities; and\n\u2022\nconfigurability and agility in complex, enterprise-grade, planning environments.\nMarket leadership and customer success orientation, including:\n\u2022\ninvolvement in growing the category of Connected Planning;\n\u2022\nthought leadership and best practices, from example models to roadmaps for success;\n\u2022\nestablished, proven success;\n\u2022\npassionate, dedicated customers;\n\u2022\ncustomer-centric approach and focus;\n\u2022\nspeed and scale of return on investment; and\n\u2022\ntime to deployment.\nWe believe that we are competitive with respect to each of these factors.\nIntellectual Property\nWe rely on a combination of trade secrets, patents, copyrights, and trademarks, as well as contractual protections, to establish and protect our intellectual property rights while actively working to increase our patent portfolio. As of January 31, 2021, we had four issued U.S. patents that expire between November 2030 and August 2034. We pursue the registration and enforcement of domain names, trademarks, and service marks in the United States and in various jurisdictions outside the United States. We also actively seek patent protection covering inventions originating from our company. Our software is protected by U.S. and international intellectual property laws. We control access to and use of our proprietary and confidential technology, documentation and other information through internal and external controls. We require our employees and independent contractors to sign agreements assigning to us any inventions, trade secrets, works of authorship, developments, and other processes generated by them on our behalf and agreeing to protect our confidential information. In addition, we generally enter into agreements containing confidentiality obligations with our customers, partners, vendors, and other service providers.\nGovernment Regulation\nAs a company with global operations, we are subject to the laws of the United States and multiple foreign jurisdictions in which we operate and the rules and regulations of various governing bodies, which\nmay differ among jurisdictions. Because we collect, process and store personal information and furthermore, because our platform could be used by customers to do the same, evolving domestic and international privacy and security laws, regulations and other obligations could result in additional costs and liabilities to us or inhibit sales of our platform.\nData privacy and security have become significant issues in the U.S. and in many other countries where our platform is available. Laws, rules, and regulations in these jurisdictions apply broadly to the collection, use, storage, data residency, disclosure, and security of various types of data, including data that identifies or may be used to identify an individual, such as names, email addresses, and in some jurisdictions, Internet Protocol addresses. In the U.S., these include laws, rules, and regulations promulgated under the authority of the Federal Trade Commission, the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, and state laws relating to privacy and data security. Internationally, virtually every jurisdiction in which we operate has established its own data security and privacy legal framework with which we, or our customers, must comply. Interpretation of, and costs of compliance with, these laws, rules, and regulations and their application to our platform and services in the United States and foreign jurisdictions is ongoing and cannot be fully determined at this time.\nFurther, the regulatory framework for privacy and security issues worldwide is rapidly evolving, subject to change and is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. Examples of recent changes to privacy and security laws that could impact our business include the following:\n\u2022\nThe California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d) came into effect on January 1, 2020, and broadly defines personal information, extends expanded privacy rights and protections to California residents, and provides for civil penalties for violations and a private right of action for data breaches. In November 2020, California voters approved a new privacy law, the California Privacy Rights Act (\u201cCPRA\u201d) that significantly amends the CCPA.\n\u2022\nOn May 25, 2018, the General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d) came into effect in the European Union (\u201cEU\u201d). The GDPR includes stringent operational requirements for processors and controllers of personal data and gave EU data protection authorities the power to impose significant sanctions for actual or alleged violations of the GDPR. Actual or alleged violations of the GDPR may also lead to damages claims by data controllers and data subjects.\n\u2022\nThe United Kingdom formally completed its withdrawal from the EU on January 31, 2020, in a process known as \u201cBrexit\u201d. The United Kingdom has enacted a Data Protection Act that substantially implemented the GDPR. However, Brexit has created uncertainty with regard to the future regulation of data protection in the United Kingdom and how data transfers to and from the United Kingdom will be regulated.\n\u2022\nOn July 16, 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union (\u201cECJ\u201d), invalidated the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield program on the grounds that Privacy Shield failed to offer adequate protections to EU personal data transferred to the U.S. While our use of the EU Standard Contractual Clauses (\u201cModel Clauses\u201d) provides an alternative to the Privacy Shield framework for authorized transfers of certain EU-U.S. data flows, the use of Model Clauses to protect data exports between the EU and the U.S. is itself subject to ongoing legal challenges, which may result in a ruling that these industry-standard measures that we, and other companies, have relied on would no longer be sufficient. Moreover, we may be unsuccessful in maintaining legitimate means for our transfer and receipt of personal data from the EU to the U.S.\nFor more information, see",
    "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nA description of the risks and uncertainties associated with our business and ownership of our common stock is set forth below. You should carefully consider the risks described below, as well as the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d The occurrence of any of the events or developments described below could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and growth prospects. In such an event, the market price of our common stock could decline. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations. This Annual Report on Form 10-K also contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors, including the risks described below. See \u201cCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nRisk Factor Summary\nBelow is a summary of the principal factors that make an investment in our common stock speculative or subject to risk. This summary does not address all of the risks facing our business. You should consider the risks in this summary together with the detailed discussion of risks that immediately follows this summary in this section titled \u201cRisk Factors,\u201d as well as the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\u2022\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and resulting global economic downturn, has impacted how we, our customers, and our partners are operating, and could result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\n\u2022\nWe have a limited history of operating at our current scale and under our current strategy, which makes it difficult to predict our future operating results, and we may not achieve our expected operating results in the future.\n\u2022\nOur recent revenue growth rates may not be indicative of our future performance or growth.\n\u2022\nWe have a history of net losses, we anticipate increasing our operating expenses in the future, and we do not expect to be profitable for the near future.\n\u2022\nOur quarterly results may fluctuate significantly and may not fully reflect the underlying performance of our business.\n\u2022\nWe have experienced rapid growth and expect to continue to invest in our growth in the future. If we fail to manage our growth effectively, we may be unable to execute our business plan, maintain high levels of service, or adequately address competitive challenges and our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\n\u2022\nWe derive substantially all of our revenue from a single software platform and if our platform fails to satisfy customer demands or to achieve widespread market acceptance it would adversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition, and growth prospects.\n\u2022\nIf we are unable to attract new customers, both domestically and internationally, the growth of our revenue will be adversely affected and our business may be harmed.\n\u2022\nOur business depends substantially on our customers renewing their subscriptions and expanding their use of our platform. If our customers do not renew their subscriptions, if they renew on less favorable terms, or if they fail to add more users in more functional areas or upgrade to a higher level of functionality on our platform, our business and operating results will be adversely affected.\n\u2022\nFailure to effectively expand our sales and marketing capabilities, including to hire and retain direct sales personnel, could harm our ability to increase our customer base and achieve broader market acceptance of our service.\n\u2022\nOur growth depends in part on the success of our strategic relationships with third parties and their continued performance.\n\u2022\nIf our customers and partners do not have access to highly skilled and trained users of our platform, our customers may not be able to unlock the full potential of our platform, customer satisfaction may suffer, and our results of operations, financial condition and growth prospects may be adversely affected.\n\u2022\nIf we fail to continue to enhance our platform, satisfy the cloud infrastructure priorities of our clients or adapt to rapid technological change, our ability to remain competitive could be impaired.\n\u2022\nIf we experience a security incident affecting our platform, networks, systems or data or the data of our customers, or are perceived to have experienced such a security incident, our platform may be perceived as not being secure, our reputation may be harmed, customers may reduce the use of or stop using our platform, we may incur significant liabilities, and our business could be materially adversely affected.\n\u2022\nReal or perceived errors, failures, bugs, service outages, or disruptions in our platform could adversely affect our reputation and harm our business.\n\u2022\nWe depend on the experience and expertise of our senior management team and certain key employees, especially engineering, research and development and sales personnel, and our inability to retain these executive officers and key employees or recruit them in a timely manner, could harm our business, operating results, and financial condition.\n\u2022\nThe markets in which we participate are intensely competitive, and if we do not compete effectively, our business and operating results could be adversely affected.\n\u2022\nBecause we collect, process and store personal information and furthermore, because our platform could be used by customers to do the same, evolving domestic and international privacy and security laws, regulations and other obligations could result in additional costs and liabilities to us or inhibit sales of our platform.\nIf we are unable to adequately address these and other risks we face, our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects may be adversely affected.\nOperational Risks\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and resulting global economic downturn, has impacted how we, our customers, and our partners are operating, and could result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to persist. Precautionary measures designed to prevent the spread of COVID-19, such as travel restrictions, shelter-in-place orders, and business shutdowns, remain in place in many of the regions in which we conduct business, and new or more restrictive measures have been and may continue to be adopted if the pandemic worsens. These factors have increased economic and financial market volatility and uncertainty. Although multiple vaccines to protect against COVID-19 have been approved for use by various governments, the production and distribution of such vaccines, and inoculation of a sufficient segment of the population to contain the pandemic, may require a significant amount of time and is subject to uncertainties including the ability of pharmaceutical companies to quickly increase vaccine production and the willingness of the general population to be\nvaccinated. As such, the duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic and the degree of its impact on our business remains uncertain and difficult to predict.\nAs a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we continue to operate in a modified manner employing precautionary measures designed to protect the health of our employees while enabling us to support our customers and partners. Among other modifications, we continue to require our employees to work remotely, to maintain business-related travel restrictions, and to virtualize, postpone or cancel our sales and marketing, employee or industry events. These modifications have and may continue to result in inefficiencies, delays and additional costs in our sales and marketing, professional services and research and development efforts, which could have an adverse effect on our operations. The remote work measures that we implemented have generally allowed us to provide uninterrupted service to our customers, but have affected the way we conduct our sales, research and development, testing, customer support, and other activities. While we have not observed significant impacts to the productivity of our workforce, working remotely poses additional operational challenges that may impact productivity in the future. Working remotely has made our employees more reliant on cloud-based communication services, and if those services are interrupted, or are less secure, employee productivity could be harmed. Our employees may also face unexpected child-care or other related family responsibilities while working from home that could impact productivity and employee retention. In addition, work-from-home and related business practice modifications present significant challenges to maintaining our corporate culture, including employee engagement, productivity and retention, both during the immediate pandemic crisis and as we make additional adjustments in the eventual transition from it. Our remote work measures may not be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, and illness and workforce disruptions could lead to unavailability of key personnel and harm our ability to perform critical functions. Even in regions where governmental restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic are eased, we may continue to face challenges as our employees return to our offices, including managing our office environments in a manner that protects the health and safety of our employees and planning for a potential resurgence of COVID-19, which could negatively impact our business.\nOur future growth is substantially dependent on our direct sales team and partners driving new customer acquisition and expanded use of our platform within existing customers. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, we held in-person sales, marketing, and industry events and our employees traveled frequently to establish and maintain relationships with our customers, prospective customers, and partners. Our business operations, including sales-related and customer support activities, could be increasingly adversely affected by continued or additional business closures, travel restrictions impacting employees and partners, virtualization of events, and other precautionary measures, especially in regions where we have material operations or sales. We may also experience negative impacts on our business if COVID-19 related governmental restrictions, or the easing or tightening of those restrictions, occurs at different rates in the markets in which we, our customers, or our partners operate, and as a result of the disparate restrictions we are unable to meet customer expectations. We may not be able to fully mitigate the impact of these disruptions which cannot be predicted or quantified at this time and which could negatively impact our business.\nThe pandemic and associated global economic uncertainty is also having an adverse impact on many of our customers, prospective customers and partners, which could result in reduced consumer demand and willingness to enter into or renew contracts with us, and ultimately could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. We have seen and may continue to see our customers and prospective customers deferring or delaying buying decisions and project implementations, prolonged sales cycles, and an increase in requests for extended payment terms due to uncertain economic conditions including those caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, the macroeconomic factors triggered by the pandemic have and could continue to result in decreased business spending by our customers and prospective customers, reduced demand for our solutions, longer sales cycles, lower renewal rates by our customers and increased competition, all of which could result in a material adverse impact on our business operations and financial condition even after the COVID-19 pandemic is contained and the shelter-in-place orders are lifted. If our customers are unable or unwilling to pay for their subscriptions to our platform, we may be adversely affected by an inability to collect amounts due, the cost of enforcing the terms of our contracts, including litigation, or a reduction in revenue. Further, if we experience a decrease in demand in a given period it could negatively affect our revenue in future\nperiods, particularly if experienced on a sustained basis, because a substantial proportion of revenue related to our platform is recognized over time. While we have developed and continue to develop plans to help mitigate the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, these efforts may not be effective and a protracted economic downturn may limit the effectiveness of our mitigation efforts.\nThe extent to which the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and associated global economic uncertainty, may impact our business will depend on future developments, including vaccine availability and distribution, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time. The COVID-19 pandemic may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section. We will continue to evaluate the nature and extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business.\nWe have a limited history of operating at our current scale and under our current strategy, which makes it difficult to predict our future operating results, and we may not achieve our expected operating results in the future.\nWhile we were originally formed as Anaplan, LLC in 2008 and first introduced our business planning platform in 2011, much of our growth has occurred in recent years. Over the last few years, we have substantially increased our headcount, shifted our sales strategy to increase our focus on driving the adoption and expansion of our platform by our customers and increased our reliance on partners to accelerate our sales process and provide implementation services, and invested in enhancing the features of our platform. As we have a limited history of operations at our current scale and under our current strategy, our ability to forecast our future operating results and plan for and model future growth is more limited than that of companies with longer operating histories and subject to a number of uncertainties, including those resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and the associated economic disruptions and market volatility. In addition, we have encountered and will encounter risks, uncertainties and challenges frequently experienced by growing companies in rapidly changing markets, such as the risks, uncertainties and challenges described this report. If our assumptions regarding these risks, uncertainties and challenges are incorrect or change, or if we do not execute on our strategy and manage these risks, uncertainties and challenges successfully, our operating results could differ materially from our expectations and those of securities analysts and investors, and our business could suffer and the trading price of our common stock could decline.\nOur recent revenue growth rates may not be indicative of our future performance or growth.\nFrom fiscal 2020 to fiscal 2021, our total revenue grew from $348.0 million to $447.8 million, an increase of 29%, and from fiscal 2019 to fiscal 2020, our total revenue grew from $240.6 million to $348.0 million, an increase of 45%. In future periods, we may not be able to sustain revenue growth consistent with recent history and/or that meets the expectations of securities analysts or investors. You should not consider our recent or historical revenue growth as indicative of our future performance or growth.\nWe have a history of net losses, we anticipate increasing our operating expenses in the future, and we do not expect to be profitable for the near future.\nWe have incurred significant losses in each period since inception, including net losses of $154.0 million, $149.2 million, and $131.0 million, respectively, in fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019. We had an accumulated deficit of $647.0 million at January 31, 2021. Our losses and accumulated deficit reflect the substantial investments we have made to acquire new customers and develop our platform. We expect our operating expenses to increase in the foreseeable future as we continue to make investments and implement initiatives designed to grow our business, including:\n\u2022\nexpanding our sales and marketing organization to increase our overall customer base, pursue larger transactions and expand sales within our current customer base;\n\u2022\nexpanding our offices and headcount internationally as we seek to continue to penetrate international markets, provided appropriate economic conditions and opportunities are present;\n\u2022\ninvesting in research and development to improve the capabilities, accessibility, features and functionality of our platform;\n\u2022\ngrowing our partner ecosystem;\n\u2022\nmaking additional investments to broaden and deepen our user community;\n\u2022\nexpanding our operations and infrastructure, both domestically and internationally, to support future growth; and\n\u2022\ninvesting in legal, accounting, human resources and other administrative functions necessary to support our operating as a public company.\nThese initiatives may prove more expensive than we currently anticipate, and we may not succeed in increasing our revenue, if at all, in an amount sufficient to offset these higher expenses and to achieve and sustain profitability. Growth of our revenue may slow or revenue may decline for a number of possible reasons, including a decrease in our ability to attract and retain customers, a failure to successfully implement our \u201cland and expand\u201d strategy, a failure to increase our number of partners, a decrease in the effectiveness of our partners, increasing competition, decreasing growth of our overall market, decreasing business spending by customers and prospective customers due to uncertain economic conditions including those caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, an increase in legal risk from the use of our products due to evolving laws, regulations or standards, an inability to timely and cost-effectively introduce new products and services that are favorably received by customers and partners, a security incident, or our failure, for any reason, to continue to capitalize on growth opportunities. Further, we have entered into non-cancelable multi-year purchase commitments with respect to cloud partnership services with third-party public cloud partners, which require us to pay for such services irrespective of actual usage and may not be offset by increased revenue if we are unable to use these partnerships to attract new customers. To the extent we are successful in increasing our customer base, we will also initially incur increased losses because costs associated with acquiring customers are generally incurred up front. In contrast, subscription revenue is generally recognized ratably over the terms of the agreements that last typically two to three years, although some customers commit for shorter periods. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that we will achieve or maintain profitability in the future. Furthermore, any failure to achieve or maintain profitability, or the failure to do so on the timeline expected by investors or securities analysts, could adversely affect the value of our common stock.\nOur quarterly results may fluctuate significantly and may not fully reflect the underlying performance of our business.\nOur quarterly results of operations, our key metrics discussed elsewhere in this report, including the levels of our revenue, gross margin, cash flow, remaining performance obligations and deferred revenue, as well as other metrics that analysts use to evaluate our business such as billings and dollar-based net expansion rate, have fluctuated in the past and may vary significantly in the future. Quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our operating results and other key metrics may not be meaningful. Accordingly, the results of any one quarter should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. Our quarterly financial results and metrics may fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control and may not fully reflect the underlying performance of our business. These fluctuations could result in our failure to meet our expectations or those of securities analysts or investors. If we fail to meet these expectations for any particular period, the trading price of our common stock could decline significantly. Factors that may cause these quarterly fluctuations include, without limitation, those listed below:\n\u2022\nthe impact of an economic downturn or market volatility, including the current downturn caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, on the price of our common stock, our business and the businesses of our customers, prospective customers and partners;\n\u2022\nour ability to attract new customers;\n\u2022\nour customer renewal and adoption rates, and our ability to expand use of our platform by existing customers;\n\u2022\nthe timing and rate at which we sign agreements with customers, including the impact of cost reduction measures, delayed purchasing decisions or prolonged sales cycles at prospective or existing customers as a result of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022\nthe contract value of agreements with customers;\n\u2022\nthe addition or loss of large customers, including through acquisitions or consolidations;\n\u2022\nthe timing of recognition of revenue;\n\u2022\nthe amount and timing of operating expenses;\n\u2022\nthe amount and timing of completion of professional services engagements;\n\u2022\nour ability to hire, train and retain sales personnel, and their productivity rate including, any impact to productivity due to governmental restrictions adopted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022\nchanges in our pricing policies or those of our competitors;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates and changes in the proportion of our revenue and expenses denominated in foreign currencies;\n\u2022\nseasonal variations in sales of our software subscriptions, which have historically been highest in the fourth quarter of a calendar year but may vary in future quarters;\n\u2022\nthe timing and success of new product features, updates, and enhancements by us or our competitors or any other change in the competitive dynamics of our industry, including consolidation among competitors, customers, or strategic partners;\n\u2022\nthe financial condition and creditworthiness of our customers, including greater unpredictability in our customers\u2019 willingness or ability to timely pay for subscriptions to our platform as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022\nthe timing of expenses related to the development or possible acquisition and integration of technologies or businesses and potential future charges for impairment of goodwill and long-lived assets from acquired companies;\n\u2022\nour ability to achieve and sustain a level of liquidity sufficient to grow and support our business and operations;\n\u2022\nnetwork outages, technical difficulties or interruptions affecting the delivery and use of our platform or actual or perceived security breaches;\n\u2022\nany adverse litigation, judgments, settlements, or other litigation-related costs;\n\u2022\nchanges in the legislative or regulatory environment;\n\u2022\nnon-cancelable multi-year purchase commitments with third-party partners which require us to pay for services irrespective of actual usage;\n\u2022\nthe effects of global pandemics, such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic, industry, market and geopolitical conditions and uncertainty, both domestically and internationally.\nWe have experienced rapid growth and expect to continue to invest in our growth in the future. If we fail to manage our growth effectively, we may be unable to execute our business plan, maintain high levels of service, or adequately address competitive challenges and our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nWe have experienced a period of rapid growth in our headcount and operations in the United States and internationally. We have also significantly increased the size of our customer base and our partner ecosystem. We sell our platform to customers across the globe and have operations in North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific and Israel. We anticipate that we will continue to expand our domestic and international operations and headcount in the future, provided appropriate economic conditions and opportunities are present.\nThis growth has placed, and future growth will place, a significant strain on our management, and administrative, operational, and financial infrastructure. Our success will depend in part on our ability to manage this growth effectively and execute our business plan. To manage the expected growth of our operations and personnel, we must effectively recruit, motivate, integrate and retain employees in a manner consistent with, and that preserves, our corporate culture. We will also need to continue to develop our physical and remote work infrastructure to support our business growth, promote our\nworkers\u2019 safety, and enable our global workforce to effectively and securely communicate with each other, our partners and customers. As our customer base grows, we will need to maintain a high level of customer satisfaction by providing high quality customer support, consistency across deployments of our platform, and access to ongoing training. As we grow and our organizational structure becomes more complex, we will need to continue to improve our operational, financial, reporting, compliance, information technology and management systems, controls and procedures, and our risk management activities related to the activities of our customers and partners. For the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, we will also need to monitor and respond to various and constantly changing local regulations, restrictions and requirements that could impact our operations, personnel and systems, controls and procedures.\nThese and other improvements in our operations, personnel and systems, controls and procedures will require significant capital expenditures and the allocation of valuable management and employee resources. Failure to effectively manage growth or execute our business plan could result in difficulty or delays in increasing the size of our customer base, declines in quality of customer support or customer satisfaction, increases in costs and expenses, failures to make timely and accurate reports of our operations and financial results, which would escalate the risk of noncompliance with applicable policies or laws, difficulties in introducing new features or other operational difficulties, harm to our reputation and brand. Any of these developments could adversely affect our business performance, results of operations and financial position.\nWe derive substantially all of our revenue from a single software platform and if our platform fails to satisfy customer demands or to achieve widespread market acceptance it would adversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition, and growth prospects.\nWe derive and expect to continue to derive substantially all of our revenue from our cloud-based enterprise planning software platform. As such, market acceptance of our platform is critical to our continued success. Demand for our platform is affected by a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control. These factors include continued market acceptance of our platform for existing and new use cases, the introduction of enhancements to our platform that are well received by existing and prospective customers, the pace at which existing customers realize benefits from the use of our platform and its features and decide to expand deployment of our platform across their business, the extent to which our customers involve a wider group of employees in planning, the timing of development and release of new products by our competitors, technological change, the perception of ease of use, reliability and security of our platform, the pace at which enterprises engage in digital transformation initiatives, the success of our strategic partners, and developments in data privacy regulations. In addition, we expect that the planning and integration needs of our customers will continue to rapidly change and increase in complexity. We will need to improve the functionality, ease of use, and performance of our platform continually to meet those rapidly changing, complex demands. If we are unable to continue to meet customer demands or to achieve widespread market acceptance of our platform, our business operations, financial results, and growth prospects will be materially and adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to attract new customers, both domestically and internationally, the growth of our revenue will be adversely affected and our business may be harmed.\nOur ability to achieve significant growth in revenue and improvement in other key metrics in the future will depend, in large part, upon the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts, both domestically and internationally, and our ability to attract new customers. This may be particularly challenging where an organization has already invested substantial personnel and financial resources to integrate traditional strategic planning and management solutions into its business, as such organization may be reluctant or unwilling to invest in new products and services. Furthermore, as our industry matures or if competitors introduce lower cost and/or differentiated products or services that are perceived to compete with ours, our ability to sell to new customers based on factors such as pricing, technology, and functionality could be impaired. Additionally, mitigation and containment measures adopted by government authorities to contain the spread of COVID-19 in the U.S. and abroad, including travel restrictions and other requirements that limit in-person meetings, could limit our ability to establish relationships with new customers. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the related global economic uncertainty, including decreased spending by prospective customers, delays in the implementation of digital transformation initiatives and prolonged sales cycles have disrupted the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts, and the duration and scope of this disruption remains unclear. As a result, we may be unable to attract new customers at rates or on terms that would be favorable or comparable to prior periods, and our business, revenue, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nOur business depends substantially on our customers renewing their subscriptions and expanding their use of our platform. If our customers do not renew their subscriptions, if they renew on less favorable terms, or if they fail to add more users in more functional areas or upgrade to a higher level of functionality on our platform, our business and operating results will be adversely affected.\nIn order for us to maintain or improve our operating results, it is important that our customers renew their subscriptions when the contract term expires, add additional authorized users to their subscriptions, and upgrade to a higher level of functionality on the platform. Our customers generally enter into agreements with two- to three-year subscription terms and have no obligation to renew their subscriptions after the expiration of their initial subscription period. Our customers may decide not to renew their subscriptions with a similar contract period, at the same prices or terms or with the same or a greater number of authorized users or level of functionality as a result of a number of factors including uncertain economic conditions due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Some of our customers have elected not to renew their agreements with us, and we may not be able to accurately predict renewal rates. Our customer retention may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including our customers\u2019 satisfaction with our platform and features, the quality of the professional services provided by us or our partners, our prices, the features and pricing of competing products, reductions in our customers\u2019 spending levels, customer adoption and expanded use of our platform, mergers and acquisitions involving our customers and deteriorating general economic conditions.\nIn addition, our growth strategy is a \u201cland-and-expand\u201d strategy that depends in substantial part on our customers expanding the use of our platform in their organizations through use by additional users, use across more functional areas of their organization, including finance, sales, supply chain, marketing, human resources, and operations, and the purchase of subscriptions providing additional features and functionality, such as the mobile app and predictive capabilities of our platform for sales and marketing. We refer to our \u201cland and expand\u201d strategy as the Honeycomb\u2122 effect where our platform\u2019s agility enables additional use cases across business functions. To increase the opportunities for further expanding the use of our platform by existing customers, we will need to introduce new features and functionality to our platform to more comprehensively address the needs of customers deploying our platform to address a wider variety of use cases and to support large, complex models. We will also need to drive user adoption rates of our platform. If our customers do not realize benefits through their initial adoption of our platform, or if they do not believe that they will realize additional benefits through broader deployment of our platform in other functional areas of their organizations, or in other uses cases, our ability to increase our revenue will suffer. Achieving incremental sales to our current customer base requires increasingly sophisticated and costly sales efforts that are targeted at senior management. If we are not able to attract the attention of our customers\u2019 senior management or to do so in a cost-effective manner, our sales efforts may not be effective and our ability to increase our revenue will suffer. We have seen and may continue to see prolonged sales cycles and other sales disruptions arising as a result of a number of factors including uncertain economic conditions due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The duration and scope of these disruptions on our \u201cland and expand\u201d strategy remains unclear.\nIf our customers do not renew their subscriptions, if they renew on less favorable terms, or if they fail to add more users in more functional areas or upgrade to a higher level of functionality on our platform, our business and operating results as well as certain metrics that may be used to evaluate our business such as billings and dollar-based net expansion rate will be adversely affected.\nFailure to effectively expand our sales and marketing capabilities, including to hire and retain direct sales personnel, could harm our ability to increase our customer base and achieve broader market acceptance of our service.\nOur ability to increase our customer base, achieve broader market acceptance of our platform, grow our revenue, and achieve and sustain profitability will depend, to a significant extent, on our ability to effectively expand our sales and marketing operations and activities, specifically our direct sales efforts targeted at executives of customers with the most complex planning needs. As we are substantially dependent on our direct sales force to obtain new customers and expand usage of our platform within existing customers, our ability to execute on our sales and marketing strategy will depend, in large part, on our success in recruiting, training, incentivizing and retaining a sufficient number of qualified direct sales personnel and on such personnel attaining desired productivity levels within a reasonable amount of time. In recent years, we have increased the size of our direct sales force, and accordingly many of the new members of our sales force have not yet become fully productive. While remote work restrictions remain in place, newly hired direct sales personnel may need additional time to become fully productive\nas they may face additional hurdles due to remote onboarding and more limited access to customers. We plan to continue to expand our direct sales force both domestically and internationally but we may not be able to recruit and hire a sufficient number of sales personnel to successfully execute our hiring strategy, which may adversely affect our ability to expand our sales capabilities. New hires require significant training and time before they achieve full productivity, particularly in new sales territories. Our recent hires and planned hires may not become as productive as quickly as we would like, and we may be unable to hire or retain sufficient numbers of qualified individuals in the future in the markets where we do business. Furthermore, hiring sales personnel in new countries can be costly, complex, and time-consuming, and requires additional set up and upfront costs that may be disproportionate to the initial revenue that we expect to receive from those countries. We believe that there is significant competition for direct sales personnel with the sales skills and technical knowledge that we require. Attrition rates may increase, and we may face integration challenges as we continue to seek to expand our sales force. Moreover, we do not have significant experience as an organization developing and implementing overseas marketing campaigns, and such campaigns may be expensive and difficult to implement. Our business will be harmed if our continuing investment in increasing our sales and marketing capabilities does not generate a significant increase in revenue. Our sales and marketing expenses represent a significant percentage of our expenses, and our operating results will suffer if our sales and marketing expenditures do not contribute to increasing revenue as we anticipate.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has changed the way we interact with our customers and prospective customers. We have, and may continue to, alter, postpone or cancel planned customer, employee and industry events or shift them to a virtual only format. Our operating results may also suffer if sales and marketing personnel are unable to maintain the same level of productivity while working remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic. These and other changes in the ways in which we interact with and market to our customers and prospective customers could adversely impact our business if they prove to be less effective than in-person events.\nOur growth depends in part on the success of our strategic relationships with third parties and their continued performance.\nWe have established strategic relationships with global strategic consulting firms, global systems integrators, regional consulting firms, implementation partners, public cloud partners and technology partners. We intend for these parties, as members of our partner ecosystem, to contribute to our growth by, among other things, extending the coverage and enhancing the expertise of our professional services, expanding the reach of our platform, and accelerating the usage and adoption of our platform. Partners can also exercise a significant role in revenue generation, by referring opportunities to us, enhancing the effectiveness of our sales efforts by establishing connections with senior management at prospective customers and/or promoting the use of our platform as a key component of digital transformation projects that the partner is implementing with their own customers. In order to grow our business, we anticipate that we will need to broaden and deepen our partner ecosystem by continuing to establish and maintain relationships with such third parties. Identifying partners, and negotiating and documenting relationships with them, requires significant time and resources. If we are not able to successfully operationalize our partnerships, we may not be able to generate growth sufficient to meet our contractual commitments, which could adversely affect our revenue, gross margin, profitability, financial position, and cash flow. Our partners may conclude that they are not receiving sufficient benefits, economic or otherwise, from their relationships with us, resulting in a reduction or termination of their involvement in our partner ecosystem. Our partners may have relationships with our competitors or experience with their products or services and such relationships or experience may result in our partners recommending our competitors\u2019 products or services over ours. Furthermore, our competitors may be effective in providing incentives to our partners to favor their products or services or to prevent or reduce subscriptions to our services. In addition, acquisitions of our partners by our competitors could result in a decrease in the number of our current and potential customers, as our partners may no longer facilitate the adoption of our platform by potential customers. Uncertain economic conditions, including those caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, have and may continue to have an adverse impact on the business operations of our existing partners and on our ability to attract and retain new partners, which could result in reduced demand generation and ultimately could disrupt our business operations with a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nIf we are unsuccessful in establishing or maintaining our relationships with third parties, or our partners fail to perform or are unable to perform (including due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic), our ability to compete in the marketplace or to grow our revenue could be impaired, we could incur increased operating expenses and our operating results may suffer. Even if we are successful, we cannot assure you that these relationships will result in increased customer adoption or usage of our platform or increased revenue.\nIf our customers and partners do not have access to highly skilled and trained users of our platform, our customers may not be able to unlock the full potential of our platform, customer satisfaction may suffer, and our results of operations, financial condition and growth prospects may be adversely affected.\nIn order for our customers to unlock the full potential of our platform, both our customers and partners need access to highly skilled and trained users of our platform, such as Master Anaplanners. Implementations of our platform may be technically complicated because our platform is designed to be deployed in a wide range of technological environments and integrates data from a broad and complex range of workflows and systems. In order for our customers to successfully implement our platform, they need access to highly skilled users that are familiar with their operating environment and with our platform. Further, our partners rely heavily on highly skilled and trained users of our platform to effectively provide implementation, training and consulting services to our customers. Incorrect or improper implementation or use of our platform could result in customer dissatisfaction and harm our business and financial condition. If our customers are unable to implement our platform, perceptions of our company and our platform may be impaired, our reputation and brand may suffer, and customers may choose not to renew their subscriptions or increase their purchases of our related services. Our \u201cland and expand\u201d growth strategy depends in large part on existing customers adding new users and use cases, and expanding to additional lines of business, divisions, and geographies. We have found that this strategy is most successful when internal users quickly adopt our platform and build out their expertise as informed end users of our platform. Our partners\u2019 trained users also develop new solutions on our platform and promote and facilitate adoption of our platform at our customers. If our customers and partners do not have access to highly skilled and trained users of our platform, implementation and adoption of our\nplatform may not be effective, customer satisfaction may suffer, and our results of operations, financial condition and growth prospects may be adversely affected.\nWe need to continue to develop a steady pipeline of highly qualified and trained personnel to meet customer and partner demand, but our efforts may be ineffective. While we continue to expand our training resources for trained users of our platform, we increasingly rely on our customers and partners to encourage their users to enhance their Anaplan expertise using our training resources. If our customers and partner do not encourage enough internal users to become highly skilled users of our platform, there may not be enough trained users of our platform to meet demand. If a customer has not developed an internal cohort of trained users of our platform, the loss of a trained user could have an adverse impact on their ability to unlock the value of our platform and ability to expand the platform\u2019s use within the organization. Further, the courses we offer on the Anaplan Academy, Anaplan\u2019s online training portal providing a full range of training courses on our platform, may not serve their intended purpose or the certification programs we offer may take longer than anticipated to create a robust and consistent pipeline of talent. Our customers and partners need regular training to support disparate technologies involved in large-scale deployments and maximize potential of our platform as technology changes without which our results of operations and growth prospects could be materially adversely affected. Our ability to effectively educate and train users of our platform may be negatively impacted if our customer support employees or the users of our customers or partners are unable to receive training virtually while COVID-19 restrictions remain in place or the virtual training is not as effective as in-person training methods. If we fail to develop and maintain a sufficient pipeline of qualified and trained users of our platform for utilization with our customers and partners, we may suffer adverse consequences including professional services not being furnished correctly, incorrect or improper use of our platform by partners and customers, damage to our reputation and brand, and customers choosing not to renew their subscriptions or expand their use of our platform. Any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business, financial position and growth prospects.\nIf customers are not satisfied with the implementation services provided by us or our partners, our business could be adversely affected.\nOur business depends on the professional services that are performed to help our customers implement and use our platform. Professional services may be performed by our own staff, by a third-party partner or by a combination of the two. Our strategy is to work with partners to increase the breadth of capability and depth of capacity for delivery of these services to our customers, and we expect the number of our partner-led implementations to continue to increase over time. Our ability and the ability of our third-party partners to successfully implement services may be negatively impacted by remote work environments and travel restrictions adopted as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. In response to the travel restrictions and other measures enacted in connection with COVID-19, professional services, including implementation projects that were previously performed at a customer location are now provided virtually. However, virtual provision of services may not be as effective or deliver the same benefits as services performed on-site. If a customer is not satisfied with the quality of work performed by us or a partner or with the type of professional services or functionality delivered, even if we are not contractually responsible for the partner services, then we could incur additional costs to address the situation, the profitability of that work might be impaired and the customer\u2019s dissatisfaction with our or our partner\u2019s services could damage our ability to expand the scope of functionality subscribed to by that customer. In addition, negative publicity related to our customer relationships, regardless of its accuracy, may further damage our business by affecting our ability to compete for new business with current and prospective customers.\nIf we fail to continue to enhance our platform, satisfy the cloud infrastructure priorities of our clients or adapt to rapid technological change, our ability to remain competitive could be impaired.\nThe industry in which we compete is characterized by rapid technological change, frequent introductions of new products, and evolving industry standards. Our ability to attract new customers and increase revenue from existing customers will depend on a number of factors including: our ability to anticipate industry standards and trends, to continue to enhance our platform and introduce new functionality in a timely manner, to update and expand our infrastructure, and to keep pace with technological developments. The success of any enhancement, new functionality, or infrastructure development depends on several factors, including timely completion and market acceptance. Any new enhancement, functionality, or infrastructure development might not be introduced in a timely or cost-effective manner and might not achieve the broad market acceptance necessary to generate significant revenue. If any of our competitors implements new technologies before we are able to implement them or if our competitors are able to respond more quickly and effectively to new or changing opportunities, those competitors may be able to provide more effective products than ours at lower prices.\nWe have experienced, and may in the future experience, delays in the planned release dates of enhancements to our platform. Delays could result in adverse publicity, loss of sales, delay in market acceptance of our platform, any of which could cause us to lose existing customers or impair our ability to attract new customers. In addition, the introduction of new products and services by competitors or the development of entirely new technologies to replace existing offerings could make our platform obsolete or adversely affect our ability to compete. Any delay or failure in the introduction of enhancements, functionality, or infrastructure developments could harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nOur platform must also integrate with a variety of third-party technologies, and we need to continuously modify and enhance our platform to adapt to changes in cloud-enabled hardware, software, networking, browser, and database technologies. Any undetected errors or defects in this third-party software, or cybersecurity threats or attacks related to such software, could impair the functionality of our platform, result in increased costs, and injure our reputation. Any failure of our platform to operate effectively with existing or future technologies, or any failure of a third-party cloud infrastructure partner to support one or more of the features of our platform, could cause customer dissatisfaction and reduce the demand for our platform, resulting in harm to our business. Further, the emergence of new industry standards related to strategic planning and operational execution products and services may adversely affect the demand for our platform. In addition, because our platform is cloud-based, we need to continually enhance and improve our platform to keep pace with changes in Internet-related hardware, software, communications, and database technologies and standards. Any failure of our platform to operate effectively with future hardware or software technologies, or to comply with new industry standards, could reduce the demand for our platform and harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe invest significantly in research and development, and to the extent our research and development investments are not directed efficiently or do not result in material enhancements to our platform, our business and results of operations would be harmed.\nA key element of our strategy is to invest significantly in our research and development efforts to enhance the features, functionality, performance, and ease of use of our platform to address additional applications and use cases that will broaden the appeal of our platform and facilitate the broad use of our platform across customers with complex planning needs. If we do not spend our research and development budget efficiently or effectively on compelling enhancements, innovations and technologies, such as public cloud functionality, predictive analytics and machine learning, our business may be harmed and we may not realize the expected benefits of our strategy. We will need to appropriately deploy our human resources, and may need to hire new employees with highly technical skills who are often in high demand, or we may not be able to effectively execute on our research and development strategy. Our ability to conduct research and development activities as planned may also be negatively impacted by our remote work environment adopted as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, research and development projects can be technically challenging and expensive. As a result of the nature of research and development cycles, there will be delays between the time we incur expenses associated with research and development activities and the time we are able to offer compelling enhancements to our platform and generate revenue, if any, from those activities. Additionally, anticipated customer demand for a platform enhancement we are developing could decrease after the development\ncycle has commenced. If we expend a significant amount of resources on research and development efforts that do not lead to the successful introduction of functionality or platform improvements that are competitive in our current or future markets our business and results of operations will suffer.\nIf we experience a security incident affecting our platform, networks, systems or data or the data of our customers, or are perceived to have experienced such a security incident, our platform may be perceived as not being secure, our reputation may be harmed, customers may reduce the use of or stop using our platform, we may incur significant liabilities, and our business could be materially adversely affected.\nOur platform involves the storage, transmission and processing of our customers\u2019 sensitive proprietary information, including their business and financial data. We also use third-party service providers to deliver services to our customers and employees, and those providers may store or process the personal or confidential information of our customers or employees. Security incidents have become more prevalent across industries and our platform, systems, networks or the systems or networks of our third-party service providers may become the subject of such an incident. These security incidents may be caused by the intentional acts of third-party actors, or may arise from failures or defects in our or our partners\u2019 software, systems or controls.\nWhile we have many security measures in place designed to protect customer and other sensitive information and the integrity of our information technology systems and prevent data loss and other security breaches, our security measures or those of our third party service providers may not be sufficiently broad in scope to protect all relevant information, may be deployed incorrectly, may not be adequately monitored or supported due to insufficient personnel or resources, may not function as planned, or could be breached as a result of third-party action, human error, technical malfunction, malfeasance, or otherwise. As we do not control our third-party service providers, or have real-time visibility of their security measures, we cannot ensure the integrity or sufficiency of their security measures and hackers or other third parties may successfully breach our systems by exploiting a vulnerability in third-party software or applications that are utilized by, or have access to, our systems. Third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce our employees, contractors, or users into disclosing sensitive information such as user names, passwords or other information or otherwise compromise the security of our platform, systems or networks in order to breach our security measures and gain unauthorized access to our data or our customers\u2019 data. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently, become more complex over time or may be designed to remain dormant until a predetermined event and often are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement sufficient preventative measures to defend against these techniques. Further, once a security incident is identified, we may be unable to remediate or otherwise respond to such incident in a timely manner. Our users may also disclose or lose control of their passwords, or use the same or similar passwords on third parties\u2019 systems, which could lead to unauthorized access to their accounts on our platform. Further, we may face additional cybersecurity risks related to our employees and partners working remotely during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and potentially beyond as remote work becomes more commonplace.\nA security incident may result in unauthorized access, use, loss, modification or disclosure of our or our customers\u2019 sensitive information, or denial or degradation of service, which could seriously harm our or our customers\u2019 businesses and reputations. Any security incidents, whether real or perceived, could result in the expenditure of significant resources to analyze, correct, eliminate, or remediate errors or vulnerabilities, negatively affect our ability to attract new customers or partners, cause existing partners to end their relationship with us and existing customers to reduce the use of our platform or elect to not renew their subscriptions, expose us to reputational damage, subject us to contractual liability, third-party lawsuits, regulatory inquiries or fines, or other action or liability, which could adversely affect our operating results. We cannot assure you that any limitations of liability provisions in our contracts for a security breach or incident would be enforceable or adequate or would otherwise protect us from any liabilities or damages with respect to any particular claim. While we maintain insurance, our insurance coverage related to security and privacy damages may not be adequate for liabilities actually incurred and we cannot be certain that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all, or that any insurer will not deny coverage of a future claim. These risks are likely to increase as our brand becomes more widely known and recognized, governments enact increasingly strict regulations regarding data security and privacy, we continue to grow the scale and functionality of our platform and\nprocess, store, and transmit increasingly large amounts of our customers\u2019 information and data, which may include proprietary or confidential data or personal or identifying information.\nWe may also experience disruptions, outages, and other performance problems on our systems due to service attacks, unauthorized access, or other security-related incidents. For example, third parties may conduct attacks designed to temporarily deny customers access to our services. Any successful denial of service attack could result in a loss of customer confidence in the security of our platform and damage to our brand.\nReal or perceived errors, failures, bugs, service outages, or disruptions in our platform could adversely affect our reputation and harm our business.\nOur platform is complex, has contained defects and errors and may continue to contain undetected defects or errors. We are continuing to evolve the features and functionality of our platform through updates and enhancements, and as we do so, we may introduce additional defects or errors that may not be detected until after deployment by our customers. In addition, if our platform is not implemented or used correctly or as intended, inadequate performance and disruptions in service may result. Our platform is often used in connection with large scale computing environments which may expose errors, failures, or vulnerabilities in our platform or integrations. Moreover, we have acquired and may in the future acquire companies or integrate into our platform technologies developed by third parties and we may encounter difficulty in incorporating the newly-obtained technologies into our platform or maintaining the quality standards that are consistent with our reputation, and furthermore, we may face technological incompatibilities with the newly-acquired intellectual property. In addition, while we seek to maintain sufficient excess capacity in our operations infrastructure to meet the needs of all of our customers, we have experienced, and may in the future experience, disruptions, outages, and other performance problems.\nSince our customers use our platform for important aspects of their business, any actual or perceived errors, defects, disruptions in service, outages, or other performance problems could damage our customers\u2019 businesses. Any defects or errors in our platform and solutions, or the perception of such defects or errors, or other performance problems could result in any of the following, each of which could adversely affect our business and results of operations:\n\u2022\nexpenditure of significant financial and product development resources in efforts to analyze, correct, eliminate or work around errors or defects;\n\u2022\nloss of existing or potential customers or partners;\n\u2022\ninterruptions or delays in sales of our platform;\n\u2022\ndelayed or lost revenue;\n\u2022\ndelay or failure to attain market acceptance;\n\u2022\ndelay in the development or release of new functionality or improvements to our platform;\n\u2022\nnegative publicity, which could harm our reputation;\n\u2022\nsales credits or refunds for prepaid amounts related to unused subscription services;\n\u2022\ndiversion of development and customer service resources;\n\u2022\nbreach of warranty claims against us, which could result in an increase in our provision for doubtful accounts; and\n\u2022\nan increase in collection cycles for accounts receivable or the expense and risk of litigation.\nAlthough we have contractual protections, such as warranty disclaimers and limitation of liability provisions, in our standard terms and conditions of sale, they may not fully or effectively protect us from claims by customers, partners or other third parties. Any insurance coverage we may have may not adequately cover all claims asserted against us, or cover only a portion of such claims. A successful product liability, warranty, or other similar claim against us could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. In addition, even claims that ultimately are unsuccessful could result in our expenditure of funds in litigation and divert management\u2019s time and other resources.\nWe depend on computing infrastructure operated by third parties, and any delays in service or disruption in these operations or an inability to increase capacity could impair the use or functionality of our platform, harm our business, and subject us to liability.\nWe currently serve our customers from third-party data center facilities operated by Equinix, Inc. located in the United States, the Netherlands, and Germany. We are also developing our platform on the infrastructure of certain third-party public cloud partners in order to increase the accessibility and reach of our platform. If we are unable to renew our cloud infrastructure agreements on commercially reasonable terms, we may be required to transfer our servers and other infrastructure, and we may incur significant costs and experience possible service interruptions in connection with doing so.\nAlthough we have disaster recovery plans in place, we may experience interruptions, delays and outages in service and availability from time-to-time arising from problems with our third-party data center or cloud partner infrastructure including technical failures, power loss or telecommunications failures or capacity issues, natural disasters, security incidents, and other events beyond our control which could negatively affect the use, functionality or availability of our platform and harm our reputation, damage our customers\u2019 businesses, and adversely affect our business. In addition, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic may have an adverse operational impact on our data center and public cloud infrastructure partners, as they navigate restrictions, health and safety regulations and other impacts from the pandemic. Furthermore, in the event of interruption or delay in service, our insurance coverage may not adequately compensate us for any losses that we may incur.\nIn addition, as we continue to increase the number of customers and users on our platform, we will need to increase the capacity of our cloud infrastructure, including internationally. If we do not increase our capacity in a timely manner, customers could experience interruptions or delays in access to our platform, and we may not be able to attract potential customers in specific regions of the world unless we provide localized offerings in those regions. As we continue to increase our cloud capacity, we may move or transfer our data and our customers\u2019 data. Despite precautions taken during this process, any unsuccessful data transfers may impair the use or functionality of our platform. Any damage to, or failure of, our systems, or those of our third-party data center or public cloud infrastructure partners, could interrupt our service and hinder the use or functionality of our platform. Impairment of or interruptions in our service may reduce our revenue, cause us to issue credits or pay penalties, subject us to claims and litigation, cause our customers to terminate their subscriptions, and adversely affect our renewal rates and our ability to attract new customers. Our business will also be harmed if our customers and potential customers believe our platform is unreliable.\nAny failure to offer high-quality technical support services may adversely affect our relationships with our customers and our financial results.\nOnce our platform is implemented, our customers depend on our support organization to resolve technical issues or perceived technical issues relating to the platform. We may be unable to respond quickly enough to accommodate short-term increases in customer demand for support services. We also may be unable to modify the format of our support services to compete with changes in support services provided by our competitors. Our ability to provide support services may also be negatively impacted by our remote work environment adopted as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Increased customer demand for these services, without corresponding revenue, could increase costs and adversely affect our operating results. In addition, our sales process is highly dependent on our business reputation and on positive recommendations from our existing customers. Any failure to maintain high-quality technical support, or a market perception that we do not maintain high-quality support, could adversely affect our reputation, our ability to sell subscriptions to our platform to existing and prospective customers and our business, operating results, and financial position.\nIf we fail to develop, maintain, and enhance widespread brand awareness in a cost-effective manner or if we receive negative publicity, our revenue and competitive position may be materially and adversely affected.\nWe believe that developing, maintaining, and enhancing widespread awareness of our brand and our platform solutions that enable Connected Planning and digital transformation in a cost-effective manner is critical to achieving widespread acceptance of our platform, attracting new customers, and maintaining existing customers. For example, widespread awareness of our brand is critical to ensuring that we are invited to participate in requests for proposals from prospective customers. We have made, and will continue to make, significant investments to promote our brand. However, brand promotion activities may not generate customer awareness or increase revenue, and, even if they do, any increase in revenue may not offset the expenses we incur in building our brand. Furthermore, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has made it more challenging to develop, maintain and enhance widespread awareness of our brand. Numerous marketing and brand promotion events, held in-person with customers and prospective customers in prior years, have been delayed, cancelled or converted into a virtual format. Virtual events may not be as successful as in-person interactions, and the precautions and safety measures that have been adopted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly if extended for prolonged periods, could have a detrimental effect on our ability to develop, maintain and enhance widespread awareness of our brand. If we fail to successfully promote and maintain our brand, or incur\nsubstantial expenses, we may fail to attract or retain customers necessary to realize a sufficient return on our brand-building efforts or to achieve the widespread brand awareness that is critical for broad customer adoption of our platform. We believe that the importance of our brand and reputation will increase as competition in our market further intensifies.\nNegative publicity, whether or not justified, relating to our company, our platform, or events or activities attributed to us, our employees, our partners or others associated with any of these parties, may tarnish our reputation and reduce the value of our brand. Independent industry analysts often provide reviews of our platform, as well as the products and services of our competitors, and perception of our platform in the marketplace may be significantly influenced by these reviews. If these reviews are negative, or less positive as compared to those of our competitors\u2019 products and services, our brand may be adversely affected. Additionally, the performance of our partners may affect our brand and reputation if customers do not have a positive experience with our partners\u2019 services. Damage to our reputation and loss of brand equity may reduce demand for our platform and have an adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. Moreover, any attempts to rebuild our reputation and restore the value of our brands may be costly and time consuming, and such efforts may not ultimately be successful. The upfront investment and costs incurred to build and maintain our brand, both domestically and internationally, may not generate increased market acceptance and may negatively impact our results of operations.\nBecause our platform is sold to enterprises with complex operating environments, we can encounter long and unpredictable sales cycles, which could adversely affect our operating results in a given period.\nOur ability to increase revenue and achieve profitability depends, in large part, on widespread adoption of our platform by customers with complex operating environments who tend to make larger purchases of our products. As we target our sales efforts at these customers, we face greater costs, longer sales cycles and less predictability in completing some of our sales. Further, we have experienced and we expect to experience prolonged sales cycles as a result of uncertain economic conditions including those caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result of the variability and length of the sales cycle, we have only a limited ability to forecast the timing of sales. A delay in or failure to complete large sales to one or more enterprise customers could harm our business and financial results, and could cause our financial results to vary significantly from period to period. Our sales cycle varies widely, reflecting differences in potential customers\u2019 decision-making processes, procurement requirements, and budget cycles, and is subject to significant risks over which we have little or no control, including:\n\u2022\ncustomers\u2019 budgetary constraints and priorities;\n\u2022\nthe timing of customers\u2019 budget cycles;\n\u2022\nthe need by some customers for lengthy evaluations;\n\u2022\nannouncements of new products, features, or functionality by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nexternal factors such as economic uncertainty (including due to the COVID-19 pandemic); and\n\u2022\nthe length and timing of customers\u2019 approval processes and disruptions to their approval process arising from disruptions in operations due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nA customer\u2019s decision to use our platform may be an enterprise-wide decision, requiring us to expend substantial time, effort, and money educating customers as to the use and value of our platform and encouraging widespread adoption of our platform by users. In addition, our ability to successfully sell our platform to customers with complex planning needs is dependent on us attracting and retaining sales personnel with experience in selling to these customers. Moreover, our target customers may prefer to purchase software that is critical to their business from one of our larger, more established competitors. Our typical sales cycles can range from three to nine months, and we expect that this lengthy sales cycle may continue or lengthen further. Longer sales cycles could cause our operating and financial results to suffer in a given period.\nBecause we recognize revenue over varying periods depending on the nature of the revenue, changes in our business including downturns or upturns in new sales and renewals will not be immediately reflected in our operating results and may be difficult to discern.\nWe generally recognize subscription revenue from customers ratably over the terms of their contracts, which are typically two to three years, although some customers commit for shorter periods. As a result, most of the subscription revenue we report in each quarter is derived from the recognition of deferred revenue relating to subscriptions entered into during previous quarters. Consequently, a decline in new or renewed subscriptions in any single quarter will likely have only a small impact on our revenue for that quarter. However, such a decline will negatively affect our revenue in future quarters. In addition, the severity and duration of events that affect revenue may not be predictable and their effects could extend beyond a single quarter. Accordingly, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, significant downturns in sales and market acceptance of our platform, and potential changes in our pricing policies or rate of renewals, may not be fully apparent from our reported results of operations until future periods.\nIn addition, a majority of our costs are expensed as incurred, while subscription revenue is recognized over the life of the customer agreement. As a result, increased growth in the number of our customers could continue to result in our recognition of more costs than revenue in the earlier periods of the terms of our agreements with them. Our subscription model also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue through additional sales in any period, as revenue from new customers must be recognized over the applicable subscription term.\nIn addition, professional services revenue is recognized as the services are performed or upon the completion of the project, depending on the type of professional services arrangement involved. Professional services engagements typically span from a few weeks to several months, which can make it difficult to predict the timing of revenue recognition for such services and the corresponding effects on our results of operations. Professional services revenue has fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate significantly from period to period, as we are increasingly leveraging our partners to provide these services. In addition, because professional services expenses are recognized as the services are performed, professional services margins can significantly fluctuate from period to period.\nThe sum of our revenue and changes in deferred revenue may not be an accurate indicator of business activity within a period.\nInvestors or analysts sometimes look to the sum of revenue and changes in deferred revenue, sometimes referred to as \u201cestimated billings,\u201d as an indicator of business activity in a period for businesses such as ours. However, these measures may significantly differ from underlying business activity for a number of reasons including:\n\u2022\na relatively large number of transactions occur at the end of the quarter. Invoicing of those transactions may or may not occur before the end of the quarter based on a number of factors including receipt of information from the customer, volume of transactions, and holidays. A shift of a few days has little economic impact on our business, but will shift deferred revenue from one period into the next;\n\u2022\nmulti-year upfront billings may distort trends;\n\u2022\nsubscriptions that have deferred start dates; and\n\u2022\nservices that are invoiced upon delivery.\nAccordingly, we do not believe that estimated billings are an accurate indicator of future revenue for any given period of time. However, many companies that provide subscriptions report changes in estimated billings as a key operating or financial metric, and it is possible that analysts or investors may view this metric as important. Thus, any changes in our estimated billings could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nChanges in our subscription or pricing models could adversely affect our operating results.\nAs the markets for our software subscriptions grow, as new competitors introduce new products or services that compete with ours or as we enter into new international markets, we may be unable to attract new customers at the same price or based on the same pricing model as we have historically used. Regardless of pricing model used, large customers may demand higher price discounts than in the past. As a result, we may be required to reduce our prices, offer shorter contract durations or offer alternative pricing models, which could adversely affect our revenue, gross margin, profitability, financial position, and cash flow.\nIn the past, we have been able to increase our prices for our platform and services, but we may choose not to introduce or be unsuccessful in implementing future price increases. Our competitors may introduce new products that compete with ours or reduce their prices, or we may be unable to attract new customers or retain existing customers based on our historical pricing models. As we expand internationally, we also must determine the appropriate pricing to enable us to compete effectively internationally. In addition, if our mix of products sold changes, then we may need to, or choose to, revise our pricing. As a result, we may be required or choose to reduce our prices or change our pricing model, which could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe depend on the experience and expertise of our senior management team and certain key employees, especially engineering, research and development and sales personnel, and our inability to retain these executive officers and key employees or recruit them in a timely manner, could harm our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nOur success depends largely upon the continued services of our key executive officers and certain key employees. We rely on our executive leadership team in the areas of business strategy, research and development, marketing, sales, services, and general and administrative functions. We have experienced, and may in the future experience, changes in our executive management team or key employees resulting from the hiring or departure of executives or key employees, which could disrupt our business. We do not have employment agreements with our executive officers or other key personnel that require them to continue to work for us for any specified period and, therefore, they could terminate their employment with us at any time. Conversely, we may terminate the employment of the senior management team and certain key employees, which may subject us to costly and time-consuming negotiations over severance, litigation and employment claims. While we seek to carefully manage any changes in our executive management team or key employees, including by establishing processes and procedures and engaging in succession planning, such measures may be insufficient and the departure or unavailability of one or more of our executive officers or key employees could have a serious adverse effect on our business.\nTo execute our growth plan, we must attract and retain highly qualified personnel, especially engineering, research and development and sales personnel. Competition for personnel can be intense, especially for engineers with high levels of experience in designing and developing software for Internet-related services and for direct sales personnel with the sales skills and technical knowledge that we require. For example, competition is intense for experienced software and cloud infrastructure engineers in San Francisco in the United States, London and York in the U.K., and Israel, our primary development locations. We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, difficulty in hiring and retaining employees with appropriate qualifications. If we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel, our business and future growth prospects could be adversely affected.\nMany of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater resources than we have. If we hire employees from competitors or other companies, their former employers may attempt to assert that these employees or our company have breached their legal obligations, resulting in a diversion of our time and resources and potential litigation. In addition, job candidates and existing employees often consider the value of the stock awards they receive in connection with their employment. If the perceived value of our stock awards declines, it may adversely affect our ability to recruit and retain highly skilled employees. Further, in times of increased economic uncertainty, employees and potential employees may perceive older or larger companies to be more attractive and the current period of economic uncertainty may adversely affect our ability to recruit and retain highly skilled employees. The challenges we face in recruiting and hiring qualified personnel may be compounded by a decreased willingness of candidates to leave their current employment due to various factors including economic uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and uncertainty regarding immigration policies.\nOur global operations and sales to customers outside the United States or with international operations subject us to risks inherent in international operations that can harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nA key element of our strategy is to operate globally and sell our products to customers across the world. We derive a significant portion of our revenue from customers located outside the United States. Operating globally requires significant resources and management attention. We cannot be certain that the investment and additional resources required to operate globally will produce desired levels of revenue or profitability. Further, operating globally subjects us to various risks, including:\n\u2022\nincreased management, travel, infrastructure and legal compliance costs associated with having operations in many countries;\n\u2022\nincreased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities;\n\u2022\nvariations in adoption and acceptance of cloud computing in different countries, requirements or preferences for domestic products, and difficulties in replacing products offered by more established or known regional competitors;\n\u2022\nnew and different sources of competition;\n\u2022\nlaws and business practices favoring local competitors;\n\u2022\ndiffering technical standards, existing or future regulatory and certification requirements and required features and functionality;\n\u2022\ncommunication and integration problems related to entering and serving new markets with different languages, cultures, and political systems;\n\u2022\ncompliance with foreign privacy and security laws and regulations, including data privacy laws that require customer data to be stored and processed in a designated territory, and the risks and costs of non-compliance;\n\u2022\ncompliance with laws and regulations for foreign operations, including anti-bribery laws (such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.S. Travel Act, and the U.K. Bribery Act), import and export control laws, tax laws, tariffs, trade barriers, economic sanctions, and other regulatory or contractual limitations on our ability to sell our products in certain foreign markets, and the risks and costs of non-compliance;\n\u2022\ncompliance with foreign laws, regulations and orders related to health and safety, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022\nheightened risks of unfair or corrupt business practices in certain geographies that may impact our financial results and result in restatements of our consolidated financial statements;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates and related effects on our results of operations;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in repatriating or transferring funds from or converting currencies in certain countries;\n\u2022\ndifferent pricing environments, longer sales cycles, and longer accounts receivable payment cycles and collections issues;\n\u2022\npolitical and economic conditions and uncertainty in the countries or regions in which we operate and around the world;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in recruiting, managing and retaining local partners, including consulting and implementation firms, to support our operations and sales;\n\u2022\ndiffering labor standards, including restrictions related to, and the increased cost of, terminating employees in some countries;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in recruiting, hiring and retaining employees in certain countries;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in managing a global workforce and maintaining our corporate culture globally;\n\u2022\nthe preference for localized software and licensing programs;\n\u2022\nthe preference for localized language support;\n\u2022\nweaker protection in some jurisdictions for intellectual property and other legal rights than in the United States and practical difficulties in enforcing intellectual property and other rights outside of the United States;\n\u2022\ncompliance with the laws of numerous foreign taxing jurisdictions, including withholding obligations, and overlapping of different tax regimes;\n\u2022\ncompliance challenges related to the complexity of multiple, conflicting and changing governmental laws and regulations, including employment, tax, privacy, and data protection laws and regulations;\n\u2022\nthe fragmentation of longstanding regulatory frameworks caused by Brexit; and\n\u2022\nglobal pandemics such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and travel restrictions and other measures undertaken by governments in response to such pandemics.\nAny of the above risks could adversely affect our international operations, reduce our revenue from customers outside of the United States or increase our operating costs, each of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and growth prospects.\nSome of our business partners also have international operations and are subject to the risks described above. Even if we are able to successfully manage the risks of international operations, our business may be adversely affected if our business partners are not able to successfully manage these risks.\nOur corporate culture promotes an entrepreneurial mindset, and if we cannot maintain this culture as we grow, we could lose the entrepreneurial spirit, innovation, creativity, and other qualities we believe contribute to our success, and it could harm our business.\nWe believe that our culture has been, and will continue to be, a key contributor to our success because it fosters the entrepreneurial spirit, innovation, creativity, and other qualities we believe drive our growth. As we continue to grow, we will need to maintain our corporate culture among a larger number of employees dispersed in various geographic regions. However, our growth may result in a change to, or dilution of, our corporate culture, and we may not be able to effectively integrate new hires in our fast-paced culture. The challenge we face in maintaining our culture is compounded by the COVID-19 pandemic and its effects including an employee base that is working remotely and facing personal and professional challenges. Any failure to maintain the cohesiveness of our culture could negatively affect\nour business, decrease employee engagement and productivity, result in current or former employees posting negative feedback on third-party company review sites, damage our reputation, reduce our ability to retain and recruit personnel and could lead to the failure to achieve our vision and implement our strategy.\nWe may engage in strategic transactions, which could divert our management\u2019s attention, result in additional dilution to our stockholders, disrupt our operations and adversely affect our operating results. We may not be able to successfully integrate acquired businesses and technologies or achieve the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions.\nIn pursuing our business strategy, we have in the past acquired and may in the future seek to acquire or invest in businesses, products, technologies, or talent that we believe could complement or expand our platform, augment our product offerings, enhance our technical capabilities or otherwise offer growth opportunities. We often compete with others for the same opportunities. The pursuit of any of these strategic transactions may divert the attention of management and cause us to incur various expenses in identifying, investigating, and pursuing suitable transactions, whether or not they are consummated.\nAny strategic transaction may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures. If we acquire additional businesses or enter into other strategic transactions, we may not be able to integrate the acquired personnel, operations, and technologies successfully, or effectively manage the combined business following the strategic transactions. In addition, we have limited experience in consummating strategic transactions. We also may not achieve the anticipated benefits from the strategic transactions due to a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nfailure to evaluate, integrate, utilize or benefit from or accurately anticipate the adoption rates of acquired technologies or services;\n\u2022\nproduct synergies, cost reductions, increases in revenue and economies of scale may not materialize as expected;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in retaining, motivating and integrating key management and other employees of the acquired business;\n\u2022\nthe business culture of the acquired entity may not match well with our culture;\n\u2022\nunforeseen delays, unanticipated costs and liabilities may arise when integrating operations, processes and systems in geographies where we have not conducted business;\n\u2022\nunanticipated costs or liabilities associated with the strategic transactions;\n\u2022\nincurrence of transaction-related costs;\n\u2022\nassumption of the existing obligations or unforeseen liabilities of the acquired business that we were not able to mitigate through due diligence or other means;\n\u2022\ndifficulty integrating the accounting systems, security infrastructure, operations, and personnel of the acquired business;\n\u2022\ndifficulties and additional expenses associated with supporting legacy products and hosting infrastructure of the acquired business;\n\u2022\ndifficulty converting the current and prospective customers of the acquired business onto our platform and contract terms, including disparities in the revenue, licensing, support, or professional services model of the acquired company;\n\u2022\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns;\n\u2022\nadverse effects to our existing business relationships with business partners and customers as a result of the strategic transactions;\n\u2022\nunexpected costs may arise due to unforeseen changes in tax, payroll, pension, labor, trade, environmental and safety policies in new jurisdictions where the acquired entity operates;\n\u2022\nuse of resources that are needed in other parts of our business; and\n\u2022\nuse of substantial portions of our available cash to consummate the strategic transaction.\nIn addition, a significant portion of the purchase price of companies we acquire may be allocated to acquired goodwill and other intangible assets, which must be assessed for impairment at least annually. In the future, if our acquisitions do not yield expected returns, we may be required to take charges to our operating results based on this impairment assessment process, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nStrategic transactions could also result in dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt, which could adversely affect our operating results, increase our financial risk, and cause the market price of our common stock to decline. In addition, if a strategic transaction fails to meet our expectations, our operating results, business, and financial position may suffer.\nIndustry Risks\nThe markets in which we participate are intensely competitive, and if we do not compete effectively, our business and operating results could be adversely affected.\nThe market for business planning software is highly competitive, with relatively low barriers to entry for some software or services. As a result, we anticipate aggressive competition not only from established vendors of business planning software but also from new entrants into the industry. Our ability to compete successfully in our market depends on a number of factors, both within and outside of our control. Any failure by us to compete successfully in any one of these or other areas may reduce the demand for our platform, as well as adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nOur competitors primarily include Oracle Corporation (Oracle), SAP AG (SAP), Workday, Inc. (Workday) and International Business Machines Corporation (IBM), which are well-established providers of business planning and analytics software with long-standing relationships with many customers. Some customers may be hesitant to adopt cloud-based software such as ours or to purchase cloud-based software from us and may prefer to purchase from such legacy software vendors. Oracle, SAP, and IBM are larger than we are and have greater name recognition, longer operating histories, larger marketing budgets, and significantly greater resources than we do. These vendors, as well as other competitors, may offer business planning software on a standalone basis at a low price or bundled as part of a larger product sale. Our competitors have offered, and may continue to offer, new products developed through acquisitions or organic development that more directly compete with our products and solutions. Our competitors may also seek to partner with other leading cloud providers.\nWe may also face competition from a variety of vendors of cloud-based and on-premises software products that address only a portion of the use cases addressed by our platform, including spreadsheets, which are used by virtually every business to some degree for business planning. Some of these applications may have greater functionality than our platform for the specific use cases for which they were designed, even if they lack the breadth of planning capabilities provided by our platform. In addition, other companies that provide cloud-based software in different target markets may develop software or acquire companies that operate in our target markets, and some potential customers may elect to develop their own internal software or simply use the manual processes that they have traditionally used. With the introduction of new technologies and market entrants, we expect competition to intensify in the future.\nMany of our competitors have longer operating histories and greater name recognition than we do, and are able to devote greater resources to the development, promotion, and sale of their products and services than we can. As a result, our competitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively to new or changing opportunities, technologies, operational requirements and industry standards, as well as to new challenges such as those resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, our current or potential competitors may acquire or be acquired by third parties with greater available resources and the ability to initiate or withstand substantial price competition, and the resulting change in the competitive landscape could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively. In addition, many of our competitors have established marketing relationships, access to larger customer bases, and major distribution agreements with consultants, systems integrators, and resellers. Our competitors may also establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties that may further enhance their product\nofferings or resources. If our competitors are successful in bringing their products or services to market earlier than ours or if their products or services are more technologically capable than ours, then our revenue could be adversely affected. In addition, some of our competitors may offer their products and services at a lower price. If we are unable to achieve our target pricing levels, our operating results would be negatively affected. Pricing pressures and increased competition could result in reduced sales, reduced margins, losses or a failure to maintain or improve our competitive market position, any of which could adversely affect our business.\nIf the market for Connect Planning solutions develops more slowly than we expect or declines, or if we are unable to successfully capitalize on the market, our business could be adversely affected.\nOur success will depend to a substantial extent on continued growth in the demand for cloud-based Connected Planning and digital transformation solutions and on our ability to continue to capitalize on this demand. Many enterprises have invested substantial resources on legacy planning products, emerging point products and manual processes and, therefore, may be reluctant or unwilling to migrate to enterprise cloud planning software. Our ability to capitalize on this market depends in part on our ability to sell customers on the benefits that the Connected Planning and digital transformation features of our platform can provide over their existing solutions. The growth rate of the Connected Planning market depends on a number of factors, including the cost, performance, and perceived value and security associated with Connected Planning software. If the market for Connect Planning solutions fails to grow, grows more slowly than we currently expect, or decreases in size, or if we are unable to successfully capitalize on the market, our business could be adversely affected.\nLegal and Compliance Risks\nWe typically provide service level commitments under our customer contracts. If we fail to meet these contractual commitments, we could be obligated to provide credits or refunds for prepaid amounts related to unused subscription services or face contract terminations, which could adversely affect our revenue.\nOur customer agreements typically provide service level commitments on a monthly basis. If we are unable to meet the stated service level commitments or suffer extended periods of unavailability for our platform, we may be contractually obligated to provide these customers with service credits, or we could face contract terminations, in which case we would be subject to refunds for prepaid amounts related to unused subscription services. Our revenue could be significantly affected if we suffer unexcused downtime under our agreements with our customers. Any extended service outages could adversely affect our reputation, ability to attract new customers and retain existing customers, revenue, and operating results.\nBecause we collect, process and store personal information and furthermore, because our platform could be used by customers to do the same, evolving domestic and international privacy and security laws, regulations and other obligations could result in additional costs and liabilities to us or inhibit sales of our platform.\nWe collect, process, store and transfer various types of information, including personally identifiable information or other sensitive information, for our customers and similar data about our employees, services providers, partners and potential customers in the normal course of business. Additionally, our customers can use our platform to collect, process, and store certain types of personal or identifying information regarding their employees and customers. In most cases we contractually prohibit our customers from using our platform to collect, process, or store sensitive information (such as personal health information or credit card information); however, our customers may breach such use prohibitions without our knowledge. Such a breach could result in our violation of the laws, rules, or regulations governing the collection, use, and protection of personal information, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition, and operating results. Moreover, as our customers face increased scrutiny for data privacy breaches, they may elect to transfer the risk to us through contractual provisions which may subject us to increasing levels of contractual liability for data privacy breaches.\nData privacy and security have become significant issues in the United States (\u201cU.S.\u201d) and in many other countries where our platform is available. Laws, rules, and regulations in these jurisdictions apply broadly to the collection, use, storage, data residency, disclosure, and security of various types of data, including data that identifies or may be used to identify an individual, such as names, email addresses, and in some jurisdictions, Internet Protocol addresses. In the U.S., these include laws, rules, and regulations promulgated under the authority of the Federal Trade Commission, the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, and state laws relating to privacy and data security. Internationally, virtually every jurisdiction in which we operate has established its own data security and privacy legal framework with which we, or our customers, must comply. Interpretation of, and costs of compliance with, these laws, rules, and regulations and their application to our platform and services in the United States and foreign jurisdictions is ongoing and cannot be fully determined at this time.\nFurther, the regulatory framework for privacy and security issues worldwide is rapidly evolving, subject to change and is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. Many federal, state, and foreign government bodies and agencies are considering adopting or amending laws, rules, and regulations regarding the collection, use, storage, data residency, security, and disclosure of personal information and breach notification procedures. In addition to government regulation, privacy advocates, and industry groups may propose new and different self-regulatory standards that may apply to us.\nRecent changes to privacy and security laws, including the CCPA, the GDPR, the Data Protection Act, and ongoing legal challenges to Model Clauses, could impact our business. Aspects of these laws, and their interpretation and enforcement remain unclear, and we cannot yet fully predict their impact on our business or operations. We have taken and will continue to take steps to comply with these and other new and changing privacy and security laws, rules, regulations and standards, but such laws, rules, regulations and standards may be unclear and we cannot assure you that our steps will be compliant. The interpretation and application of privacy and data protection laws, regulations, rules, and other standards remains uncertain and may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data management practices or the features of our platform. If so, we could be required to fundamentally change our business activities and practices or modify our platform, which we may be unable to do in a commercially reasonable manner or at all, and which could have an adverse effect on our business. As a result of changing standards, we may experience reluctance or refusal by current or prospective multi-national customers or customers in geographies with strict privacy laws, like the EU and the United Kingdom, to use our products, and we may find it necessary or desirable to make further changes to our handling of personal data for those customers. The changing regulatory environment applicable to the handling personal data, and our actions taken in response, may cause us to assume additional liabilities or incur additional costs or regulatory penalties, and could result in our business, operating results, and financial condition being harmed. Our efforts to comply new data protection laws and regulations may cause us to incur substantial operational costs, require us to modify our data handling practices, and may otherwise adversely impact our business, financial condition and operating results.\nDespite our compliance efforts, we may fail to achieve compliance with applicable privacy or data protection laws and regulations as they evolve, or adhere to contractual obligations regarding the collection, processing, storage and transfer of data (including data from our customers, prospective customers, partners and employees), either due to internal or external factors such as resource limitations or a lack of vendor cooperation. Any actual or perceived failure to comply with these laws or obligations could result in enforcement action against us, including fines, claims for damages by customers and other affected individuals, damage to our reputation, and loss of goodwill (both in relation to existing customers and prospective customers), any of which could harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nFurthermore, the costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, the laws, regulations, and policies that are applicable to the businesses of our customers may limit the use and adoption of, and reduce the overall demand for, our platform. Privacy concerns, whether valid or not valid, may inhibit market adoption of our software particularly in certain industries and foreign countries.\nIndemnity provisions in various agreements potentially expose us to substantial liability for intellectual property infringement and other losses.\nOur agreements with customers and other third parties generally include indemnification provisions under which we agree to indemnify them for losses suffered or incurred as a result of claims of intellectual property infringement, or other liabilities relating to or arising from our software, services or other contractual obligations. Large indemnity payments could harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Although we normally contractually limit our liability with respect to such indemnity obligations, those limitations may not be fully enforceable in all situations, and we may still incur substantial liability under those agreements. Any dispute with a customer with respect to such obligations could have adverse effects on our relationship with that customer and other existing customers and new customers and harm our business and results of operations.\nWe could incur substantial costs in expanding, protecting or defending our intellectual property rights, and any failure to protect our intellectual property rights could impair our ability to protect our proprietary technology and our brand.\nOur success and ability to compete depend in part upon our intellectual property and our ability to expand our existing intellectual property portfolio. We primarily rely on copyright, patent, trade secret and trademark laws, trade secret protection, and confidentiality or contractual agreements with our employees, customers, partners and others to protect our intellectual property rights. However, the steps we take to protect our intellectual property rights may be inadequate and we may not be able to secure our intellectual property rights in the U.S. and international markets in which we operate.\nSome or all of our issued patents may be invalidated or otherwise limited, allowing our competitors to develop competitive offerings. In addition, issuance of a patent does not guarantee that we have a right to practice the patented invention or that we can effectively use that patent to limit the ability of other companies to develop competitive products. We cannot be certain that we are the first to use the inventions claimed in our issued patents or pending patent applications or otherwise used in our platform, that we are the first to file for protection in our patent applications, or that third parties do not have blocking patents that could be used to prevent us from marketing or practicing our patented technology. While we have patents and patent applications pending, we may be unable to obtain patent protection for the technology covered in our patent applications or the patent protection may not be obtained quickly enough to meet our business needs. In addition, our existing patents and any patents issued in the future may not provide us with competitive advantages or may be successfully challenged by third parties. Effective patent, trademark, copyright, and trade secret protection may not be available to us in every country in which our platform is available. The laws of some foreign countries may not be as protective of intellectual property rights as those in the United States (in particular, some foreign jurisdictions do not permit patent protection for software), and mechanisms for enforcement of intellectual property rights may be inadequate. Additional uncertainty may result from changes to intellectual property legislation enacted in the United States, including the America Invents Act, and by other national governments and from interpretations of the intellectual property laws of the United States and other countries by applicable courts and agencies. Accordingly, despite our efforts, we may be unable to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property.\nAlthough we generally enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and consultants that have access to material confidential information and enter into confidentiality agreements with our customers and the parties with whom we have strategic relationships and business alliances, these agreements may not be effective in controlling access to and distribution of our platform and propriety information or preventing reverse engineering. Further, these agreements may not prevent competitors from independently developing technologies that are substantially similar or superior to our platform.\nUnauthorized use of our intellectual property may have already occurred or may occur in the future. In order to protect our intellectual property rights, we may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect these rights. Litigation brought to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights could be costly, time-consuming, and distracting to management and could result in the impairment or loss of portions of our intellectual property. Furthermore, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights may be met with defenses, counterclaims, and countersuits attacking the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights and could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and our patent applications at risk of not issuing. Our failure to secure, protect, and enforce our intellectual property rights could seriously and adversely affect our brand and our business.\nWe may be sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights, which may be costly to defend, could require us to pay significant damages and could limit our ability to use certain technologies.\nThere has been considerable activity in our industry to develop intellectual property and enforce intellectual property rights. Our success depends upon our not infringing upon the intellectual property rights of others. Our competitors, as well as a number of other entities and individuals, may own or claim to own intellectual property relating to our platform and underlying technology, and we may be unaware of the intellectual property rights that others may claim cover aspects of our platform or the underlying technology. In the future, others may claim that our platform and underlying technology infringe or violate their intellectual property rights.\nClaims of intellectual property rights infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights might require us to stop using technology found to violate a third party\u2019s rights, redesign our platform, which could require significant effort and expense and cause delays of releases, enter into costly settlement or license agreements, pay costly damage awards, or face a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting us from marketing or selling our platform. With respect to such technology for which intellectual property rights are claimed to be infringed or otherwise violated by our technology or the conduct of our business, if we cannot or do not license any infringed or otherwise violated technology on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or substitute similar non-infringing technology from another source, we could be forced to limit or stop selling our platform, we may not be able to meet our obligations to customers under our customer contracts, we may be unable to compete effectively, and our revenue and operating results could be adversely impacted. We may also be obligated to indemnify our customers and business partners or to pay substantial settlement costs, including royalty payments, in connection with any such claim or litigation and to obtain licenses, modify our platform, or refund fees, which could be costly. Even if we were to prevail in such a dispute, any litigation regarding intellectual property could be costly and time-consuming, damage our reputation and brand, delay or reduce potential sales, deter our partners from promoting adoption of our platform and divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations. As the number of competitors in our market increases, claims of intellectual property rights infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights may increase. Furthermore, our insurance coverage may not adequately cover losses from intellectual property rights infringement claims.\nWe employ third-party licensed software for use in or with our platform, and the inability to maintain these licenses or errors in the software we license could result in increased costs, or reduced service levels, which could adversely affect our business.\nOur platform incorporates certain third-party software obtained under licenses from other companies, and we use third-party software development tools as we continue to develop and enhance our platform. We anticipate that we will continue to rely on such third-party software in the future. If we are required to replace such software, commercially reasonable alternatives may not be available, and if they are available, they might require substantial investment of our time and resources. In addition, integration of the software used in our platform with new third-party software may require significant work and require substantial investment of our time and resources. Also, to the extent that our platform depends upon the successful operation of third-party software in conjunction with our software, any undetected errors or defects in this third-party software could prevent the deployment or impair the functionality of our platform, delay new feature introductions, result in a failure of our functionality or a security incident, and injure our reputation. Our use of additional or alternative third-party software would require us to enter into license agreements with third parties. In the event that we are not able to maintain our licenses to third-party software, or cannot obtain licenses to new software as needed, or in the event third-party software used in conjunction with our platform contains errors or defects, our business, operating results, and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nOur platform utilizes open source software, which could negatively affect our ability to offer our products and subject us to litigation or other adverse consequences.\nOur platform utilizes software governed by open source licenses, which may include, by way of example, the MIT License and the Apache License. The use of open source software involves a number of risks, many of which cannot be eliminated and could negatively affect our business. For example, the terms of various open source licenses have not been interpreted by United States courts, and there is a risk that such licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to market our platform. By the terms of certain open source licenses, if we combine our proprietary software with open source software in a certain manner, we could be required to release the source code of our proprietary software and to make our proprietary software available under open source licenses. We may face claims alleging noncompliance with open source license terms or misappropriation or other violation of open source technology. These claims could result in litigation, damage our reputation in the open-source community, or require us to purchase a costly license, devote additional research or development resources to re-engineer our products or services, discontinue the sale of our products if re-engineering could not be accomplished on a timely or cost-effective basis, require us to make the source code of our proprietary code generally available, or result in us being enjoined from the offering of components of our platform that contained the open source software, any of which would have a negative effect on our business and operating results. We also could be subject to lawsuits from other parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software. Litigation could be costly for us to defend, have a negative effect on our operating results or financial condition, and could require us to devote additional research and development resources to re-engineer our platform. In addition to risks related to license requirements, usage of open source software can lead to greater risks than use of third-party commercial software, as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on the origin of the software.\nWe are subject to anti-corruption, anti-bribery, and similar laws, and failure to comply with these laws could subject us to criminal penalties or significant fines and harm our business and reputation.\nWe are subject to anti-corruption and anti-bribery and similar laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, or the FCPA, the U.S. domestic bribery statute contained in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 201, the U.S. Travel Act, the USA PATRIOT Act, the U.K. Bribery Act 2010, and other anti-corruption, anti-bribery, and anti-money laundering laws in countries in which we conduct activities. Anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws have been enforced aggressively in recent years and are interpreted broadly and prohibit companies and their employees and agents from promising, authorizing, making or offering improper payments, or other benefits to government officials and others in the private sector. As we increase our international sales and business, our risks under these laws may increase.\nNoncompliance with these laws could subject us to investigations, sanctions, settlements, prosecution, other enforcement actions, disgorgement of profits, significant fines, damages, other civil and criminal penalties or injunctions, adverse media coverage, and other consequences. Any investigations, actions, or sanctions could harm our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nWe are subject to governmental export and import controls and economic sanctions programs that could impair our ability to compete in international markets or subject us to liability if we violate the controls or programs.\nWe are subject to certain U.S. export control and import laws and regulations, including the U.S. Export Administration Regulations, U.S. Customs regulations, and various economic and trade sanctions regulations administered by the U.S. Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Controls. Exports of our platform must be made in compliance with these laws and regulations. If we fail to comply with these laws and regulations, we and certain of our employees could be subject to substantial civil or criminal penalties, including: the possible loss of export or import privileges; fines, which may be imposed on us and responsible employees or managers; and, in extreme cases, the incarceration of responsible employees or managers. Obtaining the necessary authorizations, including any required license, for a particular sale may be time-consuming, is not guaranteed, and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities.\nWe incorporate encryption technology into our platform. These encryption products and the underlying technology may be exported outside of the United States only with the required export authorizations, including by license, a license exception or other appropriate government authorizations. In addition, various countries regulate the import of certain encryption technology, including through import permitting and licensing requirements, and have enacted laws that could limit our ability to distribute our platform or could limit our customers\u2019 ability to implement our platform in those countries. Governmental regulation of encryption technology and regulation of imports or exports of encryption products, or our failure to obtain required import or export approval for our platform, when applicable, could harm our international sales and adversely affect our revenue. Furthermore, U.S. export control laws and economic sanctions programs prohibit the shipment of certain products and services to countries, governments, and persons targeted by U.S. sanctions. Any violations of such economic embargoes and trade sanction regulations could have negative consequences, including government investigations, penalties, and reputational harm.\nChanges in our platform or future changes in export and import regulations may create delays in the introduction and sale of our platform in international markets, prevent our customers with international operations from deploying our platform globally or, in some cases, prevent the export or import of our platform to certain countries, governments, or persons altogether. Any change in export or import regulations, economic sanctions or related legislation, or change in the countries, governments, persons, or technologies targeted by such regulations, could result in decreased use of our platform by, or in our decreased ability to export or sell our platform to, existing or potential customers with international operations. Any decreased use of our platform or limitation on our ability to export or sell our platform would likely adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe incur significant costs, devote substantial management time, and may have difficulty attracting qualified board members as a result of operating as a public company.\nAs a public company, we are subject to various securities rules and regulations, including the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the New York Stock Exchange listing standards, and rules and regulations subsequently implemented by the SEC and the New York Stock Exchange. We expect that complying with these rules and regulations will continue to increase our legal, accounting, and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming, and costly, and place significant strain on our personnel, systems, and resources. The Exchange Act requires, among other things, that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and operating results. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we establish and maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. Compliance with these various requirements has increased, and we expect will continue to increase, our legal and financial compliance costs and makes some activities more time consuming and costly. In addition, our management and other personnel need to divert attention from operational and other business matters to devote substantial time\nto these public company requirements, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results. Although we have hired additional employees to help comply with these requirements, we may need to hire more employees in the future or engage outside consultants, which will increase our costs and expenses.\nIn addition, changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure are creating uncertainty for public companies, increasing legal and financial compliance costs and making some activities more time consuming. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. Compliance with evolving laws, regulations and standards may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management's time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. If our efforts to comply with new laws, regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to their application and practice, regulatory authorities may impose fines, initiate legal proceedings or take other action against us and our business may be adversely affected.\nAs a result of the rules and regulations applicable to public companies, it may be more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance and we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage. It may also be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors, particularly to serve on our audit committee and compensation committee, and qualified executive officers.\nAs a public company we file certain information publicly, which provides visibility into our business and financial condition. We are currently subject to litigation related to our public filings, and may continue to be subject to threatened or actual litigation in the future. If such claims are successful, our business, and operating results could be adversely affected, and even if the claims do not result in litigation or are resolved in our favor, these claims, and the time and resources necessary to resolve them and the diversion of management resources, could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, our ability to produce timely and accurate financial statements, or comply with applicable regulations could be impaired.\nAs a public company, we are required to design and maintain internal controls over financial reporting and to report any material weaknesses in such internal controls. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that we evaluate and determine the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting and provide a management report on the internal controls over financial reporting, which must be attested to by our independent registered public accounting firm. We are continuing to develop and refine our disclosure controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we will file with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and that information required to be disclosed in reports under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our principal executive and financial officers. We are also continuing to improve our internal control over financial reporting, including through our internal audit team. In order to maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, we have expended, and anticipate that we will continue to expend, significant resources, including accounting-related costs and significant management oversight.\nOur current controls and any new controls that we develop may become inadequate because of changes in conditions in our business. Further, weaknesses in our disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting may be discovered in the future. If we fail to develop or maintain effective controls, encounter difficulties in their implementation or improvement, or identify a material weakness in our controls, our operating results could be harmed or we could fail to meet our reporting obligations and may be required to restate our financial statements for prior periods. Any failure to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting also could adversely affect the results of periodic management evaluations and annual independent registered public accounting firm attestation reports regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting that we are required to include in our periodic reports that will be filed with the SEC. Our independent registered public accounting firm may issue a report that is adverse in the event it is not satisfied with the level at which our internal control over financial reporting is documented, designed, or operating. Ineffective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting could result in regulatory scrutiny and sanctions, cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial and other information, and subject us to stockholder or other third party litigation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness and operating results and a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock. In addition, if we are unable to continue to meet these requirements, we may not be able to remain listed on the New York Stock Exchange.\nFinancial and Credit Risks\nIf we are unable to achieve and sustain a level of liquidity sufficient to support our operations and fulfill our obligations, our business, operating results and financial position could be adversely affected.\nWe actively monitor and manage our cash and cash equivalents so that sufficient liquidity is available to fund our operations and other corporate purposes. As an example of our liquidity management, in April 2020, we amended our credit agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (\u201cWells Fargo\u201d) to, among other things, increase the aggregate revolving credit commitment amount to allow us to borrow up to $60.0 million, subject to the terms of the credit agreement, including the accounts receivable borrowing base, and extend the maturity date of the revolving credit facility from April 2020 to April 2022. In the future, increased levels of liquidity may be required to adequately support our operations and initiatives and to mitigate the effects of business challenges or unforeseen circumstances. If we are unable to achieve and sustain such increased levels of liquidity, we may suffer adverse consequences including reduced investment in our platform and its functionality, difficulties in executing our business plan and fulfilling our obligations, and other operational challenges. Any of these developments could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial position.\nWe may face exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\nWhile our international contracts are sometimes denominated in U.S. dollars, a significant portion of our revenue is in foreign currencies and the majority of our international costs are denominated in local currencies. Over time, an increasing portion of our international contracts may be denominated in local currencies. Therefore, fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies may affect our operating results when translated into U.S. dollars. We do not currently engage in currency hedging activities to limit the risk of exchange rate fluctuations. However, in the future, we may engage in hedging activities including the use of derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The use of such hedging activities may not successfully offset any of the risks associated with exchange rate fluctuations, including uncertainty caused by volatility in the currency exchange rates. Moreover, the use of hedging instruments may introduce additional risks if we are unable to structure effective hedges with such instruments.\nWe may not be able to secure additional financing on favorable terms, or at all, to meet our future capital needs.\nWe have funded our operations since inception primarily through equity financings and payments by customers. We do not know when or if our operations will generate sufficient cash to fund our ongoing operations. In the future, we may require additional capital to respond to business opportunities, challenges, strategic transactions, a decline in the level of customer prepayments or unforeseen circumstances. We may determine to engage in equity or debt financings or enter into credit facilities for these or other reasons, and we may not be able to timely secure additional debt or equity financing on favorable terms, or at all, especially during a global economic downturn. Any debt financing obtained by us in the future could involve restrictive covenants relating to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities, including potential strategic transactions. If we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity, convertible debt securities or other securities convertible into equity, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution in their percentage ownership of our company, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences, and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us, when we require it, our ability to continue to grow or support our business and to respond to business challenges could be significantly limited.\nIf we default on our credit obligations, our operations may be interrupted and our business could be seriously harmed.\nWe have a credit facility that we may draw on to finance our operations, strategic transactions, and other corporate purposes. Our obligations pursuant to this credit facility are secured by a first priority lien on our assets for the benefit of the lenders. Our credit facility contains financial and operating covenants, including maintenance of a specific minimum tangible net worth, customary limitations on the incurrence of certain indebtedness and liens, restrictions on certain intercompany transactions, and limitations on the amount of dividends and stock repurchases. Our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control, and breaches of these covenants or other obligations in the credit facility, or the occurrence of certain events specified in the credit facility, could result in a default under the credit facility and any future financial agreements into which we may enter. If we default on the obligations under our credit facility, our lenders may pursue various remedial actions against us, including:\n\u2022\nrequiring repayment of any outstanding amounts drawn on our credit facility;\n\u2022\nterminating our credit facility;\n\u2022\ndisposing of our assets subject to the lien; and\n\u2022\nrequiring us to pay significant damages.\nIf any of these events occur, our operations may be interrupted and our ability to fund our operations or obligations, as well as our business, could be seriously harmed. For more information on our credit facility, see \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d\nWe may not be able to utilize a significant portion of our net operating loss or research tax credit carryforwards, which could adversely affect our potential profitability.\nWe have federal and state net operating loss carryforwards due to prior period losses, which if not utilized will begin to expire in fiscal 2029 and 2025 for federal and state purposes, respectively. These net operating loss carryforwards could expire unused and be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities, which could adversely affect our potential profitability.\nAlso, under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (\u201cTax Reform Act\u201d), tax losses generated in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, may be utilized to offset no more than 80% of taxable income annually. Although the subsequent CARES Act modified the Tax Reform Act by, among other things, eliminating the aforementioned 80% limitation for taxable years beginning before January 1, 2021, we may still face reduced availability of net operating losses in future taxable years, which could adversely affect our potential profitability.\nIn addition, under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, our ability to utilize net operating loss carryforwards or other tax attributes, such as research tax credits, in any taxable year may be limited if we experience an \u201cownership change.\u201d Such an \u201cownership change\u201d generally occurs if one or more stockholders or groups of stockholders who own at least 5% of our stock increase their ownership by more than 50 percentage points over their lowest ownership percentage within a rolling three-year period. Similar rules may apply under state tax laws. We completed an analysis under Sections 382 and 383 of the Code for the Company\u2019s tax years through January 31, 2019, and determined two \u201cownership changes\u201d occurred, one in fiscal 2011 and one in fiscal 2012. We believe utilization of our net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards have become limited. This could result in increased U.S. federal income tax liability for us if we generate taxable income in a future period. Limitations on the use of net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes could also increase our state tax liability. The use of our tax attributes will also be limited to the extent that we do not generate positive taxable income in future tax periods.\nWe are subject to the tax laws of various jurisdictions, which are subject to changes and to interpretation, which could harm our future results.\nWe are subject to income, sales, use, value added, and other similar taxes in the United States and foreign jurisdictions, and our domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to the allocation of expenses in differing jurisdictions. Our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates, certain non-deductible expenses\nas a result of acquisitions, the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, the interpretation and application of existing tax laws within a jurisdiction, and changes in federal, state, or international tax laws and accounting principles.\nChanges to various tax laws, rules and regulations are currently being considered by the United States and other countries where we do business. Certain of these proposed changes could be applied solely or disproportionately to services provided over the internet. These tax initiatives, if implemented, could result in additional tax obligations that we are required to pay or adversely affect our sales activity due to the inherent cost increase the taxes would represent and ultimately result in a negative impact on our operating results and cash flows. In addition, existing tax laws, rules, or regulations could be interpreted, modified, or applied adversely to us (possibly with retroactive effect), which could require us or our customers to pay additional tax amounts, or require us or our customers to pay fines, penalties and interest for past amounts. If we are unsuccessful in collecting such taxes from our customers, we could be held liable for such costs, thereby adversely affecting our operating results and cash flows.\nSales and use, value added, and similar tax laws and rates vary greatly by jurisdiction and are subject to varying interpretations that change over time. We do not collect sales and use, value added, and similar taxes in all jurisdictions in which we have sales, based on our belief that such taxes are not applicable or that we are not required to collect such taxes with respect to the jurisdiction. Certain jurisdictions in which we do not collect such taxes may assert that such taxes are applicable, which could result in tax assessments, penalties, and interest, and we may be required to collect such taxes in the future.\nOur customers may fail to pay us in accordance with the terms of their agreements, necessitating action by us to compel payment.\nWe typically enter into multiple year, non-cancelable arrangements with our customers. If customers fail to pay us under the terms of our agreements, we may be adversely affected both from the inability to collect amounts due and the cost of enforcing the terms of our contracts, including litigation. The risk of such negative effects increases with the term length of our customer arrangements. Furthermore, some of our customers may seek bankruptcy protection or other similar relief, including as a result of the impacts and disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, and fail to pay amounts due to us, or pay those amounts more slowly, either of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur reported financial results may be adversely affected by changes in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.\nGenerally accepted accounting principles in the United States are subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, the SEC and various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles. A change in these principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported financial results for periods prior and subsequent to such change. For example, recent new standards issued by the FASB that could materially impact our financial statements include certain changes to accounting for leases. We may adopt one or more of these standards retrospectively to prior periods, and the adoption may result in an adverse change to previously reported results. Additionally, the adoption of these standards may potentially require enhancements or changes in our systems and could require our financial management to devote significant time and resources to implementing those changes.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nThe stock price of our common stock may be volatile and may decline regardless of our operating performance and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nThe market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile. In addition to factors discussed in this report, the market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\nthe COVID-19 pandemic and the extent to which, and for how long, it impacts our business and that of our customers and prospective customers;\n\u2022\noverall performance of the equity markets;\n\u2022\nour operating performance, including key metrics, and the performance of other similar companies;\n\u2022\nchanges in our projected operating results that we provide to the public, our failure to meet these projections or changes in recommendations by securities analysts that elect to follow our common stock;\n\u2022\nchanges in our financial, operating or other metrics, regardless of whether we consider those metrics as reflective of the current state or long-term prospects of our business, and how those results compare to securities analyst expectations;\n\u2022\nannouncements of technological innovations, new software or enhancements to services, acquisitions, strategic alliances, or significant agreements by us or by our competitors;\n\u2022\ndisruptions in our services due to computer hardware, software, or network problems;\n\u2022\na data breach or other security incident involving us, or one of our customers or partners, or another company in the cloud planning software market;\n\u2022\nannouncements of customer additions and customer cancellations or delays in customer purchases;\n\u2022\nrecruitment or departure of key personnel;\n\u2022\nthe economy as a whole, market conditions in our industry and the industries of our customers;\n\u2022\nthe sale, purchase, or exercise of a significant block of our common stock;\n\u2022\nthe impact of environmental, social, governance or other matters on our reputation or investor confidence in our operations;\n\u2022\nthe size of our market float; and\n\u2022\nany other factors discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIn addition, the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many technology companies. Stock prices of many technology companies have fluctuated in a manner unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. In the past, stockholders have filed securities class action litigation following periods of market volatility. For example, in August 2020, a purported stockholder filed a putative securities class action complaint in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California against us and certain of our executive officers. This lawsuit is further described in Note 9, Commitment and Contingencies, in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Although we believe this lawsuit lacks merit and intend to vigorously defend against it, this matter, and any other similar matters, could subject us to substantial costs, divert resources, and the attention of management from our business and adversely affect our business.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more analysts cease or reduce coverage of us, the trading price for our common stock would be negatively affected. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our common stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our common stock price would likely decline.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared nor paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance the operation and expansion of our business, and we do not expect to declare or pay any dividends in the foreseeable future. Consequently, stockholders must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investment.\nDelaware law and provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws could make a merger, tender offer, or proxy contest difficult, thereby depressing the trading price of our common stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of our company more difficult, including the following:\n\u2022\na classified board of directors so that not all members of our board of directors are elected at one time, which could delay the ability of stockholders to change the membership of a majority of our board of directors;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our board of directors to issue shares of preferred stock and to determine the price and other terms of those shares, including preferences and voting rights, without stockholder approval, which could be used to significantly dilute the ownership of a hostile acquiror;\n\u2022\nthe right of our board of directors, subject to the rights of the holders of any series of preferred stock, to the extent such preferred stock is issued by the board of directors in the future, to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of our board of directors or the resignation, death, or removal of a director, could impede an attempt by stockholders to fill vacancies on our board of directors;\n\u2022\na prohibition on stockholder action by written consent, which forces stockholder action to be taken at an annual or special meeting of our stockholders;\n\u2022\nthe requirement that a special meeting of stockholders may be called only by a majority vote of our entire board of directors, the chairman of our board of directors or our chief executive officer, which could delay the ability of our stockholders to force consideration of a proposal or to take action, including the removal of directors; and\n\u2022\nadvance notice procedures with which stockholders must comply to nominate candidates to our board of directors or to propose matters to be acted upon at a stockholders\u2019 meeting, which may discourage or deter a potential acquiror from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquiror\u2019s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us.\nIn addition, as a Delaware corporation, we are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. This provision may prohibit large stockholders, in particular those owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock, from engaging in a business combination with us even if the business combination would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. A Delaware corporation may opt out of this provision by express provision in its original certificate of incorporation or by amendment to its certificate of incorporation or bylaws approved by its stockholders. However, we have not opted out of this provision.\nThese and other provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, amended and restated bylaws, and Delaware law could make it more difficult for stockholders or potential acquirers to obtain control of our board of directors or initiate actions that are opposed by our then-current board of directors, including delay or impede a merger, tender offer, or proxy contest involving our company. The existence of these provisions could negatively affect the price of our common stock and limit opportunities for you to realize value in a corporate transaction.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive forum for many types of disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or employees.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, any action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty, any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation Law, our certificate of incorporation or our bylaws or any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. This choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or other employees and may discourage these types of lawsuits. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in our amended and\nrestated certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nUncertain global economic and market conditions may negatively impact our business, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur business depends on the overall demand for information technology and on the economic health of our current and prospective customers in the United States and abroad. Any significant weakening of the economy in the United States or in regions globally like Europe and Asia, more limited availability of credit, a reduction in business confidence and activity, decreased government spending, perceived impact of global trade barriers like tariffs and sanctions and the corresponding retaliatory actions, economic uncertainty, or other difficulties may affect one or more of the sectors or countries in which we sell our platform. Global economic and political uncertainty, including the uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, Brexit, increased tariffs and international trade disputes, may cause some of our customers or potential customers to curtail spending, scale back their digital transformation efforts, delay their expansion of Anaplan use cases, result in new regulatory and cost challenges to our international operations and cause customers to delay or reduce their technology spending overall. In addition, a strong dollar could reduce demand for our products in countries with relatively weaker currencies. Global economic conditions and market conditions may also continue to experience volatility and remain uncertain for an indefinite period of time as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. We expect our business will be impacted in a variety of ways by these conditions because, among other reasons, some prospective and existing customers may curtail business spending, there may be greater unpredictability in some customers\u2019 ability to pay for their subscriptions to our platform, business disruptions for us and/or our customers are likely to persist in at least some jurisdictions and travel by us and our partners to customer sites has been and is expected to remain limited. These adverse conditions have, in part, resulted in and may result in certain of our customers and prospective customers deferring or delaying buying decisions and project implementations, prolonged sales cycles, and increased requests for extended payment terms. These adverse conditions could result in reductions in the rate of enterprise software spending generally, sales of our platform, longer sales cycles, slower adoption of new technologies, lower renewal rates, and increased price competition. Any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial position.\nCatastrophic events and other events beyond our control may disrupt our business and adversely affect our operating results.\nNatural disasters, catastrophic events, and other events beyond our control may cause damage or disruption to our business. As an example, our corporate headquarters are located in San Francisco, California and the west coast of the United States contains active earthquake zones. An earthquake affecting our headquarters may result in disruption to our business and operations. Additionally, we rely on our network and third-party infrastructure and enterprise applications, internal technology systems, and our website for our development, marketing, operational support, hosted services, and sales activities and such infrastructure and systems may also be affected by natural disasters or other catastrophic events. For example, our data centers are critical infrastructure located in the United States, the Netherlands, and Germany, including in areas with active earthquake zones. From time to time, global pandemics may result from outbreak of diseases such as the MERS, SARS, avian flu and COVID-19, which may result in a material adverse impact on our or our customers\u2019 and partners\u2019 business operations including reduction or suspension of operations in the U.S. or certain parts of the world. We serve a wide range of customers with international operations in varying industries including manufacturing. Depending upon the continuity and severity of pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, our customers and partners may suspend or delay their engagement with us, or our partners may have difficulty engaging with customers and delivering the services we typically expect them to provide, which could result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition. Although we maintain disaster and crisis recovery plans, in the event of an earthquake, hurricane, flood, natural disaster or catastrophic event such as fire, power loss, telecommunications failure, breach of security protocols, global pandemics like the COVID-19 pandemic, cyber-attack, war, or terrorist attack, such plans or the disaster recovery plans established by the third-party data centers and other infrastructure that we rely on may prove to be inadequate and we may be unable to continue our operations and may endure system interruptions, reputational harm, delays in our product development, lengthy interruptions in our services, breaches of data security, and\nloss of critical data, all of which could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. Furthermore, in the event of a catastrophic event or other crisis, our insurance coverage may not adequately compensate us for any losses that we may incur.",

    "item_7": "ITEM 7. management\u2019s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal 2019 and year-to-year comparisons between fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 is included in Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020, filed with the SEC on March 30, 2020. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties as discussed in \u201cCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed below. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, impacts on our business and general economic conditions due to the current COVID-19 pandemic, those identified below and those discussed in \u201cRisk Factors\u201d under Part I, Item 1A in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our fiscal year ends January 31.\nOverview\nAnaplan is a cloud-native enterprise SaaS company and a market leader in Connected Planning, empowering global enterprises to orchestrate transformative business performance. Our customers rely on the Anaplan platform-powered by our proprietary Hyperblock\u00ae technology-to connect teams, systems, and insights from across their organizations to continuously adapt to change, transform how they operate, and reinvent value creation. Our cloud platform empowers enterprises to orchestrate complex scenario planning and conduct continuous forecasting to systematically identify possibilities, seize opportunities, and reduce risk. Users of our platform can view and assess the impact of assumptions on plans and key performance indicators in real time and across multiple business dimensions. The Anaplan platform enables businesses to be more agile, make better decisions and to plan and execute their ongoing digital transformation to compete in today\u2019s digital economy.\nOur customers often initially adopt our platform within a specific business function for one or more planning use cases, but also because our platform has the potential to be used as an enterprise-wide integrated planning and forecasting tool and as part of a broader digital transformation initiative. We sell subscriptions to our cloud-based planning platform primarily through our direct sales team targeting these customers. We also have a robust partnership ecosystem that serves as an integral part of our go-to-market strategy and an extension of our direct sales force. Our strategic consulting and systems integration partners provide us with a significant source of lead generation and implementation leverage. These partners act as strategic advisors to senior executives in corporate, functional, and process transformation initiatives of organizations. They often promote our platform as their clients examine how to plan more effectively or seek digital transformation through organizational change or improved business processes. We also rely on partners with deep subject-matter expertise in the implementation of specific use cases who can facilitate implementations for our customers. Our partners also help to drive thought leadership in promoting Connected Planning and digital transformation.\nOnce our customers see the benefits and wide applicability of our platform, we use a \u201cland and expand\u201d sales strategy to encourage our existing customers to increase the number of users, add new use cases, and expand to additional lines of business, divisions, and geographies. This expansion often generates a natural network effect in which the value of our platform to customers increases as more use cases are adopted, more users are connected, and greater amounts of data are incorporated in our platform delivering exponential value to our customers.\nWe see a greenfield opportunity to help over 70 million knowledge workers around the world plan more efficiently using Anaplan\u2019s platform.\nWe derive the substantial majority of our revenue from subscriptions for users on our platform. Our initial subscription term is typically two to three years, although some customers commit for shorter periods. We generally bill our customers annually in advance. We also offer professional services, including consulting, implementation, and training, but are increasingly leveraging our partners to provide these services. During fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019, subscription revenue was $408.2 million,\n$307.9 million and $208.6 million, respectively, representing a year-over-year subscription revenue growth rate of 33% and 48% in fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively. During fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019, services revenue was $39.6 million, $40.1 million and $32.0 million, respectively. Our subscription revenue as a percentage of total revenue was 91%, 88%, and 87% in fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.\nDuring fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, our total revenue was $447.8 million, $348.0 million and $240.6 million, respectively. Approximately 46%, 43% and 43% of our revenue was generated from outside of the United States in fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our net loss was $154.0 million, $149.2 million and $131.0 million in fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nWe believe that our focus on customer success allows us to retain and expand the subscription revenue generated from our existing customers, and is an indicator of the long-term value of our customer relationships for Anaplan as a whole. We track our performance in this area by measuring our dollar-based net expansion rate, which compares our annual recurring revenue from the same set of customers across comparable periods. The dollar-based net expansion rate was 114% and 122% as of January 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nOur dollar-based net expansion rate equals the annual recurring revenue at the end of a period for a base set of customers from which we generated annual recurring revenue in the year prior to the date of calculation, divided by the annual recurring revenue one year prior to the date of the calculation for that same set of customers. Annual recurring revenue is calculated as subscription revenue already booked and in backlog that will be recorded over the next 12 months, assuming any contract expiring in those 12 months is renewed and continues on its existing terms and at its prevailing rate of utilization.\nThe number of customers with greater than $250,000 of annual recurring revenue was 453, 353 and 248 as of January 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We monitor this metric and believe it is a useful tool to investors, as an indicator of the scale of customer adoption and expansion of our platform.\nWe define calculated billings as total revenue plus the change in deferred revenue in the period. Calculated billings in any particular period is comprised of subscription contracts with existing customers (including renewal contracts and add-on contracts), subscription contracts with new customers, and contracts for professional services. Calculated billings is intended to provide information about our subscription revenue growth over time and can typically be seen as an early indicator of trends in revenue growth. While calculated billings can increase as our revenues grow, it may significantly fluctuate from period to period for several reasons, including the timing of contracted billings, the timing of renewals, and other factors. See Part I, Item 1A, \u201cRisk Factors-Operational Risks-The sum of our revenue and changes in deferred revenue may not be an accurate indicator of business activity within a period\u201d for a description of some limitations in the use of calculated billings.\nCalculated billings is calculated as follows:\nYear Ended January 31,\n(In thousands)\nTotal revenue\n$\n447,755\n$\n348,022\nAdd:\nDeferred revenue (end of period)\n295,543\n220,208\nLess:\nDeferred revenue (beginning of period)\n(220,208\n)\n(150,843\n)\nCalculated billings\n$\n523,090\n$\n417,387\nWe regularly evaluate acquisitions or investment opportunities in complementary businesses, services and technologies and intellectual property rights as a means to expand our offerings through a disciplined and strategic acquisition process. For example, on October 3, 2019 we completed the acquisition of Mintigo Limited (Mintigo), an Israel-based artificial intelligence/machine learning company, to enhance the predictive capabilities of our solutions. We may continue to make such acquisitions and investments in the future, and we plan to reinvest a significant portion of our incremental revenue in future periods to grow our business and continue our leadership role in the Connected Planning category.\nCOVID-19 Update\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to persist. Precautionary measures designed to prevent the spread of COVID-19, such as travel restrictions, shelter-in-place orders, and business shutdowns, remain in place in many of the regions in which we conduct business, and new or more restrictive measures have been adopted, and may continue to be adopted if the pandemic worsens.\nAs the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic continues to unfold around the world, we remain focused on supporting our employees, customers, and partners. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we continue to operate in a modified manner and to prioritize the health and safety of our employees, customers and the communities in which we operate. Among other modifications, we continue to require our employees to work remotely, to maintain business-related travel restrictions, and to virtualize, postpone or cancel our sales and marketing, employee or industry events. Our plan is to slowly move toward normal operations on a market by market basis in accordance with local authority guidelines and to ensure that our return to work is thoughtful, prudent and handled with an abundance of caution with the health of our employees being the top priority. When we determine that it is safe for employees to return to work, we have developed health and safety procedures to enable our employees to do so safely. The impact, if any, of these and any additional operational changes we may implement is uncertain, but we currently believe the changes we have implemented have not materially affected and are not expected to have a material and adverse effect on our ability to maintain financial reporting systems, internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures.\nWhile the broader implications of the COVID-19 pandemic on our employees, our results of operations, and overall financial performance remain uncertain, we have seen and we currently expect our financial performance to be negatively impacted by the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, at least for the immediate future. We have seen and expect to continue to see certain of our customers and prospective customers defer or delay buying decisions and project implementations, prolonged sales cycles, and an increase in requests for extended payment terms due to uncertain economic conditions including those caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. We have seen and expect to continue to see these deferrals and delays impact our new business pipeline and large deals, including delays in deals arising out of our strategic relationships with our global partners. We may also experience contraction in our existing customer base. These and other changes in customer demand for our solutions could materially and adversely impact our business, results of operations, and overall financial performance in future periods.\nWhile we have developed and continue to develop plans to help mitigate the negative impact of the pandemic on our business, these efforts may not be effective and any protracted economic downturn may limit the effectiveness of our mitigation efforts. In addition, even after the immediate impacts of the pandemic on the global economy and our business subside, the residual effects of the pandemic may present additional challenges to our business that are currently difficult to predict. Furthermore, we generally recognize subscription revenue from our customer contracts ratably over the term of the contract. Therefore, changes in our contracting activity in the near term may not be apparent as a change to our reported revenue until future periods. See Part I, Item 1A, \u201cRisk Factors\u201d for further discussion of the possible impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business.\nFactors Affecting Our Performance\nWe believe that our future performance will depend on many factors, including those described below. While these areas present significant opportunity, they also present risks that we must manage to achieve successful results. See Part I, Item 1A, \u201cRisk Factors\u201d. If we are unable to address these challenges, our business and operating results could be adversely affected.\nMarket adoption of our platform. Our long-term success will depend on widespread adoption of Connected Planning by enterprises for numerous planning applications with broad use of those applications within their organizations. While we believe that we are still in the early stages of penetrating our addressable market, we have benefited from rapid customer growth.\nCustomer First strategy. We put the success of our customers at the center of our culture, strategy, and investments. We view our Customer First strategy as core to capturing our Connected Planning vision and driving the continued adoption and expansion in the use of our platform. By aligning our thought leadership, worldwide development and delivery capabilities, and local sales and service resources, our Customer First strategy drives exceptional value throughout our customers\u2019 Connected Planning and digital transformation journeys. Our continued success depends in part on our ability to continue to put customers at the center of our strategy.\nExpansion of existing customers. We employ a \u201cland and expand\u201d approach, with many of our customers initially deploying our product for a specific use case and group of users. Once they realize the benefits and wide applicability of our platform, many of our customers subsequently renew their subscriptions and expand the number of users or use cases within and across lines of business and geographies as they continue unlocking the agile enterprise planning and operating model across functional boundaries. As a result, we are able to generate a significant increase in revenue from the expanded use of our platform across the enterprise. Going forward, we are focused on targeting customers where the opportunity for expansion and need for our planning solutions are greatest. Our future revenue growth and our ability to achieve and maintain profitability is dependent upon our ability to maintain existing customer relationships and to continue to expand our customers\u2019 use of our platform.\nScaling our sales team. Our ability to achieve significant growth in revenue in the future will depend, in large part, upon the effectiveness of our sales leadership and sales efforts, both domestically and internationally. We have invested and intend to continue to invest in expanding and retaining our sales leadership and direct sales force, particularly in attracting and retaining sales personnel with experience selling to larger enterprises. Our ability to increase our revenue will depend on the new members of our sales force becoming fully productive and executing expeditiously and effective sales leadership. A customer\u2019s decision to use our platform may be an enterprise-wide decision. These types of sales require us to provide greater levels of education regarding the use and benefits of our platform, which involves substantial time, effort, and costs.\nInternational sales. Our total revenue generated outside of the United States during fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, was approximately 46%, 43% and 43%, respectively, of our total revenue. We believe global demand for our platform will continue to develop as organizations experience the benefits that our platform can provide to international enterprises with complex planning needs spanning multiple geographies. Accordingly, we believe there is significant opportunity to grow our international business. We have invested, and plan to invest, ahead of this potential demand in personnel, marketing, and access to data center capacity to support our international growth.\nPartner ecosystem. Our partner ecosystem extends our geographic coverage, accelerates the usage and adoption of our platform, and enables more efficient delivery of service solutions. We intend to augment and deepen our partnerships with strategic and advisory consulting, systems integration, public cloud, and technology firms. We believe our partners\u2019 scale and route to market can significantly contribute to our ability to penetrate our addressable market, extend our geographic coverage, and extend usage and adoption of our platform.\nProduct velocity. We have invested and intend to continue to invest significantly in research and development in an effort to enhance and expand the functionality of our platform, to attract and retain development personnel, and to protect our market-leading technology advantage. We have a well-defined technology roadmap to introduce new features and functionality to our platform that we believe will improve our ability to generate revenue by broadening the appeal of our platform to potential new customers as well as increasing the opportunities for further expanding the use of our platform by existing customers. We are also investing to further enhance the functionality, intelligence, user experience, scale, extensibility and security of our platform. We will need to continue to focus on bringing cutting-edge technology to market in order to remain competitive.\nComponents of Results of Operations\nRevenue\nWe offer subscriptions to our cloud-based planning platform. We derive our revenue primarily from subscription fees and, to a lesser degree, from professional services fees. Subscription revenue consists primarily of fees to provide our customers access to our cloud-based platform. Professional services revenue includes fees from assisting customers in implementing and optimizing the use of our cloud-based platform. These services include implementation, consulting, and training.\nSubscription Revenue\nSubscription revenue accounted for 91%, 88% and 87% of our total revenue for fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Subscription revenue is driven primarily by the number of customers, the number of users at each customer, the price of user subscriptions, and renewal rates.\nSubscription fees are recognized ratably as revenue over the contract term beginning on the date the platform is made available to the customer. Our new business subscriptions typically have a term of two to three years. We generally invoice our customers in annual installments at the beginning of each year within the subscription period. Amounts that have been invoiced are initially recorded as deferred revenue and are recognized ratably over the subscription period.\nMost of our contracts are non-cancelable over the contract term. We had remaining performance obligations, or backlog, in the amount of $817.6 million and $656.2 million as of January 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, consisting of both billed and unbilled consideration.\nBecause we recognize revenue from subscription fees ratably over the term of the contract, changes in our contracting activity in the near term may not impact our reported revenue until future periods.\nProfessional Services Revenue\nProfessional services revenue is generally recognized as the services are rendered for time and material contracts, or on a proportional performance basis for fixed price contracts. The substantial majority of our professional service contracts are on a time and materials basis. Implementations generally take one to six months to complete depending upon the scope of engagement with the customer. Our professional services revenue fluctuates from quarter to quarter as a result of the requirements, complexity, and timing of our customers\u2019 implementation projects.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of Subscription Revenue\nCost of subscription revenue primarily consists of costs related to providing cloud applications, compensation and other employee-related expenses for data center staff, including salaries and bonuses, benefits, and stock-based compensation, payments to outside service providers, customer service, data center and networking expenses, depreciation expenses, and amortization of capitalized software development costs.\nCost of Professional Services Revenue\nCost of professional services revenue primarily consists of costs related to providing implementation and configuration services, optimization services and training services, personnel-related costs directly associated with our professional services and training departments, including salaries and bonuses, benefits, and stock-based compensation, the costs of contracted third-party vendors, and travel.\nProfessional services associated with the implementation and configuration of our subscription platform are performed directly by our services team, as well as by contracted third-party vendors. When third-party vendors invoice us for services performed for our customers, those fees are recognized as expense as incurred.\nOperating Expenses\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of personnel-related costs for our development team, including salaries and bonuses, benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and allocated overhead costs. We have invested, and intend to continue to invest, in developing technology to support our growth. We capitalize certain software development costs that are attributable to developing new features and adding incremental functionality to our platform, and amortize such costs as costs of subscription revenue over the estimated life of the new incremental functionality, which is generally two to three years. We plan to increase our investment in research and development for the foreseeable future as we focus on further developing our platform and enhancing its use cases. However, we expect our research and development expenses to decrease as a percentage of our total revenue over time, although they may fluctuate as a percentage of our total revenue from period to period.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel-related costs directly associated with our sales and marketing staff, including salaries and bonuses, benefits, commissions, and stock-based compensation. Other sales and marketing costs include promotional events to promote our brand, including our Anaplan Connected Planning Xperience (CPX) user conferences, advertising, and allocated overhead costs. We plan to increase our investment in sales and marketing over the foreseeable future, primarily stemming from increased headcount in sales and marketing, and investment in brand- and product-marketing efforts. However, we expect our sales and marketing expenses to decrease as a percentage of our total revenue over time, although they may fluctuate as a percentage of our total revenue from period to period.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel-related costs associated with our executive, finance, legal, and human resources personnel, including salaries and bonuses, benefits, and stock-based compensation expense, professional fees for external legal, accounting and other consulting services, and allocated overhead costs. We expect to increase the size of our general and administrative function to support the growth of our business and continue to incur additional expenses as a result of operating as a public company. As a result, we expect the dollar amount of our general and administrative expenses to increase for the foreseeable future. However, we expect our general and administrative expenses to decrease as a percentage of our total revenue over time, although they may fluctuate as a percentage of our total revenue from period to period.\nInterest Income (Expense), Net\nInterest income (expense), net consists primarily of interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents, net of interest expense from our finance leases.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther income (expense), net consists primarily of foreign exchange gains and losses.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nProvision for income taxes consists primarily of income taxes related to foreign and state jurisdictions in which we conduct business. We maintain a full valuation allowance on our federal, state, U.K. and Israel deferred tax assets as we have concluded that it is not more likely than not that the deferred assets will be utilized.\nResults of Operations\nThe following tables set forth selected consolidated statements of operations data for each of the years indicated:\nYear Ended January 31,\n(In thousands)\nRevenue:\nSubscription revenue\n$\n408,199\n$\n307,890\n$\n208,605\nProfessional services revenue\n39,556\n40,132\n32,037\nTotal revenue\n447,755\n348,022\n240,642\nCost of revenue:\nCost of subscription revenue (1)\n69,802\n51,460\n36,500\nCost of professional services revenue (1)\n39,177\n39,317\n30,898\nTotal cost of revenue\n108,979\n90,777\n67,398\nGross profit\n338,776\n257,245\n173,244\nOperating expenses:\nResearch and development (1)\n100,523\n68,396\n48,998\nSales and marketing (1)\n302,002\n250,430\n176,323\nGeneral and administrative (1)\n90,030\n86,852\n76,186\nTotal operating expenses\n492,555\n405,678\n301,507\nLoss from operations\n(153,779\n)\n(148,433\n)\n(128,263\n)\nInterest income (expense), net\n4,478\n1,921\nOther income (expense), net\n3,736\n(809\n)\n(1,465\n)\nLoss before income taxes\n(149,876\n)\n(144,764\n)\n(127,807\n)\nProvision for income taxes\n(4,091\n)\n(4,453\n)\n(3,209\n)\nNet loss\n$\n(153,967\n)\n$\n(149,217\n)\n$\n(131,016\n)\n(1) Includes stock-based compensation\nexpense as follows:\nCost of subscription revenue\n$\n3,822\n$\n2,547\n$\nCost of professional services revenue\n2,481\n2,199\nResearch and development\n18,715\n10,608\n3,826\nSales and marketing\n48,210\n34,428\n15,475\nGeneral and administrative\n30,398\n30,264\n31,823\nTotal stock-based compensation expense\n$\n103,626\n$\n80,046\n$\n52,806\nFiscal Year 2021 Compared to Fiscal Year 2020\nRevenue\nYear Ended January 31,\n% Change\n(In thousands)\nSubscription revenue\n$\n408,199\n$\n307,890\n%\nProfessional services revenue\n39,556\n40,132\n(1\n)\nTotal revenue\n$\n447,755\n$\n348,022\nTotal revenue was $447.8 million in fiscal 2021 compared to $348.0 million in fiscal 2020, an increase of $99.8 million, or 29%.\nSubscription revenue was $408.2 million, or 91% of total revenue, in fiscal 2021, compared to $307.9 million, or 88% of total revenue, in fiscal 2020.

The decrease of $0.5 million, or 1%, in professional services revenue was primarily driven by lower sales of our professional services due to timing of our customers\u2019 implementation projects. This also represents a continued decline in professional services revenue as a percentage of total revenue from 12% to 9%, primarily due to our strategy of shifting professional services revenue to the members of our growing partner ecosystem.\nCost of Revenue\nYear Ended January 31,\n% Change\n(In thousands)\nCost of subscription revenue\n$\n69,802\n$\n51,460\n%\nCost of professional services revenue\n39,177\n39,317\n-\nTotal cost of revenue\n$\n108,979\n$\n90,777\nTotal cost of revenue was $109.0 million in fiscal 2021 compared to $90.8 million in fiscal 2020, an increase of $18.2 million, or 20%.\nCost of subscription revenue was $69.8 million in fiscal 2021 compared to $51.5 million in fiscal 2020, an increase of $18.3 million, or 36%. The increase in cost of subscription revenue was primarily due to an increase in hosting and consulting costs of $5.2 million, an increase in amortization of our equipment leases and capitalized software development costs of $4.5 million, an increase in salary and bonuses, and benefits costs of $4.0 million, including stock-based compensation, and an increase in software license and maintenance costs of $3.7 million.\nCost of professional services revenue was $39.2 million in fiscal 2021 compared to $39.3 million in fiscal 2020, a decrease of $0.1 million. The decrease in cost of professional services revenue was primarily due to a decrease in the partner implementation costs related to a decrease in partners activities of $1.5 million, and a decrease in travel related expenses of $0.9 million due to the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by an increase in salary and bonuses, and benefits costs of $2.0 million, including stock-based compensation.\nGross Profit and Gross Margin\nYear Ended January 31,\n% Change\n(In thousands)\nSubscription gross profit\n$\n338,397\n$\n256,430\n%\nProfessional services gross profit\n(53\n)\nTotal gross profit\n$\n338,776\n$\n257,245\nSubscription gross margin\n%\n%\nProfessional services gross margin\n%\n%\nTotal gross margin\n%\n%\nGross profit was $338.8 million in fiscal 2021 compared to $257.2 million in fiscal 2020, an increase of $81.6 million, or 32%. The increase in gross profit was the result of the increases in our subscription revenue primarily driven by existing customers expanding their use of our platform and acquisition of new customers in fiscal 2021.\nGross margin was 76% in fiscal 2021 compared to 74% in fiscal 2020. The increase in gross margin was primarily due to the increase in subscription revenue, which generates a significantly higher gross margin than our professional services revenue, as a percentage of total revenue.\nOur gross margins can fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of the requirements, complexity, and timing of our customers\u2019 implementation projects that can vary significantly.\nOperating Expenses\nYear Ended January 31,\n% Change\n(In thousands)\nOperating expense:\nResearch and development\n$\n100,523\n$\n68,396\n%\nSales and marketing\n302,002\n250,430\nGeneral and administrative\n90,030\n86,852\nTotal operating expenses\n$\n492,555\n$\n405,678\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses were $100.5 million in fiscal 2021 compared to $68.4 million in fiscal 2020, an increase of $32.1 million, or 47%. The increase was primarily due to an increase in salary and bonuses, and benefits costs related to an increase in headcount of $22.3 million (which included an increase in stock-based compensation of $8.1 million), and an increase in hosting and consulting costs of $5.2 million.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expenses were $302.0 million in fiscal 2021 compared to $250.4 million in fiscal 2020, an increase of $51.6 million, or 21%. The increase was primarily due to an increase in salary and bonuses, and benefits costs related to an increase in headcount of $55.6 million (which included an increase in stock-based compensation of $13.8 million and an increase in commission expenses of $10.0 million), partially offset by a reduction of $13.3 million of discretionary spend such as marketing events and travel related expenses due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $90.0 million in fiscal 2021 compared to $86.9 million in fiscal 2020, an increase of $3.1 million, or 4%. The increase was primarily due to an increase in salary and bonuses, and benefits costs related to an increase in headcount of $5.5 million, including stock-based compensation, and an increase in allowance for credit losses of $0.8 million primarily stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by decreases in workplace and recruiting expenses of $2.4 million, and other general expenses.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nYear Ended January 31,\n% Change\n(In thousands)\nInterest income (expense), net\n$\n$\n4,478\n(96\n)\n%\nOther income (expense), net\n3,736\n(809\n)\nInterest income (expense), net\nInterest income (expense), net decreased by $4.3 million, or 96%, in fiscal 2021. The decrease in interest income (expense), net was primarily due to lower interest income from our cash and cash equivalents as a result of lower interest rates in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020.\nOther income (expense), net\nOther income (expense), net was a gain of $3.7 million in fiscal 2021 compared to a loss of $0.8 million in fiscal 2020, an increase in income of $4.5 million. The change was primarily due to currency fluctuations and the related remeasurements during the fiscal years presented.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nYear Ended January 31,\n% Change\n(In thousands)\nProvision for income taxes\n$\n4,091\n$\n4,453\n(8\n)\n%\nProvision for income taxes was $4.1 million in fiscal 2021 compared to $4.5 million in fiscal 2020, a decrease of $0.4 million, or 8%. The decrease in provision for income taxes was primarily related to a decrease in income generated from intercompany cost-plus arrangements in certain European and Asian countries, partially offset by discrete tax expenses relating to gains from intercompany transactions.\nQuarterly Financial Data\nThe following tables set forth selected unaudited quarterly consolidated statements of operations data for each of the eight quarters in fiscal 2021 and 2020. The information for each of these eight quarters has been prepared on the same basis as the audited annual consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and, in the opinion of management, includes all adjustments, which consist only of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for the fair presentation of the results of operations for these periods in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP.\nThis data should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These quarterly operating results are not necessarily indicative of our operating results for a full year or any future period.\nThree Months Ended\nJanuary 31,\nOctober 31,\nJuly 31,\nApril 30,\nJanuary 31,\nOctober 31,\nJuly 31,\nApril 30,\n(in thousands, except per share data)\nTotal revenue\n$\n122,525\n$\n114,875\n$\n106,511\n$\n103,844\n$\n98,242\n$\n89,410\n$\n84,540\n$\n75,830\nGross profit\n$\n93,103\n$\n85,500\n$\n81,069\n$\n79,104\n$\n74,033\n$\n66,926\n$\n62,033\n$\n54,253\nLoss from operations\n$\n(41,471\n)\n$\n(35,873\n)\n$\n(37,675\n)\n$\n(38,760\n)\n$\n(37,593\n)\n$\n(32,524\n)\n$\n(41,207\n)\n$\n(37,109\n)\nNet loss\n$\n(42,049\n)\n$\n(36,792\n)\n$\n(35,524\n)\n$\n(39,602\n)\n$\n(36,683\n)\n$\n(34,701\n)\n$\n(40,642\n)\n$\n(37,191\n)\nNet loss per share, basic and diluted\n$\n(0.29\n)\n$\n(0.26\n)\n$\n(0.26\n)\n$\n(0.29\n)\n$\n(0.27\n)\n$\n(0.26\n)\n$\n(0.31\n)\n$\n(0.30\n)\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of January 31, 2021, our principal sources of liquidity were cash and cash equivalents totaling $321.0 million, which were held for working capital purposes and strategic initiatives. Our cash equivalents are comprised primarily of money market funds and bank deposits.\nCash from operations could be affected by various risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, such as timing of cash collections from our customers and other risks detailed in Part I, Item 1A, \u201cRisk Factors\u201d. We believe our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our projected operating requirements for at least the next 12 months. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our pace of growth, subscription renewal activity, the timing and extent of spend to support research and development efforts, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, the introduction of new and enhanced platform offerings, and the continuing market acceptance of the platform. We may in the future enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, services and technologies, and intellectual property rights. We may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. In the event that additional financing is required from outside sources, we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired, our business, operating results, and financial condition would be adversely affected.\nLoan and Credit Facility Agreements\nIn April 2020, we entered into the Third Amendment to Credit Agreement and First Amendment to Collateral Agreement with Wells Fargo as administrative agent and a lender (the \u201cThird Amendment\u201d). Among other things, the Third Amendment further amends the Credit Agreement entered into with Wells Fargo in April 2018, as amended in September 2018 and October 2019 (the \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d) in order to: (1) increase the aggregate revolving credit commitment amount by $20.0 million, so that we may borrow up to $60.0 million under a secured revolving credit facility, subject to the terms of the Credit Agreement including the accounts receivable borrowing base, for general corporate purposes, and (2) extend the maturity date of the revolving credit facility until April 23, 2022. Also, pursuant to the Third Amendment, any loans drawn on the credit facility will incur interest at a rate equal to the highest of (A) the prime rate, (B) the federal funds rate plus 0.5%, and (C) the one-month LIBOR plus 1%. Interest is payable monthly in arrears with the principal and any accrued and unpaid interest due on April 23, 2022. As of January 31, 2021, we had not drawn down any amounts under this agreement.\nAs part of the Credit Agreement, we granted Wells Fargo a first priority lien in our accounts receivable, all of the issued shares of capital stock and equity interests in certain of our subsidiaries, and other corporate assets and agreed not to pledge our intellectual property to other parties. The Credit Agreement, as amended by the Third Amendment, includes affirmative and negative covenants, including financial covenants requiring the maintenance of: (1) minimum tangible net worth (defined as assets, excluding intangible assets, less liabilities) as of the last day of any fiscal quarter of not less than $150.0 million for any fiscal quarter ending on or prior to January 31, 2021 and $125.0 million for any fiscal quarter ending thereafter, and (2) minimum billings for the most recent twelve months ending as of the last day of any fiscal quarter of not less than $350.0 million. As of January 31, 2021, we were in compliance with the financial covenants contained in the Credit Agreement.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods presented:\nYear Ended January 31,\n(In thousands)\nNet cash used in operating activities\n$\n(4,631\n)\n$\n(14,405\n)\n$\n(45,853\n)\nNet cash used in investing activities\n(15,743\n)\n(48,506\n)\n(22,519\n)\nNet cash provided by financing activities\n27,832\n46,506\n279,923\nOperating Activities\nNet cash used in operating activities of $4.6 million for fiscal 2021, was primarily due to a net loss of $154.0 million and non-cash foreign currency remeasurement gains of $4.2 million, partially offset by non-cash charges for stock-based compensation of $103.6 million, amortization of deferred commissions\nof $33.4 million, depreciation and amortization of $25.8 million, reduction of operating lease right-of-use assets and accretion of operating lease liabilities $10.1 million, and other non-cash items of $3.1 million. Changes in working capital were unfavorable to cash flows from operations by $22.5 million primarily due to an increase in deferred commissions of $65.6 million related to commissions capitalized on our sales, an increase in accounts receivable of $39.9 million primarily due to increased customer billings, net payments for operating lease liabilities of $9.3 million, and an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets of $6.1 million, partially offset by an increase in deferred revenue balance of $71.8 million due to increased customer billings, an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $21.2 million due to our growth and timing of payments, and an increase in other noncurrent liabilities of $6.6 million.\nNet cash used in operating activities of $14.4 million for fiscal 2020 was primarily due to a net loss of $149.2 million, partially offset by non-cash charges for stock-based compensation of $80.0 million, amortization of deferred commissions of $20.5 million, depreciation and amortization of $20.3 million, and reduction of operating lease right-of-use assets and accretion of operating lease liabilities of $10.7 million. Changes in working capital were favorable to cash flows from operations by $2.6 million primarily due to an increase in deferred revenue balance of $67.5 million due to increases in sales, and an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $19.6 million due to our growth and the timing of payments, partially offset by an increase in deferred commissions of $54.0 million related to increases in our sales, an increase in accounts receivable of $16.3 million due to increased customer billings, payments for operating lease liabilities of $10.4 million, and an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets of $4.3 million.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities for fiscal 2021 of $15.7 million was related to the capitalization of internal-use software of $10.1 million as we expanded our platform and increased our development efforts, and purchases of property and equipment of $5.7 million related to our growth.\nNet cash used in investing activities for fiscal 2020 of $48.5 million was related to the net cash payment of $33.5 million for our acquisition of Mintigo, the capitalization of internal-use software of $11.0 million as we expanded our platform and increased our development efforts, and purchases of property and equipment of $4.0 million related to our growth.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities for fiscal 2021 of $27.8 million consisted primarily of $18.8 million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options and $17.7 million in proceeds from employee stock purchase plan, partially offset by $8.7 million principal payment on finance lease obligations.\nNet cash provided by financing activities for fiscal 2020 of $46.5 million consisted primarily of $21.9 million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options, $18.6 million in proceeds from sales of stock under our employee stock purchase plan, and $11.5 million from the repayment of promissory notes, partially offset by $5.4 million principal payment on finance lease obligations.\nCommitments and Contractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes our non-cancelable contractual obligations as of January 31, 2021:\nPayments Due by Period\nTotal\nLess\nThan\n1 Year\n1 - 3\nYears\n3 - 5\nYears\nMore\nThan\n5 Years\n(In thousands)\nOperating lease obligations, including\nimputed interest\n$\n44,347\n$\n9,944\n$\n17,876\n$\n13,833\n$\n2,694\nFinance lease obligations, including\nimputed interest\n14,272\n8,613\n5,659\n-\n-\nNon-cancelable purchase obligations (1)\n187,506\n30,250\n70,691\n70,490\n16,075\nTotal\n$\n246,125\n$\n48,807\n$\n94,226\n$\n84,323\n$\n18,769\n(1) Includes commitments entered into subsequent to the balance sheet date.\nThe contractual commitment amounts in the table above are associated with agreements that are enforceable and legally binding. Obligations under contracts that we can cancel without a significant penalty are not included in the table above. Purchase orders issued in the ordinary course of business are not included in the table above, as these purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements and are generally fulfilled within short time periods.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThrough January 31, 2021, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated organizations or financial partnerships, such as structured finance or special purpose entities that would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Actual results may differ from these estimates. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and our actual results, our future financial statements will be affected.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue from contracts with customers using the five-step method described in Note 1 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. At contract inception we evaluate whether two or more contracts should be combined and accounted for as a single contract and whether the combined or single contract includes more than one performance obligation. We combine contracts entered into at or near the same time with the same customer if we determine that the contracts are negotiated as a package with a single commercial objective; the amount of consideration to be paid in one contract depends on the price or performance of the other contract; or the services promised in the contracts are a single performance obligation.\nOur performance obligations consist of (i) subscription and support services and (ii) professional and other services. Contracts that contain multiple performance obligations require an allocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation based on their relative standalone selling price. We determine standalone selling price, or SSP, for all our performance obligations using observable inputs, such as standalone sales and historical contract pricing. SSP is consistent with our overall pricing objectives, taking into consideration the type of subscription services and professional and other services. SSP also reflects the amount we would charge for that performance obligation if it were sold separately in a standalone sale, and the price we would sell to similar customers in similar circumstances.\nIn general, we satisfy the majority of our performance obligations over time as we transfer the promised services to our customers. We review the contract terms and conditions to evaluate the timing and amount of revenue recognition; the related contract balances; and our remaining performance obligations. We also estimate the number of hours expected to be incurred based on an expected hours approach that considers historical hours incurred for similar projects based on the types and sizes of customers. These evaluations require judgment that could affect the timing and amount of revenue recognized.\nDeferred Commissions\nWe capitalize sales commissions that are considered to be incremental to the acquisition of customer contracts, which are then amortized over an estimated period of benefit. To determine the period of benefit of our deferred commissions, we evaluate the type of costs incurred, the nature of the related benefit, and the specific facts and circumstances of our arrangements. We determine the period of\nbenefit for commissions paid for the acquisition of the initial subscription contract by taking into consideration our historical initial and renewal contractual terms and estimated renewal rates. We determine the period of benefit for commissions on renewal subscription contracts by considering the average contractual term for renewal contracts. We evaluate these assumptions at least annually and periodically review whether events or changes in circumstances have occurred that could impact the period of benefit.\nBusiness Combinations, Goodwill, and Acquisition-Related Intangible Assets\nAccounting for business combinations requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions. We use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately allocate the purchase consideration to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values, with the excess recorded to goodwill. Critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows, expected asset lives, and discount rates. The amounts and useful lives assigned to acquisition-related intangible assets impact the amount and timing of future amortization expense.\nWe use estimates, assumptions, and judgments when assessing the recoverability of goodwill and acquisition-related intangible assets. We test for impairment on an annual basis, during the fourth quarter or more frequently if a significant event or circumstance indicates impairment. We also evaluate the estimated remaining useful lives of acquisition-related intangible assets for changes in circumstances that warrant a revision to the remaining periods of amortization.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee \u201cSummary of Business and Significant Accounting Policies\u201d in Note 1 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.",
    "item_7A": "item 7a. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk\nOur results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly changes in the British Pound Sterling, Euro, Swedish Krona and Singapore Dollar. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, including those resulting from COVID-19 pandemic, may cause variability in our results of operations. Impacts to our operations from changes in foreign currency have been fairly limited to date and thus we have not instituted a hedging program. We expect our international operations to continue to grow in the near term and we will monitor our foreign currency exposure to determine when we should begin a hedging program. A majority of our agreements have been and we expect will continue to be denominated in U.S. dollars. A hypothetical 10% increase or decrease in the relative value of the U.S. dollar to other currencies would not have had a material effect on operating results for fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019.\nInterest Rate Sensitivity\nWe are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business. These risks primarily include interest rate sensitivities. As of January 31, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents of $321.0 million, which consisted primarily of money market funds and bank deposits. The carrying amount of our cash equivalents reasonably approximates fair values. Due to the short-term nature of our money market funds, we believe that exposure to changes in interest rates will not have a material impact on the fair value of our cash equivalents. A hypothetical 10% change in interest rates would not have had a material impact on our operating results for fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019.",

We also have audited the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of January 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended January 31, 2021, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2021 based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\nChange in Accounting Principle\nAs discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has changed its method of accounting for leases as of February 1, 2019 due to the adoption of Accounting Standards Codification Topic 842, Leases.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company\u2019s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management\u2019s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included\nperforming such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nAmortization period for capitalized sales commissions\nAs discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company capitalizes sales commissions related to the acquisition of customer contracts and amortizes them over the estimated period of benefit. In determining the period of benefit, the Company considers data including historical initial and renewal contractual terms and estimated renewal rates. The Company estimated the period of benefit for the initial acquisition of a contract to be five years. The Company amortized $33,404 thousand of deferred commissions during the year ended January 31, 2021 and had $119,202 thousand of deferred commissions capitalized as of January 31, 2021.\nWe identified the evaluation of the amortization period for capitalized sales commissions related to the acquisition of customer contracts as a critical audit matter. Evaluating the Company\u2019s assessment of the relevant information used in the model to determine the estimated period of benefit involved subjective auditor judgment.\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of an internal control related to the Company\u2019s capitalized sales commission process. This control related to the assessment of the model used and the determination of relevant information, and the re-assessment of the period of benefit. We considered the Company\u2019s assessment of the information used to estimate the period of benefit by evaluating its relevance against potential alternatives. We recalculated the Company\u2019s historical initial and renewal contractual terms. We compared the estimated renewal rates to a sample of historical customer contracts.\n/s/ KPMG LLP\nWe have served as the Company\u2019s auditor since 2013.\nSan Francisco, California\nMarch 12,

(the Company or Anaplan) was incorporated in Delaware on July 9, 2009 and is headquartered in San Francisco, California, with offices in multiple U.S. and international locations.\nThe Company provides a cloud-based Connected Planning platform that helps connect organizations and people to make better and faster decisions. The Company delivers its application over the Internet as a subscription service using a software-as-a-service (SaaS) model. The Company also offers professional services related to implementing and supporting its application.\nFiscal Year\nThe Company\u2019s fiscal year ends on January 31. References to fiscal 2021, for example, refer to the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) and include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries (collectively, the Company). All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Certain prior period amounts in the consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current period\u2019s presentation.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Such estimates include, but are not limited to, the determination of revenue recognition, the period of benefit for deferred commissions, the fair value of intangibles and stock awards issued, and the allowance for credit losses. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of the novel strain of coronavirus (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) as a global pandemic with widespread and detrimental effect on the global economy. The extent of the impact of COVID-19 on the Company's operational and financial performance will depend on certain developments, including the duration and spread of the pandemic, impact on the Company's customers, prospective customers, sales cycles, and employees, all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted. During fiscal 2021, the Company assessed the impact of COVID-19, including its estimate of credit losses for accounts receivable. As of the filing date of consolidated financial statements, the Company is not aware of any specific event or circumstance that would require updating significant estimates or judgments or revising the carrying value of the Company's assets or liabilities as presented in the consolidated financial statements. These estimates may change as new events occur and additional information is obtained. Actual results could differ from those estimates and any such differences may be material to its consolidated financial statements.\nForeign Currency\nThe functional currency of the Company\u2019s foreign subsidiaries is primarily their respective local currency. The Company translates all assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries to U.S. dollars at the current exchange rate as of the applicable consolidated balance sheet date. Revenue and expenses are translated at the average exchange rate prevailing during the period. The related unrealized gains and losses from foreign currency translation are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss as a separate component of stockholders\u2019 equity. Foreign currency transaction gains were $3.8 million for fiscal 2021. Foreign currency transaction losses were $0.4 million and $1.4 million for fiscal 2020 and\n2019, respectively, and are included in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of comprehensive loss.\nCash and Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash\nThe Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents are stated at fair value. Restricted cash represents cash held to collateralize lease obligations. The balance of restricted cash at the end of fiscal 2021 and 2020 was immaterial.\nFair Value Measurement\nThe Company\u2019s financial instruments, other than cash and restricted cash, consists principally of accounts receivable and accounts payable of which the fair value approximates the carrying value of these financial instruments because of their short-term nature.\nProperty and Equipment, net\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets, which is two or three years for all property and equipment, excluding leasehold improvements. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of 10 years or the remaining lease term.\nBusiness Combinations\nThe Company uses its best estimates and assumptions to assign fair value to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date. During the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, the Company may record adjustments to the fair value of these tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the fair value of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to the Company\u2019s consolidated statements of comprehensive loss.\nGoodwill, Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets\nThe Company performs a qualitative assessment on goodwill at least annually, during the fourth quarter, or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist, to determine if any events or circumstances exist, such as an adverse change in business climate or a decline in the overall industry that would indicate that it would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. If it is determined in the qualitative assessment that the fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not below its carrying amount, then the Company will perform a quantitative impairment test. The quantitative goodwill impairment test is performed by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. Any excess in the carrying value of a reporting unit\u2019s goodwill over its fair value is recognized as an impairment loss, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. For purposes of goodwill impairment testing, the Company has one reporting unit.\nAcquisition-related intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives. The Company evaluates long-lived assets, including property, equipment and leasehold improvements and other intangible assets subject to amortization, for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable based on expected future cash flows attributable to that asset or asset group. Recoverability of assets held and used is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of an asset or an asset group to estimated undiscounted future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group. If the carrying amount of an asset or asset group exceeds estimated undiscounted future cash flows, then an impairment charge would be recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset or asset group over its fair value. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell.\nThere were no material impairment charges recognized related to goodwill, intangible assets, or other long-lived assets during fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019.\nLeases\nThe Company adopted Accounting Standards Codification Topic 842 (ASC 842), Leases, effective February 1, 2019, using the effective date transition method, which applies the provisions of the new guidance at the effective date without adjusting the comparative periods presented. The Company elected to use certain practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance within the new guidance, which allows it to carry forward the historical accounting relating to lease identification and classification for existing leases upon adoption. The Company also elected not to use the hindsight practical expedient in determining the lease term and impairment of the right-of-use (ROU) assets and elected to keep operating leases with an initial term of 12 months or less off of its consolidated balance sheet. The Company elected not to separate lease and non-lease components for all classes of underlying assets.\nThe Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. The Company\u2019s lease agreements do not contain any material options to extend or terminate leases, any material residual value guarantees, any material restrictions or covenants, or any material variable lease payments. Any variable lease payments consist of common area maintenance, taxes and other costs and are expensed as incurred.\nROU assets represent the Company\u2019s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term at the commencement date. In determining the present value of lease payments, the Company uses its country specific incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the lease commencement date, including the lease term, for operating leases. The incremental borrowing rate is a hypothetical rate based on the Company\u2019s understanding of what its credit rating would be within each country. The operating lease ROU asset was valued at the amount of the lease liabilities adjusted for the remaining balance of unamortized lease incentives, prepaid rent, and deferred rent. Finance lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized based on the carrying amount of the lease assets and lease liabilities. The finance lease ROU asset also includes any remaining unamortized initial direct costs. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nConcentration of Risk and Significant Customers\nFinancial instruments that subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, and accounts receivable. The Company maintains its cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash with high-quality financial institutions with investment-grade ratings. A majority of the cash balances are with U.S. banks and are insured to the extent defined by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.\nThe Company markets its subscription and services in the United States and in foreign countries through its direct sales force and partners. No customer accounted for more than 10% of total revenue for fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019, or more than 10% of total accounts receivable as of January 31, 2021 and 2020.\nSegment Information\nThe Company operates in one operating segment. Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker, who is the chief executive officer, in deciding how to allocate resources and assessing performance. The Company\u2019s chief operating decision maker allocates resources and assesses performance based upon discrete financial information at the consolidated level.\nThe following table summarizes the Company\u2019s long-lived assets by geographic area, which consist of property and equipment, net and operating lease right-of-use assets:\nAs of January 31,\n(In thousands)\nLong-lived assets\nUnited States\n$\n61,111\n$\n67,104\nUnited Kingdom\n17,862\n15,235\nOther\n6,615\n4,175\nTotal\n$\n85,588\n$\n86,514\nRevenue by geographical region is discussed below in the Revenue Recognition disclosures.\nAccounts Receivable, net\nThe Company adopted Accounting Standards Codification Topic 326 (ASC 326), Financial Instruments - Credit Losses, effective February 1, 2020 using a modified retrospective approach.\nUnder ASC 326, accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount, net of allowance for credit losses. The Company regularly reviews the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses based on a combination of factors. In establishing any required allowance, management considers historical losses adjusted for current market conditions, the Company\u2019s customers\u2019 financial condition, the amount of any receivables in dispute, the current receivables aging, current payment terms and expectations of forward-looking loss estimates. Accounts receivable deemed uncollectable are charged against the allowance for credit losses when identified.\nAs of January 31, 2021, the allowance for credit losses reflects increased collectability concerns stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic. The allowance for credit losses was $3.2 million and $1.0 million as of January 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company derives revenue primarily from sales of subscription services and, to a lesser degree, from professional services. Revenue is recognized when a customer obtains access to the platform and receives the related professional services. The amount of revenue recognized reflects the consideration that the Company expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for these services.\nThe Company determines revenue recognition through the following steps:\n1. Identification of the contract, or contracts, with the customer\n2. Identification of the performance obligations in the contract\n3. Determination of the transaction price\n4. Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract\n5. Recognition of the revenue when, or as, a performance obligation is satisfied\nSubscription Revenue\nThe Company generates revenue primarily from sales of subscriptions to access its cloud-based business and execution planning platform. Subscription arrangements with customers do not provide the customer with the right to take possession of the software operating the platform. Instead, customers are granted continuous access to the platform over the contractual period. A time-elapsed method is used to measure progress because the Company\u2019s obligation is to provide continuous service over the contractual period. Accordingly, the fixed consideration related to subscription revenue is recognized ratably over the contract term beginning on the date access to the platform is provided.\nThe typical subscription term is two to three years and customers are generally invoiced in annual installments at the beginning of each year within the subscription period. Most contracts are non-cancelable over the contractual term. Some customers have the option to purchase additional subscription services at a stated price. These options are evaluated on a case-by-case basis but generally do not provide a material right as they are priced within a range of prices provided to other customers for the same products and, as such, would not result in a separate performance obligation.\nProfessional Services Revenue\nProfessional services revenue consists of fees associated with implementation or consultation services, and training. Professional services do not result in significant customization of the subscription service and are considered distinct. A substantial majority of the professional service contracts are recognized on a time and materials basis and the related revenue is recognized as the service hours are performed. For time and materials projects, the Company invoices for professional services as the work is incurred and in arrears.\nContracts with Multiple Performance Obligations\nMost contracts with customers contain multiple performance obligations that are distinct and accounted for separately. The transaction price is allocated to the separate performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price (SSP) basis. The Company determines SSP for all performance obligations using observable inputs, such as standalone sales and historical contract pricing. SSP is consistent with the Company\u2019s overall pricing objectives, taking into consideration the type of subscription services and professional and other services. SSP also reflects the amount the Company would charge for that performance obligation if it were sold separately in a standalone sale, and the price the Company would sell to similar customers in similar circumstances.\nVariable Consideration\nRevenue from sales is recorded based on the transaction price, which includes estimates of variable consideration.\nVariable consideration may exist where a customer has purchased professional services that are sold on a time and materials basis. The Company estimates the number of hours expected to be incurred based on an expected values approach that considers historical hours incurred for similar projects based on the types and sizes of customers.\nDisaggregation of Revenue\nThe following table summarizes the revenue by region based on the shipping address of customers who have contracted to use the Company\u2019s cloud-based application:\nYear Ended January 31,\nAmount\nPercentage\nof Revenue\nAmount\nPercentage\nof Revenue\nAmount\nPercentage\nof Revenue\n(In thousands, except percentage data)\nAmericas\n$\n253,775\n%\n$\n205,345\n%\n$\n141,595\n%\nEMEA\n144,260\n110,057\n78,868\nAPAC\n49,720\n32,620\n20,179\nTotal\n$\n447,755\n%\n$\n348,022\n%\n$\n240,642\n%\nThe United States and the United Kingdom were the only two countries that represented more than 10% of the Company\u2019s revenues in any period, comprised of $243.7 million and 54%, $197.6 million and 57%, and $136.8 million and 57% for the United States in fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively, and $53.3 million and 12%, $41.5 million and 12%, and $32.3 million and 13% for the United Kingdom in fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.\nContract Balances\nContract assets represent revenue recognized for contracts that have not yet been invoiced to customers, typically for multi-year arrangements. Total contract assets were $0.3 million and $0.2 million as of January 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, which were included within prepaid expenses and other current assets on the consolidated balance sheets.\nContract liabilities consist of deferred revenue. Revenue is deferred when the Company has the right to invoice in advance of performance under a contract. The current portion of deferred revenue balances are recognized over the following 12-month period. The amount of revenue recognized in fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019 that was included in deferred revenue at the beginning of each period was $216.1 million, $149.6 million, and $101.0 million, respectively.\nDeferred Commissions\nThe Company capitalizes sales commissions that are incremental due to the acquisition of customer contracts. These costs are recorded as deferred commissions on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company determines whether costs should be deferred based on its sales compensation plans, if the commissions are in fact incremental and would not have occurred absent the customer contract.\nSales commissions for renewal of a subscription contract are not considered commensurate with the commissions paid for the acquisition of the initial subscription contract given the substantive difference in commission rates between new and renewal contracts. Commissions paid upon the initial acquisition of a contract are amortized over an estimated period of benefit of five years, while commissions paid related to renewal contracts are amortized over the renewal term. Amortization is recognized on a straight-line basis commensurate with the pattern of revenue recognition. Commissions paid on professional services are typically expensed as incurred. The Company determines the period of benefit for commissions paid for the acquisition of the initial subscription contract by taking into consideration the historical initial and renewal contractual terms and estimated renewal rates. The Company determines the period of benefit for renewal subscription contracts by considering the average contractual term for renewal contracts. Amortization of deferred commissions is included in sales and marketing expense in the consolidated statements of comprehensive loss.\nThe Company periodically reviews deferred commissions to determine whether events or changes in circumstances have occurred that could impact the period of benefit. There were no impairment losses recorded during the periods presented.\nThe following table represents a rollforward of the Company\u2019s deferred commissions:\nAs of January 31,\n(In thousands)\nBeginning balance\n$\n83,937\n$\n50,890\nAdditions to deferred commissions\n65,639\n53,978\nAmortization of deferred commissions\n(33,404\n)\n(20,508\n)\nForeign currency translation effect of deferred\ncommissions\n3,030\n(423\n)\nEnding balance\n$\n119,202\n$\n83,937\nDeferred commissions, current (to be\nrecognized in next 12 months)\n36,797\n25,990\nDeferred commissions, net of current portion\n82,405\n57,947\nTotal deferred commissions\n$\n119,202\n$\n83,937\nRemaining Performance Obligations\nAs of January 31, 2021, the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations was $817.6 million, which consists of both billed consideration in the amount of $295.5 million and unbilled consideration in the amount of $522.1 million that the Company expects to recognize as revenue. The Company expects to cumulatively recognize approximately 51% and 83% of this amount as revenue in the next 12 months and 24 months, respectively, with the remaining balance recognized thereafter.\nThe Company applied a practical expedient allowing it not to disclose the amount of the transaction price allocated to the remaining performance obligations for contracts with an original expected duration of one year or less.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of Subscription Revenue\nCost of subscription revenue primarily consists of costs related to providing cloud applications, compensation and other employee-related expenses for data center staff, payments to outside service providers, customer service, data center and networking expenses, depreciation expenses, and amortization of capitalized software development costs.\nCost of Professional Services Revenue\nCost of professional services primarily consists of costs related to providing implementation services, optimization services, and training, and includes compensation and other employee-related expenses for professional services staff, costs of subcontractors, and travel.\nAdvertising Costs\nAdvertising costs are expensed as incurred in sales and marketing expense and amounted to $13.7 million, $17.7 million, and $15.1 million for fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.\nStock-Based Compensation\nPrior to the Initial Public Offering (IPO), the Company\u2019s board of directors determined the fair value of its common stock using various valuation methodologies, including valuation analyses performed by third-party valuation firms. After the IPO, the Company uses the publicly quoted market closing price as reported on the New York Stock Exchange as the fair value of its common stock.\nThe Company measures the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments, including stock options, stock purchase rights (SPRs), restricted stock units (RSUs), and purchase rights issued under the 2018 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP), based on the estimated grant-date fair value of the award. The Company calculates the fair value of options, SPRs, and the purchase rights issued under ESPP using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model and the related expense is recognized using the straight-line attribution approach. The vesting period is the period the employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award.\nThe Company\u2019s RSUs granted under the 2012 Stock Plan (2012 Plan) vest upon the satisfaction of both a service condition and a liquidity condition. Both the service and liquidity conditions must be met for the expense to be recognized. The liquidity condition was satisfied upon the IPO, and the Company recognized an expense of $29.9 million in the three months ended October 31, 2018 for the portion of the RSUs that had met the service condition as of such date.\nThe Company\u2019s RSUs granted after the IPO under the 2018 Equity Incentive Plan (2018 Plan) vest upon the satisfaction of a service condition and do not have a corresponding liquidity condition.\nStock-based compensation expense includes the impact of estimated forfeitures, and has been allocated between cost of revenue and operating expense lines based on the cost category of the respective award holders.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes are accounted for under the asset-and-liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.\nThe Company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the net amount that the Company believes is more likely than not to be realized. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, the Company has considered its historical levels of income, expectations of future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies. Because of the uncertainty of the realization of the deferred tax assets, the Company has recorded a valuation allowance against substantially all deferred tax assets. Realization of its deferred tax assets is dependent primarily upon future U.S., U.K. and Israel taxable income.\nThe Company recognizes the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not to be sustained. Recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized. Changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs.\nCapitalized Software Development Costs\nThe Company capitalizes software development costs in connection with its cloud-based business modeling and planning software application, as well as certain projects for internal use, as incurred. Qualifying computer software costs that are incurred during the application development stage are capitalized. The Company capitalized $13.6 million, $13.6 million, and $8.1 million related to software costs incurred during fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. Capitalized software costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the related software, which is generally two to three years, in cost of subscription revenue.\nNet Loss Per Share Attributable to Common Stockholders\nBasic net loss per share attributable to common stockholders is computed by dividing the net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders adjusts basic net loss per share for the potentially dilutive impact of stock options, restricted stock units, and stock repurchase rights. As the Company has reported losses for all periods presented, all potentially dilutive securities are antidilutive and accordingly, basic net loss per share equals diluted net loss per share.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740), Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes, which simplifies the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions to the general principles of income taxes and reducing the cost and complexity in accounting for income taxes. The guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2020, with early adoption permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption of this ASU to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13 \u201cFinancial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of credit Losses on Financial Instruments\u201d, which replaces the existing incurred loss impairment model with an expected credit loss model and requires a financial asset measured at amortized cost to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected. The Company adopted the new standard on February 1, 2020, using a modified retrospective approach and recorded a cumulative-effect adjustment to decrease retained earnings in the amount of $0.6 million for expected credit losses on accounts receivable at the adoption date.\n(2) Consolidated Balance Sheet Components\nProperty and Equipment, net\nProperty and equipment consisted of the following:\nAs of January 31,\n(In thousands)\nComputer and office equipment\n$\n58,231\n$\n46,986\nLeasehold improvements\n14,055\n12,728\nInternal-use software\n41,475\n29,445\nConstruction in progress\n6,941\n3,943\nProperty and equipment, gross\n120,702\n93,102\nLess: accumulated depreciation\n(69,099\n)\n(44,463\n)\nProperty and equipment, net\n$\n51,603\n$\n48,639\nDepreciation expense was $24.5 million, $19.9 million, and $12.7 million for fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.\nThe Company capitalized $13.6 million and $13.6 million in internal-use software for fiscal 2021 and 2020, of which $3.5 million and $2.3 million was stock-based compensation expense. Amortization of the capitalized internal-use software, included in total depreciation expense above was $9.3 million and $6.1 million for fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nAccrued Expenses\nAccrued expenses consisted of the following:\nAs of January 31,\n(In thousands)\nVendor accruals\n$\n11,262\n$\n11,098\nAccrued commission\n12,521\n10,033\nAccrued bonuses\n15,583\n14,279\nAccrued other payroll liabilities\n31,238\n21,077\nCurrent portion of finance lease obligations\n8,031\n6,956\nAccrued other\n22,872\n15,581\nAccrued expenses\n$\n101,507\n$\n79,024\nPreferred Stock\nAs of January 31, 2021 and 2020, the authorized preferred stock of the Company consisted of 25 million shares with a par value of $0.0001 per share. There were no shares of preferred stock issued and outstanding as of January 31, 2021 and 2020.\n(3) Bank Borrowing\nIn April 2020, the Company entered into the Third Amendment to Credit Agreement and First Amendment to Collateral Agreement with Wells Fargo as administrative agent and lender (the \u201cThird Amendment\u201d). Among other things, the Third Amendment further amends the Credit Agreement entered into with Wells Fargo in April 2018, as amended in September 2018 and October 2019 (the \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d) in order to: (1) increase the aggregate revolving credit commitment amount by $20.0 million, so that the Company may borrow up to $60.0 million under a secured revolving credit facility, subject to the terms of the Credit Agreement including the accounts receivable borrowing base, for general corporate purposes; and (2) extend the maturity date of the revolving credit facility until April 23, 2022. Also, pursuant to the Third Amendment, any loans drawn on the credit facility will incur interest at a rate equal to the highest of (A) the prime rate, (B) the federal funds rate plus 0.5%, and (C) the one-month LIBOR plus 1%. Interest is payable monthly in arrears with the principal and any accrued and unpaid interest due on April 23, 2022. As of January 31, 2021, the Company had not drawn down any amounts under this agreement. The Company was in compliance with the financial covenants contained in the agreement as of January 31, 2021.\n(4) Leases\nThe Company leases certain facilities under operating leases, and property and equipment under finance leases that expire from fiscal 2021 to 2028.\nThe components of lease expense were as follows:\nYear Ended January 31,\n(In thousands)\nOperating lease costs\n$\n10,060\n$\n10,748\nFinance lease costs\nAmortization of assets\n$\n8,510\n$\n5,737\nInterest on lease liabilities\nTotal finance lease costs\n$\n9,235\n$\n6,563\nSupplemental balance sheet information related to leases is as follows:\nAs of January 31,\n(In thousands)\nOperating leases:\nOperating lease ROU assets\n$\n33,985\n$\n37,875\nOperating lease liabilities, current portion\n$\n7,951\n$\n7,278\nOperating lease liabilities, net of current portion\n30,130\n34,017\nTotal operating lease liabilities\n$\n38,081\n$\n41,295\nFinance leases:\nProperty and equipment, gross\n$\n29,132\n$\n21,321\nLess: accumulated depreciation\n(15,876\n)\n(7,347\n)\nProperty and equipment, net\n$\n13,256\n$\n13,974\nAccrued expenses\n$\n8,031\n$\n6,956\nOther noncurrent liabilities\n5,761\n7,261\nTotal finance lease liabilities\n$\n13,792\n$\n14,217\nWeighted-average lease terms and discount rates are as follows:\nAs of January 31, 2021\nOperating Leases\nFinance Leases\nWeighted-average remaining lease terms\n4.8 years\n1.8 years\nWeighted-average discount rates\n5.5%\n4.4%\nAs of January 31, 2020\nOperating Leases\nFinance Leases\nWeighted-average remaining lease terms\n5.6 years\n2.1 years\nWeighted-average discount rates\n5.6%\n5.3%\nFuture minimum lease payments under operating leases and finance leases as of January 31, 2021 are as follows:\nAs of January 31, 2021\nOperating Leases\nFinance Leases\n(In thousands)\nYears ending January 31,\n$\n9,944\n$\n8,613\n9,417\n4,333\n8,459\n1,326\n6,962\n-\n6,871\n-\nThereafter\n2,694\n-\nTotal lease payments\n44,347\n14,272\nLess: amount representing interest\n(5,811\n)\n(480\n)\nLess: leases less than 12 months\n(455\n)\n-\nTotal lease liabilities\n$\n38,081\n$\n13,792\nThe Company enters into commitments to lease computer and office equipment for which the timing of the lease payments is not determined until the date of acceptance. As of January 31, 2021, the amounts related to these leases were approximately $7.4 million, which are to be paid over three years after the date of commencement.\n(5) Business Combination\nOn October 3, 2019, the Company acquired all outstanding shares of Mintigo Limited (Mintigo), an Israel-based company that provides a predictive analytics platform for marketing and sales. The acquisition of Mintigo is intended to enhance the predictive capabilities of the Company\u2019s solutions.\nThe following table summarizes the allocation of the purchase consideration to the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed:\n(In thousands)\nCash\n$\n2,735\nOther current and noncurrent assets\n1,793\nIntangible assets\n7,300\nGoodwill\n32,379\nDeferred revenue\n(2,100\n)\nOther current and noncurrent liabilities\n(5,880\n)\nTotal purchase consideration\n$\n36,227\nThe intangible assets acquired consist of developed technology of $5.2 million, and customer relationships of $2.1 million and were assigned useful lives of 5 and 7 years, respectively. The fair value of the developed technology was determined utilizing the multi-period excess earning method, and the with-and-without method was utilized to determine the fair value of customer relationships. The excess of the purchase consideration over the fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired\nand liabilities assumed was recorded as goodwill, and is attributable to Mintigo\u2019s workforce and the synergies expected to arise from the acquisition. The Company does not expect goodwill to be deductible for income tax purposes.\nAcquisition-related costs of approximately $1.3 million were included in general and administrative expenses during fiscal 2020 in the consolidated financial statements. The total cash consideration was $33.5 million, net of cash acquired of $2.7 million, and was fully paid in fiscal 2020.\nThe consolidated financial statements include the operating results of the acquisition from the date of acquisition. Pro forma results of operations for the acquisition have not been presented because the effects of the acquisition, individually and in the aggregate, were not material to the financial results of the Company.\nAdditionally, the Company entered into retention agreements with employees of Mintigo who joined the Company after the acquisition, totaling up to approximately $10.0 million. As payment of these retention agreements is contingent upon the continuous service of these employees with the Company, they are being accounted for as compensation over the required service period of three years commencing from the acquisition date.\n(6) Acquisition-Related Intangible Assets\nThe components of identifiable intangible assets included in \u201cOther noncurrent assets\u201d are as follows:\nAs of January 31, 2021\nIntangible\nAssets, Gross\nAccumulated\nAmortization\nIntangible\nAssets, Net\nRemaining\nAmortization\nPeriods\n(In thousands)\nDeveloped technology\n$\n5,200\n$\n(1,387\n)\n$\n3,813\n3.7 years\nCustomer relationships\n2,976\n(1,276\n)\n1,700\n5.7 years\nTotal\n$\n8,176\n$\n(2,663\n)\n$\n5,513\nAs of January 31, 2020\nIntangible\nAssets, Gross\nAccumulated\nAmortization\nIntangible\nAssets, Net\nRemaining\nAmortization\nPeriods\n(In thousands)\nDeveloped technology\n$\n5,200\n$\n(346\n)\n$\n4,854\n4.8 years\nCustomer relationships\n2,976\n(977\n)\n1,999\n6.8 years\nTotal\n$\n8,176\n$\n(1,323\n)\n$\n6,853\nAmortization expense of acquisition-related intangible assets was $1.3 million, $0.5 million and $0.2 million for fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.\nThe expected future intangible assets amortization as of January 31, 2021 is as follows:\nAs of January 31, 2021\n(In thousands)\nYears ending January 31,\n$\n1,340\n1,340\n1,340\nThereafter\nTotal future intangible assets amortization\n$\n5,513\n(7) Common Stock and Employee Stock Plans\nAs of January 31, 2021, the Company was authorized to issue 1,750,000,000 shares of common stock.

The awards have varying terms, but generally vest over four years, and are issued at the fair value of the shares of common stock on the date of grant.\nIn connection with the IPO, the 2012 Plan was terminated and the number of shares of common stock reserved under the 2012 Plan that were not issued or subject to outstanding awards under the 2012 Plan on the IPO date were transferred to the 2018 Plan. As of January 31, 2021, options to purchase and RSUs to convert to a total of 8.0 million shares of common stock were outstanding under the 2012 Plan pursuant to their original terms and no shares were available for future grant.\n2018 Stock Plan\nIn October 2018, the Company adopted the 2018 Plan, which became effective on October 11, 2018 and serves as the successor to the Company\u2019s 2012 Plan, and provides various forms of equity incentive awards to the Company\u2019s officers, employees and consultants at the discretion of the Board of Directors. The awards have varying terms, but generally vest over four years, and are issued at the fair value of the shares of common stock on the date of grant.\nAs of January 31, 2021, options to purchase and RSUs to convert to a total of 7.1 million shares of common stock were outstanding under the 2018 Plan. On the first day of each fiscal year of the Company during the term of the 2018 Plan, commencing on February 1, 2019 and ending on (and including) February 1, 2028, the aggregate number of common shares that may be issued under the 2018 Plan shall automatically increase by a number equal to the least of (a) 5% of the total number of common shares issued and outstanding on the last day of the preceding fiscal year, (b) 7,500,000 of common shares subject to anti-dilution adjustments or (c) a number of common shares determined by the Company\u2019s board of directors.\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan\nIn September 2018, the Company adopted the 2018 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the ESPP), which became effective on October 12, 2018. The ESPP initially authorizes the issuance of 2,700,000 shares of the Company\u2019s common stock pursuant to purchase rights granted to eligible employees. The number of shares of common stock available for sale under the ESPP also includes an annual increase on the first day of each fiscal year beginning on February 1, 2019, equal to the least of: (i) 1% of the outstanding shares of common stock as of the last day of the preceding fiscal year, (ii) 1,500,000 shares of stock subject to anti-dilution adjustments or (iii) such other amount as the board of directors may determine.\nExcept for the initial offering period, the ESPP provides for 12-month offering periods beginning June 21 and December 21 of each year, and each offering period will consist of two six-month purchase periods. The initial offering period began October 12, 2018 and ended on December 20, 2019. On each purchase date, eligible employees will purchase the shares at a price per share equal to 85% of the lesser of (1) the fair market value of the Company\u2019s stock on the offering date or (2) the fair market value of our stock on the purchase date.\nFor fiscal 2021, 0.4 million shares of common stock were purchased under the ESPP at a weighted-average price of $41.67 per share, and $7.8 million of stock-based compensation expense was recorded. During fiscal 2020, 1.2 million shares of common stock were purchased under the ESPP at a weighted-average price of $15.78 per share, and $5.9 million of stock-based compensation expense was recorded. During fiscal 2019, there was no common stock purchased under the ESPP, and $1.6 million of stock-based compensation expense was recorded.\nThe Company accounted for the stock purchase rights under ESPP at the grant date (first day of the offering period) by valuing each purchase period separately. The Black-Scholes assumptions used to value the ESPP are as follows:\nYear Ended January 31,\nESPP:\nRisk-free interest rate\n0.09% - 2.05%\n1.52% - 2.69%\n2.51% - 2.69%\nExpected term (years)\n0.50 - 1.00\n0.50 - 1.19\n0.69 - 1.19\nExpected volatility\n34.9% - 64.0%\n32.5% - 42.9%\n32.5% - 34.9%\nExpected dividend yield\n-\n-\n-\nStock Purchase Rights (SPRs) with Recourse Notes\nSPRs have been issued in exchange for recourse promissory notes with the aggregate price of the underlying shares as the principal amount. The promissory notes are collateralized by the related common stock. Repayment is due between four and twelve years from the date of the promissory notes or earlier in certain circumstances. In addition, any proceeds from the sale of shares purchased with the notes must be applied to repay the outstanding note receivable balance. The Company has a right to repurchase the shares if the employee\u2019s service period is not fulfilled or upon termination of employment at the original per share issuance price. The right of repurchase lapses over an employee service period which is typically four years with 25% vesting on the first anniversary of the vesting commencement date and 1/48 each month thereafter. The Company deemed all employee recourse promissory notes to be non-substantive in nature and therefore the notes are not reflected in the consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of stockholders\u2019 equity. Rather, the note issuances and the share purchases are accounted for as share option grants, with the related share-based compensation measured using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model and recognized over the vesting periods.\nThere were no SPRs issued since fiscal 2017.\nShares underlying the SPRs are presented as outstanding on the consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of stockholders\u2019 equity as the shares have voting and dividend rights and are thus considered legally outstanding. There were no outstanding SPRs as of January 31, 2021. During fiscal 2020 and 2019, an immaterial amount and 4.8 million of these underlying shares, respectively, have been excluded from the respective net loss per share calculations because the shares are considered contingently issuable and subject to repurchase.\nDuring fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019, the recorded stock-based compensation expense related to the SPRs was immaterial.\nShare Repurchase\nThere were no shares repurchased in fiscal 2021. During fiscal 2020 and 2019, the Company repurchased approximately 0.1 million unvested shares from one employee, and 0.2 million unvested shares from one employee, respectively. The share repurchases took place upon termination of employment by cancelling the principal balance of the related note, plus any accrued interest from the date of purchase related to the unvested portion.\nStock Options and Restricted Stock Units\nStock options can be granted with an exercise price equal to or greater than the stock\u2019s fair value at the date of grant. Most awards have 10-year terms and vest and become exercisable at a rate of 25% on the first anniversary of the vesting commencement date and 1/48th each month thereafter. Options granted may include provisions for early exercisability.\nThe Black-Scholes assumptions used to value the employee options at the grant dates are as follows:\nYear Ended January 31,\nStock Options:\nFair value of common\nstock\n$37.61 - $59.91\n$32.75 - $58.82\n$7.12 - $25.10\nRisk-free interest rate\n0.36% - 1.40%\n1.51% - 2.54%\n2.68% - 3.00%\nExpected term (years)\n5.14 - 6.08\n5.07 - 6.25\n6.06 - 6.26\nExpected volatility\n36.9% - 40.3%\n37.5% - 38.8%\n37.0% - 37.8%\nExpected dividend yield\n-\n-\n-\nThese assumptions and estimates were determined as follows:\n\u2022\nFair Value of Common Stock. Prior to the IPO, the Company\u2019s board of directors determined the fair value of its common stock using various valuation methodologies, including valuation analyses performed by third-party valuation firms. After the IPO, the Company uses the publicly quoted market closing price as reported on the New York Stock Exchange as the fair value of its common stock.\n\u2022\nRisk-Free Interest Rate. The risk-free interest rate for the expected term of the options was based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant.\n\u2022\nExpected Term. The expected term was estimated using the simplified approach, in which the expected term of an award is presumed to be the mid-point between the vesting date and the expiration date of the award, as the Company does not have sufficient historical data relating to stock-option exercises.\n\u2022\nExpected Volatility. As there was no public market for the Company\u2019s common stock prior to IPO, the Company has limited information on the volatility of its common stock. Accordingly, the expected volatility for the Company was estimated by taking the average historic price volatility for industry peers, consisting of several public companies in the Company\u2019s industry which are either similar in size, stage of life cycle, or financial leverage, over a period equivalent to the expected term of the awards.\n\u2022\nExpected Dividend Yield. The Company has never declared or paid any cash dividends and does not presently plan to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future. As a result, an expected dividend yield of zero was used.\nA summary of stock option and RSU activities for fiscal 2021 is as follows:\nOptions Outstanding\nRSUs Outstanding\nShares\nAvailable\nfor Grant\nShares\nSubject to\nOptions\nOutstanding\nWeighted\nAverage\nExercise\nPrice\nAverage\nRemaining\nContractual\nLife (Years)\nAggregate\nIntrinsic\nValue\nShares\nWeighted-\nAverage\nGrant Date\nFair Value\n(in thousands, except weighted average exercise price, average remaining contractual life and weighted average grant date fair value)\nBalance as of January 31, 2020\n17,071\n10,198\n$\n11.69\n7.55\n$\n468,079\n10,260\n$\n23.70\nShares authorized\n6,775\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nOptions granted\n(422\n)\n38.47\n-\n-\n-\n-\nOptions exercised\n-\n(2,916\n)\n6.46\n-\n-\n-\n-\nOptions forfeited\n1,104\n(1,104\n)\n34.97\n-\n-\n-\n-\nRSUs granted\n(4,162\n)\n-\n-\n-\n-\n4,162\n50.28\nRSUs vested\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n(4,666\n)\n20.37\nRSUs forfeited\n1,198\n-\n-\n-\n-\n(1,198\n)\n33.02\nBalance as of January 31, 2021\n21,564\n6,600\n$\n11.83\n6.85\n$\n362,149\n8,558\n$\n37.15\nExercisable as of January 31, 2021\n6,401\n$\n11.40\n6.80\n$\n354,018\nVested and expected to vest as\nof January 31, 2021\n4,521\n$\n8.13\n6.41\n$\n264,776\n7,416\nThe total intrinsic value of the options exercised during fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019 was $129.5 million, $194.1 million, and $24.2 million, respectively. The intrinsic value is calculated as the difference between the fair value of the underlying common stock at the exercise date and the exercise price of the stock option.\nThe weighted-average grant date fair value of options granted during fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019 was $14.36, $13.87, and $5.48, respectively.\nAs of January 31, 2021, unrecognized stock-based compensation cost related to outstanding unvested stock options that are expected to vest was $14.0 million, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.1 years.\nRSUs granted under the 2012 Stock Plan (2012 Plan) vest upon the satisfaction of both a service condition and a liquidity condition. Both the service and liquidity conditions must be met for the expense to be recognized. The liquidity condition was satisfied upon completion of our IPO, and we recognized an expense of $29.9 million in the three months ended October 31, 2018 for the portion of the RSUs that had met the service condition as of such date. In connection with the IPO, the 2012 Plan was terminated and the number of shares of common stock reserved under the 2012 Plan that were not issued or subject to outstanding awards under the 2012 Plan on the IPO date were transferred to the 2018 Plan.\nThe RSUs granted after the IPO under the 2018 Plan solely vest upon the satisfaction of a service condition.\nAs of January 31, 2021, unrecognized stock-based compensation cost related to outstanding unvested RSUs that are expected to vest was $221.5 million, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.8 years.\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe stock-based compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, by line item in the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive loss is summarized as follows:\nYear Ended January 31,\n(In thousands)\nCost of subscription revenue\n$\n3,822\n$\n2,547\n$\nCost of professional services revenue\n2,481\n2,199\nResearch and development\n18,715\n10,608\n3,826\nSales and marketing\n48,210\n34,428\n15,475\nGeneral and administrative\n30,398\n30,264\n31,823\nTotal stock-based compensation expense\n$\n103,626\n$\n80,046\n$\n52,806\nThe Company\u2019s estimated forfeiture rate is based on accumulated historical forfeiture data.\nThe capitalized stock-based compensation expense relating to research and development expense was $3.5 million, $2.3 million, and $0.6 million during fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.\n(8) Fair Value Measurements\nThe Company utilizes valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs to the extent possible. The Company determines fair value based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or a liability in the principal or most advantageous market. When considering market participant assumptions in fair value measurements, the following fair value hierarchy distinguishes between observable and unobservable inputs, which are categorized in one of the following levels:\n-\nLevel 1 inputs: Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities accessible to the reporting entity at the measurement date.\n-\nLevel 2 inputs: Other than quoted prices included in Level 1 inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.\n-\nLevel 3 inputs: Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability used to measure fair value to the extent that observable inputs are not available, thereby allowing for situations in which there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability at measurement date.\nCash and cash equivalents included investments in money market funds of $240.0 million at January 31, 2021. The fair value of the money market funds was determined using quoted prices for identical investments in active markets, which are considered to be Level 1 inputs under the fair value measurements and disclosure guidance.\nOther than the money market funds, the Company did not hold any assets or liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of January 31, 2021 or 2020. There were no transfers into or out of Level 1, Level 2, or Level 3 during fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019.\n(9) Commitments and Contingencies\nIndemnifications\nThe Company delivers its application over the Internet as a subscription service using a SaaS model. Each subscription is subject to the terms of the contractual arrangement with the customer and generally includes certain provisions for holding the customer harmless against and indemnifying the customer for costs, damages, losses, liabilities, and expenses arising from claims that the Company\u2019s software infringes upon a copyright, trademark, or other trade secret rights, and third-party claims arising from the Company\u2019s breach of the contract.\nThe Company has not incurred any expense in defense or reimbursement of any of its customers for losses related to indemnification provisions, and no material claims against the Company are outstanding as of January 31, 2021 and 2020. The Company\u2019s exposure under these indemnification provisions is generally capped at a fixed amount in many customer agreements and uncapped in others.\nDue primarily to the lack of history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular contractual arrangement, the Company has determined that potential costs related to indemnification are not probable or estimable and, as such, has not recorded a reserve for fiscal 2021, 2020, or 2019.\nWarranties\nThe Company provides a warranty for the implementation services it performs for its subscription services to its customers for a period of 30 days after completion of the services. The Company\u2019s services are generally warranted to conform to the specifications set forth in the related customer contract and published documentation. In the event there is a failure of such warranties, the Company generally will correct the problem or provide a reasonable workaround or replacement product. If the Company cannot correct the problem or provide a workaround or replacement product, then the customer\u2019s remedy is generally limited to termination of the contractual arrangement related to the nonconforming product services with a refund of the related fees paid. Accordingly, no amounts have been recorded.\nLegal Matters\nOn August 24, 2020, a purported stockholder of the Company filed a putative securities class action complaint in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, captioned Grobler v. Anaplan, Inc., et al., 3:20-cv-05959, against the Company and certain of the Company\u2019s executive officers. The Court appointed a lead plaintiff on November 12, 2020, and on January 6, 2021, the lead plaintiff filed an amended complaint, captioned Sakkal v. Anaplan, Inc., et al. The amended complaint alleges violations of Section 10(b) and Section 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, purportedly on behalf of all persons who purchased Anaplan, Inc. securities between November 21, 2019, and February 26, 2020, inclusive. The claims are based upon allegations that the defendants misrepresented and/or omitted material information in certain of the Company\u2019s prior public filings regarding the business, operations and prospects of the Company. The Company filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint on March 8, 2021. At this point, no discovery has occurred in this case. The case is still in the preliminary stages, and it is not possible for the Company to quantify the extent of potential liability to the defendants, if any. The Company believes that the lawsuit lacks merit and intends to vigorously defend the action. The Company cannot predict the outcome of or is not able to reasonably estimate the amount or range of possible loss from the above described matter.\nFrom time to time, the Company is party to litigation and subject to claims incident to the ordinary course of business. As the Company\u2019s growth continues, the Company may become party to an increasing number of litigation matters and claims. The outcome of litigation and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, and the resolution of these matters could materially affect the Company\u2019s future results of operations, cash flows, or financial position. The Company is not presently party to any legal proceedings that, in the opinion of management, if determined adversely to the Company, would individually or taken together have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, operating results, financial condition, or cash flows.\nOther Contractual Commitments\nOther contractual commitments primarily consist of data center, cloud and IT operations related to our daily business operations.

The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management believes it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized; accordingly, a valuation allowance has been established on U.S., U.K. and Israel net deferred tax assets. The valuation allowance increased $90.7 million for fiscal 2021 and increased $110.0 million for fiscal 2020.\nAs of January 31, 2021, the Company has net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of $933.0 million available to reduce future income subject to income taxes. The federal net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire, if not utilized, in fiscal 2029. In addition, the Company has $233.2 million and $330.4 million of net operating loss carryforwards available to reduce future taxable income subject to California state income taxes and all other applicable state jurisdictions, respectively. The California net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire, if not utilized, in fiscal 2031 through fiscal 2040. The other states\u2019 net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire at various dates beginning in fiscal 2025 through fiscal 2040, if not utilized. The U.K. net operating loss carryforwards of $235.5 million do not expire.\nThe federal and state net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to significant limitations under Section 382 and Section 383 of the Code and similar provisions under state law. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 contains provisions that limit the federal net operating loss carryforwards that may be used in any given year in the event of special occurrences, including significant ownership changes. The Company completed an analysis under Code Sections 382 and 383 through January 31, 2019 and concluded that the limitation on its ability to utilize its net operating loss carryforwards will not be material. If there were material ownership changes subsequent to the study, such changes could limit the Company\u2019s ability to utilize its net operating loss carryforwards.\nChanges in our unrecognized tax benefits are summarized as follows:\nAs of January 31,\n(In thousands)\nBeginning balance\n$\n6,530\n$\n-\nAdditions for current year items\n1,250\n-\nMintigo acquisition\n-\n7,355\nLapse of statute of limitations\n(1,519\n)\n(825\n)\nEnding balance\n$\n6,261\n$\n6,530\nThe Company does not expect any significant change in its unrecognized tax benefits during the next twelve months that would be material to the consolidated financial statements because nearly all of the unrecognized tax benefits have been offset by a deferred tax asset, which has been reduced by a valuation allowance.\nThe Company files income tax returns for U.S. federal income tax, several U.S. states, and other foreign jurisdictions. The Company\u2019s most significant tax jurisdictions are the United States and the United Kingdom. The Company\u2019s tax years for 2009 and forward are subject to examination by the federal tax authorities. The Company\u2019s tax years for 2009 and forward are subject to examination by the state tax authorities. The Company\u2019s tax years for 2011 and forward are subject to examination by the foreign tax authorities. The Company is currently under examination for income tax in Israel.\n(11) Net Loss Per Share Attributable to Common Stockholders\nThe following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders:\nYear Ended January 31,\n(In thousands, except per share data)\nNumerator:\nNet loss\n$\n(153,967\n)\n$\n(149,217\n)\n$\n(131,016\n)\nDenominator:\nWeighted-average shares used in computing\nnet loss per share attributable to common\nstockholders, basic and diluted\n139,499\n129,799\n53,328\nNet loss per share attributable to common\nstockholders, basic and diluted\n$\n(1.10\n)\n$\n(1.15\n)\n$\n(2.46\n)\nThe potential shares of common stock that were excluded from the computation of diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders for the periods presented because including them would have been antidilutive are as follows:\nAs of January 31,\n(In thousands)\nStock options\n6,600\n10,198\n14,986\nStock repurchase rights\n-\n4,776\nRestricted stock units\n8,558\n10,260\n10,894\nUnvested shares subject to repurchase\n-\nTotal\n15,158\n20,469\n30,680\n(12) Employee Benefit Plans\nOn January 1, 2013, the Company initiated a savings and retirement plan for employees. The Company\u2019s employee savings and retirement plan is qualified under Section 401 of the Internal Revenue Code. The plan is available to all regular employees on the Company\u2019s U.S. payroll and provides employees with tax-deferred salary deductions and alternative investment options. Employees may contribute up to 90% of their salary up to the statutory prescribed annual limit. The Company also has a defined-contribution retirement plan or participates in government programs that covers substantially all employees in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, India, Israel, Japan, Malaysia, the Netherlands, the Philippines, Singapore, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. The Company matches employees\u2019 contributions to the U.S. 401(k) plan, subject to certain limitations. The Company also matches at varying percentages of income, voluntarily or within a statutory scheme, for employees in the countries listed above.",

Based on this evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of January 31, 2021, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.\nThe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2021 has been audited by KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which is included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rule 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act that occurred during the quarter ended January 31, 2021 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nInherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls\nOur management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, do not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions, over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.",
