    "item_1": "Item 1. Business.\nGeneral Overview.\nAdvanced Voice Recognition Systems, Inc. (the \u201cCompany\u201d, \u201cwe\u201d or \u201cus\u201d), is a software development company headquartered in Scottsdale, Arizona. We specialize in creating interface and application solutions for speech recognition technologies. Our speech recognition software and related firmware was first introduced in 1994 at an industry trade show. We currently have limited capital resources. We are not currently engaged in marketing any products. We are currently engaged in discussions with a certain firm dedicated to assisting in the commercialization of intellectual assets.\nOur principal assets are our patents. We currently hold six issued patents. U.S. Patent #7,558,730 (\u201cthe \u2018730\u201d) entitled \u201cSpeech Recognition and Transcription Among Users Having Heterogeneous Protocols\u201d discloses a system for facilitating speech recognition and transcription among users employing incompatible protocols for generating, transcribing and exchanging speech.

U.S. Patent #8,498,871, (\u201cthe \u2018871\u201d) entitled \u201cDynamic Speech Recognition and Transcription Among Users Having Heterogeneous Protocols,\u201d is a system for facilitating free form dictation, including directed dictation and constrained recognition and /or structured transcription among users having heterogeneous protocols for generating, transcribing and exchanging recognized and transcribed speech. U.S. Patent #9,142,217, (\u201cthe 217\u201d) entitled \u201cSpeech Recognition and Transcription Among Users Having Heterogeneous Protocols,\u201d is an expansion of the coverage of the \u2018871. U.S. Patent #9,934,786 (\u201cthe \u2018786\u201d) was issued April 3, 2018 and is an extension of the coverage in the \u2018871 patent. Our business strategy is to attempt to interest other companies in entering into license agreements or other strategic relationships and to enforce and defend our patents through infringement and interference proceedings, as appropriate.\nIndustry Overview\nWe believe that speech recognition technology has a multitude of potential applications including but not limited to dictation and transcription, mobile messaging (voice to texting), server based web search, customer relations and translation.\nSpeech recognition technology, which provides for the conversion of speech into written text, is the threshold feature of our solutions. Our technology focuses on improving speech recognition technology by increasing speech conversion precision, with the goal of achieving near 100% accuracy and allowing the user to speak naturally. We also focus on improving user productivity and profitability by enabling the user to effectively utilize the written text produced by speech recognition technology (the End-Text) in multiple applications specific to the user\u2019s business purposes and goals.\nWe believe our main competitors are Microsoft, Nuance, Google Voice, Amazon Alexa and Apple. We also compete, and anticipate that we will compete, with several smaller niche suppliers.\nPrincipal Proposed Products or Services\nWe have not achieved any revenues from product sales. In addition, we will need substantial additional capital to achieve our marketing objectives as described below.\nSpeech Recognition Software and Related Firmware\nOur principal proposed product is speech recognition software and related firmware which allows for dictation into a broad range of applications, including DOS applications running in Windows, UNIX and mainframe applications accessed through terminal emulation programs, various custom applications, and all Windows 3.x, 95, 98, 2000, XP, Vista, Windows 7 and Windows 10 programs. Through this product, we seek to provide full functionality including audio proofreading, deferred and delegated correction and additional capabilities that we believe are not available with other products. This product is designed to allow for deferred dictation, where the text is saved with the associated audio, and the users can resume when stopped and can play back dictated content. Similarly, the recognized text and associated audio can be saved to be used when text is corrected.\nAVRS Enterprise Solutions\nAVRS patented technology is applicable to many main stream speech enabled applications ranging from traditional desktop applications to mobile, web-based and cloud solutions. The technology reaches beyond simple speech recognition and transcription into many other applications thus enabling the exchange of spoken text transcription amongst numerous users on diverse system platforms, as well as enabling the transcribed text to be utilized by many interface applications. The key is the recognition of, and in many cases the transcription of, spoken text in a myriad of applications to allow a seamless interface among users and /or systems having disparate protocols. Recognition of dictated speech including spoken text and commands, over many platforms provides operations of systems having diverse requirements and capabilities.\nAVRS patents cover both a method of implementation and a system whereby speech recognition and transcription can be operated upon and exchanged amongst users employing disparate legacy protocols through one or more transaction managers having a systems protocol. An underlying key factor in all AVRS patented technology lies in its enabling capability whereby any legacy application protocol can be made compatible with speech recognition and transcription engines with or without modification of the application or the protocol upon which the initiating or the receiving application relies.\nMarket\nWe believe that our patented technology has applications in vertical markets that require individuals and organizations to create reports, letters, e-mail, data entry, manuals, books, and virtually any other document or end product involving written data. These organizations include corporations, hospitals, medical product and service providers, governmental entities, legal professionals, sales and service organizations law enforcement agencies and mobile search and voicemail to text.\nOriginal Equipment Manufacturer (OEM)\nWe believe that our patented technology has applications in OEM markets, targeting both software developers and hardware manufacturers. When we have sufficient available resources, we may approach the larger OEM companies with a joint marketing approach strategy while using a direct sale basis to approach small and medium-sized OEMs.\nHardware Manufacturers\nWe believe that our patented technology has applications in hardware manufacturing, and to that end, when we have sufficient available resources, we may approach hardware manufacturers both on a direct basis and through joint sales and marketing programs. We anticipate that we will offer technology and patent licenses to manufacturers of medical devices, digital dictation systems, recorders, workstation PCs, mobile phones, PDAs, WAPs and intelligent electronics. Alternatively, we may offer these manufacturers limited versions of our speech recognition software and related firmware product line for embedding into hardware. When we have sufficient available resources, we expect to develop joint sales and marketing programs for mainframe, thin-client, telephony and other large hardware processing systems.\nIntellectual Property\nOur primary assets are U.S. Patent #7,558,730, U.S. Patent #7,949,534, U.S. Patent #8,131,557, U.S. Patent #8,498,871, U.S. Patent #9,142,217 and U.S. Patent 9,934,786.\nU.S. Patent #7,558,730, entitled \u201cSpeech Recognition and Transcription Among Users Having Heterogeneous Protocols\u201d, was issued by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office on July 7, 2009.

Legal Proceedings.\nOn November 6, 2017 Advanced Voice Recognition Systems, Inc (\u201cAVRS\u201d) received notice that Meyers & Associates, LLC filed Complaint number 2017CV32482 in Arapahoe County District Court on October 30, 2017. The Complaint relates to purported legal fees owed by AVRS. On January 31, 2018 AVRS entered into a Settlement Agreement and Promissory Note with Meyers & Associates, LLC. AVRS promises to pay the principal sum of Fifty-Two Thousand Three Hundred Eighty-Five Dollars and Forty-Six Cents ($52,385.46) as well as accrued interest. AVRS shall pay $1,000 per month on the first day of each month beginning February 1, 2018 and continuing through July 1, 2018 and pay all remaining unpaid principal and accrued interest (12% annual) on August 1, 2018. All payments have been made.\nOn August 1, 2018 AVRS and Meyers & Associates entered into an Agreement to Amend Promissory Note. AVRS shall pay $6,000 on or before August 1, 2018, shall pay $1,500 on the first day of each month beginning September 1, 2018 and continuing through November 1, 2018 and shall pay all remaining unpaid principal and accrued interest on December 1, 2018. All payments have been made.\nOn November 21, 2018 AVRS and Meyers & Associates entered into a Second Agreement to Amend Promissory Note. AVRS shall pay $20,000 on or before November 21, 2018, shall pay $1,500 on the first day of each month beginning January 1, 2019 and continuing through June 1, 2019 and shall pay all remaining principle and interest on July 1, 2019. On June 7, 2019 the Company made the final payment of $11,046.74. The note is paid in full. A $1,500 gain from early extinguishment of Note Payable was reported as income on June 30, 2019.\nAVRS filed a Complaint in the United States District Court Northern District for Arizona (Case No. 2-18-cv-2083) on July 3, 2018, and alleges that Apple products infringe U.S. Patent No. 7,558,730 entitled \u201cSpeech Recognition and Transcription Among Users Having Heterogeneous Protocols\u201d (the \u201c\u2018730 Patent\u201d). AVRS is seeking, among other things, a Judgement of infringement, past damages no less than a reasonable royalty, attorneys\u2019 fees, pre and post Judgement interest and costs including expenses and disbursements and any other relief deemed proper by the Court.\nOn July 22, 2019 Apple, Inc. submitted a petition for Inter Partes Review (\u201cIPR\u201d) of the AVRS patent. It was ordered in the case of AVRS, Inc. v. Apple Inc (Case No. 2-18-cv-2083) that the parties\u2019 stipulation was granted and the case is stayed pending the resolution of the IPR proceeding. Buether Joe and Carpenter, LLC (\u201cBJC\u201d), our representation in the AVRS v. Apple litigation will represent AVRS in the IPR. The IPR response to the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (\u201cPTAB\u201d) was made on November 8, 2019. The PTAB has instituted the IPR on some of the grounds asserted by Apple and denied institution on other grounds asserted by Apple. This means that the IPR will proceed but only on the grounds instituted by the PTAB. Due to the interruption from COVID-19 the Company responded to the PTAB on September 18, 2020. Oral arguments were presented remotely on October 26, 2020. On January 13, 2021 the PTAB Final Written Decision under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7\u202f318(a) in Inter Partes Review petitioned by Apple Inc. The decision found that claims 15 and 17 of AVRS\u2019s U.S. Patent No. 7,558,730 B2 were invalid under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103(a). On March 17, 2021 AVRS filed an appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit Docket Number 2021-1745.",

This document contains certain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, such as statements of the Company\u2019s plans, objectives, expectations and intentions. When used in this document, the words \u201cexpects\u201d, \u201canticipates\u201d, \u201cintends\u201d and \u201cplans\u201d and similar expressions are intended to identify certain of these forward-looking statements. The cautionary statements made in this document should be read as being applicable to all related forward-looking statements wherever they appear in this document. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in this document.\nResults of Operation\nWe completed a stock exchange on May 19, 2008 and changed our business model. We have not generated any revenue since inception and do not have any cash generating product or licensing sales. We have incurred losses since Inception (March 15, 1994).\nWe had a net loss of $81,529 for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to a net loss of $68,302 in 2019. Professional fees were $43,598 in 2020, as compared to $28,014 in 2019, an increase of $15,584. An increase in our auditing fees is responsible for the increase in professional fees. Compensation was $7,839 in 2020, as compared to $4,916 in 2019, an increase of $2,923 which increased our net loss.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we used $33,026 of cash in operating activities and $0 cash in investing activities. We received $22,600 of cash from the sale of shares of our common stock. As a result, for the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized an $5,893 net decrease in\ncash on hand. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we used $56,244 of cash in operating activities and $-0- of cash in investing activities, and received net cash of $69,002 provided by financing activities, resulting in a $11,342 decrease in cash on hand for the year.\nAt December 31, 2020, we had current assets of $348 and current liabilities of $276,955 as compared to current assets of $6,241 and current liabilities of $238,622 at December 31, 2019. Our decrease in current assets resulted from a decreased amount of financing activities in 2020 as compared to 2019.\nBecause of our history of losses, net capital deficit and lack of assurance of additional financing, the audit report on our financial statements contains a \u201cgoing concern\u201d opinion regarding doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nIn an attempt to address our financing needs, we have made sales of our common stock in private transactions.\nDuring the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, we entered into Stock Purchase Agreements for the private sale to four persons or entities of an aggregate of 2,166,667 shares of the common stock for aggregate proceeds of $22,600. All of the proceeds were paid during the 12 months ended December 31, 2020.\nDuring the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, we entered into Stock Purchase Agreements for the private sale to six persons or entities of an aggregate of 11,200,000 shares of the common stock for aggregate proceeds of $69,002. All of the proceeds were paid during the 12 months ended December 31, 2019.\nOn March 16, 2015 we entered into a letter agreement with Adapt IP Ventures, LLC (Adapt IP) confirming the retention of Adapt IP to assist us in identifying companies that might be interested in acquiring and / or licensing our patents, to attempt to negotiate financial terms and conditions for acquisition and / or licensing and to assist with collection of compensation from such entities. Adapt IP will receive a success fee of 15% of net compensation received from such entities based upon Adapt IP\u2019s efforts. We or Adapt IP may terminate the agreement upon 30 days\u2019 notice to the other party.\nOn April 20, 2015 we made a Promissory Note to Adapt IP for $20,000, and Adapt IP agreed to pay to our patent counsel up to $20,000 for patent work on our behalf. The Note matures one year from the date of the Note. We are obligated to repay the funds advanced by Adapt IP plus a premium of 10% of the principal amount and a percentage of proceeds received by us from any monetization event involving the patents. If we repay the Note within the six months of the date of the Note, the percentage will be 1%, and it will be 2% after six months. As of December 31, 2020 $11,961 interest has accrued.\nOn August 20, 2015, AVRS entered into a letter agreement with Dominion Harbor Group, LLC pursuant to which Dominion will provide strategic advisory services to AVRS to support the common goal of the acquisition, sale, licensing, prosecution, enforcement, and settlement with respect to AVRS\u2019s intellectual property, including patents held by AVRS. On June 28, 2017 AVRS and Dominion agreed to terminate the August 20, 2015 Letter Agreement. AVRS did not incur any material early termination penalties in connection of the early termination of the agreement.\nOn November 1, 2016, AVRS entered into a Contingent Fee Agreement with Buether Joe and Carpenter, LLC to represent AVRS in connection with investigating and asserting claims including negotiating license agreements and the filing and prosecution of lawsuits against any potential infringers of the Patent rights. On June 6, 2017 AVRS and BJC revised the Contingent Fee Agreement as it related to the termination of the August 20, 2017 Dominion Harbor Letter Agreement.\nHistorically, our President has loaned or advanced to us funds for working capital on an \u201cas needed\u201d basis. There is no assurance that these loans or advances will continue in the future. At December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, we owed our officers an aggregate of $162,382 for accrued payroll. On September 24, 2018, the Company entered into a Promissory Note with Walter Geldenhuys, who is our President, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, and who serves as a member of our Board of Directors. The Promissory Note is effective as of September 24, 2018 in the principal amount of $9,000 with a maturity date of September 24, 2019. Interest at 4% per annum was charged and $91.00 accrued at December 31, 2018. On December 10, 2018 the Company repaid $2,500 leaving a balance of $6,500. During 2019 the Company repaid $6,500, paying the note in full on December 27, 2019. Our Secretary / Treasurer advanced the Company a total of $4533 at December 31, 2020.\nBecause of our history of losses, and lack of assurance of additional financing, the audit reports on our financial statements at December 31, 2020 and 2019 contained a \u201cgoing concern\u201d opinion regarding doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nWe will require additional debt or equity financing or a combination of both in order to carry out our business plan. We plan to raise additional funds through future sales of our securities, until such time as our revenues are sufficient to meet our cost structure, and ultimately achieve profitable operations. There is no assurance we will be successful in raising additional capital or achieving profitable operations. Our board of directors may attempt to use non-cash consideration to satisfy obligations that may consist of restricted shares of our common stock. These actions would result in dilution of the ownership interests of existing shareholders and may further dilute our common stock book value.\nTo obtain sufficient funds to meet our future needs for capital, we will from time to time, evaluate opportunities to raise financing through some combination of the private sale of equity, or issuance of convertible debt securities. However, future equity or debt financing may not be available to us at all, or if available, may not be on terms acceptable to us. We do not intend to pay dividends to shareholders in the foreseeable future.\nU.S. Patent #7,558,730 expands an extremely broad base of features in speech recognition and transcription across heterogeneous protocols.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the shareholders and the board of directors of Advanced Voice Recognition Systems, Inc.\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Advanced Voice Recognition Systems, Inc. (the \"Company\") as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the related statements of operations, stockholders' equity (deficit), and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the \"financial statements\"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.\nSubstantial Doubt about the Company\u2019s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company has suffered recurring losses from operations and has a significant accumulated deficit. In addition, the Company continues to experience negative cash flows from operations. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 2. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (\"PCAOB\") and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engage to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n/s/ BF Borgers CPA PC\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2013.\nLakewood, CO\nMarch 31, 2021\nPart I.

Nature of Operations\nCompany Overview\nThe operations of Advanced Voice Recognition Systems, Inc. (\u201cAVRS\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d), http://www.avrsys.com, commenced in 1994 with a predecessor entity called NCC, Inc. NCC, Inc. was incorporated on March 15, 1994 in the State of Ohio. NCC, Inc. operated as a software and hardware development company that marketed voice recognition and transcription products for commercial applications.\nIn May 2000, WG Investments, LLC acquired the assets of NCC, Inc. and subsequently changed its name to NCC, LLC. NCC, LLC (also a predecessor to AVRS) continued the operations of NCC, Inc. until approximately December 31, 2001, when shifts in the industry\u2019s markets caused NCC, LLC to suspend its operations.\nAVRS was incorporated in the State of Colorado on July 7, 2005. In September 2005, the members of NCC, LLC transferred all of their membership interests in NCC, LLC to AVRS in exchange for 93,333,333 shares (post-recapitalization) of AVRS common stock. In December 2005, the Board of Directors approved a 1.5-to-1 stock split issuing 46,666,667 common shares (post-recapitalization), which increased the number of common shares outstanding to 140 million shares (post-capitalization). Following the incorporation of AVRS, the Company initiated a new business plan and intends to continue its operations in the voice recognition and transcription industry.\nAVRS is a software development company specializing in speech recognition technologies. AVRS has successfully obtained patent protection of its proprietary technology (refer to Note 3, Intangible Assets). The Company has currently engaged a firm to investigate and asserting claims relating to certain patents including negotiating licensing agreements and the filing and prosecution of lawsuits.\nStock Exchange Agreement\nOn April 28, 2008, the Company entered into a Stock Exchange Agreement (\u201cthe Agreement\u201d) with Samoyed Energy Corp., a Nevada corporation (\u201cSamoyed\u201d), which resulted in a reverse acquisition. The Agreement provided for the reorganization of AVRS with Samoyed. In connection with the Agreement, Samoyed acquired all of the issued and outstanding common shares of AVRS in exchange for 140 million shares of Samoyed\u2019s common stock. On May 19, 2008, at the closing of the Agreement, the former shareholders of AVRS owned approximately 85% of the outstanding common stock of Samoyed, resulting in a change in control.\nFor accounting purposes, this acquisition has been treated as a reverse acquisition and recapitalization of AVRS, with Samoyed the legal surviving entity. Since Samoyed had, prior to the recapitalization, minimal assets and limited operations, the recapitalization has been accounted for as the sale of 24,700,008 shares of AVRS common stock for the net liabilities of Samoyed. Therefore, the historical financial information prior to the date of the recapitalization is the financial information of AVRS. Costs of the transaction have been charged to the period in which they are incurred.\nIn connection with the Agreement, a shareholder of Samoyed holding an aggregate of 3.5 million shares of Samoyed\u2019s common stock made payments totaling $565,651 since 2008 in lieu of tendering shares to the Company. The Company received the final payment of $6,000 on February 15, 2012.\nStock Purchase Agreements\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020 the Company entered into Stock Purchase Agreements for the private sale to four persons or entities of an aggregate of 2,166,667 shares of the common stock for aggregate proceeds of $22,600, full payment of which was received in the period. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company entered into Stock Purchase Agreements to six persons for the private sale of an aggregate of 11,200,000 shares of the common stock for aggregate proceeds of $69,002, full payment of which was received in the period.\nCommitments and Contingencies\nOn April 20, 2015 Advanced Voice Recognition Systems, Inc. (\u201cAVRS\u201d) entered into a Material Letter Agreement with an unrelated third party (Third Party) in which they promise to pay to patent legal counsel funds to continue prosecuting Patents on behalf of AVRS. AVRS promises to pay to the Third Party, or to such other holder of this promissory note (Note) as designate, the principal, together with any additional amounts owed pursuant to the terms set forth in this Note. Interest at 2% was accrued and reported at December 31, 2020.\nOn August 20, 2015, Advanced Voice Recognition Systems, Inc. (\u201cAVRS\u201d) entered into a letter agreement with unrelated third party (Third Party) pursuant to which the Third Party will provide strategic advisory services to AVRS to support the common goal of the acquisition, sale, licensing, prosecution, enforcement, and settlement with respect to AVRS\u2019s intellectual property, including patents held by AVRS. The Third Party has agreed to advance costs recommended by it, including court filing fees, discovery and other litigation costs, and patent prosecution costs, up to an aggregate of $10,000,000. AVRS will be responsible for costs not recommended by the Third Party, as well as travel and ordinary business expenses incurred by AVRS. Except for the advanced costs by the Third Party, AVRS will be responsible for any contingency payments to law firms. Any and all advanced costs will only become liabilities if successful. On June 28, 2017 AVRS and the Third Party agreed to terminate the August 20, 2015\nLetter Agreement. AVRS did not incur any material early termination penalties in connection of the early termination of the agreement.\nOn November 1, 2016, Advanced Voice Recognition Systems, Inc. (\u201cAVRS\u201d) entered into a Contingent Fee Agreement (the \u201cAgreement\u201d) with Legal Representation pursuant to which they will represent AVRS in connection with investigating and asserting claims relating to certain patents, including the negotiation of license agreements and the filing and prosecution of lawsuits, against any potential infringers of rights associated with such patents (the \u201cPatent Rights\u201d) Legal representation will handle licensing and litigation activities under the Agreement on a contingent fee basis. The fee will depend upon whether AVRS recovers any sums by way of licensing, settlement, trial or otherwise with respect to the Patent Rights. On June 6, 2017 AVRS and Legal Representation revised the Contingent Fee Agreement as it related to the termination of the August 20, 2015 Letter Agreement which was to provide advisory services, court filing fees, discovery and other litigation costs. The revised Contingent Fee Agreement assumed the responsibility for the costs and expenses in the Terminated August 20, 2015 Letter Agreement and provides for the payment of twenty percent (20%) of all gross Licensing Agreement Proceeds and thirty percent (30%) of all Litigation Proceeds received by AVRS. In addition if the Litigation Proceeds agreed to or received by AVRS at any time are $100,000 or less then Legal Representative shall receive forty percent (40%) of the Litigation Proceeds.\nOn November 6, 2017 Advanced Voice Recognition Systems, Inc (\u201cAVRS\u201d) received notice that Meyers & Associates, LLC filed Complaint number 2017CV32482 in Arapahoe County District Court on October 30, 2017. The Complaint relates to purported legal fees owed by AVRS. On January 31, 2018 AVRS entered into a Settlement Agreement and Promissory Note with Meyers & Associates, LLC. AVRS promises to pay the principal sum of Fifty-Two Thousand Three Hundred Eighty-Five Dollars and Forty-Six Cents ($52,385.46) as well as accrued interest. AVRS shall pay $1,000 per month on the first day of each month beginning February 1, 2018 and continuing through July 1, 2018 and pay all remaining unpaid principal and accrued interest (12% annual) on August 1, 2018. All payments have been made.\nOn August 1, 2018 AVRS and Meyers & Associates entered into an Agreement to Amend Promissory Note. AVRS shall pay $6,000 on or before August 1, 2018, shall pay $1,500 on the first day of each month beginning September 1, 2018 and continuing through November 1, 2018 and shall pay all remaining unpaid principal and accrued interest on December 1, 2018. All payments have been made.\nOn November 21, 2018 AVRS and Meyers & Associates entered into a Second Agreement to Amend Promissory Note. AVRS shall pay $20,000 on or before November 21, 2018, shall pay $1,500 on the first day of each month beginning January 1, 2019 and continuing through June 1, 2019 and shall pay all remaining principle and interest on July 1, 2019. On June 7, 2019 the Company made the final payment of $11,047. The note is paid in full. A $1,500 gain from early extinguishment of Note Payable was reported as income on June 30, 2019.\nOn June 21, 2018, Advanced Voice Recognition Systems, Inc. (\u201cAVRS\u201d) and Buether Joe & Carpenter, LLC (\u201cBJC) entered into a Letter of Engagement for Legal Services Limited Scope Agreement (\u201cAgreement\u201d) with Schmeiser, Olsen & Watts LLP (\u201cthe Firm\u201d) pursuant to which the Firm will serve as local counsel in the United States District Court, District of Arizona. The Firm has been hired to represent AVRS as local counsel in connection with forthcoming litigation in the U.S. District Court, District of Arizona. AVRS may terminate the Agreement at any time.\nOn September 24, 2018, Advanced Voice Recognition Systems, Inc., a Nevada corporation (\u201cAVRS\u201d, \u201cwe\u201d or \u201cus\u201d), entered into Promissory Note with Walter Geldenhuys, who is our President, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, and who serves as a member of our Board of Directors. The Promissory Note is effective as of September 24, 2018 in the principal amount of $9,000 with a maturity date of the Promissory Note September 24, 2019. Interest at 4% per annum was charged and accrued at December 31, 2018. The Company repaid $2500 of the note on December 10, 2018. Interest at 4% per annum was charged and accrued at December 31, 2019. During 2019 the Company repaid $6,500, paying the note in full on December 27, 2019.\nNote 2. Significant Accounting Policies\nGoing Concern\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. Liabilities exceed assets and there is a capital deficiency of $262,623 and no significant revenues. The Company may be unable to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time.\nThe financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of assets and liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. The Company\u2019s continuation as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to generate sufficient cash flow to meet its obligations on a timely basis and ultimately to attain profitability. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 the Company received an aggregate of $22,600 from the sale of shares in private offerings of its common stock. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 the Company received an aggregate of $69,002 from the sale of shares in private offerings of its common stock.\nThe Company\u2019s current operations are related to patent monetization and filing of additional patents. The Company has entered into a letter agreement with Dominion Harbor Group, LLC to provide strategic advisory services to AVRS. Dominion has agreed to advanced costs up to an aggregate of $10,000,000. On June 28, 2017 the Company and Dominion agreed to terminate the August 20, 2015 Letter Agreement. The Company did not incur any material early termination penalties. In addition the Company has revised the Contingent Fee Agreement with Buether Joe & Carpenter, LLC which will represent AVRS in connection with investigating and asserting claims to the AVRS patents including licensing and litigation activities. Any and all advanced costs will only become liabilities if successful. On June 6, 2017 AVRS and BJC revised the Contingent\nFee Agreement as it related to the termination of the August 20, 2015 Dominion Harbor Letter Agreement. There is no guarantee that AVRS will be able to provide the capital required for the Company to continue as a going concern.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments with original maturities of three months or less when acquired to be cash equivalents. The Company had cash at December 31, 2020 of $348 and $6,241 at December 31, 2019. No amounts resulted from cash equivalents.\nNote 3. Intangible Assets\nIntangible Assets\nThe Company monitors the anticipated outcome of legal actions, and if it determines that the success of the defense of a patent is probable, and so long as the Company believes that the future economic benefit of the patent will be increased, the Company capitalizes external legal costs incurred in the defense of the patent. Upon successful defense of litigation, the amounts previously capitalized are amortized over the remaining life of the patent.\nOn July 7, 2009, U.S. Patent # 7,558,730, entitled \u201cSpeech Recognition and Transcription Among Users Having Heterogeneous Protocols,\u201d was issued by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.

Controls and Procedures.\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur management, with the participation of our chief executive officer, who also is our chief financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) and pursuant to Rules 13a-15(b) and 15d-15(b) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d) as of December 31, 2020 Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act, such as this Form 10-K, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time period specified in the SEC\u2019s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and is communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing\nsimilar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.\nBased on our review and evaluation, our chief executive officer, who also is our chief financial officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were adequate and effective, including consideration of the matters identified below to ensure that material information relating to us would be made known to them by others within the Company in a timely manner, particularly during the period in which this annual report on Form 10-K was being prepared, and that no changes are required at this time. The evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures and the conclusion as to their adequacy and effectiveness, included consideration of the deficiency noted below and the fact that our chief executive officer and chief financial officer is extensively involved in day-to-day transactional activities combined with the fact that the volume of transactions and activities of the Company are limited.\nWe have identified, as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, a lack of segregation of duties in accounting and financial reporting activities, which we do not believe is a material weakness. The size of our business necessarily imposes practical limitations on the effectiveness of those internal control practices and procedures that rely on the segregation of duties. Our chief executive officer and chief financial officer work closely and review all day to day transactional activities with the secretary Treasurer. The volume of the transactions of the Company is limited.\nManagement believes this lack of segregation of duties in accounting and financial reporting did not result in material inaccuracies or omissions of material fact and, to the best of its knowledge, believes that the financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 fairly present in all material respects the financial condition and results of operations for the Company in conformity with GAAP. There is, however, a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements would not have been prevented or detected as a result of this weakness.\nManagement\u2019s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:\n(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets;\n(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with the authorization of its management and directors; and\n(3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nOur management assessed the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020. We have identified, as of December 31, 2020, a lack of segregation of duties in accounting and financial reporting activities, which we believe is a material weakness. The size of our business necessarily imposes practical limitations on the effectiveness of those internal control practices and procedures that rely on the segregation of duties.\nManagement believes this deficiency in internal control did not result in material inaccuracies or omissions of material fact and, to the best of its knowledge, believes that the financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 fairly present in all material respects the financial condition and results of operations for the Company in conformity with GAAP. There is, however, a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements would not have been prevented or detected as a result of this weakness.\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management\u2019s report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the SEC that permit us to provide only management\u2019s report in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nChanges in internal control over financial reporting.\nWe regularly review our system of internal control over financial reporting and make changes to our processes and systems to improve controls and increase efficiency, while ensuring that we maintain an effective internal control environment. Changes may include such activities as implementing new, more efficient systems, consolidating activities, and migrating processes.\nThere were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.",
