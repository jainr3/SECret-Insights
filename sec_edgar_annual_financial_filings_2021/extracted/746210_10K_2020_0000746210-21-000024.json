    "item_1": "Item 1. Business\nOverview\nOblong, Inc. (\u201cOblong\u201d or \u201cwe\u201d or \u201cus\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) was formed as a Delaware corporation in May 2000 and is a provider of patented multi-stream collaboration technologies and managed services for video collaboration and network applications. Prior to March 6, 2020, Oblong, Inc. was named Glowpoint, Inc. (\u201cGlowpoint\u201d).\nOn October 1, 2019, the Company closed an acquisition of all of the outstanding equity interests of Oblong Industries, Inc., a privately held Delaware corporation founded in 2006 (\u201cOblong Industries\u201d), pursuant to the terms of an Agreement and Plan of Merger (as amended, the \u201cMerger Agreement\u201d). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, among other things, Oblong Industries became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (the \u201cMerger\u201d). See further discussion of the Merger in Note 3 - Oblong Industries Acquisition to our consolidated financial statements attached hereto. On March 6, 2020, Glowpoint changed its name to Oblong, Inc. In this Report, we use the terms \u201cOblong\u201d or \u201cwe\u201d or \u201cus\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d to refer to (i) Oblong (formerly Glowpoint), for periods prior to the closing of the Merger, and (ii) the \u201ccombined organization\u201d of Oblong (formerly Glowpoint) and Oblong Industries for periods after the closing of the Merger. For purposes of segment reporting, we refer to the Oblong (former Glowpoint) business as \u201cGlowpoint\u201d herein, and to the Oblong Industries business as \u201cOblong Industries\u201d herein.\nWe believe there is a substantial market opportunity for Oblong Industries\u2019 product offerings and services. Therefore, we expect to focus our future investments in product development and sales and marketing on our efforts to grow revenue from Oblong Industries\u2019 products and service offerings. Glowpoint\u2019s business has experienced revenue declines in recent years which we expect to continue. We plan to seek opportunities in the future to divest some or all of Glowpoint\u2019s business.\nRecent Developments\nOn February 1, 2021, we determined to voluntarily withdraw the listing of the Company\u2019s common stock from the NYSE American Stock Exchange (the \u201cNYSE American\u201d) and transfer such listing to The Nasdaq Capital Market (\u201cNasdaq\u201d). The listing and trading of our common stock on the NYSE American ended on February 11, 2021, and began trading on Nasdaq on February 12, 2021.\nThe terms of the Company\u2019s Series D and Series E Preferred Stock, par value $0.0001 per share (together, the \u201cSeries D and E Preferred Stock\u201d), provided that such shares were automatically convertible into a number of shares of the Company\u2019s common stock equal to the accrued value of the preferred shares (initially $28.50), plus any accrued dividends thereon, divided by the conversion price (initially $2.85 per share, subject to specified adjustments) upon the completion of both (i) approval of such conversion by the Company\u2019s stockholders entitled to vote thereon (which occurred on December 19, 2019); and (ii) the receipt of all required authorizations and approval of a new listing application for the combined organization following the Company\u2019s October 2019 acquisition of Oblong Industries from the NYSE American or any such other exchange upon which the Company\u2019s securities are then listed for trading. This conversion condition was completed in its entirety, and the Series D and E Preferred Stock automatically converted to shares of common stock pursuant to their terms, effective upon the commencement of trading of the common stock on Nasdaq in February 2021 as described above.\nFollowing the conversion of the Series D and E Preferred Stock during February 2021, the Company had issued and outstanding no shares of Preferred Stock.\nOur Products and Services\nOblong Industries\nMezzanine\u2122 Product Offerings\nOur flagship product is called Mezzanine\u2122, a family of turn-key products that enable dynamic and immersive visual collaboration across multi-users, multi-screens, multi-devices, and multi-locations. Mezzanine\u2122 allows multiple people to share, control and arrange content simultaneously, from any location, enabling all participants to see the same content in its entirety at the same time in identical formats, resulting in dramatic enhancements to both in-room and virtual videoconference presentations. Applications include video telepresence, laptop and application sharing, whiteboard sharing and slides. Spatial input allows content to be spread across screens, spanning different walls, scalable to an arbitrary number of displays and\ninteraction with our proprietary wand device. Mezzanine\u2122 substantially enhances day-to-day virtual meetings with technology that accelerates decision making, improves communication, and increases productivity. Mezzanine\u2122 scales up to support the most immersive and commanding innovation centers; across to link labs, conference spaces, and situation rooms; and down for the smallest work groups. Mezzanine\u2019s digital collaboration platform can be sold as delivered systems in various configurations for small teams to total immersion experiences. The family includes the 200 Series (two display screen), 300 Series (three screen), and 600 Series (six screen). The Company also sells maintenance and support contracts and license agreements.\nSee \u201cMarket Need--Oblong Industries\u201d below for further discussion of our Mezzanine product offerings.\nOblong (formerly Glowpoint)\nManaged Services for Video Collaboration\nOur services are designed to provide a comprehensive suite of automated and concierge applications to simplify the user experience and expedite the adoption of video as the primary means of collaboration. Our customers include Fortune 1000 companies, along with small and medium enterprises in a variety of industries. We market our services globally through a multi-channel sales approach that includes direct sales and channel partners.\nWe provide a range of video collaboration services, from automated to orchestrated, to address the spectrum of user experience and business applications, in an effort to drive adoption of video throughout the enterprise. We deliver our services through a hybrid service platform or as a service layer on top of our customers\u2019 video infrastructure. We provide our customers with the following services to meet their videoconferencing needs:\n\u2022Managed Videoconferencing is a \u201chigh-touch\u201d concierge-based offering where we set up and manage customer videoconferences. Our managed videoconferencing services are offered to our customers on either a usage basis or on a monthly subscription. These services include call scheduling and launching, and videoconference monitoring, support and reporting.\n\u2022Remote Service Management provides an overlay to enterprise information technology (\u201cIT\u201d) and channel partner support organizations and provides 24/7 support and management of customer video environments. Our services are designed to align with a globally recognized set of best practices, Information Technology Infrastructure Library (\u201cITIL\u201d), to standardize processes and communicate through a consistent set of terms with our customers and partners. We leverage an IT service management (\u201cITSM\u201d) provider, ServiceNow, Inc., to systematically provide Remote Service Management, as well as enable us to integrate with an enterprise\u2019s systems and workflows. We offer, on a monthly subscription basis, three tiers of Remote Service Management options, ranging from remote proactive automated monitoring to end-to-end management to complement the needs of IT support organizations (including 24x7 support desk, incident/problem/change management, site certifications, and service level agreements).\nNetwork Services\nOur network services provide our customers around the world with network solutions that ensure reliable, high-quality and secure traffic of video, data and internet. Network services are offered to our customers on a subscription basis. Our network services business carries variable costs associated with the purchasing and reselling of this connectivity. We offer our customers the following networking solutions that can be tailored to each customer\u2019s needs:\n\u2022Cloud Connect: Video\u2122: Allows our customers to outsource the management of their video traffic to us and provides the customer\u2019s office locations with a secure, dedicated video network connection to the Oblong Cloud for video communications.\n\u2022Cloud Connect: Converge\u2122: Provides customized Multiprotocol Label Switching (\u201cMPLS\u201d) solutions for customers who require a converged network. A converged network is an efficient network solution that combines the customer\u2019s voice, video, data, and Internet traffic over one or more common access circuits. We fully manage and prioritize traffic to ensure that video and other business critical applications run smoothly.\n\u2022Cloud Connect: Cross Connect\u2122: Allows the customer to leverage their existing carrier for the extension of a Layer 2 private line to our data center.\nProfessional and Other Services\nOur professional services include onsite support, or dispatch, as well as configuration or customization of equipment or software on behalf of a customer. On a limited basis, we also resell video equipment to our customers.\nSales and Marketing\nOblong Industries has sold its product offerings through both direct customer sales and channel partners. Oblong Industries had six employees engaged in sales and marketing activities at December 31, 2020. In June 2019, Oblong Industries entered into a sales channel partner agreement with Cisco Systems, Inc. As a result, the family of Mezzanine\u2122 product offerings became available globally on the Cisco Global Price List as a part of the Cisco SolutionsPlus Program. This program allows Cisco\u2019s customers and channel partners to purchase Mezzanine\u2122 through Cisco\u2019s Global Price List to streamline the ordering process. We anticipate our investments in sales and marketing throughout 2021 will primarily focus on further developing our core channel partner relationships.\nOblong (formerly Glowpoint) has sold its services through both direct customer sales and indirect sales channels. Oblong reduced sales and marketing expenses in recent years in order to reduce expenses and improve cash flow from operations. At December 31, 2020, Oblong had one employee engaged in sales and marketing.\nMarket Need\nOblong Industries\nToday, ideation and content collaboration are gaining growing importance in both physical and virtual meeting environments to support collective brainstorming and expedite decision making. Visualization of ideas can happen more naturally when people expand the collaborative canvas from sharing a single content stream among many participants to empowering an entire team, such as through our Mezzanine\u2122 multistream solutions. While historically focused on in-room collaboration, the need for next-generation virtual collaboration solutions is on the rise, attributed to the confluence of several key trends that influence the way individuals collaborate. Key capabilities and features of our Mezzanine Series include:\n\u2022Share Work With Others. Easily present work by plugging in or sharing wirelessly with the Mezzanine app. Share up to 10 connected devices including laptops, in-room PCs, and digital media players. Upload images and slides to present and explore content alongside live video streams.\n\u2022Capture Ideas Instantly. Save snapshots of on-screen content to make sure good ideas don\u2019t get lost. Annotate content in the Mezzanine app and share thoughts with others. Download meeting materials to reference or share after the meeting.\n\u2022Visualize Options and Outcomes. Mezzanine content spans multiple displays so the information needed is in sight and on hand. Share more content, see more detail, and improve visual storytelling. Arrange content for side-by-side comparisons and cross-referencing.\n\u2022Unite Distributed Teams. Connect teams and get everyone on the same page. Meeting participants share the same visual workspace so they can perform like they are in the same room. Everyone in every location can add content and steer the conversation, increasing opportunity and motivation to participate.\n\u2022Connect with Ease. Mezzanine works seamlessly with existing video conferencing and collaboration solutions so teams can join meetings with the tools they use every day. Integration with Cisco and Polycom systems simplify connecting rooms with voice, video, and content.\n\u2022Orchestrate Content. Place content anywhere in the room from anywhere in the room with Mezzanine\u2019s award-winning wands. Gestural interaction makes it easy to move and highlight content to focus the attention of the team.\nWe believe key drivers for demand include:\n\u2022rapid growth of cloud-based unified communications (UC) services adoption and continuously increasing collaborative intensity in workplaces;\n\u2022accelerating demand for low-cost video conferencing options such as USB conference room cameras and audio/video soundbars;\n\u2022rising appetite among end-user organizations for content sharing as well as content collaboration capabilities including ideation, annotation, illustration, and coediting;\n\u2022convergence of audio, video and content collaboration (as opposed to siloed applications and platforms) to improve employee productivity;\n\u2022significant growth in the number of huddle rooms and flexible meeting spaces worldwide;\n\u2022preference for Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) screen share in meeting spaces; and\n\u2022growing number of distributed and remote workers.\nToday\u2019s knowledge workers are seeking optimal meeting spaces - both in and out of the office - that foster creativity, agility, innovation, and engagement. The trend towards ad-hoc and small group meetings has led to the creation of the huddle room concept, where workers can meet in a disruption-free setting. Globally, there are over 90 million meeting spaces, 33 million of which are huddle spaces. However, it is estimated that fewer than 5 percent of these spaces are truly \u2018full spectrum\u2019 collaboration enabled. Further, the penetration of stand-alone content sharing applications is significantly less than video penetration in large and huddle-sized meeting rooms. While pre-pandemic momentum suggested end-users were beginning to embrace simple, easy to install, intuitive, and affordable collaboration solutions that integrate with cloud-based collaboration software services, we believe as businesses begin to reopen there will be significant demand for higher forms of engagement that combines robust video conferencing with enhanced content sharing as users adapt to more flexible workplace alternatives. This combination focuses on allaying customer apprehension with regards to how to cost-effectively pursue an expanded collaboration strategy without replacing their existing investments.\nTransforming our Business Model\nWe are transforming our offerings to meet the evolving needs of our customers. As part of the transformation of our business, we are evolving certain aspects of our model by designing and developing software to include subscription-based offerings. Historically, our technology products and services have been developed and consumed in conventional commercial real estate spaces such as conference rooms. As our core collaboration products evolve, we expect to add more contemporary software features along with expanded accessibility beyond commercial spaces through both hybrid and SaaS offerings. These initiatives will require significant investment in technology development and sales and marketing. For a discussion of the risks associated with our strategy, see \u201c",
    "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOur business faces numerous risks, including those set forth below and those described elsewhere in this Report or in our other filings with the SEC. The risks described below are not the only risks that we face, nor are they necessarily listed in order of significance. Other risks and uncertainties may also affect our business. Any of these risks may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. When making an investment decision with respect to our common stock, you should also refer to the other information contained or incorporated by reference in this Report, including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nThe Oblong (formerly Glowpoint) business experienced declines in revenue in recent fiscal years and may continue to experience further revenue decline in future periods. Our revenue increased for calendar year 2020 as compared to calendar year 2019; primarily attributable to the acquisition of Oblong Industries on October 1, 2019. The Oblong (formerly Glowpoint)\nbusiness has experienced declines in revenue for the last several years. We believe that these revenue declines are primarily due to net attrition of customers and lower demand for Glowpoint\u2019s services given the competitive environment and pressure on pricing that exists in our industry. During the past several years, we had limited resources to invest in product development and sales and marketing in order to reverse the Company\u2019s revenue trends.\nRevenue growth and increase in the market share of our products depends on successful adoption of our Mezzanine product offerings in the Cisco partner channel, which requires sufficient sales, marketing, and product development funding. With the acquisition of Oblong Industries, our goal is to grow revenue from an increase in adoption of Oblong Industries\u2019 product offerings. If we cannot successfully gain adoption of our Mezzanine product offerings in the Cisco partner channel or through other channels, we may not be able to grow revenue and/or increase the market share of our products. We cannot assure you that we will have sufficient funds available to invest in sales and marketing and continued product development in order to achieve revenue growth.\nWe have a history of substantial net operating losses and we may incur future net losses. We reported substantial net losses in recent years. We may not be able to achieve revenue growth or profitability or generate positive cash flow on a quarterly or annual basis in the future. If we do not achieve profitability in the future, the value of our common stock may be adversely impacted, and we could have difficulty obtaining capital to continue our operations.\nOur business activities may require additional financing that might not be obtainable on acceptable terms, if at all, which could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, liquidity and its ability to operate as a going concern in the future. The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As shown in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, as of December 31, 2020, we had $5.3 million in cash (including restricted cash), an accumulated consolidated deficit of $192.9 million resulting from historical net losses, and total obligations of $2.4 million under the Paycheck Protection Program Loan (\u201cPPP Loan\u201d). In addition, the Oblong (formerly Glowpoint) business has experienced declines in revenue in recent fiscal years, with revenue of $12.6 million, $9.7 million, and $6.3 million in 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively.\nIn April 2020, we received cash proceeds of $2,417,000 from the PPP Loan from MidFirst Bank under the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) contained within the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act. The PPP Loan has a term of two years, is unsecured, and is guaranteed by the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA). The PPP Loan carries a fixed interest rate of one percent (1.0%) per annum, with the first six months of interest deferred. The Company estimates that approximately $2,266,000 of the PPP Loan will be forgiven. However, this estimate is subject to change and there is no guarantee that the Company will receive any forgiveness for any fixed amount of any PPP Loan principal received by the Company. Our capital requirements in the future will continue to depend on numerous factors, including the timing and amount of revenue for the combined organization, customer renewal rates and the timing of collection of outstanding accounts receivable, in each case particularly as it relates to the combined organization\u2019s major customers, the expense to deliver services, expense for sales and marketing, expense for research and development, capital expenditures, the cost involved in protecting intellectual property rights, the amount of forgiveness of the PPP Loan, if any, and the debt service obligations under the PPP Loan. We expect to continue to invest in product development and sales and marketing expenses with the goal of growing the Company\u2019s revenue in the future. The Company believes that, based on the combined organization\u2019s current projection of revenue, expenses, capital expenditures, debt service obligations, and cash flows, it will not have sufficient resources to fund its operations for the next twelve months following the filing of this Report. We believe additional capital will be required to fund operations and provide growth capital including investments in technology, product development and sales and marketing. To access capital to fund operations or provide growth capital, we will need to raise capital in one or more debt and/or equity offerings. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in raising necessary capital or that any such offering will be on terms acceptable to the Company. If we are unable to raise additional capital that may be needed on terms acceptable to us, it could have a material adverse effect on the Company. The factors discussed above raise substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from these uncertainties.\nWe received a loan under the Paycheck Protection Program of the CARES Act, and all or a portion of the loan may not be forgivable. Under the CARES Act, we will be eligible to apply for forgiveness of certain PPP Loan proceeds used to pay payroll costs, rent, utilities and other qualifying expenses during the eight-week period following receipt of the PPP Loan, provided that we maintain our number of employees and compensation within certain parameters during such period. If the conditions outlined in the PPP Loan program are adhered to by us, all or part of such PPP Loan could be forgiven. The Company estimates that approximately $2,266,000 of the PPP Loan will be forgiven. However, this estimate is subject to change and there is no guarantee that the Company will receive any forgiveness for any fixed amount of any PPP Loan principal received by the Company.\nIf we fail to achieve broad market acceptance on a timely basis, we will not be able to compete effectively, and we will likely experience continued declines in revenue and lower gross margins. We operate in a highly competitive, quickly changing environment, and our future success depends on our ability to develop or acquire, and introduce, new products that achieve broad market acceptance. Our future success will depend in large part upon our ability to identify demand trends in the markets in which we operate, and to quickly develop or acquire, and build and sell products that satisfy these demands in a cost-effective manner. In order to differentiate our products from our competitors\u2019 products, we must increase our focus and capital investment in research and development. If our products do not achieve widespread market acceptance, or if we are unsuccessful in capitalizing on market opportunities, our future growth may be slowed and our financial results could be harmed. Also, as the mix of our business increasingly includes new products and services that require additional investment, this shift may adversely impact our margins, at least in the near-term. Successfully predicting demand trends is difficult, and it is very difficult to predict the effect that introducing a new product will have on existing product sales. We will also need to respond effectively to new product announcements by our competitors by quickly introducing competitive products.\nIn addition, we may not be able to successfully manage integration of any new product lines with our existing products. Selling new product lines in new markets will require our management to learn different strategies in order to be successful. We may be unsuccessful in launching a new product line in new markets which requires management of new suppliers, potential new customers and new business models. Our management may not have the experience of selling in these new markets and we may not be able to grow our business as planned. If we are unable to effectively and successfully further develop these new product lines, we may not be able to achieve our desired sales targets and our gross margins may be adversely affected.\nWe may experience delays and quality issues in releasing new products, which could result in lower quarterly revenue than expected. In addition, we may experience product introductions that fall short of our projected rates of market adoption. Any future delays in product development and introduction, or product introductions that do not meet broad market acceptance, or unsuccessful launches of new product lines could result in:\n\u2022loss of or delay in revenue and loss of market share;\n\u2022negative publicity and damage to our reputation and brand;\n\u2022a decline in the average selling price of our products; and\n\u2022adverse reactions in our sales channels.\nIf we cannot successfully introduce new product lines, either through rapid innovation or acquisition of new products or product lines, we may not be able to maintain or increase the market share of our products. In addition, if we are unable to successfully introduce or acquire new products with higher gross margins, or if we are unable to improve the margins on our existing product lines, our revenue and overall gross margin will likely decline.\nWe cannot assure you that our present or future products will achieve market acceptance on a sustained basis. In order to achieve market acceptance and achieve future revenue growth, we must introduce new product lines, incorporate new technologies into our existing product lines and design, and develop and successfully commercialize higher performance products in a timely manner. We cannot assure you that it will be able to offer new or complementary products that gain market acceptance quickly enough to avoid decreased revenues during current or future product introductions or transitions.\nWe depend upon the development of new products and services, and enhancements to existing products and services, and if we fail to predict and respond to emerging technological trends and customer\u2019s changing needs, our operating result may suffer. The markets for our products and services are characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards, and new product and service introductions. Our operating results depend on our ability to develop and introduce new products and services into existing and emerging markets and to reduce the production costs of existing products. If customers do not purchase and/or renew our offerings our business could be harmed. The process of developing new technology related to market transitions - such as collaboration, digital transformation and cloud - is complex and uncertain, and if we fail to accurately predict customers\u2019 changing needs and emerging technological trends our business could be harmed. We must commit significant resources, including the investments we have been making in our strategic priorities to developing new products and services before knowing whether our investments will result in products and services the market will accept. In particular, if our modeled evolution from on-premises products to hybrid and, ultimately, SaaS consumption of our flagship Mezzanine\u2122 products does not emerge as we believe it will, or if the industry does not evolve as we believe it will, or if our strategy for addressing this evolution is not successful, many of our strategic initiatives and investments may be of no or limited value. Similarly, our business could be harmed if we fail to develop, or fail to develop in a timely fashion, offerings to address other market transitions, or if the offerings addressing these other transitions that ultimately succeed are based on technology, or\nan approach to technology, different from ours. In addition, our business could be adversely affected in periods surrounding our new product introductions if customers delay purchasing decisions to qualify or otherwise evaluate new product offerings.\nWe have also been transforming our business to move from selling individual products and services generally consumed in conventional commercial conference rooms to selling products and services integrated into architectures and solutions, and we are seeking to meet the evolving needs of customers which include offering our products and solutions in the manner in which customers wish to consume them. As a part of this transformation, we continue to make changes to how we are organized and how we build and deliver our technology, including changes in our business models with customers. If our strategy for addressing our customer needs, or the architectures and solutions we develop do not meet those needs, or the changes we are making in how we are organized and how we build and deliver or technology is incorrect or ineffective, we may not be able to achieve our customer adoption and revenue goals, in connection with which our operating results and financial condition may be negatively affected.\nFurthermore, we may not execute successfully on our vision or strategy because of challenges with regard to product planning and timing, technical hurdles that we fail to overcome in a timely fashion, or a lack of appropriate resources. This could result in competitors, some of which may also be our partners, providing those solutions before we do and loss of market share, revenue, and earnings. In addition, the growth in demand for technology delivered as a service enables new competitors to enter the market. The success of new products and services depends on several factors, including proper new product and service definition, component costs, timely completion and introduction of these products and services, differentiation of new products and services from those of our competitors, and market acceptance of these products and services. There can be no assurance that we will successfully identify new product and services opportunities, develop and bring new products and services to market in a timely manner, or achieve market acceptance of our products and services or that products, services and technologies developed by others will not render our products, services or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive.\nOur success depends on our ability to recruit and retain adequate engineering talent. The market for our products and services are characterized by rapidly changing technology. The pressure to innovate and stay ahead of our competitors requires an investment in talent. Specifically, competing successfully in this market depends on our ability to recruit and retain adequate engineering talent. Because of the competitive nature of this industry, this can prove a challenge. Failure to recruit and retain adequate talent could negatively impact our ability to keep up with the rapidly changing technology.\nOur success is highly dependent on the evolution of our overall market and on general economic conditions. The market for collaboration technology and services is evolving rapidly. Although certain industry analysts project significant growth for this market, their projections may not be realized. Our future growth depends on broad acceptance and adoption of collaboration technologies and services. There can be no assurance that this market will grow, that our offerings will be adopted or that businesses will purchase our collaboration technologies and services. If we are unable to react quickly to changes in the market, if the market fails to develop or develops more slowly than expected, or if our services do not achieve market acceptance, then we are unlikely to achieve profitability. Additionally, adverse economic conditions may cause a decline in business and consumer spending which could adversely affect our business and financial performance.\nWe may be unable to adequately respond to rapid changes in technology. The market for our collaboration technologies and services is characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards and frequent product introductions. The introduction of products and services embodying new technology and the emergence of new industry standards may render our existing product and service offerings obsolete and unmarketable if we are unable to adapt to change. A significant factor in our ability to grow and to remain competitive is our ability to successfully introduce new products and services that embody new technology, anticipate and incorporate evolving industry standards and achieve levels of functionality and price acceptable to the market. If our offerings are unable to meet expectations or unable to keep pace with technological changes in the collaboration industry, our offerings could eventually become obsolete. We may be unable to allocate the funds necessary to upgrade our offerings as improvements in collaboration technologies are introduced. In the event that other companies develop more advanced service offerings, our competitive position relative to such companies would be harmed.\nWe operate in a highly competitive market and many of our competitors have greater financial resources and established relationships with major corporate customers. The collaboration industry is highly competitive and includes large, well-financed participants. Many of these organizations have substantially greater financial and other resources than us, furnish some of the same services provided by us, and have established relationships with major corporate customers that have policies of purchasing directly from them. Our competitors offer services similar both on a bundled and un-bundled basis, creating a highly competitive environment with pressure on pricing of such services. We believe that as the demand for collaboration technologies continues to increase, additional competitors, many of which may have greater resources than us, will continue to enter this market.\nWe rely on a limited number of customers for a significant portion of our revenue, and the loss of any one of those customers, or several of our smaller customers, could materially harm our business. A significant portion of our revenue is generated from a limited number of customers. For the year ended December 31, 2020, two major customers each accounted for 17% of the Company\u2019s total consolidated revenue. The composition of our significant customers will vary from period to period and we expect that most of our revenue will continue, for the foreseeable future, to come from a relatively small number of customers. Consequently, our financial results may fluctuate significantly from period-to-period based on the actions of one or more significant customers. A customer may take actions that affect the Company for reasons that we cannot anticipate or control, such as reasons related to the customer\u2019s financial condition, changes in the customer\u2019s business strategy or operations, changes in technology and the introduction of alternative competing products, or as the result of the perceived quality or cost-effectiveness of our products. Our agreements with these customers may be canceled if we materially breach the agreement or for other reasons outside of our control such as insolvency or financial hardship that may result in a customer filing for bankruptcy court protection against unsecured creditors. In addition, our customers may seek to renegotiate the terms of current agreements or renewals. The loss of or a reduction in sales or anticipated sales to our most significant or several of our smaller customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAny system failures or interruptions may cause loss of customers. Our success depends, in part, on the seamless, uninterrupted operation of our managed service offerings. As the complexity and volume continue to increase, we will face increasing demands and challenges in managing them. Any prolonged failure of these services or other systems or hardware that cause significant interruptions to our operations could seriously damage our reputation and result in customer attrition and financial loss.\nThere is limited market awareness of our services. Our future success will be dependent in significant part on our ability to generate demand for our collaboration technologies and services. To this end, our direct marketing and indirect sales operations must increase market awareness of our service offerings to generate increased revenue. We have limited sales and marketing resources, with 7 employees in sales and marketing as of December 31, 2020, and we have had limited resources and/or cash flow in the last several years for spending on advertising, marketing and additional personnel. Our products and services require a sophisticated sales effort targeted at the senior management of our prospective customers. If we were to hire new employees in sales and marketing, those employees will require training and take time to achieve full productivity. We cannot be certain that our new hires will become as productive as necessary or that we will be able to hire enough qualified individuals or retain existing employees in the future. In June 2019, Oblong Industries entered into a sales channel partner agreement with Cisco Systems, Inc. As a result, the family of Mezzanine\u2122 product offerings became available globally on the Cisco Global Price List as a part of the Cisco SolutionsPlus Program. This program allows Cisco\u2019s customers and channel partners to purchase Mezzanine\u2122 through Cisco\u2019s Global Price List to streamline the ordering process. Given the limited history with sales through this channel, there can be no assurance that we will generate significant sales through the Cisco channel program. We cannot be certain that we will be successful in our efforts to market and sell our products and services, and, if we are not successful in building market awareness and generating increased sales, future results of operations will be adversely affected.\nWe rely on third-party software that may be difficult to replace or may not perform adequately. We integrate third-party licensed software components into our technology infrastructure (e.g., ServiceNow, Inc.) in order to provide our services. This software may not continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms or pricing or may fail to continue to be updated to remain competitive. The loss of the right to use this third-party software may increase our expenses or impact the provisioning of our services. The failure of this third-party software could materially impact the performance of our services and may cause material harm to our business or results of operations.\nWe depend upon our network providers and facilities infrastructure. Our success depends upon our ability to implement, expand and adapt our network infrastructure and support services to accommodate an increasing amount of video traffic and evolving customer requirements at an acceptable cost. This has required and will continue to require that we enter into agreements with providers of infrastructure capacity, equipment, facilities and support services on an ongoing basis. We cannot ensure that any of these agreements can be obtained on satisfactory terms and conditions. We also anticipate that future expansions and adaptations of our network infrastructure facilities may be necessary in order to respond to growth in the number of customers served.\nOur network could fail, which could negatively impact our revenues. Our success depends upon our ability to deliver reliable, high-speed access to our channels\u2019 and customers\u2019 data centers and upon the ability and willingness of our telecommunications providers to deliver reliable, high-speed telecommunications service through their networks. Our network and facilities, and other networks and facilities providing services to us, are vulnerable to damage, unauthorized access or cessation of operations from human error and tampering, breaches of security, fires, earthquakes, severe storms, power losses, telecommunications failures, software defects, intentional acts of vandalism including computer viruses, and similar events. The occurrence of a\nnatural disaster or other unanticipated problems at the network operations center, key sites at which we locate routers, switches and other computer equipment that make up the backbone of our service offering and hosted infrastructure, or at one or more of our partners\u2019 data centers, could substantially and adversely impact our business. We cannot ensure that we will not experience failures or shutdowns relating to individual facilities or even catastrophic failure of the entire network or hosted infrastructure. Any damage to, or failure of, our systems or service providers could result in reductions in, or terminations of, services supplied to our customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur network depends upon telecommunications carriers who could limit or deny us access to their network or fail to perform, which would have a material adverse effect on our business. We rely upon the ability and willingness of certain telecommunications carriers and other corporations to provide us with reliable high-speed telecommunications service through their networks. If these telecommunications carriers and other corporations decide not to continue to provide service to us through their networks on substantially the same terms and conditions (including, without limitation, price, early termination liability, and installation interval), if at all, it would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, many of our service level objectives are dependent upon satisfactory performance by our telecommunications carriers. If they fail to so perform, it may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nCybersecurity incidents could disrupt business operations, result in the loss of critical and confidential information, and adversely impact our reputation and results of operations. In the ordinary course of providing video communications services, we transmit sensitive and proprietary information of our customers. We are dependent on the proper function, availability and security of our information systems, including without limitation those systems utilized in our operations. We have undertaken measures to protect the safety and security of our information systems and the data maintained within those systems, and on an annual basis, we test the adequacy of our security measures. As part of our efforts, we may be required to expend significant capital to protect against the threat of security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by such breaches, including unauthorized access to proprietary customer data stored in our information systems and the introduction of computer malware to our systems. However, there can be no assurance our safety and security measures will detect and prevent security breaches in a timely manner or otherwise prevent damage or interruption of our systems and operations. We may be vulnerable to losses associated with the improper functioning, security breach or unavailability of our information systems. In the event of a cybersecurity incident, our affiliates and customers may seek to hold us liable for any damages, which could result in reputational damage, litigation, or negative publicity, among other negative consequences.\nWe may experience material disconnections and/or reductions in the prices of our services and may not be able to replace the loss of revenues. Historically, we have experienced both significant disconnections of services and also reductions in the prices of our services. We endeavor to obtain long-term commitments from new customers, as well as expand our relationships with current customers. The disconnection of services by our significant customers or by several of our smaller customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Service contract durations and termination liabilities are defined within the terms and conditions of the Company\u2019s agreements with our customers. Termination of services in our existing agreements typically require a minimum of 30 days\u2019 notice and are subject to early termination penalties equal to the amount of accrued and unpaid charges including the remaining term length multiplied by any fixed monthly fees. The standard form of service agreement with us includes an auto-renewal clause at the end of each term if the customer does not choose to terminate service at that time. Certain customers and partners negotiate master agreements with custom termination liabilities that differ from our standard form of service agreement.\nOur failure to obtain or maintain the right to use certain intellectual property may negatively affect our business. Our future success and competitive position depends in part upon our ability to obtain and maintain certain proprietary intellectual property to be used in connection with our services. While we are not currently engaged in any intellectual property litigation, we could become subject to lawsuits in which it is alleged that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of others or we could commence lawsuits against others who we believe are infringing upon our rights. Our involvement in intellectual property litigation could result in significant expense, adversely affecting the development of sales of the challenged product and diverting the efforts of our technical and management personnel, whether or not such litigation is resolved in our favor.\nIn the event of an adverse outcome as a defendant in any such litigation, we may, among other things, be required to pay substantial damages; cease the development, use or sale of services that infringe upon other patented intellectual property; expend significant resources to develop or acquire non-infringing intellectual property; discontinue the use or incorporation of infringing technology; or obtain licenses to the infringing intellectual property. We cannot ensure that we would be successful in such development or acquisition or that such licenses would be available upon reasonable terms. Any such development, acquisition or license could require the expenditure of substantial time and other resources and could have a negative effect on our business and financial results.\nAn adverse outcome as plaintiff in any such litigation, in addition to the costs involved, may, among other things, result in the loss of the intellectual property (such as a patent) that was the subject of the lawsuit by a determination of invalidity or unenforceability, significantly increase competition as a result of such determination, and require the payment of penalties resulting from counterclaims by the defendant.\nWe may not be able to protect the rights to our intellectual property. Failure to protect our existing intellectual property rights may result in the loss of our exclusivity or the right to use our technologies. If we do not adequately ensure our freedom to use certain technology, we may have to pay others for rights to use their intellectual property, pay damages for infringement or misappropriation and/or be enjoined from using such intellectual property. We rely on patent, trade secret, trademark and copyright law to protect our intellectual property. Some of our intellectual property is not covered by any patent. As we further develop our services and related intellectual property, we expect to seek additional patent protection. Our patent position is subject to complex factual and legal issues that may give rise to uncertainty as to the validity, scope and enforceability of a particular patent. Accordingly, we cannot assure that any of the patents owned by us or other patents that other parties license to us in the future will not be invalidated, circumvented, challenged, rendered unenforceable or licensed to others; any of our pending or future patent applications will be issued with the breadth of claim coverage sought by it, if issued at all; or any patents owned by or licensed to us, although valid, will not be dominated by a patent or patents to others having broader claims. Additionally, effective patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable, limited or not applied for in certain foreign countries.\nWe also seek to protect our proprietary intellectual property, including intellectual property that may not be patented or patentable, in part by confidentiality agreements. We cannot ensure that these agreements will not be breached, that we will have adequate remedies for any breach or that such persons will not assert rights to intellectual property arising out of these relationships.\nWe are exposed to the credit and other counterparty risk of our customers in the ordinary course of our business. Our customers have varying degrees of creditworthiness, and we may not always be able to fully anticipate or detect deterioration in their creditworthiness and overall financial condition, which could expose us to an increased risk of nonpayment under our contracts with them. In the event that a material customer or customers default on their payment obligations to us, discontinue buying services from us or use their buying power with us to reduce its revenue, this could materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nOur future plans could be adversely affected if we are unable to attract or retain key personnel. We have attracted a highly skilled management team and specialized workforce. Our future success is dependent in part on attracting and retaining qualified management and technical personnel. Our inability to hire qualified personnel on a timely basis, or the departure of key employees (including Peter Holst, the Company\u2019s President and CEO) without a suitable replacement therefor could materially and adversely affect our business development and therefore, our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf our actual liability for sales and use taxes and federal regulatory fees is different from our accrued liability, it could have a material impact on our financial condition. Each state has different rules and regulations governing sales and use taxes, and these rules and regulations are subject to varying interpretations that may change over time. We review these rules and regulations periodically and, when we believe our services are subject to sales and use taxes in a particular state, we voluntarily engage state tax authorities in order to determine how to comply with their rules and regulations. Vendors of services, like us, are typically held responsible by taxing authorities for the collection and payment of any applicable sales taxes and federal fees. If one or more taxing authorities determines that taxes should have, but have not, been paid with respect to our services, we may be liable for past taxes in addition to taxes going forward. Liability for past taxes may also include very substantial interest and penalty charges. Our customer contracts provide that our customers must pay all applicable sales taxes and fees. Nevertheless, customers may be reluctant to pay back taxes and may refuse responsibility for interest or penalties associated with those taxes. If we are required to collect and pay back taxes and the associated interest and penalties, and if our customers fail or refuse to reimburse us for all or a portion of these amounts, we will have incurred unplanned expenses that may be substantial. Moreover, imposition of such taxes on our services going forward will effectively increase the cost of such services to our customers and may adversely affect our ability to retain existing customers or to gain new customers in the areas in which such taxes are imposed. We may also become subject to tax audits or similar procedures in states where we already pays sales and use taxes. The assessment of taxes, interest, and penalties as a result of audits, litigation, or otherwise could be materially adverse to our current and future results of operations and financial condition.\nWe depend upon suppliers and have limited sources for some services. We rely on other companies to supply some components of our network infrastructure and the means to access our network. Certain products and services that we resell and certain components that we require for our network are available only from limited sources. We could be adversely affected if such sources were to become unavailable to us on commercially reasonable terms. We cannot ensure that, on an ongoing basis, we will be able to obtain third-party services cost-effectively and on the scale and within the time frames that we require, if at all. Failure to obtain or to continue to make use of such third-party services would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur failure to properly manage the distribution of our services could result in a loss of revenues. We currently sell our services both directly to customers and through channel partners. Successfully managing the interaction of our direct and indirect sales channels to reach various potential customers for our services is a complex process. Each sales channel has distinct risks and costs, and therefore, our failure to implement the most advantageous balance in the sales model for our services could adversely affect our revenue and profitability.\nWe will need to raise additional capital by issuing securities or debt, which may cause significant dilution to our stockholders and restrict our operations. We will need to raise additional capital to fund our near and long-term operations. Additional financing may not be available when we need it or may not be available on favorable terms. To the extent that we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities, the terms of such an issuance may cause more significant dilution to our stockholders\u2019 ownership, and the terms of any new equity securities may have preferences over the combined organization\u2019s common stock. Any debt financing we enter into may involve covenants that restrict our operations. These restrictive covenants may include limitations on additional borrowing and specific restrictions on the use of our assets, as well as prohibitions on our ability to create liens, pay dividends, redeem stock or make investments.\nRisks Related to Our Business Resulting From the Coronavirus Pandemic\nThe coronavirus pandemic is an emerging serious threat to health and economic well-being affecting our employees, investors, customers, and other business partners. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization announced that infections of the novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) had become pandemic, and on March 13, the U.S. President announced a National Emergency relating to the disease. Throughout 2020, widespread infection in the United States and abroad prompted National, state, and local authorities to require or recommend social distancing and impose quarantine and isolation measures on large portions of the population, including mandatory business closures. These measures, while intended to protect human life, have had serious adverse impacts on domestic and foreign economies, and these impacts could continue, in various degrees of severity and for an uncertain duration. The effectiveness of economic stabilization efforts, including government payments to affected citizens and industries and the availability of the vaccine introduced in December 2020, is uncertain.\nThe sweeping nature of the coronavirus pandemic makes it extremely difficult to predict how the Company\u2019s business and operations will be affected in the longer run, but we expect that it may materially affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. The extent to which the coronavirus impacts our results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information that may emerge concerning the severity of the coronavirus and the actions to contain the coronavirus or treat its impact, among others. Moreover, the coronavirus outbreak has had indeterminable adverse effects on general commercial activity and the world economy, and our business and results of operations could be adversely affected to the extent that this coronavirus or any other epidemic harms the global economy generally and/or the markets in which we operate specifically.\nFurther, our current and potential customers may likely be required to continue to allocate resources and adjust budgets to accommodate potential contingencies related to the effects of the coronavirus and measures required to be put in place to prevent and contain contamination of the virus. An existing major customer of the Company suspended certain professional services we provided to the customer effective April 30, 2020 due to COVID-19. These services accounted for $1.0 million, or 9%, of the Company\u2019s revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020. Uncertainties resulting from COVID-19 may result in additional customers delaying budget expenditures or re-allocating resources, which would result in a decrease in orders from these customers. Any such decrease in orders from these customers could cause a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results and our ability to generate positive cash flows. Further, our current service offerings and our future growth may be minimized to a point that would be detrimental to our business development activities.\nAny of the foregoing factors, or other cascading effects of the coronavirus pandemic that are not currently foreseeable, could materially increase our costs, negatively impact our sales and damage the company\u2019s results of operations and its liquidity position, possibly to a significant degree. The duration of any such impacts cannot be predicted.\nA material disruption in our workplace as a result of the coronavirus could affect our ability to carry on our business operations in the ordinary course and may require additional cost and effort should our employees continue to not be able to be physically on-premises. While many of our employees work remotely in the ordinary course, other employees work from our offices. Should we continue to experience periods where it is not prudent for some or all of these employees to be physically present on-site, we may not have the benefit of the time and skills of such employees or we may be required to adjust our current business operations and processes to permit some or all of such employees to work remotely in order to avoid the potential spread of the virus. In addition, for a currently indeterminate amount of time we may be forced to continue to suspend all non-essential travel for our employees and discourage employee attendance at industry events and in-person work-related meetings. We can offer no assurances that these adjustments would not cause material disruptions to our daily operations or require us to expend our time, energy and resources to make necessary adjustments, and they therefore may result in a material adverse effect on our sales, research and development and other critical areas of our business model.\nRisks to Owning Our Common Stock\nOur stock price has fluctuated in the past, has recently been volatile and may be volatile in the future, and as a result, investors in our common stock could incur substantial losses. Our stock price has fluctuated in the past, has recently been volatile and may be volatile in the future. For example, on November 30, 2020, the intra-day sales price of our common stock fluctuated between a reported low sale price of $4.07 and a reported high sales price of $12.25. We may incur rapid and substantial decreases in our stock price in the foreseeable future that are unrelated to our operating performance or prospects. In addition, the COVID-19 outbreak has caused broad stock market and industry fluctuations. The stock market in general and the market for technology companies in particular have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. As a result of this volatility, investors may experience losses on their investment in our common stock. The market price for our common stock may be influenced by many factors, including the following:\n\u00b7\ninvestor reaction to our business strategy;\n\u00b7\nthe success of competitive products or technologies;\n\u00b7\nour continued compliance with the listing standards of the Nasdaq;\n\u00b7\nregulatory or legal developments in the United States and other countries, especially changes in laws or regulations applicable to our products;\n\u00b7\nvariations in our financial results or those of companies that are perceived to be similar to us;\n\u00b7\nour ability or inability to raise additional capital and the terms on which we raise it;\n\u00b7\ndeclines in the market prices of stocks generally;\n\u00b7\ntrading volume of our common stock;\n\u00b7\nsales of our common stock by us or our stockholders;\n\u00b7\ngeneral economic, industry and market conditions; and\n\u00b7\nother events or factors, including those resulting from such events, or the prospect of such events, including war, terrorism and other international conflicts, public health issues including health epidemics or pandemics, such as the outbreak of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19), and natural disasters such as fire, hurricanes, earthquakes, tornados or other adverse weather and climate conditions, whether occurring in the United States or elsewhere, could disrupt our operations, disrupt the operations of our suppliers or result in political or economic instability.\nThese broad market and industry factors may seriously harm the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. Further, recent increases are significantly inconsistent with any improvements in actual or expected operating performance, financial condition or other indicators of value, including our loss per share of $1.48 and $1.52 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Since the stock price of our common stock has fluctuated in the past, has been recently volatile and may be volatile in the future, investors in our common stock could incur substantial losses. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market, securities class-action litigation has often been instituted against companies. Such litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. There can be no guarantee that our stock price will remain at current prices or that future sales of our common stock will not be at prices lower than those sold to investors.\nThroughout much of our corporate history, our common stock has been thinly traded, and therefore has therefore been susceptible to wide price swings. While our common stock has recently experienced increased trading volume, we cannot ensure that this level of trading volume will continue, or that the increased trading volumes will lessen the historic volatility in the price for our common stock. Thinly traded stocks are more susceptible to significant and sudden price changes and the liquidity of our common stock depends upon the presence in the marketplace of willing buyers and sellers. At any time, the\nliquidity of our common stock may decrease to the thinly traded levels it has experienced in the past, and we cannot ensure that any holder of our securities will be able to find a buyer for its shares. Further, we cannot ensure that an organized public market for our securities will continue or that there will be any private demand for our common stock.\nAdditionally, recently, securities of certain companies have experienced significant and extreme volatility in stock price due short sellers of shares of common stock, known as a \u201cshort squeeze.\u201d These short squeezes have caused extreme volatility in those companies and in the market and have led to the price per share of those companies to trade at a significantly inflated rate that is disconnected from the underlying value of the company. Many investors who have purchased shares in those companies at an inflated rate face the risk of losing a significant portion of their original investment as the price per share has declined steadily as interest in those stocks have abated. While we have no reason to believe our shares would be the target of a short squeeze, there can be no assurance that we will not be in the future, and you may lose a significant portion or all of your investment if you purchase our shares at a rate that is significantly disconnected from our underlying value.\nPenny stock regulations may impose certain restrictions on the marketability of our securities. The SEC has adopted regulations which generally define a \u201cpenny stock\u201d to be any equity security that has a market price less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. Our common stock is presently subject to these regulations, which impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell such securities to persons other than established customers and accredited investors (generally those with a net worth in excess of $1,000,000 or annual income exceeding $200,000, or $300,000 together with their spouse). For transactions covered by these rules, the broker-dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchase of such securities and have received the purchaser\u2019s written consent to the transaction prior to the purchase. Additionally, for any transaction involving a \u201cpenny stock,\u201d unless exempt, the rules require the delivery, prior to the transaction, of a risk disclosure document mandated by the SEC relating to the \u201cpenny stock\u201d market. The broker-dealer must also disclose the commission payable to both the broker-dealer and the registered representative, current quotations for the securities and, if the broker-dealer is the sole market maker, the broker-dealer must disclose this fact and the broker-dealer\u2019s presumed control over the market. Finally, monthly statements must be sent disclosing recent price information for the \u201cpenny stock\u201d held in the account and information on the limited market in \u201cpenny stocks.\u201d Consequently, the \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules may restrict the ability of broker-dealers to sell our securities and may negatively affect the ability of purchasers of our shares of common stock to sell such securities.\nFuture operating results may vary from quarter to quarter, and we may fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors at any given time. We have experienced, and may continue to experience, significant quarterly fluctuations in operating results. Factors that cause fluctuation in our results of operations include lack of revenue growth or declines in revenue and declines in gross margins and increases in operating expenses. Accordingly, it is possible that in one or more future quarters our operating results will be adversely affected and fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors. If this happens, the trading price of our common stock may decline.\nSales of substantial amounts of common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales may occur, could reduce the market price of our common stock and make it more difficult for us and our stockholders to sell our equity securities in the future. The sale into the public market of a significant number of shares of common stock issued upon the conversion of the Series D and Series E Preferred Stock in February 2021, or the resale into the public market of shares issued in prior or future financings, could depress the trading price of our common stock and make it more difficult for us or our stockholders to sell equity securities in the future. Such transactions may include, but are not limited to (i) any future issuances by us of additional shares of our common stock or of other securities that are convertible or exchangeable for shares of common stock; and (ii) the resale of any previously issued but restricted shares of our common stock that become freely available for re-sale, whether through an effective registration statement or under Rule 144 of the Securities Act.\nWhile the sale of shares to the public might increase the trading volume of our common stock and thus the liquidity of our stockholders\u2019 investments, the resulting increase in the number of shares available for public sale could drive the price of our common stock down, thus reducing the value of our stockholders\u2019 investment and perhaps hindering our ability to raise additional funds in the future.\nOur charter documents and Delaware law could discourage takeover attempts and lead to management entrenchment. The Company\u2019s certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control of the company. These provisions could also make it difficult for stockholders to elect directors that are not nominated by the current members of the board of directors or take other corporate actions, including effecting changes in the Company\u2019s management. These provisions include:\n\u2022no cumulative voting in the election of directors, which limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect director candidates;\n\u2022the ability of our board of directors to issue shares of preferred stock and to determine the price and other terms of those shares, including preferences and voting rights, without stockholder approval, which could be used to significantly dilute the ownership of a hostile acquirer;\n\u2022the exclusive right of our board of directors to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of our board of directors or the resignation, death or removal of a director, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on its board of directors;\n\u2022the requirement that a special meeting of stockholders may be called only by the chairman of our board of directors or a majority of our board of directors, which could delay the ability of our stockholders to force consideration of a proposal or to take action, including the removal of directors;\n\u2022the ability of our board of directors, by majority vote, to amend the Company\u2019s amended and restated bylaws, which may allow our board of directors to take additional actions to prevent an unsolicited takeover and inhibit the ability of an acquirer to amend the amended and restated bylaws to facilitate an unsolicited takeover attempt; and\n\u2022advance notice procedures with which stockholders must comply to nominate candidates to our board of directors or to propose matters to be acted upon at a stockholders\u2019 meeting, which may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer\u2019s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of the Company.\nGeneral Risks\nWe incur significant accounting and administrative costs as a publicly traded corporation that impact our financial condition. As a publicly traded corporation, we incur certain costs to comply with regulatory requirements. If regulatory requirements were to become more stringent or if controls thought to be effective later fail, we may be forced to make additional expenditures, the amounts of which could be material. Some of our competitors are privately owned so their comparatively lower accounting and administrative costs can be a competitive disadvantage for us. Should our sales continue to decline or if we are unsuccessful at increasing prices to cover higher expenditures for internal controls and audits, ours costs associated with regulatory compliance will rise as a percentage of sales.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud. As a result, current and potential stockholders may not be confident in our financial reporting, which could adversely affect the price of our stock and harm our business. Pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we are required to include in our annual report on Form 10-K our assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting. Although we believe that we currently have adequate internal control procedures in place, we cannot be certain that our internal controls over financial reporting will remain effective. If we cannot adequately maintain the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting, we may be subject to liability and/or sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities, such as the SEC. Any such action could adversely affect our financial results and the market price of our common stock.\nWe could fail to satisfy the standards to maintain our listing on a stock exchange. We could fail to satisfy the standards for continued exchange listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market such as standards having to do with a minimum share price, the minimum number of public shareholders, a minimum amount of stockholders\u2019 equity or the aggregate market value of publicly held shares. As a result of each of the foregoing, we may be unable to maintain our listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market, which would negatively affect, among other things (i) our ability to raise capital on terms we deem advisable, or at all, and (ii) the liquidity of our common stock. Failure to obtain financing, or obtaining financing on unfavorable terms, could result in a decrease in our stock price, would have a material adverse effect on future operating prospects and could require us to significantly reduce operations. Any holder of our securities should regard them as a long-term investment and should be prepared to bear the economic risk of an investment in such securities for an indefinite period.",

    "item_6": "Item 6. Selected Financial Data\nNot applicable.",
    "item_7": "Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders\u2019 equity and cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the related notes attached thereto. All statements contained herein that are not historical facts, including, but not limited to, statements regarding anticipated future capital requirements, our future development plans, our ability to obtain debt, equity or other financing, and our ability to generate cash from operations, are based on current expectations. The discussion of results, causes and trends should not be construed to imply any conclusion that such results or trends will necessarily continue in the future. Because the closing of the acquisition of Oblong Industries occurred on October 1, 2019, the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019, included in this Report only reflect Oblong Industries\u2019 financial results for the fourth quarter of 2019.\nBusiness\nOblong, Inc. (\u201cOblong\u201d or \u201cwe\u201d or \u201cus\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) was formed as a Delaware corporation in May 2000 and prior to March 6, 2020, was named Glowpoint, Inc. (\u201cGlowpoint\u201d). On October 1, 2019, the Company closed an acquisition of all of the outstanding equity interests of Oblong Industries, Inc., a privately held Delaware corporation founded in 2006 (\u201cOblong Industries\u201d), pursuant to the terms of an Agreement and Plan of Merger (as amended, the \u201cMerger Agreement\u201d). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, among other things, Oblong Industries became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (the \u201cMerger\u201d). See further discussion of the Merger in Note 3 - Oblong Industries Acquisition to our consolidated financial statements attached hereto. On March 6, 2020, Glowpoint changed its name to Oblong, Inc. In this Report, we use the terms \u201cOblong\u201d or \u201cwe\u201d or \u201cus\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d to refer to (i) Oblong (formerly Glowpoint), for periods prior to the closing of the Merger and (ii) the \u201ccombined organization\u201d of Oblong, Inc. (formerly Glowpoint) and Oblong Industries for periods after the closing of the Merger. For purposes of segment reporting, we refer to the Oblong (formerly Glowpoint) business as \u201cGlowpoint\u201d herein, and to the Oblong Industries business as \u201cOblong Industries\u201d herein.\nSince the closing of the Merger on October 1, 2019, we have been focused on the integration of the businesses of Oblong (formerly Glowpoint) and Oblong Industries into a combined organization. While our acquisition of Oblong Industries provides additional revenues to the combined organization, the cost to further develop and commercialize Oblong Industries\u2019 product offerings is expected to exceed its revenues for the foreseeable future. We believe there is a substantial market opportunity for Oblong Industries\u2019 product offerings and services, and we are in the process of transforming our offerings to meet the evolving needs of our customers. As part of the transformation of our business, we are evolving certain aspects of our model by designing and developing software to include subscription-based offerings. Historically, our technology products and services have been developed and consumed in conventional commercial real estate spaces such as conference rooms. As our core collaboration products evolve, we expect to add more contemporary software features along with expanded accessibility beyond commercial spaces through both hybrid and SaaS offerings. These initiatives will require significant investment in technology development and sales and marketing.\nWe have achieved certain revenue and cost synergies in connection with combining Oblong and Oblong Industries; we reduced the total of general and administrative, research and development and sales and marketing expenses 49% from $5,656,000 in the fourth quarter of 2019 to $2,899,000 in the fourth quarter of 2020. We believe additional capital will be required to fund operations and provide growth capital including investments in Oblong Industries\u2019 technology, product development and sales and marketing. We intend to invest sales and marketing resources to expand awareness of Oblong Industries\u2019 product offerings with the goal of increasing adoption and growing revenue.\nGlowpoint\u2019s business has experienced revenue declines in recent years which we expect to continue. We currently expect to continue operating the Glowpoint business as part of our combined organization, however, we plan to seek opportunities in the future to divest some or all of Glowpoint\u2019s business.\nResults of Operations\nYear Ended December 31, 2020 (\u201c2020\u201d) versus Year Ended December 31, 2019 (\u201c2019\u201d)\nSegment Reporting\nAs discussed above, on October 1, 2019, the Company acquired Oblong Industries, and Oblong Industries became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. Prior to the acquisition of Oblong Industries on October 1, 2019, the Company operated in one segment. Effective October 1, 2019, the former businesses of Glowpoint (now Oblong, Inc.) and Oblong Industries were\nmanaged separately during the fourth quarter of 2019 and the year ended December 31, 2020, and involved different products and services. Accordingly, the Company currently operates in two segments: (1) the Oblong (formerly Glowpoint) business which mainly consists of managed services for video collaboration and network and (2) the Oblong Industries business which consists of products and services for visual collaboration technologies.\nBecause the closing of the acquisition of Oblong Industries occurred on October 1, 2019, the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019 included in this Report only reflect Oblong Industries\u2019 financial results for the fourth quarter of 2019. Certain information concerning the Company\u2019s segments for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, is presented in the following table (in thousands):\nFor the Year Ended December 31, 2020\nOblong (formerly Glowpoint) Oblong Industries Corporate Total\nRevenue $ 6,227 $ 9,106 $ - $ 15,333\nCost of revenues 3,789 3,491 - 7,280\nGross profit $ 2,438 $ 5,615 $ - $ 8,053\nGross profit % 39.2 % 61.7 % - % 52.5 %\nAllocated operating expenses $ 1,479 $ 9,913 $ - $ 11,392\nUnallocated operating expenses - - 6,725 6,725\nTotal operating expenses $ 1,479 $ 9,913 $ 6,725 $ 18,117\nIncome (loss) from operations $ 959 $ (4,298) $ (6,725) $ (10,064)\nInterest and other income (expense), net (19) 2,765 - 2,746\nIncome (loss) before income taxes. $ 940 $ (1,533) $ (6,725) $ (7,318)\nIncome tax expense $ 50 $ 53 $ - $ 103\nNet income (loss) $ 890 $ (1,586) $ (6,725) $ (7,421)\nAs of December 31, 2020\nTotal assets $ 6,494 $ 22,649 $ - $ 29,143\nFor the Year Ended December 31, 2019\nOblong (formerly Glowpoint) Oblong Industries Corporate Total\nRevenue $ 9,660 $ 3,167 $ - $ 12,827\nCost of revenues 6,269 1,158 - 7,427\nGross profit $ 3,391 $ 2,009 $ - $ 5,400\nGross profit % 35.1 % 63.4 % - % 42.1 %\nAllocated operating expenses $ 6,835 $ 5,183 $ - $ 12,018\nUnallocated operating expenses - - 956 956\nTotal operating expenses $ 6,835 $ 5,183 $ 956 $ 12,974\nLoss from operations $ (3,444) $ (3,173) $ (956) $ (7,574)\nInterest and other expense, net - - (187) (187)\nLoss before income taxes $ (3,444) $ (3,173) $ (1,143) $ (7,761)\nIncome tax expense $ - $ - $ - $ -\nNet loss $ (3,444) $ (3,173) $ (1,143) $ (7,761)\nAs of December 31, 2019\nTotal assets $ 5,942 $ 28,967 $ - $ 34,909\nUnallocated operating expenses include costs, after the October 1, 2019 acquisition date, that are not specific to a particular segment but are general to the group; included are expenses incurred for administrative and accounting staff, general liability and other insurance, professional fees and other similar corporate expenses. Interest and other (income) expense, net, is also not allocated to the operating segments.\nAs shown in the table below, the combined organization\u2019s total revenue for calendar year 2019 on a pro forma basis (as if the acquisition of Oblong Industries had occurred on January 1, 2019), was $25.6 million.\nPro forma and unaudited (as if the acquisition of Oblong Industries had occurred on January 1, 2019)\nYear Ended December 31,\n($ in thousands)\nRevenue\nOblong (formerly Glowpoint) $ 9,660\nOblong Industries 15,926\nPro forma total revenue $ 25,586\nRevenue. Total revenue increased $2,506,000 (or 20%) in 2020 to $15,333,000 from $12,827,000 in 2019. The following table summarizes the changes in components of our revenue, and the significant changes in revenue are discussed in more detail below.\nYear Ended December 31,\n($ in thousands)\n2020 % of Revenue 2019 % of Revenue\nRevenue: Oblong (formerly Glowpoint)\nVideo collaboration services $ 2,413 15.7 % $ 5,566 43.4 %\nNetwork services 3,611 23.6 % 3,860 30.1 %\nProfessional and other services 203 1.3 % 234 1.8 %\nTotal Oblong (formerly Glowpoint) revenue $ 6,227 40.6 % $ 9,660 75.3 %\nRevenue: Oblong Industries\nVisual collaboration product offerings $ 6,873 44.8 % $ 2,180 17.0 %\nProfessional services 1,033 6.7 % $ 709 5.5 %\nLicensing 1,200 7.8 % $ 278 2.2 %\nTotal Oblong Industries revenue $ 9,106 59.4 % $ 3,167 24.7 %\nTotal consolidated revenue $ 15,333 100.0 % $ 12,827 100.0 %\nOblong (formerly Glowpoint)\n\u2022Revenue for managed services for video collaboration services decreased $3,153,000 (or 57%) to $2,413,000 in 2020, from $5,566,000 in 2019. This decrease is mainly attributable to lower revenue from existing customers (either from reductions in price or level of services) and loss of customers to competition.\n\u2022Revenue for network services decreased $249,000 (or 6%) to $3,611,000 in 2020 from $3,860,000 in 2019. This decrease is mainly attributable to net attrition of customers and lower demand for our services given the competitive environment and pressure on pricing that exists in the network services business.\n\u2022Revenue for professional and other services decreased $31,000 (or 13%) to $203,000 in 2020 from $234,000 in 2019. This decrease is mainly attributable to lower resale of video equipment.\nOblong Industries\n\u2022For Oblong Industries, the increase in revenue in each of the different components is primarily attributable to the acquisition of Oblong Industries on October 1, 2019. Oblong Industries revenue for 2020 includes a full year of revenue, compared to revenue for 2019, which only included three months. Oblong Industries revenue for 2020 decreased compared to pro forma 2019, shown above, primarily as a result of delayed fulfillment and order placements and cancellation of professional services, as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\u2022Revenue for visual collaboration product offerings increased $4,693,000 (or 215%) to $6,873,000 in 2020 from $2,180,000 in 2019.\n\u2022Revenue for professional services increased $324,000 (or 46%) to $1,033,000 in 2020 from $709,000 in 2019. Oblong Industries\u2019 professional service revenue was generated from a specialized group of personnel that delivered innovative architectural scale spatial computing solutions for customers implementing Executive Briefing Centers, Command Centers, Television studios and Virtual Wargaming environments. A former customer terminated our professional services effective April 30, 2020 due to COVID-19. Our professional services revenue for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was primarily attributable to this customer. We do not expect to generate revenue from professional services in 2021 and in the future.\n\u2022Revenue for licensing increased $922,000 (or 332%) to $1,200,000 in 2020 from $278,000 in 2019. A former customer terminated the licensing of our technology effective December, 31 2020. Our licensing revenue for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was primarily attributable to this customer. We do not expect to generate material revenue from licensing in 2021.\nCost of revenue (exclusive of depreciation and amortization). Cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, includes all internal and external costs related to the delivery of revenue. Cost of revenue also includes the cost for taxes which have been billed to customers.\nFor the Year Ended December 31,\n2020 2019\nCost of Revenue\nOblong (formerly Glowpoint) $ 3,789 $ 6,269\nOblong Industries $ 3,491 1,158\nTotal cost of revenue $ 7,280 $ 7,427\nCost of revenue decreased to $7,280,000 in 2020 from $7,427,000 in 2019. The $147,000 decrease in cost of revenue from 2019 to 2020 is mainly attributable to lower costs associated with the decrease in Oblong (formerly Glowpoint) revenue during the same period, partially offset by the increased costs related to the increase in revenue for Oblong Industries from 2019 to 2020. The Company\u2019s total gross profit, as a percentage of revenue, improved to 53% in 2020 as compared to 42% in 2019. For Oblong, gross profit, as a percentage of Oblong revenue, improved to 39% for 2020 from 35% for 2019. This improvement was due to reduced personnel costs as a percentage of revenue. For Oblong Industries, gross profit, as a percentage of revenue was 62% for of 2020 as compared to 63% for 2019.\nResearch and Development. Research and development expenses include internal and external costs related to developing features and enhancements to our existing services. Research and development expenses in 2020 and 2019 were $3,711,000 and $2,023,000, respectively. This increase is primarily attributable to a full year of research and development expenses for Oblong Industries in 2020, as compared to inclusion of only the fourth quarter for 2019.\nSales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses in 2020 and 2019 were $3,392,000 and $1,936,000, respectively. This increase is primarily attributable to a full year of sales and marketing expenses for Oblong Industries in 2020, as compared to inclusion of only the fourth quarter for 2019.\nGeneral and Administrative. General and administrative expenses include direct corporate expenses related to costs of personnel in the various corporate support categories, including executive, legal, finance and accounting, human resources and information technology. General and administrative expenses in 2020 and 2019 were $6,724,000 and $5,377,000, respectively. This increase is mainly attributable to an increase related to a full year of general and administrative expenses for Oblong Industries in 2020 as compared to inclusion of only the fourth quarter for 2019.\nImpairment Charges. Impairment charges in 2020 and 2019 were $1,150,000 and $2,317,000, respectively. The impairment charges for 2020 are primarily attributable to $541,000 on Oblong\u2019s goodwill, $465,000 on right-of-use assets related to Oblong Industries operating leases, and $144,000 on assets no longer used in the business. For 2019, the impairment charges are primarily attributable to $2,254,000 on goodwill and $63,000 on capitalized software no longer in service. Future declines of our revenue, cash flows and/or stock price may give rise to a triggering event that may require the Company to record impairment charges in the future related to our goodwill, intangible assets and other long-lived assets.\nDepreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization expenses in 2020 and 2019 were $3,140,000 and $1,321,000, respectively. This increase of $1,819,000 is mainly attributable to $2,878,000 of depreciation and amortization expense recorded in 2020 related to assets recorded in connection with the acquisition of Oblong Industries, compared to $754,000 of depreciation and amortization expense recorded in the fourth quarter of 2019, partially offset by a decrease of $305,000 in depreciation and amortization expense for Oblong as certain assets became fully depreciated in 2020.\nLoss from Operations. Loss from operations increased to $10,064,000 in 2020 from $7,574,000 in 2019. The increase in the Company\u2019s loss from operations is mainly attributable to an increase of $5,143,000 in operating expenses, partially offset by an increase of $2,653,000 in gross profit, as discussed further above.\nInterest and Other (Income) Expense, Net. Interest and other (income) expense in 2020 was income of $2,746,000, comprised of (i) a gain on extinguishment of debt of $3,117,000 related to the satisfaction of the SVB loan, partially offset by (ii) $352,000 of interest expense on the Company\u2019s debt obligations. Interest and other expense, net in 2019 was $187,000, comprised of (i) $97,000 of interest expense on the Company\u2019s debt obligations with Silicon Valley Bank (\u201cSVB\u201d) during the fourth quarter of 2019, and (ii) $90,000 of amortization of debt discount costs related to the SVB Loan Agreement.\nIncome Tax Expense. We did not record any income tax expense in 2020 and 2019 (see Note 17 - Income Taxes to our consolidated financial statements).\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had $5,277,000 (including restricted cash of $219,000) and $4,602,000 of cash, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we incurred net losses of $7,421,000 and $7,761,000, respectively, and net cash used in operating activities was $6,566,000 and $3,253,000, respectively.\nNet cash used in investing activities for 2020 was $31,000 and primarily related to purchases of property and equipment. Net cash provided by investing activities in 2019 was $2,149,000, and primarily related to cash acquired in the merger.\nNet cash provided by financing activities in 2020 was $7,272,000, primarily attributable to net proceeds of $7,371,000 from two private placements of common stock and $2,417,000 of proceeds from the PPP Loan, partially offset by the satisfaction payment of $2,500,000 on the SVB Loan. Net cash provided by financing activities for 2019 was $3,699,000, primarily attributable to net proceeds of $3,750,000 from a private placement of Series E Preferred Stock, partially offset by $51,000 used to purchase treasury stock.\nSVB Loan Agreement\nOn October 1, 2019, in connection with the Acquisition of Oblong Industries, the Company and Oblong Industries, as borrowers, and Silicon Valley Bank (\u201cSVB\u201d), as lender, executed an amendment to the SVB Loan Agreement. On October 24, 2019, GP Communications joined the SVB Loan Agreement as an additional co-borrower. The SVB Loan Agreement provided for a term loan facility of approximately $5,247,000, (the \u201cSVB Loan\u201d), all of which was outstanding at December 31, 2019. On June 26, 2020, the Company and SVB entered into a Default Waiver and First Amendment (the \u201cAmendment\u201d) to the SVB Loan Agreement. Under the Amendment, the Bank agreed to extend the interest-only payment period under the SVB Loan Agreement through September 30, 2020, after which equal monthly principal payments of $291,500 were payable over an eighteen month period from October 1, 2020 through March 1, 2022 (the \u201cMaturity Date\u201d) to fully repay the loan. The SVB Loan originally accrued interest at a rate equal to the Prime Rate (as defined in the SVB Loan Agreement) plus 200 basis points (for a total of 6.75% as of December 31, 2019). In connection with the Amendment, the interest rate under the SVB Loan was increased to the Prime Rate plus 425 basis points (for a total of 7.50% as of September 30, 2020).\nIn connection with its execution of the amended SVB Loan Agreement on October 1, 2019, the Company (i) agreed to pay SVB a fee of $100,000 on April 1, 2020 (the \u201cDeferral Fee\u201d) and (ii) issued a warrant to SVB that entitles SVB to purchase 72,394 shares of the Company\u2019s common stock at an exercise price of $0.01 per share (the \u201cSVB Warrant\u201d). Pursuant to the Amendment, the due date for the Deferral Fee was changed to the earlier of (i) the maturity of the loan, (ii) the repayment in full of all principal and interest owing under the Loan Agreement, and (iii) occurrence of an event of default under the Loan Agreement. The SVB Warrant has a ten (10) year term. The fair value of the SVB Warrant was recorded to additional paid-in capital and was determined to be $72,000 using the Black-Scholes model. The total obligations under the SVB Loan Agreement were $5,509,000, comprised of $5,247,000 for the SVB Loan, the Deferral Fee and the Maturity Fee of $262,000 that was assumed on October 1, 2019 as part of the Acquisition. The Deferral Fee, the fair value of the SVB Warrant, and $20 of debt issuance costs totaled $192 and was recorded as a discount to the debt. The remaining unamortized debt discount as of December 31, 2019 was $130,000. This debt discount was being amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the debt. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company amortized $81,000 of the debt discount, which is recorded in \u201cInterest and other expense, Net\u201d on our Consolidated Statements of Operations, and $49 of the discount was forgiven in the Satisfaction Agreement discussed below.\nOn October 22, 2020, the Company entered into an agreement (the \u201cSatisfaction Agreement\u201d) with SVB as lender, pursuant to which SVB agreed to accept a one-time cash payment of $2,500,000 (the \u201cSatisfaction Payment\u201d) in satisfaction of the Company\u2019s outstanding payment obligations under the SVB Loan Agreement, subject to certain terms and conditions. SVB also agreed to release the security interests and other liens previously granted to or held by SVB as security for the Company\u2019s obligations under the SVB Loan Agreement. The Company made the Satisfaction Payment on October 22, 2020. The remaining balance of $3,062,000, net of discount, as well as $55,000 of accrued interest was forgiven and recorded as a \u201cGain on Extinguishment of Debt\u201d on our Consolidated Statements of Operations. As of December 31, 2020, the Company has no outstanding obligations under the SVB Loan Agreement.\nFuture Capital Requirements and Going Concern\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had $5,277,000 of cash and restricted cash. As of December 31, 2020 and the filing of this Report, we had $2,417,000 of total obligations under the PPP Loan. The Company estimates that approximately $2,266,000 of the PPP Loan will be forgiven. However, this estimate is subject to change and there is no guarantee that the Company will receive any forgiveness for any fixed amount of any PPP Loan principal received by the Company. Our capital requirements in the future will continue to depend on numerous factors, including the timing and amount of revenue for the combined organization, customer renewal rates and the timing of collection of outstanding accounts receivable, in each case particularly as it relates to the combined organization\u2019s major customers, the expense to deliver services, expense for sales and marketing, expense for research and development, capital expenditures, and the amount of forgiveness of the PPP Loan, if any, and the debt service obligations under the PPP Loan. While our acquisition of Oblong Industries provides additional revenues to the Company, the cost to further develop and commercialize Oblong Industries\u2019 product offerings is expected to exceed its revenues for the foreseeable future. We expect to continue to invest in Oblong Industries\u2019 product development and sales and marketing expenses with the goal of growing the Company\u2019s revenue in the future. The Company believes that, based on the combined organization\u2019s current projection of revenue, expenses, capital expenditures, debt service obligations, and cash flows, it will not have sufficient resources to fund its operations for the next twelve months following the filing of this Report. We believe additional capital will be required to fund operations and provide growth capital including investments in technology, product development and sales and marketing. To access capital to fund operations or provide growth capital, we will need to raise capital in one or more debt and/or equity offerings. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in raising necessary capital or that any such offering will be on terms acceptable to the Company. If we are unable to raise additional capital that may be needed on terms acceptable to us, it could have a material adverse effect on the Company. The factors discussed above raise substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from these uncertainties.\nSee Note 16 - Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements for discussion regarding certain additional factors that could impact the Company\u2019s liquidity in the future.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accoutning Principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d). Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 - Business Description and Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements attached hereto. We believe the following critical accounting policies involve the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nOblong (formerly Glowpoint)\nRevenue billed in advance for video collaboration services is deferred until the revenue has been earned, which is when the related services have been performed. Other service revenue, including amounts passed through based on surcharges from our telecom carriers, related to the network services and collaboration services are recognized as service is provided. As the non-refundable, upfront installation and activation fees charged to our customers do not meet the criteria as a separate unit of accounting, they are deferred and recognized over the 12 to 24-month period estimated life of the customer relationship. Revenue related to professional services is recognized at the time the services are performed. Revenues derived from other sources are recognized when services are provided or events occur.\nOblong Industries\nThe Company accounts for revenue in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standard Codification Topic 606 \u201cRevenue from Contracts with Customers.\u201d Topic 606 requires entities to recognize revenue when control of promised goods or services is transferred to customers at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. The costs associated with obtaining a customer contract under Topic 606 are deferred on our consolidated balance sheet and amortized over the expected life of the customer.\nOblong Industries\u2019 core platform is g-speak\u2122, and Mezzanine\u2122 is its flagship product built on this platform. Mezzanine\u2122 offers advanced collaboration for conference room technology, which amplifies sales presentations, enhances group collaboration, and makes work sessions more productive. The Company offers g-speak development licenses to larger enterprise customers. The Company\u2019s products are systems that consist of hardware and software that function together to\ndeliver the system\u2019s essential functionality. The Company sells the systems as a complete package and does not sell the hardware and software separately. The Company also sells maintenance and support contracts and license agreements. The Company has determined that its systems and service contracts have value to a customer on a standalone basis; therefore, revenue from each item should be recognized separately. The Company establishes the relative selling price of each deliverable based on estimated selling price. The Company recognizes product revenue from its systems upon shipment, installation revenue upon completed installation and revenue from maintenance contracts and license agreements ratably over the applicable periods, ranging from 12 to 36 months. Professional service contracts are billed based on time and materials at the contract rate as the services are rendered.\nDeferred revenue as of December 31, 2020 totaled $1,723,000 as certain performance obligations were not satisfied as of this date. Deferred revenue as of December 31, 2019 totaled $1,901,000 as certain performance obligations were not satisfied as of this date. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded $999,000 of revenue that was included in deferred revenue as of December 31, 2019.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets, Goodwill and Intangible Assets\nThe Company assesses the impairment of long-lived assets used in operations, primarily fixed assets and purchased intangible assets subject to amortization when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets might not be recoverable. For purposes of evaluating the recoverability of fixed assets and amortizing intangible assets, the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are compared to the carrying amounts of those assets. If and when the carrying values of the assets exceed the undiscounted cash flows, then the related assets will be written down to fair value.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company recorded asset impairment charges on property and equipment of $144,000 and $63,000, respectively, which pertained primarily to assets no longer used in the business. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company disposed of fixed assets of $3,438,000, and the corresponding accumulated depreciation of $3,287,000, which resulted in a loss on disposal of $151,000. There were no impairments to purchased intangible assets for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded aggregate impairment charges of $465,000 on two right-of-use assets. See Note 16 - Commitments and Contingencies for further discussion. There were no impairments to right-of-use assets for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nGoodwill. Goodwill is not amortized but is subject to periodic testing for impairment in accordance with ASC Topic 350 \u201cIntangibles - Goodwill and Other - Testing Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets for Impairment\u201d (\u201cASC Topic 350\u201d). As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, goodwill was $7,367,000 and $7,908,000, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, all of the goodwill was recorded in connection with the October 1, 2019 acquisition of Oblong Industries.\nWe test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis on September 30 of each year or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change indicating that the fair value of the goodwill may be below its carrying amount. Prior to the acquisition of Oblong Industries on October 1, 2019, the Company operated as a single reporting unit and used its market capitalization to determine the fair value of the reporting unit as of each test date. In order to determine the market capitalization, the Company used the trailing 20-day volume weighted average price (\u201cVWAP\u201d) of its stock as of each period end.\nFor the Oblong (formerly Glowpoint) reporting unit, we recorded goodwill impairment charges of $541,000 and $2,254,000 in the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, as the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeded its fair value on the applicable test dates. These charges are recognized as \u201cImpairment Charges\u201d on our Consolidated Statements of Operations, and the Oblong segment no longer has any goodwill included in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2020.\nIn the event we experience future declines in our revenue, cash flows and/or stock price, this may give rise to a triggering event that may require the Company to record additional impairment charges on goodwill in the future.\nIntangible Assets. Intangible assets total $10,140,000 and $12,572,000 as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The Company assesses the impairment of purchased intangible assets subject to amortization when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets might not be recoverable. The determination of related estimated useful lives and whether or not these assets are impaired involves significant judgments, related primarily to the future profitability and/or future value of the assets. Changes in the Company\u2019s strategic plan and/or other-than-temporary changes in market conditions could significantly impact these judgments and could require adjustments to recorded asset balances. Long-lived assets are evaluated for impairment whenever an event or change in circumstances has occurred that could have a significant adverse effect on the\nfair value of long-lived assets. The Company performed evaluations of intangible assets as of each quarter end during 2019 and 2020 and determined that no impairment charges were required for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. Intangible assets with finite lives are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated economic lives of the assets, which range from five to twelve years in accordance with ASC Topic 350 \u201cIntangibles - Goodwill and Other - Testing Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets for Impairment.\u201d\nInflation\nManagement does not believe inflation had a significant effect on the consolidated financial statements for the periods presented.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee the sections titled \u201cSummary of Significant Accounting Policies-Recently adopted accounting pronouncements\u201d and \u201cRecent accounting pronouncements not yet adopted\u201d in Note 1 - Business Description and Significant Accounting Policies to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.",

    "item_9A": "Item 9A. Controls and Procedures\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures\nThe Company\u2019s management, with the participation of the Company\u2019s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of December 31, 2020. Based on such evaluation, the Company\u2019s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of December 31, 2020, the Company\u2019s disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC\u2019s rules and forms and are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company\u2019s management, including the Company\u2019s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThe Company\u2019s management, with the participation of the Company\u2019s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated changes in internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2020 and have concluded that no change has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting.\nManagement\u2019s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThe Company\u2019s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining an adequate system of internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Our internal control system was\ndesigned to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes, in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Because of inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with policies and procedures may deteriorate.\nThe Company\u2019s management, including the Company\u2019s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020 based on the 2013 framework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (\u201cCOSO\u201d). The COSO framework summarizes each of the components of a company\u2019s internal control system, including (i) the control environment, (ii) risk assessment, (iii) control activities, (iv) information and communication, and (v) monitoring. Based on this evaluation, the Company\u2019s management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2020.",

    "item_10": "Item 10. Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance\nBoard of Directors\nOur Board of Directors currently consists of three directors. The current Board members include two independent directors and our chief executive officer. The core responsibility of our Board of Directors is to exercise its business judgment to act in what it reasonably believes to be in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. Further, members of the Board fulfill their responsibilities consistent with their fiduciary duty to the stockholders, and in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. The primary responsibilities of the Board include:\n\u2022Oversight of management performance and assurance that stockholder interests are served;\n\u2022Oversight of the Company\u2019s business affairs and long-term strategy; and\n\u2022Monitoring adherence to the Company\u2019s standards and policies, including, among other things, policies governing internal controls over financial reporting.\nOur Board of Directors conducts its business through meetings of the Board and through activities of the standing committees, as further described below.

Board agendas include regularly scheduled executive sessions of the independent directors to meet without the presence of management. The Board has delegated various responsibilities and authority to different committees of the Board, as described below. Members of the Board have access to all of our members of management outside of Board meetings.\nOur Board of Directors met and/or acted by written consent eleven times during the year ended December 31, 2020.

Mr. Holst holds a degree in Business Administration from the University of Ottawa.\nIn considering Mr. Holst as a director of the Company, the Board reviewed his extensive knowledge and expertise in the communication services industry, and the leadership he has shown in his positions with prior companies.\nJames S. Lusk, Director. Mr. Lusk joined our Board of Directors in February 2007. Mr. Lusk is currently the Chief Financial Officer of Sutherland Global Services, a global provider of business process transformation and technology management services. Mr. Lusk joined Sutherland in July 2015. From 2007 until July 2015, Mr. Lusk was Executive Vice President of ABM Industries Incorporated (NYSE:ABM), a leading provider of facility solutions, and served as ABM\u2019s Chief Financial Officer from 2007 until April 2015.

He is a certified public accountant and was inducted into the AICPA Business and Industry Leadership Hall of Fame in 1999.\nIn considering Mr. Lusk as a director of the Company, the Board reviewed his extensive expertise and knowledge regarding finance and accounting matters, as well as compensation, risk assessment and corporate governance. Mr. Lusk qualifies as an \u201caudit committee financial expert\u201d under the applicable SEC rules and accordingly contributes to the Board of Directors his understanding of generally accepted accounting principles and his skills in auditing, as well as in analyzing and evaluating financial statements.\nDirector Independence\nOn February 12, 2021, the Company transferred the listing of our common stock from the NYSE American Stock Exchange (the \u201cNYSE American\u201d) to The Nasdaq Capital Market (\u201cNasdaq\u201d). Our Board of Directors has determined that each of our current directors, other than Mr. Holst, qualifies as \u201cindependent\u201d in accordance with the rules of the Nasdaq. Because Mr. Holst is an employee of the Company, he does not qualify as independent.\nThe Nasdaq independence definition includes a series of objective tests, such as that the director is neither an executive officer nor an employee of the Company and has not engaged in various types of business dealings with the Company. In addition, as further required by the Nasdaq rules, the Board has made a subjective determination as to each independent director that no relationship exists which, in the opinion of the Board, would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director. In making these determinations, the directors reviewed and discussed information provided by the directors and the Company with regard to each director\u2019s business and personal activities as they may relate to the Company and the Company\u2019s management, including each of the matters set forth under \u201cPart III, Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence.\u201d below.\nBoard Committees\nThe Board has an audit committee, a compensation committee and a nominating committee, and may form special committees as is required from time to time. Each of the committees regularly report on their activities and actions to the full Board. The charters for the audit committee, the compensation committee, and the nominating committee are available on the Company\u2019s website at www.oblong.com. The contents of our website are not incorporated by reference into this document for any purpose.\nAudit Committee\nThe audit committee currently consists of Mr. Lusk (chair) and Mr. Adelman. Our Board of Directors has determined that all members of the audit committee are \u201cindependent\u201d within the meaning of the listing standards of Nasdaq and the SEC rules governing audit committees and \u201cfinancially literate\u201d for purposes of applicable Nasdaq listing standards. In addition, our Board of Directors has determined that each of Messrs. Lusk and Adelman have the accounting and related financial management expertise to satisfy the requirements of an \u201caudit committee financial expert,\u201d as determined pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC. In order to comply with Nasdaq rules, the Company will need to add a third member to the audit committee within six months of our listing on the Nasdaq (or by August 12, 2021). The audit committee consults and meets with our independent registered public accounting firm, Chief Financial Officer and accounting personnel, reviews potential conflict of interest situations where appropriate, and reports and makes recommendations to the full Board of Directors regarding such matters. The audit committee met four times during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nCompensation Committee\nWe have, and will continue to have, a compensation committee of at least two members. Our compensation committee currently consists of Mr. Adelman (chair) and Mr. Lusk. Each member of the compensation committee meets the applicable independence requirements of the Nasdaq, including the additional independence test required for compensation committee members. In affirmatively determining the independence of the compensation committee members, we considered all factors specifically relevant to determining whether each of the directors has a relationship to the Company that is material to that director\u2019s ability to be independent from management in connection with the duties of a compensation committee member. The compensation committee met two times during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nThe compensation committee is responsible for establishing and administering our executive compensation policies. The role of the compensation committee is to (i) formulate, evaluate and approve compensation of the Company\u2019s directors, executive officers and key employees, (ii) oversee all compensation programs involving the use of the Company\u2019s stock and (iii) produce, if required under applicable securities laws, a report on executive compensation for inclusion in the Company\u2019s proxy statement for its annual meeting of stockholders. The duties and responsibilities of the compensation committee under its charter include:\n\u2022annually reviewing and making recommendations to the Board with respect to compensation of directors, executive officers and key employees of the Company;\n\u2022annually reviewing and approving corporate goals and objectives relevant to Chief Executive Officer compensation, evaluating the Chief Executive Officer\u2019s performance in light of those goals and objectives, and recommending to the Board the Chief Executive Officer\u2019s compensation levels based on this evaluation;\n\u2022reviewing competitive practices and trends to determine the adequacy of the executive compensation program;\n\u2022approving and overseeing compensation programs for executive officers involving the use of the Company\u2019s stock;\n\u2022approving and administering cash incentives for executives, including oversight of achievement of performance objectives, and funding for executive incentive plans;\n\u2022annually performing a self-evaluation on the performance of the compensation committee; and\n\u2022making regular reports to the Board concerning the activities of the compensation committee.\nWhen appropriate, the compensation committee may, in carrying out its responsibilities, form and delegate authority to subcommittees. The Chief Executive Officer plays a role in determining the compensation of our other executive officers by evaluating the performance of those executive officers. The Chief Executive Officer\u2019s evaluations are then reviewed by the compensation committee. This process leads to a recommendation for any changes in salary, bonus terms and equity awards, if any, based on performance, which recommendations are then reviewed and approved by the compensation committee.\nNominating Committee\nOur nominating committee currently consists of Mr. Adelman (chair) and Mr. Lusk. Each member of the nominating committee meets the independence requirements of the Nasdaq. The nominating committee is responsible for assessing the performance of our Board of Directors and making recommendations to our Board regarding nominees for the Board. The nominating committee met two times during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nThe nominating committee considers qualified candidates to serve as a member of our Board of Directors that are suggested by our stockholders. Nominees recommended by stockholders will be given appropriate consideration and evaluated in the same manner as other nominees. Stockholders can suggest qualified candidates for director by writing to our Corporate Secretary at 25587 Conifer Road, Suite 105-231, Conifer, CO 80433. Stockholder submissions that are received in accordance with our by-laws and that meet the criteria outlined in the nominating committee charter are forwarded to the members of the nominating committee for review. Stockholder submissions must include the following information:\n\u2022a statement that the writer is our stockholder and is proposing a candidate for our Board of Directors for consideration by the nominating committee;\n\u2022the name of and contact information for the candidate;\n\u2022a statement of the candidate\u2019s business and educational experience;\n\u2022information regarding each of the factors set forth in the nominating committee charter sufficient to enable the nominating committee to evaluate the candidate;\n\u2022a statement detailing any relationship between the candidate and any of our customers, suppliers or competitors;\n\u2022detailed information about any relationship or understanding between the proposing stockholder and the candidate; and\n\u2022a statement that the candidate is willing to be considered and willing to serve as our director if nominated and elected.\nIn considering potential new directors, the nominating committee will review individuals from various disciplines and backgrounds. Among the qualifications to be considered in the selection of candidates are broad experience in business, finance or administration; familiarity with national and international business matters; familiarity with our industry; and prominence and reputation. While there is no formal policy with regard to consideration of diversity in identifying director nominees, the nominating committee will consider diversity in business experience, professional expertise, gender and ethnic background, along with various other factors when evaluating director nominees. The nominating committee will also consider whether the individual has the time available to devote to the work of our Board of Directors and one or more of its committees.\nThe nominating committee will also review the activities and associations of each candidate to ensure that there is no legal impediment, conflict of interest or other consideration that might hinder or prevent service on our Board of Directors. In making its selection, the nominating committee will bear in mind that the foremost responsibility of a director of a corporation is to represent the interests of the stockholders as a whole. The nominating committee will periodically review and reassess the adequacy of its charter and propose any changes to the Board of Directors for approval.\nContacting the Board of Directors\nAny stockholder who desires to contact our Board of Directors, committees of the Board of Directors and individual directors may do so by writing to: Oblong, Inc., 25587 Conifer Road, Suite 105-231, Conifer, CO 80433, Attention: David Clark, Corporate Secretary. Mr. Clark will direct such communication to the appropriate persons.\nBoard Leadership Structure and Role in Risk Oversight\nMr. Holst has served as the Company\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer since January 2013 and has served as the Chairman of the Company\u2019s Board of Directors since July 2019. Mr. Patrick Lombardi served as the Chairman of the Company\u2019s Board of Directors from April 2014 until July 2019.\nThe Board believes the combined role of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer promotes unified leadership and direction for the Company, which allows for a single, clear focus for management to execute the Company's strategy and business plans. As Chief Executive Officer, the Chairman is best suited to ensure that critical business issues are brought before the Board, which enhances the Board\u2019s ability to develop and implement business strategies.\nTo ensure a strong and independent Board, as discussed herein, the Board has affirmatively determined that all directors of the Company, other than Mr. Holst, are independent within the meaning of the Nasdaq listing standards currently in effect. Our Corporate Governance Guidelines provide that non-management directors shall meet in regular executive session without management present, and that Mr. Lusk, who serves as our lead independent director, shall act as the Chairman of such meetings. Additionally, Mr. Lusk actively participates in establishing and setting Board meeting agendas.\nThe Board has an active role, directly and through its committees, in the oversight of the Company\u2019s risk management efforts. The Board carries out this oversight role through several levels of review. The Board regularly reviews and discusses with members of management information regarding the management of risks inherent in the operation of the Company\u2019s business and the implementation of the Company\u2019s strategic plan, including the Company\u2019s risk mitigation efforts.\nEach of the Board\u2019s committees also oversees the management of the Company\u2019s risks that are under each committee\u2019s areas of responsibility. For example, the audit committee oversees management of accounting, auditing, external reporting, internal controls and cash investment risks. The nominating committee oversees and assesses the performance of the Board and makes recommendations to the Board from time to time regarding nominees for the Board. The compensation committee oversees risks arising from compensation practices and policies. While each committee has specific responsibilities for oversight of risk, the Board is regularly informed by each committee about such risks. In this manner the Board is able to coordinate its risk oversight.\nWe have adopted a code of conduct and ethics, as amended effective October 12, 2015, that applies to all of our employees, directors and officers, including our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and our finance team.

    "item_14": "Item 14. Principal Accounting Fees and Services\nThe audit committee, composed entirely of independent, non-employee members of the Board of Directors, appointed the firm of EisnerAmper LLP (\u201cEisnerAmper\u201d) as the independent registered public accounting firm for the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries for the fiscal years ending December 31, 2020 and 2019. As our independent registered public accounting firm, EisnerAmper audited our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2020, reviewed the related interim quarters, and performed audit-related services and consultation in connection with various accounting and financial reporting matters. EisnerAmper may also perform certain non-audit services for our Company. The audit committee has determined that the provision of the services provided by EisnerAmper as set forth herein are compatible with maintaining EisnerAmper\u2019s independence and the prohibitions on performing non-audit services set forth in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and relevant SEC rules.\nAudit Fees\nEisnerAmper, our principal accountant, billed us approximately $275,000 for professional services for the audit of our annual consolidated financial statements for the 2020 fiscal year and the reviews of the consolidated financial statements included in our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for the 2020 fiscal year. EisnerAmper billed us $344,480 for professional services for the audit of our annual consolidated financial statements for the 2019 fiscal year and the reviews of the consolidated financial statements included in our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for the 2019 fiscal year.\nAudit-Related Fees\nEisnerAmper did not bill us in the 2020 and 2019 fiscal years for any audit-related fees.\nTax Fees\nEisnerAmper did not bill us in the 2020 and 2019 fiscal years for any professional services rendered for tax compliance, tax advice or tax planning.\nAll Other Fees\nEisnerAmper billed us $9,000 in the 2020 fiscal year for products and services other than the audit and audit-related fees described above. There was no other products or services billed for in the 2019 fiscal year.\nAudit Committee Pre-Approval Policy\nThe audit committee is required to pre-approve the engagement of EisnerAmper to perform audit and other services for the Company. Our procedures for the pre-approval by the audit committee of all services provided by EisnerAmper comply with SEC regulations regarding pre-approval of services. Services subject to these SEC requirements include audit services, audit-related services, tax services and other services. The audit engagement is specifically approved, and the auditors are retained by the audit committee. The audit committee also has adopted policies and procedures for pre-approving all non-audit work performed by EisnerAmper. In accordance with audit committee policy and the requirements of law, all services provided by EisnerAmper in the 2020 and 2019 fiscal years were pre-approved by the audit committee and all services to be provided by EisnerAmper will be pre-approved. Pre-approval includes audit services, audit-related services, tax services and other services. To avoid certain potential conflicts of interest, the law prohibits a publicly traded company from obtaining certain non-audit services from its auditing firm. We obtain these services from other service providers as needed.\nPART IV",

(the \u201cCompany\") as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders\u2019 equity, and cash flows for each of the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the \u201cfinancial statements\u201d). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nGoing Concern\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company has incurred losses and expects to continue to incur losses. These conditions raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management\u2019s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 2. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company\u2019s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (\"PCAOB\") and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nGoodwill Impairment Assessment\nThe Company performs goodwill impairment testing on an annual basis on September 30 or when events occur or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying value exceeds the fair value. For reporting units evaluated using a quantitative assessment, the fair values are determined using a weighting of an income approach and a market approach. An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of a reporting unit\u2019s net assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit. These estimates are subject to significant management judgment, including the determination of many factors such as, but not limited to, sales growth rates and discount rates developed using market observable inputs and considering risk regarding future performance. Changes in these estimates can have a significant impact on the determination of cash flows and fair value and could potentially result in future material impairments. During the first quarter of 2020, the Company determined that interim triggering events, including the economic downturn caused by COVID-19 and the resulting declines in\n-F-1-\ncertain of the Company\u2019s revenue, required an interim evaluation of goodwill at March 31, 2020. The impairment test determined the carrying value of goodwill in the Oblong (formerly Glowpoint) reporting unit exceeded its estimated fair value. As a result, the Company impaired the full carrying value of this reporting unit\u2019s goodwill through an impairment charge of $541,000.\nWe identified goodwill impairment assessment as a critical audit matter because of the significant management judgment and subjectivity in developing the fair value measurement of the reporting units. This required a high degree of auditor judgement and an increase in audit effort to perform procedures and evaluate audit evidence related to the revenue growth rates, estimated costs, and the discount rate assumptions utilized in the income approach.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included, among others, (i) obtaining an understanding of management\u2019s process and evaluating the design of controls related to the goodwill impairment assessment; (ii) testing management\u2019s process for developing the fair value estimate; (iii) evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation model used in management\u2019s estimate; (iv) testing the completeness, accuracy, and relevance of underlying data used in the model; and (v) evaluating the reasonableness of the revenue growth rates and assumptions used by management. Evaluating management\u2019s assumptions related to the revenue growth rates, estimated costs and the discount rate involved evaluating whether the assumptions used by management were reasonable considering (i) the current and past performance of the reporting unit, (ii) the consistency with external market and industry data, (iii) whether these assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit, and (iv) performed sensitivity analyses over significant estimates and assumptions. We involved valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge when performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of Management\u2019s estimates and assumptions related to the selection of sales growth rates and discount rates.\nIntangible Asset Impairment Assessment\nIntangible assets are comprised of developed technology, trade names, and distributor relationships in the Oblong Industries reporting segment. The Company assesses the impairment of intangible assets subject to amortization when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets might not be recoverable. Estimates and assumptions are utilized in the valuations, including projected cash flows, revenue growth rates, and the estimated useful lives of the assets. These estimates are subject to significant management judgment. Changes in these estimates can have a significant impact on the determination of cash flows and could potentially result in future material impairments. The Company did not record any impairments on these intangible assets in 2020.\nWe identified the intangible asset impairment assessment as a critical audit matter because of the significant management judgment and subjectivity in developing the undiscounted cash flows utilized in the impairment assessment. This required a high degree of auditor judgement and significant audit effort to perform procedures and evaluate audit evidence related to the projected cash flows including revenue growth rates.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included, among others, (i) obtaining an understanding of management\u2019s process and evaluating the design of controls related to the intangible asset impairment assessment; (ii) testing management\u2019s process for developing the undiscounted cash flow estimate; (iii) testing the completeness, accuracy, and relevance of underlying data used in the model; and (iv) evaluating the reasonableness of the revenue growth rates and assumptions used by management, including the estimated useful lives of the intangible assets.

We involved valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge when performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of Management\u2019s estimates and assumptions related to the selection of sales growth rates and the estimated useful lives of the assets.\n/s/ EisnerAmper LLP\nWe have served as the Company\u2019s auditor since 2010.\nEISNERAMPER LLP\nIselin, New Jersey\nMarch

Policies\nBusiness Description\nOblong, Inc. (\u201cOblong\u201d or \u201cwe\u201d or \u201cus\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) was formed as a Delaware corporation in May 2000 and is a provider of patented multi-stream collaboration technologies and managed services for video collaboration and network applications. Prior to March 6, 2020, Oblong, Inc. was named Glowpoint, Inc. (\u201cGlowpoint\u201d). On March 6, 2020, Glowpoint changed its name to Oblong, Inc.\nOn October 1, 2019, the Company closed an acquisition of all of the outstanding equity interest of Oblong Industries, Inc., a privately held Delaware corporation founded in 2006 (\u201cOblong Industries\u201d); see further discussion in Note 3 - Oblong Industries Acquisition.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Oblong and our 100%-owned subsidiaries (i) GP Communications, LLC (\u201cGP Communications\u201d), whose business function is to provide interstate telecommunications services for regulatory purposes, (ii) Oblong Industries, Inc., and (iii) the following subsidiaries of Oblong Industries: Oblong Industries Europe, S.L. and Oblong Europe Limited. All inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The U.S. Dollar is the functional currency for all subsidiaries.\nSegments\nPrior to the acquisition of Oblong Industries on October 1, 2019, the Company operated in one segment. Effective October 1, 2019, the former businesses of Glowpoint, Inc. (now Oblong, Inc.) and Oblong Industries were managed separately and involve different products and services. Accordingly, the Company currently operates in two segments: 1) the Oblong, Inc. (formerly Glowpoint) business which mainly consists of managed services for video collaboration and network and 2) the Oblong Industries business which consists of products and services for visual collaboration technologies. See Note 15 - Segment Reporting for further discussion.\nUse of Estimates\nPreparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual amounts could differ from the estimates made. We continually evaluate estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements for reasonableness. Appropriate adjustments, if any, to the estimates used are made prospectively based upon such periodic evaluation. The significant areas of estimation include determining the allowance for doubtful accounts, the estimated lives and recoverability of property and equipment, and intangible assets, the inputs used in the valuation of goodwill and intangible assets in connection with our impairment tests, the inputs used in the fair value of equity based awards as well as the values ascribed to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the business combination.\nRestricted Cash\nAs of December 31, 2020, our total cash balance was $5,277,000, consisting of available cash of $5,058,000, current restricted cash of $158,000, and $61,000 in long-term restricted cash. The long-term restricted cash is included in our other assets on our consolidated balance sheet. The restricted cash pertains to two letters of credit that serve as the security deposit for our leased office space in Munich, Germany and our leased office space in Los Altos, California (as discussed in Note 16 - Commitments and Contingencies), and is secured by an equal amount of cash pledged as collateral, and such cash is held in a restricted bank account. As of February 28, 2021, the lease and the letter of credit ($158,000) for the Los Altos office space expired.\n-F-8-\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nWe perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers. We record an allowance for doubtful accounts based on specifically identified amounts that are believed to be uncollectible. We also record additional allowances based on our aged receivables, which are determined based on historical experience and an assessment of the general financial conditions affecting our customer base. If our actual collections experience changes, revisions to our allowance may be required. After all attempts to collect a receivable have failed, the receivable is written off against the allowance. We do not obtain collateral from our customers to secure accounts receivable. The allowance for doubtful accounts was $182,000 and $19,000 at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nInventory\nInventory consists of finished goods and was determined using average costs and was stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The Company periodically performs analyses to identify obsolete or slow-moving inventory, and as of December 31, 2020, the Company has recorded an reserve for obsolescence of $193,000. There was no corresponding reserve for 2019.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe Company considers its cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and debt obligations to meet the definition of financial instruments. The carrying amount of cash, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximated their fair value due to the short maturities of these instruments. The carrying amounts of our debt obligations (see Note 10 - Debt) approximate their fair values, which are based on borrowing rates that are available to the Company for loans with similar terms, collateral, and maturity.\nThe Company measures fair value as required by Accounting Standards Codification (\u201cASC\u201d) Topic 820\u201cFair Value Measurements and Disclosures\u201d (\u201cASC Topic 820\u201d). ASC Topic 820 defines fair value, establishes a framework and gives guidance regarding the methods used for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. ASC Topic 820 clarifies that fair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. As a basis for considering such assumptions, there exists a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:\n\u2022Level 1 - unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access as of the measurement date.\n\u2022Level 2 - inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are directly observable for the asset or liability or indirectly observable through corroboration with observable market data.\n\u2022Level 3 - unobservable inputs for the asset or liability only used when there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability at the measurement date.\nThis hierarchy requires the Company to use observable market data, when available, and to minimize the use of unobservable inputs when determining fair value.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company accounts for revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (\u201cASC\u201d) Topic 606.\nThe Company recognizes revenue using the five-step model as prescribed by Topic 606:\n\u2022Identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer;\n\u2022Identification of the distinct performance obligations in the contract;\n\u2022Determination of the transaction price;\n\u2022Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and\n-F-9-\n\u2022Recognition of revenue when or as the Company satisfies a performance obligation.\nOblong\u2019s (formerly Glowpoint) managed videoconferencing services are offered to our customers on either a usage basis or on a subscription. Our network services are offered to our customers on a subscription basis. Revenue for these services is generally recognized on a monthly basis as services are performed. Revenue related to professional services is recognized at the time the services are performed. The costs associated with obtaining a customer contract were previously expensed in the period they were incurred. Under Topic 606, these payments are deferred on our consolidated balance sheet and amortized over the expected life of the customer contract. Deferred revenue as of December 31, 2020 totaled $27,000 as certain performance obligations were not satisfied as of this date. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded $21,000 of revenue that was included in deferred revenue as of December 31, 2019. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recorded $32,000 of revenue that was included in deferred revenue as of December 31, 2018.\nOblong Industries\u2019 visual collaboration products are composed of hardware and embedded software sold as a complete package, and generally include installation and maintenance services. Revenue for hardware and software is recognized upon shipment to the customer. Installation revenue is recognized upon completion of installation, which also triggers the beginning of recognition of revenue for maintenance services which range from one to three years. Revenue is recognized over time for maintenance services. Professional services are contracts with specific customers for software development, visual design, interaction design, engineering, and project support. These contracts vary in length, and revenue is recognized over time as services are rendered. Licensing agreements are for the Company\u2019s core technology platform, g-speak, and are generally one year in length. Revenue for these services is recognized ratably over the service period. Upon adoption of Topic 606, Oblong Industries was not required to adjust its revenue recognition methodology, as recognition was deemed to be in-line with the five-step model. Deferred revenue as of December 31, 2020 totaled $1,696,000 as certain performance obligations were not satisfied as of this date. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded $978,000 of revenue that was included in deferred revenue as of December 31, 2019. During the three months ended December 31, 2019, the Company recorded $352,000 of revenue that was included in deferred revenue as of the date of the merger.\nThe Company disaggregates its revenue by geographic region. See Note 15 - Segment Reporting for more information.\nTaxes Billed to Customers and Remitted to Taxing Authorities\nWe recognize taxes billed to customers in revenue and taxes remitted to taxing authorities in our cost of revenue. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we included taxes of $313,000 and $390,000, respectively, in revenue and we included taxes of $328,000 and $390,000, respectively, in cost of revenue.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets, Goodwill and Intangible Assets\nThe Company assesses the impairment of long-lived assets used in operations, primarily fixed assets and purchased intangible assets subject to amortization when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets might not be recoverable. For purposes of evaluating the recoverability of fixed assets and amortizing intangible assets, the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are compared to the carrying amounts of those assets. If and when the carrying values of the assets exceed the undiscounted cash flow, then the related assets will be written down to fair value.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company recorded asset impairment charges on property and equipment of $144,000 and $63,000, which pertained primarily to assets no longer used in the business. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company disposed of fixed assets of $3,438,000, and the corresponding accumulated depreciation of $3,287,000, which resulted in a loss on disposal of $151,000. There were no impairments to purchased intangible assets for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded aggregate impairment charges of $465,000 on two right-of-use assets. See Note 16 - Commitments and Contingencies for further discussion. There were no impairments to right-of-use assets for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nGoodwill is not amortized but is subject to periodic testing for impairment in accordance with ASC Topic 350 \u201cIntangibles - Goodwill and Other - Testing Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets for Impairment\u201d (\u201cASC Topic 350\u201d). During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company recorded impairment charges on goodwill of $541,000 and $2,254,000, respectively. See Note 7 - Goodwill and Note 8 - Intangible Assets) for further discussion.\n-F-10-\nConcentration of Credit Risk\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject us to significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash, and trade accounts receivable. We place our cash primarily in commercial checking accounts. Commercial bank balances may from time to time exceed federal insurance limits.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost and are depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the related assets, which range from three to ten years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of either the asset\u2019s useful life or the related lease term. Depreciation is computed on the straight-line method for financial reporting purposes.\nIncome Taxes\nWe use the asset and liability method to determine our income tax expense or benefit. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are computed based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates that are expected to be in effect when the differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Any resulting net deferred tax assets are evaluated for recoverability and, accordingly, a valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.\nStock-based Compensation\nStock-based awards have been accounted for as required by ASC Topic 718 \u201cCompensation - Stock Compensation\u201d (\u201cASC Topic 718\u201d). Under ASC Topic 718 stock-based awards are valued at fair value on the date of grant, and that fair value is recognized over the requisite service period. The Company accounts for forfeitures when they occur.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses include internal and external costs related to developing new service offerings and features and enhancements to our existing services.\nTreasury Stock\nPurchases and sales of treasury stock are accounted for using the cost method. Under this method, shares acquired are recorded at the acquisition price directly to the treasury stock account. Upon sale, the treasury stock account is reduced by the original acquisition price of the shares and any difference is recorded in additional paid in capital, on a first-in first-out basis. The Company does not recognize a gain or loss to income from the purchase and sale of treasury stock.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nCredit Losses\nIn June 2016 the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, \u201cFinancial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326),\u201d which was subsequently amended in February 2020 by ASU 2020-02, \u201cFinancial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326) and Leases (Topic 842).\u201d The amendments introduce an impairment model that is based on expected credit losses, rather than incurred losses, to estimate credit losses on certain types of financial instruments (e.g., loans and held-to-maturity securities), including certain off-balance sheet financial instruments (e.g., loan commitments). The expected credit losses should consider historical information, current information, and reasonable and supportable forecasts, including estimates of prepayments, over the contractual term. Financial instruments with similar risk characteristics may be grouped together when estimating expected credit losses. The update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the new guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements.\n-F-11-\nNote 2 - Liquidity and Going Concern\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had $5,277,000 of cash and $2,417,000 of total obligations under the MidFirst Bank Loan (the \u201cPPP Loan\u201d) under the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) contained within the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act (see Note 10 - Debt). Our capital requirements in the future will continue to depend on numerous factors, including the timing and amount of revenue for the combined organization, customer renewal rates and the timing of collection of outstanding accounts receivable, in each case particularly as it relates to the combined organization\u2019s major customers, the expense to deliver services, expense for sales and marketing, expense for research and development, capital expenditures, the cost involved in protecting intellectual property rights, the amount of forgiveness of the PPP Loan, if any, and the debt service obligations under the PPP Loan. While our acquisition of Oblong Industries provides additional revenues to the Company, the cost to further develop and commercialize Oblong Industries\u2019 product offerings is expected to exceed its revenues for the foreseeable future. We expect to continue to invest in product development and sales and marketing expenses with the goal of growing the Company\u2019s revenue in the future. The Company believes that, based on the combined organization\u2019s current projection of revenue, expenses, capital expenditures, debt service obligations, and cash flows, it will not have sufficient resources to fund its operations for the next twelve months following the filing of this Report. We believe additional capital will be required to fund operations and provide growth capital including investments in technology, product development and sales and marketing. To access capital to fund operations or provide growth capital, we will need to raise capital in one or more debt and/or equity offerings. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in raising necessary capital or that any such offering will be on terms acceptable to the Company. If we are unable to raise additional capital that may be needed on terms acceptable to us, it could have a material adverse effect on the Company. The factors discussed above raise substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from these uncertainties.\nNote 3 - Oblong Industries Acquisition\nOn October 1, 2019, the Company closed its acquisition of Oblong Industries, Inc., a Delaware corporation (\u201cOblong Industries\u201d and, such transaction, the \u201cAcquisition\u201d). The Acquisition was consummated through the merger of Glowpoint Merger Sub II, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (the \u201cMerger Sub\u201d), with and into Oblong Industries on the Closing Date, with Oblong Industries continuing as the surviving corporation and as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. On the Closing Date, (i) the shares of common and preferred stock of Oblong Industries issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Acquisition were converted into an aggregate of 1,686,659 shares of the Company\u2019s 6.0% Series D Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the \u201cSeries D Preferred Stock\u201d); (ii) all options to purchase shares of Oblong\u2019s common stock held by previously terminated employees of Oblong Industries were assumed by the Company and deemed, in the aggregate, to constitute options to acquire a total of 107,845 shares of the Company\u2019s common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (\u201ccommon stock\u201d), at a volume weighted average exercise price of $4.92 per share and a remaining exercise period of one year; and (iii) all options to purchase shares of Oblong Industries\u2019 common stock held by existing employees of Oblong were canceled and exchanged for an aggregate of 49,967 restricted shares of Series D Preferred Stock (\u201cRestricted Series D Preferred Stock\u201d), which are subject to vesting over a two-year period following the Closing Date.\nEach share of Series D Preferred Stock is automatically convertible into a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the accrued value of the share (initially $28.50), plus any accrued dividends thereon, divided by the Conversion Price (initially $2.85 per share, subject to specified adjustments) upon the completion of both i) approval of such conversion by the Company\u2019s stockholders (which occurred on December 19, 2019) and (ii) the receipt of all required authorizations and approval of a new listing application for the combined organization from the NYSE American. Upon such conversion, the Series D Preferred Stock (including shares of Restricted Series D Preferred Stock) will convert into an aggregate of 17,349,010 shares of common stock. Following their conversion to common stock, shares of Restricted Series D Preferred Stock will remain subject to their vesting conditions. Subsequent to the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the company transferred the listing of its common stock from the NYSE American to the Nasdaq Capital Market. Upon this transfer, all of the Series D Preferred Stock, including the Restricted Series D Stock, was converted into shares of the Company\u2019s common stock. Please refer to Note 20 - Subsequent Events for further discussion of the transfer and the conversion.\nThe Acquisition was accounted for in accordance with FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic 805 \u201cBusiness Combinations\u201d (\u201cASC 805\u201d) as a business combination, which requires an allocation of the purchase price of an acquired entity to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. The purchase price and the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were based on management estimates and values with assistance\n-F-12-\nfrom an outside appraisal. Pursuant to ASC 805, the purchase price of $18,862,000 was measured as the fair value of the consideration exchanged in the Acquisition as follows:\nSeries D Preferred Stock (1,686,659 shares at $11.15 per share)\n$ 18,811,000\nValue of common stock options issued (107,845 at $0.47 per option)\n$ 51,000\nTotal purchase price $ 18,862,000\nThe value per share of the Series D Preferred Stock was determined using an equity allocation method using the Company\u2019s publicly traded common stock as the basis, with use of an option pricing model for determination of the value per share of the Series D Preferred Stock in the event conversion to common stock does not occur. On October 1, 2019, the closing sale price of our common stock was $1.00 per share as reported on the NYSE American. The value of the 107,845 common stock options was determined using the Black-Scholes method, with the following weighted-average assumptions: (i) exercise price of $4.92, (ii) risk-free interest rate of 1.5%, (iii) expected volatility of 217% and (iv) expected term of one year. The value of the Restricted Series D Preferred Stock was not included in the purchase price given the vesting requirements post combination. Therefore, the Company recorded stock-based compensation expense in the post combination period over the vesting period of these awards.\nBased on the purchase price allocation, the following table summarizes the estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the Closing Date (in thousands):\nCash $ 2,194\nAccounts receivable 1,962\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets 719\nInventory 1,835\nProperty and equipment 1,221\nOperating lease, right-of-use assets 3,376\nTrade names 2,410\nDistributor relationships 310\nDeveloped technology 10,060\nOther assets 194\nTotal assets acquired at fair value $ 24,281\nAccounts payable $ (296)\nOperating lease liabilities (3,578)\nDeferred revenue (2,231)\nDebt (5,509)\nOther liabilities (1,171)\nTotal liabilities assumed $ (12,785)\nNet assets acquired $ 11,496\nThe purchase price exceeded the fair value of the net assets acquired by 7,367,000, which was recorded as goodwill.\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any revenues or expenses related to the Oblong Industries business on or prior to October 1, 2019 (the Closing Date of the Acquisition). A total of $468,000 of acquisition costs were expensed and included in General and Administrative expenses in the accompanying Statement of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nThe preliminary allocation of the purchase price was based upon a valuation for which the estimates and assumptions are subject to change within the measurement period (up to one year from the acquisition date). The final allocation price could differ materially from the preliminary allocation. Any subsequent changes to the purchase price allocation that result in material changes to the Company\u2019s consolidated financial results will be adjusted accordingly.\n-F-13-\nThe consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2019 includes $3,167,000 of revenue and net loss of $3,360,000 related to Oblong Industries for the period from October 1, 2019 through December 31, 2019. The Company's unaudited pro forma results for the year ended December 31, 2019 is summarized in the table below, assuming the Acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2019 (in thousands). These unaudited pro forma results have been prepared for comparative purposes only and do not purport to be indicative of the results of operations which would have actually resulted had the acquisition occurred on January 1, 2019, nor to be indicative of future results of operations. These pro forma results include pro forma adjustments of $1,393,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019 related to the incremental amortization of Oblong Industries\u2019 intangible assets recorded in connection with the Acquisition.\nPro forma and unaudited (as if the acquisition of Oblong Industries had occurred on January 1, 2019)\nYear Ended December 31, 2019\nRevenue\nOblong (formerly Glowpoint) $ 9,660\nOblong Industries 15,926\nTotal revenue $ 25,586\nNet loss\nOblong $ 4,401\nOblong Industries 15,795\nPro forma net loss $ 20,196\nNote 4 - Inventory\nInventory was $920,000 and $1,816,000 as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and consisted primarily of equipment related to our Mezzanine\u2122 product offerings, including cameras, tracking hardware, computer equipment, display equipment and amounts related to the Oblong Industries business. Inventory consists of finished goods and was determined using average costs and was stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value.\nThe Company periodically performs analyses to identify obsolete or slow-moving inventory. As of December 31, 2020, we had a reserve for obsolete or slow moving inventory of $193,000.\nNote 5 - Prepaid Expenses and Other Current Assets\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets consisted of the following (in thousands):\nDecember 31,\n2020 2019\nOther prepaid expenses $ 663 $ 548\nOther current assets 28 209\nPrepaid software licenses - 208\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets $ 691 $ 965\nNote 6 - Property and Equipment\nProperty and equipment consisted of the following (in thousands):\nDecember 31,\n2020 2019\nNetwork equipment and software $ 4,957 $ 6,251\nComputer equipment and software 5,686 $ 7,232\nLeasehold improvements 164 $ 953\nOffice furniture and equipment 752 $ 369\n11,559 14,805\nAccumulated depreciation and amortization (10,986) (13,489)\nProperty and equipment, net $ 573 $ 1,316\n-F-14-\nEstimated Useful Life\nNetwork equipment and software 3 to 5 Years\nComputer equipment and software 3 to 5 Years\nLeasehold improvements (*)\nOffice furniture and equipment 3 to 10 Years\n(*) - Amortized over the shorter period of the estimated useful life (five years) or the lease term.\nRelated depreciation and amortization expense for the consolidated entities was $708,000 and $614,000 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the Company recorded asset impairment charges on property and equipment of $144,000 and $63,000, which pertained primarily to assets no longer used in the business. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company transferred trade show assets valued at $78,000 (net of $38,000 depreciation) from inventory to fixed assets; disposed of fixed assets of $3,438,000, and the corresponding accumulated depreciation of $3,287,000, for proceeds of $7,000 resulting in a loss on disposal of $144,000.\nNote 7 - Goodwill\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, goodwill was $7,367,000 and $7,908,000, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, goodwill was comprised of $7,367,000 recorded in connection with the October 1, 2019 acquisition of Oblong Industries.\nWe test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis on September 30 of each year, or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change indicating that the fair value of the goodwill may be below its carrying amount. Following the Acquisition of Oblong Industries, the Company operated two reporting units, Oblong (formerly Glowpoint) and Oblong Industries. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we considered the novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and resulting declines in certain of the Company\u2019s revenue to be a triggering event for an interim goodwill impairment test for both reporting units as of March 31, 2020. To determine the fair value of each reporting unit for the goodwill impairment tests, we used a weighted average of the discounted cash flow method and a market-based method (comparing the Company\u2019s equity and analyzing multiples of revenue for comparable companies). For the Oblong Industries reporting unit, the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount, as of both testing dates, therefore no impairment charge was required for the year ended December 31, 2020. For the Oblong (formerly Glowpoint) reporting unit, we recorded an impairment charge on goodwill of $541,000 at March 31, 2020, as the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeded its fair value on the test date. This charge is recognized as \u201cImpairment Charges\u201d on our consolidated Statements of Operations, and reduced goodwill for the Oblong. reporting unit to zero.\nThe activity in goodwill during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 is shown in the following table ($ in thousands):\nGoodwill Oblong Oblong Industries Total\nBalance January 1, 2019 $ 2,795 $ - $ 2,795\nAcquisition - 7,367 7,367\nImpairment (2,254) - (2,254)\nBalance December 31, 2019 541 7,367 7,908\nImpairment (541) - (541)\nBalance December 31, 2020 $ - $ 7,367 $ 7,367\nIn the event we experience future declines in our revenue, cash flows and/or stock price, this may give rise to a triggering event that may require the Company to record additional impairment charges on goodwill in the future.\n-F-15-\nNote 8 - Intangible Assets\nThe following table presents the components of net intangible assets (in thousands):\nAs of December 31, 2020 As of December 31, 2019\nGross Carrying Amount Accumulated Amortization Net Carrying Amount Gross Carrying Amount Accumulated Amortization Net Carrying Amount\nOblong\nAffiliate network $ 994 $ (735) $ 259 $ 994 $ (666) $ 328\nTrademarks 548 (548) - 548 (504) 44\nSubtotal 1,542 (1,283) 259 1,542 (1,170) 372\nOblong Industries\nDeveloped technology 10,060 (2,520) 7,540 10,060 (504) 9,556\nTrade names 2,410 (302) 2,108 2,410 (60) 2,350\nDistributor relationships 310 (77) 233 310 (16) 294\nSubtotal 12,780 (2,899) 9,881 12,780 (580) 12,200\nTotal $ 14,322 $ (4,182) $ 10,140 $ 14,322 $ (1,750) $ 12,572\nAt each reporting period, we determine if there was a triggering event that may result in an impairment of our intangible assets. During the three months ended March 31, 2020, we considered the novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and resulting declines in certain of the Company\u2019s revenue to be a triggering event for an interim impairment test of intangible assets for both reporting units. During the year ended December 31, 2020, no impairment charges were required. Intangible assets with finite lives are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated economic lives of the assets, which range from five years to twelve years in accordance with ASC Topic 350. The weighted average lives for the components of intangible assets are as follows:\nOblong (formerly Glowpoint) Life\nAffiliate network 12 years\nTrademarks 8 years\nOblong Industries Life\nDeveloped technology 5 years\nTrade names 10 years\nDistributor relationships 5 years\nRelated amortization expense was $2,432,000 and $707,000 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Amortization expense for each of the next five succeeding years will be as follows (in thousands):\n2021 $ 2,386\n2022 2,386\n2023 2,386\n2024 1,850\n2025 241\nThereafter 891\nTotal $ 10,140\n-F-16-\nNote 9 - Accrued Expenses and Other Liabilities\nAccrued expenses and other liabilities consisted of the following (in thousands):\nDecember 31,\n2020 2019\nAccrued compensation costs $ 411 $ 810\nOther accrued expenses and liabilities 786 843\nAccrued dividends on Series A-2 Preferred Stock 4 99\nAccrued expenses and other liabilities $ 1,201 $ 1,752\nNote 10 - Debt\nDebt consisted of the following (in thousands):\nDecember 31,\n2020 2019\nSVB Loan Principal $ - $ 5,609\nPPP Loan Principal 2,417 -\nTotal Loan Principal 2,417 5,609\nLess: Unamortized SVB debt discount - (102)\nNet carrying value 2,417 5,507\nLess: SVB current maturities, net of debt discount - 2,664\nLess: PPP current maturities 2,014 -\nTotal current maturities, net of debt discount 2,014 2,664\nLong-term SVB obligations, net of current maturities and debt discount - 2,843\nLong-term PPP obligations, net of current maturities 403 -\nTotal long-term obligations, net of current maturities and debt discount $ 403 $ 2,843\nSilicon Valley Bank Loan Agreement and Warrant\nOn October 1, 2019, in connection with the Acquisition of Oblong Industries, the Company and Oblong Industries, as borrowers, and SVB, as lender, executed an amendment to the SVB Loan Agreement. The SVB Loan Agreement provided for a term loan facility of approximately $5,247,000, and a discount of $362,000, for a total liability of $5,609,000 (the \u201cSVB Loan\u201d), all of which was outstanding at December 31, 2019. The Loan had a maturity date of March 1, 2022 with monthly payments of $291,500 (plus accrued and unpaid interest) to begin on October 1, 2020. The SVB Loan accrued interest at a rate equal to the Prime Rate plus 425 basis points (for a total of 7.50% as of September 30, 2020).\nIn connection with its execution of the amended SVB Loan Agreement on October 1, 2019, the Company issued a warrant to SVB that entitles SVB to purchase 72,394 shares of the Company\u2019s common stock at an exercise price of $0.01 per share (the \u201cSVB Warrant\u201d). The SVB Warrant has a ten (10) year term. The fair value of the SVB Warrant was recorded to additional paid-in capital and was determined to be $72,000 using the Black-Scholes model. The debt discount associated with the SVB Loan was being amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the debt. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company amortized $83,000 of the debt discount, which is recorded in \u201cInterest and other expense, Net\u201d on our Consolidated Statements of Operations, and $47,000 of the discount was forgiven in the Satisfaction Agreement discussed below.\nOn October 22, 2020, the Company entered into an agreement (the \u201cSatisfaction Agreement\u201d) with certain of its subsidiaries, Oblong Industries, Inc. and GP Communications, LLC (the \u201cGuarantors\u201d), and SVB as lender, pursuant to which SVB agreed to accept a one-time cash payment of $2,500,000 (the \u201cSatisfaction Payment\u201d) in satisfaction of the Company\u2019s outstanding payment obligations under the SVB Loan Agreement, effective immediately, subject to certain terms and conditions. SVB also agreed to release the security interests and other liens previously granted to or held by SVB as security\n-F-17-\nfor the Company\u2019s obligations under the SVB Loan Agreement, as well as the Guarantors\u2019 guarantees thereof. The Company made the Satisfaction Payment on October 22, 2020. The remaining balance of $3,063,000, net of discount, as well as $54,000 of accrued interest was forgiven and recorded as a \u201cGain on Extinguishment of Debt\u201d on our Consolidated Statements of Operations. As of December 31, 2020, the Company has no outstanding obligations under the SVB Loan Agreement.\nPaycheck Protection Program Loan\nOn April 10, 2020 (the \u201cOrigination Date\u201d), the Company received $2,417,000 in aggregate loan proceeds (the \u201cPPP Loan\u201d) from MidFirst Bank (the \u201cLender\u201d) pursuant to the Paycheck Protection Program (\u201cPPP\u201d) under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act. The PPP Loan is evidenced by a Promissory Note (the \u201cNote\u201d), dated April 10, 2020, by and between the Company and the Lender. Subject to the terms of the Note, the PPP Loan bears interest at a fixed rate of one percent (1.0%) per annum. Under the terms of the Note, payments of principal and interest are deferred for six months from the origination date. Following the deferral period, the Company will be required to make payments of principal plus interest accrued under the PPP Loan to the Lender in 18 monthly installments based upon an amortization schedule to be determined by the Lender based on the principal balance of the Note outstanding following the deferral period and taking into consideration any portion of the PPP Loan that is forgiven prior to that time. The PPP Loan is unsecured and guaranteed by the U.S. Small Business Administration.\nThe Paycheck Protection Program provides for forgiveness of up to the full amount borrowed as long as the Company uses the loan proceeds during the 24-week period following disbursement for eligible purposes as described in the CARES Act and related guidance. Under the CARES Act, loan forgiveness is generally available for the sum of documented payroll costs, covered rent payments, covered mortgage interest and covered utilities during the 24-week period. The Company used the majority of the proceeds from the PPP Loan to pay expenses during the applicable period that the Company believes were for eligible purposes; certain reductions in Company payroll costs during this period may reduce the amount of the Note eligible for forgiveness. The Company expects to submit an application to the Lender for forgiveness of the PPP Loan in the second quarter of 2021. There is no guarantee that the Company will receive forgiveness for any fixed amount of any PPP Loan principal received by the Company.\nUnder the revised rules for the PPP Loan program, the Company will not have to begin principal and interest payments before the date on which the SBA remits the loan forgiveness amount to the Lender (or notifies the Lender that no loan forgiveness is allowed). Following the decision on forgiveness, the Company will be required to pay the Lender equal monthly payments of principal and interest based on the principal amount outstanding on the PPP Loan, plus interest outstanding at the end of the deferment period, and taking into account any reductions in the principal amount due to forgiveness, if any. Interest accrued during the deferment period will be capitalized as principal.\nThe Company has accounted for the PPP Loan in the same manner as it has for its other loan agreements. Payments that are due within 12 months of balance sheet dates are shown as current liabilities and payments due thereafter are shown as non-current liabilities. We expect our forgiveness application to be processed, and any applicable payments to begin in May 2021. If the Company\u2019s application for forgiveness is approved, the Company will recognize a gain on extinguishment of debt at the time of forgiveness.

The number of shares purchased under the Stock Repurchase Program and the timing of any purchases may be based on many factors, including the level of the Company\u2019s available cash, general business conditions, and the pricing of the Common Stock. The Stock Repurchase Program does not obligate the Company to acquire a specific number of shares and may be suspended, modified, or terminated at any time. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company did not repurchase any shares of Common Stock. All shares of Common Stock repurchased under the Stock Repurchase Program are recorded as treasury stock. The Stock Repurchase Program does not have an expiration date. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had $673,000 remaining under the Stock Repurchase Program.\nNote 12 - Preferred Stock\nOur Certificate of Incorporation authorizes the issuance of up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock. The following table shows our authorized, issued, and outstanding preferred stock as of December 31, 2020:\nAuthorized Issued and Outstanding\n5% Series A-2 Preferred\n7,500 45\n0% Series C Preferred\n1,750 -\n0% Series D Preferred\n4,000 -\n6% Series D Preferred\n1,750,000 1,697,958\n6% Series E Preferred\n175,000 131,579\n1,938,250 1,829,582\nSeries A-2 Preferred Stock\nEach share of Series A-2 Preferred Stock has a stated value of $7,500 per share (the \u201cA-2 Stated Value\u201d), a liquidation preference equal to the Series A-2 Stated Value, and is convertible at the holder\u2019s election into common stock at a conversion price per share of $16.11 as of December 31, 2020. Therefore, each share of Series A-2 Preferred Stock is convertible into 466 shares of common stock, for an aggregate of 20,950 shares of common stock, as of December 31, 2020. The conversion price is subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events set forth in our Certificate of Incorporation.\n-F-21-\nThe Series A-2 Preferred Stock is senior to all outstanding classes of the Company\u2019s equity, has weighted average anti-dilution protection and, effective January 1, 2013, entitled to cumulative dividends at a rate of 5.0% per annum, payable quarterly, based on the Series A-2 Stated Value and payable at the option of the holder in cash or through the issuance of a number of additional shares of Series A-2 Preferred Stock with an aggregate liquidation preference equal to the dividend amount payable on the applicable dividend payment date. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company has recorded $4,000 and $99,000, respectively, in accrued dividends on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets related to the Series A-2 Preferred Stock outstanding. During the year ended December 31, 2020, $17,000 in dividends were accrued, $13,000 in accrued dividends were paid, and $99,000 in accrued and unpaid dividends were exchanged for 13 additional shares of Series A-2 Preferred Stock. The Company, at its option, may redeem all or a portion of the Series A-2 Preferred Stock in cash at a price per share of $8,250 (equal to $7,500 per share multiplied by 110%) plus all accrued and unpaid dividends.\nIn accordance with ASC Topic 815, we evaluated whether our convertible preferred stock contains provisions that protect holders from declines in our stock price or otherwise could result in modification of the exercise price and/or shares to be issued under the respective preferred stock agreements based on a variable that is not an input to the fair value of a \u201cfixed-for-fixed\u201d option and require a derivative liability. The Company determined no derivative liability is required under ASC Topic 815 with respect to our convertible preferred stock. A contingent beneficial conversion amount is required to be calculated and recognized when and if the adjusted $16.11 conversion price of the Series A-2 Preferred Stock is adjusted to reflect a down round stock issuance that reduces the conversion price below the $11.16 fair value of the common stock on the issuance date of the Series A-2 Preferred Stock.\nOn January 28, 2021, all outstanding shares of the series A-2 Preferred Stock, and accrued dividends, were converted into shares of common stock. Refer to Note 20 - Subsequent Events, for further discussion of the conversion.\nSeries C Preferred Stock\nOn January 25, 2018, the Company closed a registered direct offering of 1,750 shares of its Series C Preferred Stock for total gross proceeds to the Company of $1,750,000.

During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, 475 and 50 shares of Series C Preferred Stock were converted to 158,333 and 16,667 shares of the Company\u2019s common stock, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, no shares of Series C Preferred Stock remain issued and outstanding.\nSeries D Preferred Stock\nIn connection with the Acquisition (see Note 3 - Oblong Industries Acquisition), the Company issued an aggregate of 1,686,659 shares of Series D Preferred Stock and an aggregate of 49,967 restricted shares of Series D Preferred Stock (\u201cRestricted Series D Preferred Stock\u201d), the latter of which are subject to vesting over a two-year period following the Closing Date of the Acquisition. Each share of Series D Preferred Stock is automatically convertible into a number of shares of the Company\u2019s common stock equal to the accrued value of the share (initially $28.50), plus any accrued dividends thereon, divided by the Conversion Price (initially $2.85 per share, subject to specified adjustments) upon the completion of both (i) approval of such conversion by the Company\u2019s stockholders (which occurred on December 19, 2019); and (ii) the receipt of all required authorizations and approval of a new listing application for the combined organization from the NYSE American or any such other exchange upon which the Company\u2019s securities are then listed for trading.\nPursuant to the terms of the Series D Certificate of Designations, each share of Series D Preferred Stock is entitled to receive an annual dividend equal to 6% of its then-existing Accrued Value per annum, commencing on the first anniversary of the issuance of the Series D Preferred Stock (or October 1, 2020). Prior to the first anniversary of the issuance of the Series D Preferred Stock no dividends will accrue on such stock. Dividends are cumulative and accrue daily in arrears. If the Company\u2019s Board of Directors does not declare any applicable dividend payment in cash, the Accrued Value of the Series D Preferred Stock will be increased by the amount of such dividend payment. The undeclared dividends for the Series D Preferred Stock, as of December 31, 2020, were $732,000, and increased the value of the Series D Preferred Stock by such amount.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, 28,618 and 1,725 of Restricted Series D Preferred Stock were forfeited, respectively, and, in 2020, $8,325 shares of Series D Preferred Stock were surrendered to cover the taxes on vesting shares. As of December 31, 2020, there are 1,647,991 shares of Series D Preferred Stock, and 49,967 shares of Restricted Series D Preferred Stock outstanding.\n-F-22-\nSeries E Preferred Stock\nOn October 1, 2019, Oblong entered into a Series E Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement (the \u201cPurchase Agreement\u201d) with the investors party thereto, who, prior to the closing of the Acquisition, were stockholders of Oblong Industries (the \u201cPurchasers\u201d), relating to the offer and sale by the Company in a private placement (the \u201cOffering\u201d) of up to 131,579 shares of its Series E Preferred Stock at a price of $28.50 per share. At an initial closing on October 1, 2019 and a subsequent closing on December 18, 2019, the Company sold a total of 131,579 shares of Series E Preferred Stock for net proceeds of approximately $3,750,000. The 131,579 shares of Series E Preferred Stock issued by the Company in the Series E Financing have an aggregate Accrued Value of $3,750,000 and upon their conversion will convert at a conversion price of $2.85 per share into 1,315,790 common shares. Like the Series D Preferred Stock, each share of Series E Preferred Stock is automatically convertible into common stock upon the receipt of all required authorizations and approval of a new listing application for the combined organization from the NYSE American or any such other exchange upon which the Company\u2019s securities are then listed for trading.\nPursuant to the terms of the Series E Certificate of Designations, each share of Series E Preferred Stock is entitled to receive an annual dividend equal to 6.0% of its then-existing Accrued Value per annum, commencing on the first anniversary of the issuance of the Series E Preferred Stock (or October 1, 2020 or December 18, 2020, as applicable). Prior to the first anniversary of the issuance of the Series E Preferred Stock no dividends will accrue on such stock. Dividends are cumulative and accrue daily in arrears. If the Company\u2019s Board of Directors does not declare any applicable dividend payment in cash, the Accrued Value of the Series E Preferred Stock will be increased by the amount of such dividend payment. The undeclared dividends for the Series E Preferred Stock, as of December 31, 2020, were $56,000, and increased the value of the Series E Preferred Stock by such amount.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 no shares of Series E Preferred Stock were forfeited and 131,579 shares remain outstanding as of December 31, 2020.\nSubsequent Conversion\nIf the outstanding shares of Series D and Series E Preferred Stock had been converted to common stock as of December 31, 2020, 17,020,100 and 1,315,790 shares of common stock would have been issued for the Series D and Series E Preferred Stock, respectively, which would have increased our outstanding shares of common stock from 7,748,629 to 26,084,519. In 2021 all outstanding shares of the Series D and Series E Preferred Stock, plus the value of the 6.0% dividend, were converted into shares of common stock. Refer to Note 20 - Subsequent Events, for further discussion of the conversion.\nNote 13 - Stock Based Compensation\n2019 Equity Incentive Plan\nOn December 19, 2019, the Oblong, Inc. 2019 Equity Incentive Plan (the \u201c2019 Plan\u201d) was approved by the Company\u2019s stockholders at the Company\u2019s 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. The 2019 Plan is an omnibus equity incentive plan pursuant to which the Company may grant equity and cash incentive awards to certain key service providers of the Company and its subsidiaries. The 2019 Plan replaces the Glowpoint, Inc. 2014 Equity Incentive Plan (the \u201cPrior Plan\u201d), which was adopted by the Company\u2019s Board of Directors on April 22, 2014, and subsequently approved by the Company\u2019s stockholders. Following approval of the 2019 Plan, the Company terminated the Prior Plan and may no longer make grants under the Prior Plan; however, any outstanding equity awards granted under the Prior Plan will continue to be governed by the terms of the Prior Plan. The maximum number of shares of the Company\u2019s Common Stock initially reserved and available for issuance under the 2019 Plan was equal to the sum of (i) 2,600,000 shares the Company\u2019s Common Stock and (ii) 421,000 shares of the Company\u2019s Common Stock remaining available for issuance under the Prior Plan at the time of its termination.

These unvested restricted shares, although classified as issued and outstanding at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, are considered contingently returnable until the restrictions lapse and will not be included in the basic net loss per share calculation until the shares are vested. Unvested shares of our restricted stock do not contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends and dividend equivalents. Vested RSUs (for which shares of common stock have not yet been delivered) are included in the calculations of basic net loss per share. Unvested RSUs are not included in calculations of basic net loss per share, as they are not considered issued and outstanding at time of grant.\nDiluted net loss per share is computed by giving effect to all potential shares of common stock, including stock options, preferred stock, RSUs, and unvested restricted stock awards, to the extent they are dilutive. For the year ended December 31, 2020, all such common stock equivalents have been excluded from diluted net loss per share as the effect to net loss per share would be anti-dilutive (due to the net losses).\n-F-26-\nThe following table sets forth the computation of the Company\u2019s basic and diluted net loss per share (in thousands, except per share data):\nYear Ended December 31,\nNumerator: 2020 2019\nNet loss $ (7,421) $ (7,761)\nLess: preferred stock dividends 17 27\nLess: undeclared dividends $ 788 $ -\nNet loss attributable to common stockholders $ (8,226) $ (7,788)\nDenominator:\nWeighted-average number of shares of common stock for basic net loss per share 5,547 5,108\nBasic and diluted net loss per share $ (1.48) $ (1.52)\nThe weighted-average number of shares for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 includes 28,904 and 28,904 shares, respectively, of vested RSUs, as discussed in Note 13 - Stock Based Compensation.\nThe following table represents the potential shares that were excluded from the computation of weighted-average number of shares of common stock in computing the diluted net loss per share for the periods presented because including them would have had an anti-dilutive effect:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2019\nUnvested restricted stock units - 23,334\nOutstanding stock options 107,500 215,345\nUnvested restricted stock awards 627 627\nShares of common stock issuable upon conversion of Series A-2 preferred stock 18,161 10,978\nShares of common stock issuable upon conversion of Series C preferred stock - 158,333\nShares of common stock issuable upon conversion of Series D preferred stock 17,020,100 17,349,010\nShares of common stock issuable upon conversion of Series E preferred stock 1,315,790 1,315,790\nWarrants 1,146,500 72,394\nNote 15 - Segment Reporting\nPrior to the acquisition of Oblong Industries on October 1, 2019, the Company operated in one segment. The businesses of Oblong (formerly Glowpoint) and Oblong Industries were managed separately during the fourth quarter of 2019 and the year ended December 31, 2020, and involve different products and services. Accordingly, the Company currently operates in two segments: (1) the Oblong business which mainly consists of managed services for video collaboration and network applications; and (2) the Oblong Industries business which consists of products and services for visual collaboration technologies.\nBecause the closing of the acquisition of Oblong Industries occurred on October 1, 2019, the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019 included in this Report only reflect Oblong Industries\u2019 financial results for the fourth quarter of 2019, as compared to full year results for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nCertain information concerning the Company\u2019s segments for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 is presented in the following tables (in thousands):\n-F-27-\nFor the Year Ended December 31, 2020\nOblong (formerly Glowpoint) Oblong Industries Corporate Total\nRevenue $ 6,227 $ 9,106 $ - $ 15,333\nCost of revenues 3,789 3,491 - 7,280\nGross profit $ 2,438 $ 5,615 $ - $ 8,053\nGross profit % 39.2 % 61.7 % - % 52.5 %\nAllocated operating expenses $ 1,479 $ 9,913 $ - $ 11,392\nUnallocated operating expenses - - 6,725 6,725\nTotal operating expenses $ 1,479 $ 9,913 $ 6,725 $ 18,117\nIncome (loss) from operations $ 959 $ (4,298) $ (6,725) $ (10,064)\nInterest and other income (expense), net (19) 2,765 - 2,746\nIncome (loss) before income taxes. $ 940 $ (1,533) $ (6,725) $ (7,318)\nIncome tax expense $ 50 $ 53 $ - $ 103\nNet income (loss) $ 890 $ (1,586) $ (6,725) $ (7,421)\nAs of December 31, 2020\nTotal assets $ 6,494 $ 22,649 $ - $ 29,143\nFor the Year Ended December 31, 2019\nOblong (formerly Glowpoint) Oblong Industries Corporate Total\nRevenue $ 9,660 $ 3,167 $ - $ 12,827\nCost of revenues 6,269 1,158 - 7,427\nGross profit $ 3,391 $ 2,009 $ - $ 5,400\nGross profit % 35.1 % 63.4 % - % 42.1 %\nAllocated operating expenses $ 6,835 $ 5,183 $ - $ 12,018\nUnallocated operating expenses - - 956 956\nTotal operating expenses $ 6,835 $ 5,183 $ 956 $ 12,974\nLoss from operations $ (3,444) $ (3,173) $ (956) $ (7,574)\nInterest and other expense, net - - (187) (187)\nLoss before income taxes $ (3,444) $ (3,173) $ (1,143) $ (7,761)\nIncome tax expense $ - $ - $ - $ -\nNet loss $ (3,444) $ (3,173) $ (1,143) $ (7,761)\nAs of December 31, 2019\nTotal assets $ 5,942 $ 28,967 $ - $ 34,909\nUnallocated operating expenses include costs for the year ending December 31, 2020 that are not specific to a particular segment but are general to the group; included are expenses incurred for administrative and accounting staff, general liability and other insurance, professional fees and other similar corporate expenses.\n-F-28-\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, there was no material revenue attributable to any individual foreign country. Approximately 1% of foreign revenue is billed in foreign currency and foreign currency gains and losses are not material.

The loss of or a reduction in sales or anticipated sales to our most significant or several of our smaller customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nConcentration of revenues was as follows:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2019\nSegment % of Revenue % of Revenue\nCustomer A Oblong 17.0 % 17.8 %\nCustomer B Oblong Industries 17.0 % *\nCustomer C Oblong - % 19.8 %\n-F-29-\nConcentration of accounts receivable was as follows:\nAs of December 31,\n2020 2019\nSegment % of Accounts Receivable % of Accounts Receivable\nCustomer A Oblong 14.1 % *\nCustomer B Oblong Industries 20.1 % *\nCustomer C Oblong Industries 12.0 % 16.0 %\nCustomer D Oblong Industries - % 18.0 %\nCustomer E Oblong * 11.5 %\n* The amount did not exceed 10% of the Company\u2019s consolidated total revenue or accounts receivable.\nNote 16 - Commitments and Contingencies\nOperating Leases\nWe lease three facilities in Los Angeles, California, one facility in Boston, Massachusetts, one facility in Dallas, Texas, and one facility in Munich Germany, all providing office space. We also lease space in City of Industry, California, providing warehouse space. These leases expire between 2022 and 2023. During 2020, and through the date of this filing, we exited leases in Herndon, Virginia; Atlanta, Georgia; Houston, Texas; Los Altos, California; London, England, and a warehouse space in Los Angeles, California. Although subject to COVID restrictions, we currently occupy two of the facilities in Los Angeles and the warehouse space in City of Industry; we have subleases in place for the third Los Angeles property, the Dallas property, and the Boston property. The Munich property is not in use and the Company is considering its options with this lease. Lease expenses, net of common charges and sublet proceeds, for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were $997,000 and $580,000, respectively. The 2019 lease expense consisted of twelve months of lease expense for Oblong (formerly Glowpoint) and three months of lease expense for Oblong Industries. The 2020 expenses consisted of twelve months of lease expense for Oblong Industries, and three months of lease expense for Oblong.\nThe Company primarily leases facilities for office and data center space under non-cancellable operating leases for its U.S. and international locations that expire at various dates through 2023. For leases with a term greater than 12 months, the Company recognizes a right-of-use asset and a lease liability based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. Variable lease payments are not included in the lease payments to measure the lease liability and are expensed as incurred. The Company\u2019s leases have remaining terms of one to three years and some of the leases include a Company option to extend the lease term for less than twelve months to five years, or more, which if reasonably certain to exercise, the Company includes in the determination of lease payments. The lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.\nAs the Company's leases do not provide a readily determinable implicit rate, the Company uses the incremental borrowing rate at lease commencement, which was determined using a portfolio approach, based on the rate of interest that the Company would have to pay to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments on a collateralized basis over a similar term. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nLeases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recognized on the balance sheet and the expense for these short-term leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Common area maintenance fees (or CAMs) and other charges related to these leases continue to be expensed as incurred.\n-F-30-\nThe following provides balance sheet information related to leases as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 (in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2019\nAssets\nOperating lease, right-of-use asset, net $ 903 $ 3,117\nLiabilities\nCurrent portion of operating lease liabilities $ 830 $ 1,294\nOperating lease liabilities, net of current portion 602 2,020\nTotal operating lease liabilities $ 1,432 $ 3,314\nThe following table summarizes the future undiscounted cash payments reconciled to the lease liability (in thousands):\nYear Ending December 31,\n2021 $ 901\n2022 514\n2023 116\nTotal lease payments $ 1,531\nEffect of discounting (99)\nTotal lease liability $ 1,432\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we entered into one new operating lease, terminated six operating leases, and took impairment losses on the right-of-use assets on two of our operating leases. The following table provides a reconciliation of activity for our right of use assets and lease liabilities (in thousands):\nRight-of-Use Asset Operating Lease Liability\nBalance at December 31, 2019 $ 3,117 $ 3,314\nAdditions $ 116 $ 116\nTerminations and Modifications $ (864) $ (860)\nAmortizations and Reductions $ (1,001) $ (1,138)\nImpairment Charges $ (465) $ -\nBalance at December 31, 2020 $ 903 $ 1,432\nThe ROU assets and lease liabilities are recorded on the Company\u2019s consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019. During the year ended December 31, 2020, non-cash immaterial out-of-period adjustments of approximately $195,000 were recorded to reduce the right of use asset and lease liability. These adjustments related to an error in the calculation of these amounts, in connection with the Oblong Acquisition.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company entered into one new lease, in City of Industry, CA, for warehouse space. The new lease commenced on September 1, 2020 and has a term of 18 months. The new lease resulted in an addition to ROU Assets, and corresponding increase to lease liability, of $116,000.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company exited six of its leases, one in Denver, one in New York, one in London, one in Atlanta, one in Los Angeles, and one in Virginia. The Denver lease was exited in the first quarter of 2020, the New York and London leases were exited in the second quarter of 2020, and the Atlanta lease was exited in the third quarter of 2020 when the Company elected not to renew the leases. The Los Angeles lease was exited in third quarter of 2020, and the Virginia lease was exited in the fourth quarter of 2020, when the Company negotiated early terminations of the leases. These lease exits resulted in the reduction of ROU assets and the reduction of lease liability.\n-F-31-\nThe Denver ROU asset was fully amortized, and the lease liability had been fully paid, as of the date of exit resulting in a net effect of zero on the ROU asset and operating lease liability on the Company\u2019s consolidated balance sheet during the first quarter of 2020.\nThe New York ROU asset was fully amortized, and the lease liability had been fully paid, as of the date of exit resulting in a net effect of zero on the ROU asset and operating lease liability on the Company\u2019s consolidated balance sheet during the first quarter of 2020.\nThe London lease expired in April 2020 and the Company elected not to renew the lease. The Company had originally planned to renew the London Lease, and, pursuant to ASC 842, had recorded additional operating lease liability and ROU asset value. Upon the exit of the London Lease, the Company recorded a disposal of ROU asset value of $214,000 and corresponding reduction of operating lease liability of $197,000 on the Company\u2019s consolidated balance sheet during the first quarter of 2020.\nOn April 24, 2020, the Company signed an amendment to the lease on our Los Angeles warehouse in order to exit the lease early. The original termination date of the lease was the end of May 2022 and we exited the lease at the end of August 2020. Upon the exit of the LA Warehouse Lease, the Company recorded a disposal of ROU asset value of $317,000 and corresponding reduction of operating lease liability of $333,000 of lease liability on the Company\u2019s consolidated balance sheet during the second quarter of 2020. In addition, in exchange for the early termination, the Company forfeited its security deposit of $26,000.\nOn July 31, 2020, the Company entered into a termination agreement related to our lease in Atlanta, upon the expiration of the lease term. The Company had originally planned to renew the Atlanta Lease, and, pursuant to ASC 842, had recorded additional operating lease liability and ROU asset value. Upon exit of the Atlanta lease, the Company recorded a disposal of ROU asset value of $17,000, and a corresponding reduction of lease liability of $20,000, on the Company\u2019s consolidated balance sheet during the third quarter of 2020.\nOn November 30, 2020, the Company entered into a termination agreement, related to our lease in Virginia, in exchange for a cancellation fee of $45,000 and the forfeiture of our $18,000 security deposit. The original term of the lease was set to expire in September 2022. Upon exit of the Virginia lease, the Company recorded a disposal of ROU asset value of $120,000, and a corresponding reduction of lease liability of $137,000, on the Company\u2019s consolidated balance sheet during the fourth quarter of 2020.\nDuring 2020, the Company subleased its office space in Dallas and Los Altos, a portion of its office space in Boston, and in December 2020, we subleased one of the units of our LA office space. The sublease terms all mirror the remaining terms of their respective leases, and all subleases are in good standing. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded an offset of approximately $374,000 to our rent and occupancy expenses from the proceeds of these subleases.\nOn December 31, 2020, the Company determined it was not going to be able to sublet the remainder of the Boston property, or any of the Munich property, and impaired the ROU asset value of these leases. The Company recorded impairment charges of $195,000 and $270,000 on the ROU assets of the Boston and Munich leases, respectively, and included these amounts in impairment expense in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nCOVID-19\nOn March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization announced that infections of the novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) had become pandemic, and on March 13, the U.S. President announced a National Emergency relating to the disease. There is a possibility of continued widespread infection in the United States and abroad, with the potential for catastrophic impact. National, state and local authorities have required or recommended social distancing and imposed or are considering quarantine and isolation measures on large portions of the population, including mandatory business closures. These measures, while intended to protect human life, are expected to have serious adverse impacts on domestic and foreign economies of uncertain severity and duration. Some economists are predicting the United States will soon enter a recession. The sweeping nature of the coronavirus pandemic makes it extremely difficult to predict how the Company\u2019s business and operations will be affected in the longer run, but we expect that it may materially affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. The extent to which the coronavirus impacts our results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of the coronavirus and the actions to contain the coronavirus or treat its impact, among others. Moreover, the coronavirus outbreak has begun to have indeterminable adverse effects on general commercial activity and the world economy, and our business and results of operations could be adversely\n-F-32-\naffected to the extent that this coronavirus or any other epidemic harms the global economy generally and/or the markets in which we operate specifically. Any of the foregoing factors, or other cascading effects of the coronavirus pandemic that are not currently foreseeable, could materially increase our costs, negatively impact our revenues and damage the Company\u2019s results of operations and its liquidity position, possibly to a significant degree. The duration of any such impacts cannot be predicted. As discussed in Note 21, an existing major customer of the Company suspended certain professional services we provided to the customer effective April 30, 2020 due to COVID-19. These services accounted for $1.0 million, or 9%, of the Company\u2019s revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020. Uncertainties resulting from COVID-19 may result in additional customers delaying budget expenditures or re-allocating resources, which would result in a decrease in orders from these customers. Any such decrease in orders from these customers could cause a material adverse effect on our revenues and financial results and our ability to generate positive cash flows.\nNote 17 - Income Taxes\nThe following table sets forth pretax book loss (in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2019\nUnited States $ (7,570) $ (7,882)\nForeign 252 121\nTotal $ (7,318) $ (7,761)\nThe following table sets forth income before taxes and the income tax expense for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 (in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2019\nCurrent:\nFederal $ - $ -\nForeign 53 -\nState 50 -\n103 -\nDeferred:\nFederal - -\nForeign - -\nState - -\n- -\nIncome tax expense $ 103 $ -\n-F-33-\nOur effective tax rate differs from the statutory federal tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 as shown in the following table (in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2019\nU.S. federal income taxes at the statutory rate $ (1,533) $ (1,630)\nState taxes, net of federal effects (122) (130)\nUK Anti-Hybrid expense addback 289 397\nTransaction costs - 74\nGoodwill impairment 114 473\nSection 382 Limitation - (7,448)\nAdjustment to NOL Benefit 4,640 -\nNOL Carryforward Adjustment for Expired NOLs 84 -\nStock Compensation Plan Adjustments 272 -\nChange in state apportionment rate (350) (406)\nChange in valuation allowance (3,868) 8,869\nResearch and development credit 546 (136)\nOther 31 (63)\nIncome tax expense $ 103 $ -\nThe tax effect of the temporary differences that give rise to significant portions of the deferred tax assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 is presented below (in thousands):\nDecember 31,\n2020 2019\nDeferred tax assets (liabilities):\nTax benefit of operating loss carry forward - Federal $ 23,184 $ 22,793\nTax benefit of operating loss carry forward - State 5,548 10,122\nAccrued expenses 141 83\nDeferred revenue 417 522\nStock-based compensation 396 671\nFixed assets 329 320\nGoodwill 167 236\nInventory 47 (61)\nIntangible amortization (2,285) (3,287)\nR&D credit 2,154 2,700\nTexas margin tax temporary credit 159 186\nOther 285 125\nTotal deferred tax asset, net $ 30,542 $ 34,410\nValuation allowance (30,542) (34,410)\nNet deferred tax liability $ - $ -\nThe ending balances of the deferred tax asset have been fully reserved, reflecting the uncertainties as to realizability evidenced by the Company\u2019s historical results. The change in valuation allowance for the year ended December 31, 2020 is an decrease of $4,005,000 principally due to the reduction of NOLs due to Section 382 limitations. The change in valuation allowance for the year ended December 31, 2019 was an increase of $25,040,000.\nWe and our subsidiary file federal and state tax returns on a consolidated basis. On October 1, 2019 Oblong, Inc. acquired the stock of Oblong Industries Inc. that resulted in Oblong Industries Inc.'s shareholders now owning 75% of Oblong, Inc. Therefore, an \u201cownership change\u201d occurred on this date (as defined under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as\n-F-34-\namended), which places an annual limitation on the utilization of the net operating loss (\u201cNOL\u201d) carryforwards accumulated before the ownership change. If additional ownership changes occur in the future, the use of the net operating loss carryforwards could be subject to further limitation.\nAs a result of this annual limitation and the limited carryforward life of the accumulated NOLs, we determined that the ownership change resulted in the permanent loss of approximately $30,880,000 of tax NOL carryforwards. At December 31, 2019, we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of $108,497,000 available to offset future federal taxable income which expire in various amounts from 2020 through 2037. At December 31, 2020, we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of $110,401,000 available to offset future federal taxable income which expire in various amounts from 2020 through 2037. Of this amount, 5,928,000 is subject to annual Section 382 limitations. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company also has various state net operating loss carryforwards of $94,223,000 and $141,210,000, respectively. The determination of the state net operating loss carryforwards is dependent upon apportionment percentages and state laws that can change, from year to year and impact the amount of such carryforwards.\nThere were no significant matters determined to be unrecognized tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in a tax return, in accordance with ASC Topic 740 \u201cIncome Taxes\u201d (\u201cASC 740\u201d), which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements, that have been recorded on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. The Company does not anticipate a material change to unrecognized tax benefits in the next twelve months.\nAdditionally, ASC 740 provides guidance on the recognition of interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits. There were no interest or penalties related to income taxes that have been accrued or recognized as of and for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nThe federal and state tax returns for the 2017 and subsequent years are currently open to examination.\nNote 18 - 401(k) Plan\nWe have adopted a retirement plan under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code.
