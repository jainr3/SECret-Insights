Our business development professionals create an annual territory plan identifying various strategies to engage our target customers.\nCustomer Retention Programs\nWe use digital marketing capabilities when marketing to our customer base.

The total purchase price of $2.4 million consisted of (1) $285 thousand in cash paid at closing or in close proximity to closing, (2) $376 thousand of deferred cash payable in installments post-closing, (3) $352 thousand seller note issued to one of the selling shareholders, and (4) amounts payable to one selling shareholder as consideration for assistance with certain matters related to the acquisition for a period of one year from the closing date of the acquisition. The Woorank Purchase Agreement also provides for additional consideration, in the event of achievement of certain revenue targets and operational goals, to the selling shareholders pursuant to three separate earn-out provisions. The acquisition date fair value of contingent consideration was $1.3 million. Under certain conditions, up to \u20ac 600 thousand (approximately $723 thousand) of the purchase price is payable, at the Company\u2019s discretion, in shares of the Company\u2019s common stock, par value $0.001 per share (\u201ccommon stock\u201d), at a price per share equal to the greater of (i) the closing price of the Company\u2019s common stock on the date of issuance or (ii) $3.38. On the closing date, the Company issued 29,433 shares of its common stock, with an aggregate issuance date fair value of $99 thousand, for a portion of the purchase price.\nOn May 28, 2021, the Company, pursuant to a Share Purchase Agreement (the \u201cHawk Purchase Agreement\u201d), acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of Hawk Search, an Illinois corporation. The total purchase price of $9.9 million consisted of (1) $4.8 million initial cash payment at closing, (2) issuance of 1,500 shares of the Company\u2019s newly designated Series D Preferred Stock with an aggregate issuance date fair value of $930, and (3) $2,000 deferred cash payable on or before December 31, 2021. The Hawk Purchase Agreement also provides for additional consideration, in the event of achievement of certain revenue targets, to the selling shareholders as an additional earn-out, payable no later than December 31, 2022. The acquisition date fair value of contingent consideration was $2.2 million.\nThere were no acquisitions during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020.\nResearch and Development\nWe have research and development activities focusing on creating new products and innovations, product enhancements, and funding future market opportunities. Research and development expenses were approximately $2.4 million or 18% of revenues and $1.6 million or 15% of revenues during fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nEmployees\nHuman Capital\nBridgeline is dedicated to creating the best digital presence for our customers, and our employees are critical to achieving this mission. In order to continue to design innovative experiences and products, and compete and succeed in our highly competitive and rapidly evolving market, we continue to attract and retain experienced and talented employees. As part of these efforts, we strive to offer a competitive compensation and benefits program, foster a community where everyone feels included and empowered to do to their best work.\nAs of September 30, 2021, we had approximately 60 full-time employees. Of our full-time employees, approximately 48 were in the United States and the remaining were in our various international locations. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement.\nCompensation and Benefits Program\nOur compensation program is designed to attract and reward talented individuals who possess the skills necessary to support our business objectives, assist in the achievement of our strategic goals and create long-term value for our stockholders. We provide employees with compensation packages that include base salary, incentive bonuses, and long-term stock option awards tied to the value of our stock price. We believe that a compensation program with both short-term and long-term awards provides fair and competitive compensation and aligns employee and stockholder interests, including by incentivizing business and individual performance (pay for performance), motivating based on long-term company performance and integrating compensation with our business plans. In addition to cash and equity compensation, we also offer employees benefits such as life and health (medical, dental & vision) insurance, paid time off, paid parental leave, and a 401(k) plan.\nCustomers\nWe primarily serve the following vertical markets that we believe have a history of investing in information technology enhancements and initiatives:\n\u25cf\nFinancial Services\n\u25cf\nFranchise/Dealer Networks\n\u25cf\nRetail Brand Names\n\u25cf\nHealth Services and Life Sciences\n\u25cf\nHigh Technology (software and hardware)\n\u25cf\nCredit Unions and Regional Banks\n\u25cf\nAssociations and Foundations\nFor the year ended September 30, 2021, no customer exceeded 10% of the Company\u2019s total revenues. For the year ended September 30, 2020, one customer generated approximately 12% of our revenue.\nCompetition\nThe markets for our products and services, including software for web content management, eCommerce platform software, eMarketing software, web analytics software and digital engagement services are highly competitive, fragmented, and rapidly changing. Barriers to entry in such markets remain relatively low. The markets are significantly affected by new product introductions and other market activities of industry participants. With the introduction of new technologies and market entrants, we expect competition to persist and intensify in the future.\nWe believe we compete adequately with others and we distinguish ourselves from our competitors in a number of ways, including:\n\u25cf\nWe believe our competitors generally offer their web application software as a single point of entry type product (such as content management only, or commerce only) as compared to the deeply integrated approach provided by Bridgeline\u2019s platforms.\n\u25cf\nWe believe our competitors can generally only deploy their solutions in either a Cloud/SaaS environment or in a dedicated server environment. Bridgeline\u2019s platform\u2019s architecture is flexible and some are capable of being deployed in either a Cloud/SaaS or dedicated server environment.\n\u25cf\nWe believe the majority of our competitors do not provide interactive technology development services that complement their software products. Our ability to develop mission critical websites and online stores on our own deeply integrated platforms provides a quality end-to-end solution that distinguishes us from our competitors.\n\u25cf\nWe believe the interface of the Bridgeline platforms have been designed for ease of use without substantial technical skills.\n\u25cf\nFinally, we believe the Bridgeline platforms offers a competitive price-to-functionality ratio when compared to our competitors.\nPatents, Trademarks, and Trade Secrets\nWe own a number of trade secrets, licenses and trademarks related to Bridgeline products and services and their loss could have a material adverse effect on the Company. We do not own any patents. For additional information see Risk Factor - If we are unable to protect our proprietary technology and other intellectual property rights, our ability to compete in the marketplace may be substantially reduced.\nAvailable Information\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K, as well as our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K, along with any amendments to those reports, are made available upon request, on our website www.bridgeline.com as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d).

    "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThis report contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, such as statements of our objectives, expectations and intentions. The cautionary statements made in this report are applicable to all forward-looking statements wherever they appear in this report. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed herein. In addition to the risks discussed in \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\u201d our business is subject to the risks set forth below.\nWe operate in a rapidly changing environment that involves certain risks and uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. The risks described below are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results.\nRisk Factors\nWe have incurred significant net losses since inception and expect to continue to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future. We may never achieve or sustain profitability, which would depress the market price of our common stock and could cause you to lose all or a part of your investment.\nWe have incurred a net loss of $6.7 million for the year ended September 30, 2021, which includes expenses related to the change in the fair value of warrant liabilities. Since our inception in 2000 through fiscal 2019, we have incurred net losses. As of September 30, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $82.3 million. Our prior losses have had an adverse effect on our stockholders\u2019 equity and working capital. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with our business, we are unable to predict the extent of any future losses or when we will become profitable. If we do become profitable, we may not be able to sustain or increase our profitability on a quarterly or annual basis.\nWe may require additional financing to execute our business plan and further expand our operations.\nWe may require additional funding to further expand our operations. We depend on financing sources, either debt or equity, or a combination thereof, which may not be available to us in a timely basis if at all, or on terms acceptable to us. Further, our ability to obtain financing may be limited by rules of the NASDAQ Capital Market.\nIn July 2021, the Company received approximately $5.8 million in cash relating the issuance of 1,543,779 shares of its common stock upon exercise of Series A Warrants, originally issued in March 2019, with an exercise price of $4.00 per share.\nOn May 14, 2021, the Company offered and sold, in a registered direct offering, a total of 1,060,000 shares of its common stock at a price of $2.28 per share. On the same day, the Company entered into securities purchase agreements with certain institutional investors in connection with a private placement of 2,700 shares of newly designated Series D Convertible Preferred Stock at a price of $1,000 per share and warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 592,105 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $2.51 per share. The aggregate proceeds, net of cash paid for certain fees due to placement agents and transaction related expenses, of these two transactions that occurred on the same day was $4.6 million.\nOn February 4, 2021, the Company offered and sold a total of 880,000 shares of its common stock, par value $0.001 per share, to certain institutional and accredited investors at a public offering price of $3.10 per share in a registered direct offering. The aggregate proceeds from this transaction, net of certain fees due to placement agents and transaction expenses, was approximately $2.5 million.\nIn connection with the acquisition of Hawk Search completed during the third quarter of fiscal year 2021, the Company recognized an obligation for a deferred payment representing a portion of the purchase price of $2.0 million payable on or before December 31, 2021, and contingent earn-out payments of $2.2 million (acquisition date fair value) which are payable, no later than December 31, 2022, and may vary in amount in the event of achievement of certain revenue targets and operational goals.\nIn connection with the acquisition of Woorank completed during the second quarter of fiscal year 2021, the Company (1) assumed the outstanding long-term debt obligations of $2.1 million of the acquiree of which $732 thousand is payable over the next twelve months, (2) issued a seller note of $352 thousand to one of the selling shareholders payable over a five-year period, (3) deferred a portion of the purchase price of $376 thousand which is expected to be paid within the next twelve months, and (4) recognized contingent earn-out payments of $1.3 million (acquisition date fair value) which are payable in the event of achievement of certain revenue targets and operational goals.\nOn August 17, 2020, the Company entered into an arrangement with an investment banking firm to sell up to $4,796,090 of shares of the Company\u2019s common stock, $0.001 par value. There are no obligations for the sale or purchase of the Company\u2019s common stock pursuant to this offering. Accordingly, there can be no assurances that the Company or investment banking firm will be successful in selling any portion of the shares available for sale pursuant to this offering. On December 18, 2020, the Company delivered written notice to Roth Capital Partners that it was suspending all offers and sales under the At the Market Offering Agreement (the \u201cSuspension Period\u201d), during which time the Company will not make any sales of Placement Shares. On August 17, 2021, the ATM offering expired unused.\nIf we fail to obtain acceptable funding when needed, we may not have sufficient resources to fund our operations, and this would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nA reduction in our license renewal rate could reduce our revenue.\nOur customers have no obligation to renew their subscription licenses, and some customers have elected not to do so. Our license renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including customer dissatisfaction with our products and services, our failure to update our products to maintain their attractiveness in the market, or constraints or changes in budget priorities faced by our customers. A decline in license renewal rates could cause our revenue to decline, which would have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nWe are dependent upon a small number of major customers, and a failure to renew our licenses with such customers could reduce our revenue.\nOur customers have no obligation to renew their subscription licenses, and some customers have elected not to do so, including a number of our large customers in the recent two fiscal years. Our license renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including customer dissatisfaction with our products and services, our failure to update our products to maintain their attractiveness in the market, or constraints or changes in budget priorities faced by our customers. A decline in license renewal rates could cause our revenue to decline, which would have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nThe length of our sales cycle can fluctuate significantly, which could result in significant fluctuations in license revenues being recognized from quarter to quarter.\nThe decision by a customer to purchase our products often involves the development of a complex implementation plan across a customer\u2019s business. This process often requires a significant commitment of resources both by prospective customers and us. Given the significant investment and commitment of resources required in order to implement our software, it may take several months, or even several quarters, for marketing opportunities to materialize. If a customer\u2019s decision to purchase our products is delayed, or if the installation of our products takes longer than originally anticipated, the date on which we may recognize revenue from these sales would be delayed. Such delays and fluctuations could cause our revenue to be lower than expected in a particular period, and we may not be able to adjust our costs quickly enough to offset such lower revenue, potentially negatively impacting our results of operations.\nWe depend on a third-party cloud platform provider to host our Bridgeline SaaS environment and managed services business and if we were to experience a disruption in service, our business and reputation could suffer.\nWe host our SaaS and managed hosting customers via a third-party, Amazon Web Services. If upon renewal date our third-party provider does not provide commercially reasonable terms, we may be required to transfer our services to a new provider, such as a data center facility, and we may incur significant equipment costs and possible service interruption in connection with doing so. Service interruptions might reduce our revenue, cause us to issue credits or refunds to customers, subject us to potential liability, or harm our renewal rates.\nIf our security measures or those of our third-party cloud computing platform provider are breached and unauthorized access is obtained to a customer\u2019s data, our services may be perceived as not being secure, and we may incur significant legal and financial exposure and liabilities.\nSecurity breaches could expose us to a risk of loss of our customers\u2019 information, litigation and possible liability. While we have security measures in place, they may be breached as a result of third-party action, including intentional misconduct by computer hackers, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise and result in someone obtaining unauthorized access to our IT systems, our customers\u2019 data or our data, including our intellectual property and other confidential business information. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, or to sabotage systems, change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to implement adequate preventative measures. In addition, our customers may authorize third-party technology providers to access their customer data, and some of our customers may not have adequate security measures in place to protect their data that is stored on our services. Because we do not control our customers or third-party technology providers, or the processing of such data by third-party technology providers, we cannot ensure the integrity or security of such transmissions or processing. Malicious third parties may also conduct attacks designed to temporarily deny customers access to our services. Any security breach could result in a loss of confidence in the security of our services, damage our reputation, negatively impact our future sales, disrupt our business and lead to legal liability.\nWe rely on encryption and authentication technology from third parties to provide the security and authentication to effectively secure transmission of confidential information, including consumer payment card numbers. Such technology may not be sufficient to protect the transmission of such confidential information or these technologies may have material defects that may compromise the confidentiality or integrity of the transmitted data. Any imposition of liability, particularly liability that is not covered by insurance, or is in excess of insurance coverage, could harm our reputation, business and operating results. We might be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect further against security breaches or to rectify problems caused by any security breach, which, in turn, could divert funds available for corporate growth and expansion or future acquisitions.\nOur operating lease commitments may adversely affect our financial condition and cash flows from operations.\nWe have contractual commitments in operating lease arrangements. Our ability to meet our expenses and contractual commitments will depend on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic, regulatory and other factors. We will not be able to control many of these factors, such as economic conditions and governmental regulations. Further, our operations may not generate sufficient cash to enable us to service our working capital needs or contractual obligations resulting from our leases. If we are at any time unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations, we may be required to obtain additional sources of financing. There can be no assurance that we would be able to successfully renegotiate such terms, or that additional financing could be obtained on terms that are favorable or acceptable to us. Refer to the Risk Factor - We may require additional financing to execute our business plan and further expand our operations, for a description of capital raising activities.\nWe face intense and growing competition, which could result in price reductions, reduced operating margins and loss of market share.\nWe operate in a highly competitive marketplace and generally encounter intense competition to create and maintain demand for our services and to obtain service contracts. If we are unable to successfully compete for new business and license renewals, our revenue growth and operating margins may decline. The market for our platforms and web development services are competitive and rapidly changing. Barriers to entry in such markets are relatively low. With the introduction of new technologies and market entrants, we expect competition to intensify in the future. Some of our principal competitors offer their products at a lower price, which may result in pricing pressures. Such pricing pressures and increased competition generally could result in reduced sales, reduced margins or the failure of our product and service offerings to achieve or maintain more widespread market acceptance.\nThe web development/services market is highly fragmented with a large number of competitors and potential competitors. Our prominent public company competitors are Big Commerce, Salesforce (Commerce Cloud), Optimizely (Episerver), Hubspot, Sitecore, and Adobe (Experience Manager). We face competition from customers and potential customers who develop their own applications internally. We also face competition from potential competitors that are substantially larger than we are and who have significantly greater financial, technical and marketing resources, and established direct and indirect channels of distribution. As a result, they are able to devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products than we can.\nIf our products fail to perform properly due to undetected errors or similar problems, our business could suffer, and we could face product liability exposure.\nWe develop and sell complex web engagement software which may contain undetected errors or bugs. Such errors can be detected at any point in a product\u2019s life cycle but are frequently found after introduction of new software or enhancements to existing software. We continually introduce new products and new versions of our products. Despite internal testing and testing by current and potential customers, our current and future products may contain serious defects. If we detect any errors before we ship a product, we might have to delay product shipment for an extended period of time while we address the problem. We might not discover software errors that affect our new or current products or enhancements until after they are deployed, and we may need to provide enhancements to correct such errors. Therefore, it is possible that, despite our testing, errors may occur in our software. These errors could result in the following:\n\u25cf\nharm to our reputation;\n\u25cf\nlost sales;\n\u25cf\ndelays in commercial release;\n\u25cf\nproduct liability claims;\n\u25cf\ncontractual disputes;\n\u25cf\nnegative publicity;\n\u25cf\ndelays in or loss of market acceptance of our products;\n\u25cf\nlicense terminations or renegotiations; or\n\u25cf\nunexpected expenses and diversion of resources to remedy errors.\nFurthermore, our customers may use our software together with products from other companies. As a result, when problems occur, it might be difficult to identify the source of the problem. Even when our software does not cause these problems, the existence of these errors might cause us to incur significant costs, divert the attention of our technical personnel from our product development efforts, impact our reputation, or cause significant customer relations problems.\nTechnology and customer requirements evolve rapidly in our industry, and if we do not continue to develop new products and enhance our existing products in response to these changes, our business could suffer.\nWe will need to continue to enhance our products in order to maintain our competitive position. We may not be successful in developing and marketing enhancements to our products on a timely basis, and any enhancements we develop may not adequately address the changing needs of the marketplace. Overlaying the risks associated with our existing products and enhancements are ongoing technological developments and rapid changes in customer requirements. Our future success will depend upon our ability to develop and introduce, in a timely manner, new products that take advantage of technological advances and respond to new customer requirements. The development of new products is increasingly complex and uncertain, which increases the risk of delays. We may not be successful in developing new products and incorporating new technology on a timely basis, and any new products may not adequately address the changing needs of the marketplace. Failure to develop new products and product enhancements that meet market needs in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nIf we are unable to protect our proprietary technology and other intellectual property rights, our ability to compete in the marketplace may be substantially reduced.\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property, our competitors could use our intellectual property to market products similar to our products, which could decrease demand for such products, thus decreasing our revenue. We rely on a combination of copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as licensing agreements, third-party non-disclosure agreements and other contractual measures to protect our intellectual property rights. These protections may not be adequate to prevent our competitors from copying or reverse engineering our products. Our competitors may independently develop technologies that are substantially similar or superior to our technology. To protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information, we require employees, consultants, advisors and collaborators to enter into confidentiality agreements. These agreements may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets, know-how or other proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use, misappropriation or disclosure of such trade secrets, know-how or other proprietary information. The protective mechanisms we include in our products may not be sufficient to prevent unauthorized copying. Existing copyright laws afford only limited protection for our intellectual property rights and may not protect such rights in the event competitors independently develop similar products. In addition, the laws of some countries in which our products are or may be licensed do not protect our products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States.\nPolicing unauthorized use of our products is difficult and litigation could become necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights. Any litigation could be time consuming and expensive to prosecute or resolve, result in substantial diversion of management attention and resources, and materially harm our business or financial condition.\nIf a third party asserts that we infringe upon its proprietary rights, we could be required to redesign our products, pay significant royalties or enter into license agreements.\nClaims of infringement are becoming increasingly common as the software industry continues to develop and as related legal protections, including but not limited to patents, are applied to software products. Although we do not believe that our products infringe on the rights of third parties, a third party may assert that our technology or technologies of entities we acquire violates its intellectual property rights. As the number of software products in our markets increases, and the functionality of these products further overlap, we believe that infringement claims will become more common. Any claims against us, regardless of their merit, could:\n\u25cf\nbe expensive and time consuming to defend;\n\u25cf\nresult in negative publicity;\n\u25cf\nforce us to stop licensing our products that incorporate the challenged intellectual property;\n\u25cf\nrequire us to redesign our products;\n\u25cf\ndivert management\u2019s attention and our other resources; and/or\n\u25cf\nrequire us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements in order to obtain the right to use necessary technologies, which may not be available on terms acceptable to us, if at all.\nWe believe that any successful challenge to our use of a trademark or domain name could substantially diminish our ability to conduct business in a particular market or jurisdiction and thus decrease our revenue and result in possible losses to our business.\nIncreasing government regulation could affect our business and may adversely affect our financial condition.\nWe are subject not only to regulations applicable to businesses generally, but also to laws and regulations directly applicable to electronic commerce. In addition, an inability to satisfy the standards of certain voluntary third-party certification bodies that our customers may expect, such as an attestation of compliance with the Payment Card Industry (\u201cPCI\u201d) Data Security Standards, may have an adverse impact on our business and results. Further, there are various statutes, regulations, and rulings relevant to the direct email marketing and text-messaging industries, including the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (\u201cTCPA\u201d), the CAN-SPAM Act and related Federal Communication Commission (\u201cFCC\u201d) orders. The interpretation of many of these statutes, regulations, and rulings is evolving in the courts and administrative agencies and an inability to comply may have an adverse impact on our business and results. If in the future we are unable to achieve or maintain industry-specific certifications or other requirements or standards relevant to our customers, it may harm our business and adversely affect our results.\nWe may also expand our business in countries that have more stringent data protection laws than those in the United States, and such laws may be inconsistent across jurisdictions and are subject to evolving and differing interpretations. In particular, the European Union has passed the General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d), which came into force on May 25, 2018. The GDPR includes more stringent operational requirements for entities that receive or process personal data (as compared to U.S. privacy laws and previous EU laws), along with significant penalties for non-compliance, more robust obligations on data processors and data controllers, greater rights for data subjects, and heavier documentation requirements for data protection compliance programs. Additionally, both laws regulating privacy and third-party products purporting to address privacy concerns could negatively affect the functionality of, and demand for, our products and services, thereby reducing our revenue.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nOur revenue and quarterly results may fluctuate, which could adversely affect our stock price.\nWe have experienced, and may in the future experience, significant fluctuations in our quarterly operating results that may be caused by many factors. These factors include, among others:\n\u25cf\nchanges in demand for our products;\n\u25cf\nintroduction, enhancement or announcement of products by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf\nmarket acceptance of our new products;\n\u25cf\nthe growth rates of certain market segments in which we compete;\n\u25cf\nsize and timing of significant orders;\n\u25cf\nbudgeting cycles of customers;\n\u25cf\nmix of products and services sold;\n\u25cf\nchanges in the level of operating expenses;\n\u25cf\ncompletion or announcement of acquisitions; and\n\u25cf\ngeneral economic conditions in regions in which we conduct business.\nIf we are unable to manage our future growth efficiently, our business, liquidity, revenues and profitability may suffer.\nWe anticipate that continued expansion of our core business will require us to address potential market opportunities. For example, we may need to expand the size of our research and development, sales, corporate finance or operations staff. There can be no assurance that our infrastructure will be sufficiently flexible and adaptable to manage our projected growth or that we will have sufficient resources, human or otherwise, to sustain such growth. If we are unable to adequately address these additional demands on our resources, our profitability and growth might suffer. Also, if we continue to expand our operations, management might not be effective in expanding our physical facilities and our systems, and our procedures or controls might not be adequate to support such expansion. Our inability to manage our growth could harm our business and decrease our revenues.\nThere may be a limited market for our common stock, which may make it more difficult for you to sell your stock and which may reduce the market price of our common stock.\nThe average shares traded per day in fiscal 2021 was approximately 2,839,000 shares per day compared to approximately 484,000 shares for fiscal 2020, and 264,000 for fiscal 2019. Our average trading volume of our common stock can be very sporadic and may impair the ability of holders of our common stock to sell their shares at the time they wish to sell them or at a price that they consider reasonable. A low trading volume may also reduce the fair market value of the shares of our common stock. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the price of our common stock will reflect our actual value. There can be no assurance that the daily trading volume of our common stock will increase or improve either now or in the future.\nThe market price of our common stock is volatile, which could adversely affect your investment in our common stock.\nThe market price of our common stock is volatile and could fluctuate significantly for many reasons, including, without limitation: as a result of the risk factors listed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K; actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results; and general economic and industry conditions. During fiscal 2021, the closing price of our common stock as reported by NASDAQ fluctuated between $1.99 and $12.23. We are required to meet certain financial criteria in order to maintain our listing on the NASDAQ Capital Market. One such requirement is that we maintain a minimum closing bid price of at least $1.00 per share for our common stock. If we fail this requirement then NASDAQ will issue a notice that we are not in compliance and we will need to take corrective actions in order to not be delisted. Such corrective actions could be a reverse stock split.\nWe are dependent upon our management team and the loss of any of these individuals could harm our business.\nWe are dependent on the efforts of our key management personnel. The loss of any of our key management personnel, or our inability to recruit and train additional key management and other personnel in a timely manner, could materially and adversely affect our business, operations and future prospects. We maintain a key man insurance policy covering our Chief Executive Officer.\nBecause competition for highly qualified personnel is intense, we might not be able to attract and retain the employees we need to support our planned growth.\nWe will need to increase the size and maintain the quality of our sales force, software development staff and professional services organization to execute our growth plans. To meet our objectives, we must attract and retain highly qualified personnel with specialized skill sets. Competition for qualified personnel can be intense, and we might not be successful in attracting and retaining them. Our ability to maintain and expand our sales, product development and professional services teams will depend on our ability to recruit, train and retain top quality people with advanced skills who understand sales to, and the specific needs of, our target customers. For these reasons, we have experienced, and we expect to again experience in the future, challenges in hiring and retaining highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications for our business. In addition to hiring services personnel to meet our needs, we may also engage additional third-party consultants as contractors, which could have a negative impact on our financial results. If we are unable to hire or retain qualified personnel, or if newly hired personnel fail to develop the necessary skills or reach productivity slower than anticipated, it would be more difficult for us to sell our products and services, and we could experience a shortfall in revenue and fail to achieve our planned growth.\nFuture acquisitions may be difficult to integrate into our existing operations, may disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value, divert management\u2019s attention, or negatively affect our operating results.\nWe have acquired multiple businesses since our inception in 2000, including two in fiscal 2021. Future acquisitions could involve substantial investment of funds or financings by issuance of debt or equity securities and could result in one-time charges and expenses and have the potential to either dilute the interests of existing shareholders or result in the issuance or assumption of debt. Any such acquisition may not be successful in generating revenues, income or other returns to us, and the resources committed to such activities will not be available to us for other purposes. Moreover, if we are unable to access capital markets on acceptable terms or at all, we may not be able to consummate acquisitions, or may have to do so based upon less than optimal capital structure. Our inability to take advantage of growth opportunities for our business or to address risks associated with acquisitions or investments in businesses may negatively affect our operating results. Additionally, any impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets acquired in an acquisition or in an investment, or charges to earnings associated with any acquisition or investment activity, may materially reduce our earnings which, in turn, may have an adverse material effect on the price of our common stock.\nWe have issued preferred stock with rights senior to our common stock, and may issue additional preferred stock in the future, in order to consummate a merger or other transaction necessary to continue as a going concern.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation authorizes the issuance of up to 1.0 million shares of preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share, without shareholder approval and on terms established by our board of directors, of which 264,000 shares have been designated as Series A Preferred, 5,000 shares have been designated as Series B Preferred, 11,000 shares have been designated as Series C Preferred and 4,200 shares have been designated as Series D Preferred. We may issue additional shares of preferred stock in order to consummate a financing or other transaction, in lieu of the issuance of common stock. The rights and preferences of any such class or series of preferred stock would be established by our board of directors in its sole discretion and may have dividend, voting, liquidation and other rights and preferences that are senior to the rights of our common stock.\nWe have never paid dividends on our common stock and we do not anticipate paying dividends in the future.\nWe have never paid cash dividends and do not believe that we will pay any cash dividends on our common stock in the future. Since we have no plan to pay cash dividends, an investor would only realize income from their investment in our shares if there is an increase in the market price of our common stock, which is uncertain and unpredictable.\nWe are also subject to anti-takeover provisions under Delaware law, which could delay or prevent a change of control. Together these provisions may make the removal of management more difficult and may discourage transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our securities. Provisions in our amended and restated bylaws and Delaware law may have the effect of discouraging lawsuits against our directors and officers.\nOur amended and restated bylaws require that derivative actions brought in our name, actions against our directors, officers, other employees or stockholders for breach of fiduciary duty and other similar actions may be brought only in the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to the forum provisions in our amended and restated bylaws.\nThis choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or any of our directors, officers, other employees or stockholders, which may discourage lawsuits with respect to such claims. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in our amended and restated bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic could have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, and capital investments.\nIn 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic, and the virus continues to spread in areas where we operate and sell our services. The COVID-19 pandemic and similar issues in the future could have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, and capital investments. Several public health organizations have recommended, and some governments have implemented, certain measures to slow and limit the transmission of the virus, including shelter in place, social distancing ordinances, and business shutdowns. There is considerable uncertainty regarding the extent to which the COVID-19 outbreak will continue to spread, and the extent and duration of governmental and other measures implemented to try to limit the spread of the virus.\nThe pandemic and such preventive measures, or others required or that we may voluntarily put in place, may have a material adverse effect on our business for an indefinite period of time, such as the potential shut down of certain locations, decreased employee availability, increased claims or other expenses, potential border closures, and others. These disruptions and challenges may continue for an indefinite period of time and may also materially affect our future access to our sources of liquidity, particularly our cash flows from operations, financial condition, capitalization, and capital investments. Additionally, the effects of COVID-19 on the global economy could adversely affect our ability to access the capital and other financial markets, and if so, we may need to consider alternative sources of funding for some of our operations and for working capital, which may increase our cost of, as well as adversely impact our access to, capital. These uncertain economic conditions may also result in the inability of our customers to make payments to us, on a timely basis or at all.\nAlthough these disruptions may continue to occur, the long-term economic impact and near-term financial impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, including but not limited to, possible impairment, restructuring, and other charges, cannot be reliably quantified or estimated at this time due to the uncertainty of future developments.",

Most of the Company\u2019s shares of common stock are held in street name through one or more nominees.\nRecent Sales of Unregistered Securities; Use of Proceeds From Registered Securities\nThe following summarizes all sales of our unregistered securities during the year ended September 30, 2021 for which more information is disclosed on our Form 8-Ks. The securities in the below-referenced transactions were (i) issued without registration and (ii) were subject to restrictions under the Securities Act and the securities laws of certain states, in reliance on the private offering exemptions contained in Sections 4(a)(2), 4(a)(6) and/or 3(b) of the Securities Act and on Regulation D promulgated there under, and in reliance on similar exemptions under applicable state laws as transactions not involving a public offering. Unless stated otherwise, no placement or underwriting fees were paid in connection with these transactions.\n(1)\nOn May 14, 2021, the Company offered and sold, in a registered direct offering, a total of 1,060,000 shares of its common stock at a price of $2.28 per share. On the same day, the Company entered into securities purchase agreements with certain institutional investors in connection with a private placement of 2,700 shares of newly designated Series D Convertible Preferred Stock at a price of $1,000 per share and warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 592,105 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $2.51 per share. Joseph Gunnar & Company, LLC acted as lead placement agent for the offering and Taglich Brothers, Inc. acted as co-placement agent for the offering. The Company issued to the placement agents common stock purchase warrants to purchase an aggregate of 179,536 shares of common stock. The warrants have a term of five years from the commencement of sales and an exercise price of $2.85 per share. The aggregate proceeds, net of cash paid for certain fees due to placement agents and transaction related expenses, of these two transactions that occurred on the same day was $4.6 million. As of September 30, 2021, all 2,700 shares of Series D Preferred Stock were converted to 1,184,211 common shares.\n(2)\nOn May 28, 2021, the Company issued 1,500 shares of the newly designated Series D Convertible Preferred Stock as a component of the purchase price for the acquisition of Hawk Search.

Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThis section contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of a variety of factors and risks, including the impact of any weakness in the U.S. and international economies on our business, our inability to manage our future growth effectively or profitably, fluctuations in our revenue and quarterly results, our license renewal rate, the impact of competition and our ability to maintain margins or market share, the limited market for our common stock, the ability to maintain our listing on the NASDAQ Capital Market, the volatility of the market price of our common stock, the ability to raise capital, the performance of our products, our ability to respond to rapidly evolving technology and customer requirements, our ability to protect our proprietary technology, the security of our software and response to cyber security risks, our ability to meet our financial obligations and commitments, our dependence on our management team and key personnel, our ability to hire and retain future key personnel, our ability to maintain an effective system of internal controls, or our ability to respond to government regulations.

The total purchase price of approximately $2.4 million consisted of (1) $285 thousand in cash paid at closing or in close proximity to closing, (2) $376 thousand of deferred cash payable in installments post-closing, (3) $352 thousand seller note issued to one of the selling shareholders, and (4) amounts payable to one selling shareholder as consideration for assistance with certain matters related to the acquisition for a period of one year from the closing date of the acquisition. The Woorank Purchase Agreement also provides for additional consideration, in the event of achievement of certain revenue targets and operational goals, to the selling shareholders pursuant to three separate earn-out provisions. The acquisition date fair value of contingent consideration was $1.3 million.

The Hawk Purchase Agreement also provides for additional consideration, in the event of achievement of certain revenue targets, to the selling shareholders as an additional earn-out, payable no later than December 31, 2022. The acquisition date fair value of contingent consideration was approximately $2.2 million.\nCustomer Information\nWe currently have over 150,000 active customers. For the year ended September 30, 2021, no customers exceeded 10% of the Company\u2019s total revenue.

Loss from operations for fiscal 2021 was $1.2 million, compared with loss from operations of $1.6 million for fiscal 2020. We had a net loss for fiscal 2021 of $6.7 million, which included government grant income related to Paycheck Protection Program (\u201cPPP\u201d) loan forgiveness of $88 thousand, a loss of approximately $5.9 million as a result of the change in fair value of certain warrant liabilities and a $1.2 million discrete benefit in taxes, compared with net income of $326 thousand, which included government grant income related to PPP loan forgiveness of $960 thousand and a gain of approximately $1.0 million as a result of the change in fair value of certain warrant liabilities for fiscal 2020. Basic and diluted net loss per share calculation attributable to common shareholders for fiscal 2021 was ($1.47) compared with the equivalent basic net loss per share attributable to common shareholders of ($0.59) for fiscal 2020.\n(in thousands)\nYears Ended\nSeptember 30,\n$\n%\nChange\nChange\nNet Revenue\nDigital engagement services\n$ 3,296\n$ 3,409\n$ (113 )\n(3 )%\n% of total net revenue\n%\n%\nSubscription and perpetual licenses\n9,963\n7,498\n2,465\n%\n% of total net revenue\n%\n%\nTotal net revenue\n13,259\n10,907\n2,352\n%\nCost of revenue\nDigital engagement services\n1,743\n1,831\n(88 )\n(5 )%\n% of digital engagement services revenue\n%\n%\nSubscription and perpetual licenses\n2,790\n2,676\n%\n% of subscription and perpetual revenue\n%\n%\nTotal cost of revenue\n4,533\n4,507\n%\nGross profit\n8,726\n6,400\n2,326\n%\nGross profit margin\n%\n%\nOperating expenses\nSales and marketing\n2,726\n2,614\n%\n% of total revenue\n%\n%\nGeneral and administrative\n2,359\n2,455\n(96 )\n(4 )%\n% of total revenue%\n%\n%\nResearch and development\n2,387\n1,641\n%\n% of total revenue\n%\n%\nDepreciation and amortization\n1,202\n%\n% of total revenue\n%\n%\nRestructuring and acquisition related expenses\n1,235\n%\n% of total revenue\n%\n%\nTotal operating expenses\n9,909\n8,044\n1,865\n%\nLoss from operations\n(1,183 )\n(1,644 )\n(28 )%\nInterest expense and other, net\n(883 )\n(7 )\n(876 )\n12,514 %\nGovernment grant income\n(872 )\n(91 )%\nChange in fair value of warrant liabilities\n(5,885 )\n1,028\n(6,913 )\n(672 )%\nIncome (loss) before income taxes\n(7,863 )\n(8,200 )\n(2,433 )%\nProvision for (benefit from) income taxes\n(1,174 )\n(1,185 )\n(10,773 )%\nNet income/(loss)\n$ (6,689 )\n$\n$ (7,015 )\n(2,152 )%\nNon-GAAP Measure:\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$ 1,839\n$ (116 )\n$ 1,955\n(1,685 )%\nRevenue\nOur revenue is derived from two sources: (i) digital engagement services and (ii) subscription and perpetual licenses.\nDigital Engagement Services\nDigital engagement services revenue is comprised of Bridgeline Unbound implementation and retainer-related services. Total revenue from digital engagement services decreased $113 thousand, or 3%, to $3.3 million in fiscal 2021 from $3.4 million in fiscal 2020. Digital engagement services revenue as a percentage of total revenue decreased to 25% in fiscal 2021 from 31% in fiscal 2020. The decrease compared to the prior period is primarily due to a decrease in new service engagements partially offset by $325 thousand related to revenues from the Company\u2019s fiscal 2021 acquisitions.\nSubscription and Perpetual Licenses\nRevenue from subscription (SaaS) and perpetual licenses increased $2.5 million, or 33%, to $10.0 million in fiscal 2021 from $7.5 million in fiscal 2020. The increase compared to the prior period is primarily due to significant multi-year license renewals across our diverse portfolio of Fortune 500 companies and the inclusion of revenue of $2.6 million from the Company\u2019s fiscal 2021 acquisitions. Subscription and perpetual license revenue as a percentage of total revenue increased to 75% in fiscal 2021 from 69% in fiscal 2020. The increase as a percentage of total revenue is attributable to the additional increase in subscription and perpetual licenses during the period compared to digital services revenue.\nCost of Revenue\nTotal cost of revenue for fiscal 2021 increased $26 thousand, or 1%, to $4.5 million from $4.5 million. The increase for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 is primarily attributable to decreases in headcount and the use of third-party consultants.\nCost of Digital Engagement Services\nCost of digital engagement services decreased $88 thousand, or 5%, to $1.7 million in fiscal 2021 from $1.8 million in fiscal 2020. The decrease in cost of digital engagement services in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 is primarily due to the allocation of support team and third-party subcontractor costs and additional costs related to the fiscal 2021 business acquisitions. The cost of total digital engagement services as a percentage of total digital engagement services revenue decreased to 53% in fiscal 2021 from 54% in fiscal 2020. The decrease as a percentage of revenues in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 is primarily due to the overall decrease in digital engagement services revenue and costs incurred related to fiscal 2021 business acquisitions, as noted above.\nCost of Subscription and Perpetual License\nCost of subscription and perpetual licenses increased $114 thousand, or 4%, to $2.8 million in fiscal 2021 compared to $2.7 million in fiscal 2020. The increase in cost of subscription and perpetual licenses in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 is primarily due to a reduction within our fixed costs to operate our cloud-based hosting model with Amazon Web Services and variable internal support costs. The cost of subscription and perpetual licenses as a percentage of subscription and perpetual license revenue decreased to 28% in fiscal 2021 from 36% in fiscal 2020. The decrease as a percentage of revenues is primarily due to the overall increases in subscription and perpetual license revenue.\nGross Profit\nGross profit increased $2.3 million, or 36%, in fiscal 2021 to $8.7 million compared to $6.4 million in fiscal 2020.The gross profit margin increased to 66% for fiscal 2021 compared to 59% for fiscal 2020. The increase in the gross profit margin for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 is primarily attributable to decreases in headcount and the use of third-party consultants and an increase in the proportion of license revenue, which is generally associated with higher margins, to digital engagement service revenue.\nOperating Expenses\nSales and Marketing Expenses\nSales and marketing expenses increased $112 thousand, or 4%, to $2.7 million in fiscal 2021 from $2.6 million in fiscal 2020. Sales and marketing expense as a percentage of total revenue decreased to 21% in fiscal 2021 compared to 24% in fiscal 2020. The increase compared to the prior period is primarily attributable to the allocation of third-party subcontractor and partner costs and additional costs related to the fiscal 2021 business acquisitions. The decrease as a percentage of revenues is primarily due to the overall increase in revenues.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased $96 thousand, or 4%, to $2.4 million in fiscal 2021 from $2.5 million in fiscal 2020. General and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue decreased to 18% in fiscal 2021 compared to 23% in fiscal 2020. These net decreases compared to the prior period are primarily attributable to an overall decrease in support headcount and personnel expenses offset by increases associated with business acquisitions in fiscal 2021.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expense increased $746 thousand, or 45%, to $2.4 million in fiscal 2021 from $1.6 million in fiscal 2020. Research and development expense as a percentage of total revenue increased to 18% in fiscal 2021 compared to 15% for fiscal 2020. These increases compared to the prior period are primarily attributable to the allocation of support team and third-party subcontractor costs and additional research and development expenses related to the business acquisitions in fiscal 2021.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased by $234 thousand, or 24%, to $1.2 million in fiscal 2021 from $968 thousand in fiscal 2020. Depreciation and amortization as a percentage of total revenue remained consistent at 9% in fiscal 2021 and 2020. The increase compared to the prior period is primarily due to amortization of intangible assets resulting from acquisitions completed during fiscal 2021.\nRestructuring and Acquisition Related Expenses\nIn connection with the acquisition of businesses completed during the fiscal 2021 second and third quarters, the Company incurred acquisition related legal and investment banking expenses of $1.2 million during fiscal 2021.\nDuring fiscal 2020, the Company recognized $366 thousand related to a reduction in the workforce in its U.S. and Canada operations aimed at improving efficiencies by combining functions, certain responsibilities and eliminating redundancies, which resulted in a reduction of 15 positions.\nLoss from Operations\nThe loss from operations was $1.2 million for fiscal 2021 compared to a loss from operations of $1.6 million for fiscal 2020, a decrease of $461 thousand or 28%.\nInterest expense and other, net; Government grant income; Change in fair value of warrant liabilities\nThe Company recognized a loss related to the change in fair value of warrant liabilities of $5.9 million, for the year ended September 30, 2021 and a gain related to the change in fair value of warrant liabilities of $1.0 million for the year ended September 30, 2020, respectively.\nDuring the years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, the Company recognized government grant income of $88 thousand and $960 thousand, respectively, associated with proceeds received under the PPP deemed probable to be forgiven based on the actual expenditures from the date proceeds were received by the Company through September 30, 2020. The Company applied for full PPP loan forgiveness on March 29, 2021 and received approval from the U.S. Small Business Administration\u2019s (the \u201cSBA\u201d) in August 2021. The Company classifies unexpended loan proceeds on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as a current or noncurrent liability based on the contractual maturities of the underlying loan agreement. During the first quarter of fiscal 2021, the remaining loan proceeds were expended on qualified expenses and as a result, the Company recognized $88 thousand of government grant income.\nDuring the years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, interest expense and other net, was $883 thousand and $7 thousand, respectively and included non-recurring non-operating costs.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe provision for (benefit from) income taxes was ($1.2) million for fiscal 2021 and $11 thousand for fiscal 2020, respectively. Income tax expense consists of estimated liability for federal and state income taxes owed by the Company. Net operating loss (\u201cNOL\u201d) carryforwards are estimated to be sufficient to offset any potential taxable income for all periods presented. A valuation allowance is established if it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. The Company maintains a valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets. As of September 30, 2021 and 2020, the Company had a full valuation allowance on its net deferred tax assets.\nThe Federal NOL carryforward is approximately $32 million as of September 30, 2021 in which the 20-year carryforward expires on various dates through 2037 and the remaining NOL carryforward is indefinite. Net operating losses incurred after December 31, 2017 carry forward indefinitely. Internal Revenue Code Section 382 places certain limitations on the amount of taxable income that can be offset by NOL carryforwards after a change in control of a loss corporation. Generally, after a change in control, a loss corporation cannot deduct NOL carryforwards in excess of the Section 382 limitation. Due to these \u201cchange of ownership\u201d provisions, utilization of NOL carryforwards may be subject to an annual limitation on utilization against taxable income in future periods. The Company has not performed a Section 382 analysis. However, if performed, Section 382 may be found to limit potential future utilization of our NOL carryforwards. The Company also has approximately $30 million in state NOLs which expire on various dates through 2039.\nThe acquisition of Hawk Search, Inc. during the third quarter of fiscal 2021 resulted in the recognition of deferred tax liabilities of approximately $1.1 million, related to intangible assets. Prior to the business combination, the Company had a full valuation allowance on its net deferred tax assets. The deferred tax liabilities generated from the business combination netted against the Company\u2019s pre-existing deferred tax assets. Consequently, the impact of such resulted in the release of $1.1 million of the pre-existing valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets and corresponding deferred tax benefit recognized during fiscal 2021.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nWe also measure our performance based on a non-GAAP (\u201cGenerally Accepted Accounting Principles\u201d) measurement of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation expense, impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, non-cash warrant related expenses, other income and expenses, change in fair value of derivative instruments, change in fair value of contingent consideration, and restructuring and acquisition related charges (\u201cAdjusted EBITDA\u201d).\nWe believe this non-GAAP financial measure of Adjusted EBITDA is useful to management and investors in evaluating our operating performance for the periods presented and provides a tool for evaluating our ongoing operations.\nAdjusted EBITDA, however, is not a measure of operating performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d) and should not be considered as an alternative or substitute for U.S. GAAP profitability measures such as (i) income from operations and net income, or (ii) cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, both as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA as an operating performance measure has material limitations because it excludes the financial statement impact of income taxes, net interest expense, amortization of intangibles, depreciation, goodwill impairment, restructuring charges, acquisition related expenses, loss on disposal of assets, other amortization, changes in fair value of warrant liabilities, changes in fair value of contingent consideration and stock-based compensation, and therefore does not represent an accurate measure of profitability. As a result, Adjusted EBITDA should be evaluated in conjunction with net income (loss) for a complete analysis of our profitability, as net income (loss) includes the financial statement impact of these items and is the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP operating performance measure to Adjusted EBITDA. Our definition of Adjusted EBITDA may also differ from and therefore may not be comparable with similarly titled measures used by other companies, thereby limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. Because of the limitations that Adjusted EBITDA has as an analytical tool, investors should not consider it in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our operating results as reported under U.S. GAAP.\nThe following table reconciles net income (loss) (which is the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP operating performance measure) to Adjusted EBITDA:\nYears Ended\nSeptember 30,\nNet income (loss)\n$ (6,689 )\n$\nProvision for income tax\n(1,174 )\nInterest expense and other, net\nGovernment grant income\n(88 )\n(960 )\nChange in fair value of warrants\n5,885\n(1,028 )\nAmortization of intangible assets\n1,130\nDepreciation\nRestructuring and acquisition related charges\n1,235\nOther amortization\nStock-based compensation\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$ 1,442\n$ (116 )\nAdjusted EBITDA increased year over year, which is primarily attributable to increases in revenues due to business acquisitions that occurred in fiscal 2021 and cost control measures.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCash Flows\nOperating Activities\nCash used in operating activities was $989 thousand during fiscal 2021 compared to cash used in operating activities of $498 thousand during fiscal 2020. The change in cash used in operating activities compared to the prior period was primarily due to an increase in loss from operations partially offset by changes in non-cash items, including changes in fair value of warrant liabilities, and changes to accounts payable and accrued liabilities and deferred revenue.\nInvesting Activities\nCash used in investing activities was $4.5 million during fiscal 2021 and we did not have any cash flows from investing activities during fiscal 2020. Cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2021 was primarily related to net cash paid for the purchase of businesses during the second and third fiscal quarters of 2021.\nFinancing Activities\nCash provided by financing activities was $13.5 million during fiscal 2021 compared with $1.0 million during fiscal 2020. Cash provided by financing activities was primarily attributable to cash proceeds of approximately $14.3 million related to the issuance of common stock, Series D Convertible Preferred Stock and stock options and warrant exercises partially offset by re-payments of contingent consideration and long-term debt assumed in connection with the acquisition of a business. Cash provided by financing activities for fiscal 2020 was attributable to the proceeds received under the PPP.\nCapital Resources and Liquidity Outlook\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of novel coronavirus disease (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) as a pandemic. We expect our operations in all locations to be affected as the virus continues to proliferate. We have adjusted certain aspects of our operations to protect employees and customers while still meeting customers\u2019 needs for vital technology. We will continue to monitor the situation closely and it is possible that we will implement further measures. In light of the uncertainty as to the severity and duration of the pandemic, the impact on our revenue, profitability and financial position is uncertain at this time.\nIn July 2021, the Company received approximately $5.8 million in cash relating the issuance of 1,543,779 shares of its common stock upon exercise of Series A Warrants, originally issued in March 2019, with an exercise price of $4.00 per share.\nOn May 14, 2021, the Company offered and sold, in a registered direct offering, a total of 1,060,000 shares of its common stock par value $0.001 per share, at a price of $2.28 per share. On the same day, the Company entered into securities purchase agreements with certain institutional investors in connection with a private placement of 2,700 shares of newly designated Series D Convertible Preferred Stock at a price of $1,000 per share and warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 592,105 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $2.51 per share. The aggregate proceeds, net of cash paid for certain fees due to placement agents and transaction-related expenses, of these two transactions that occurred on the same day was $4.6 million.\nOn February 4, 2021, the Company offered and sold a total of 880,000 shares of its common stock, par value $0.001 per share, to certain institutional and accredited investors at a public offering price of $3.10 per share in a registered direct offering. The aggregate proceeds from this transaction, net of certain fees due to placement agents and transaction expenses, was approximately $2.5 million.\nIn connection with an acquisition of a business completed during the 2021 fiscal year third quarter (Hawk Search), the Company recognized an obligation for a deferred payment representing a portion of the purchase price of $2.0 million payable on or before December 31, 2021 and contingent earn-out payments of $2.2 million which are payable, no later than December 31, 2022, in the event of achievement of certain revenue targets and operational goals.\nIn connection with an acquisition of a business completed during the 2021 fiscal year second quarter (Woorank), the Company (1) assumed the outstanding long-term debt obligations of $2.1 million of the acquiree of which $732 thousand is payable over the next twelve months, (2) issued a seller note of $352 thousand to one of the selling shareholders payable over a five-year period, (3) deferred a portion of the purchase price of $376 thousand which is expected to be paid within the next twelve months, and (4) recognized contingent earn-out payments of $1.3 million which are payable in the event of achievement of certain revenue targets and operational goals.\nIn prior years, the Company incurred operating losses and used cash to fund operations, develop new products, and build infrastructure. During its 2020 fiscal year, the Company executed an operating plan that reduced operating expenses and headcount. The Company continued to maintain tight control over discretionary spending for the 2021 fiscal year. The Company believes that future revenues and cash flows will supplement its working capital and it has an appropriate cost structure to support future revenue growth.\nOn April 17, 2020, the Company entered into a loan with an aggregate principal amount of $1,047,500, pursuant to the PPP. The Company performed initial calculations for PPP loan forgiveness according to the terms and conditions of the SBA Loan Forgiveness Application (Revised June 16, 2020) and, based on such calculations, expected that the PPP loan will be forgiven in full based on usage of related proceeds over a period less than 24 weeks. In addition, the Company determined it was probable the Company will meet all the conditions of the PPP loan forgiveness. The Company applied for full PPP loan forgiveness on March 29, 2021, and received approval from the SBA in August 2021. The Company classifies unexpended loan proceeds on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as a current or noncurrent liability based on the contractual maturities of the underlying loan agreement. During the first quarter of fiscal 2021, the remaining loan proceeds were expended on qualified expenses and as a result, the Company recognized $88 thousand as government grant income.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAt this time, the Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, financings or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons, other than our operating leases.\nContractual Obligations\nWe lease all of our office locations. The gross obligations for operating leases and subleases is $550 thousand and $236 thousand, respectively, of which $185 thousand and $101 thousand is expected in the next twelve months. Debt payments on the Company\u2019s various debt obligations total $1.9 million of which $732 thousand is expected to be paid in the next twelve months. Contingent consideration payments total $3.4 million of which $1.2 million is expected to be paid in the next twelve months. Deferred purchase price payments total $2.4 million of which $2.2 million is expected to be paid in the next twelve months.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThese critical accounting policies and estimates by our management should be read in conjunction with Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Consolidated Financial Statements that were prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses in the reporting periods. We regularly make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities. The most significant estimates included in our consolidated financial statements are the valuation of accounts receivable and long-term assets, including intangibles, goodwill and deferred tax assets, stock-based compensation, amounts of revenue to be recognized on service contracts in progress, unbilled receivables, and deferred revenue. We base our estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. The actual results experienced by us may differ materially and adversely from our estimates. To the extent there are material differences between our estimates and the actual results, our future results of operations will be affected.\nWe consider the following accounting policies to be both those most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and those that require the most subjective judgment:\n\u25cf\nRevenue recognition;\n\u25cf\nAllowance for doubtful accounts;\n\u25cf\nAccounting for goodwill and other intangible assets;\n\u25cf\nAccounting for business combinations;\n\u25cf\nAccounting for Payroll Protection Program; and\n\u25cf\nAccounting for stock-based compensation.\nRevenue Recognition\nOverview\nThe Company derives its revenue from two sources: (i) Software Licenses, which are comprised of subscription fees (\u201cSaaS\u201d), perpetual software licenses, and maintenance for post-customer support (\u201cPCS\u201d) on perpetual licenses, and (ii) Digital Engagement Services, which are professional services to implement our products such as web development, digital strategy, information architecture and usability engineering search. Customers who license the software on a subscription basis, which can be described as \u201cSoftware as a Service\u201d or \u201cSaaS\u201d, do not take possession of the software.\nRevenue is recognized when control of these services is transferred to the Company\u2019s customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those services. If the consideration promised in a contract includes a variable amount, for example, overage fees, contingent fees or service level penalties, the Company includes an estimate of the amount it expects to receive for the total transaction price if it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur. The Company\u2019s subscription service arrangements are non-cancelable and do not contain refund-type provisions. Revenue is reported net of applicable sales and use tax.\nThe Company recognizes revenue from contracts with customers using a five-step model, which is described below:\n1.\nIdentify the customer contract;\n2.\nIdentify performance obligations that are distinct;\n3.\nDetermine the transaction price;\n4.\nAllocate the transaction price to the distinct performance obligations; and\n5.\nRecognize revenue as the performance obligations are satisfied.\nIdentify the customer contract\nA customer contract is generally identified when there is approval and commitment from both the Company and its customer, the rights have been identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability and consideration is probable.\nIdentify performance obligations that are distinct\nA performance obligation is a promise to provide a distinct good or service or a series of distinct goods or services. A good or service that is promised to a customer is distinct if the customer can benefit from the good or service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available to the customer, and the Company\u2019s promise to transfer the good or service to the customer is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract.\nDetermine the transaction price\nThe transaction price is the amount of consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to a customer, excluding sales taxes that are collected on behalf of government agencies.\nAllocate the transaction price to distinct performance obligations\nThe transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation based on the relative standalone selling prices (\u201cSSP\u201d) of the goods or services being provided to the customer. The Company determines the SSP of its goods and services based upon the historical average sales prices for each type of software license and professional services sold.\nRecognize revenue as the performance obligations are satisfied\nRevenue is recognized when or as control of the promised goods or services is transferred to customers. Revenue from SaaS licenses is recognized ratably over the subscription period beginning on the date the license is made available to customers. Most subscription contracts are three-year terms. Customers who license the software on a perpetual basis receive rights to use the software for an indefinite time period and an option to purchase post-customer support (\u201cPCS\u201d). PCS revenue is recognized ratably on a straight-line basis over the period of performance and the perpetual license is recognized upon delivery. The Company also offers hosting services for those customers who purchase a perpetual license and do not want to run the software in their environment. Revenue from hosting is recognized ratably over the service period, ranging from one to three-year terms. The Company recognizes revenue from professional services as the services are provided.\nCustomer Payment Terms\nPayment terms with customers typically require payment 30 days from invoice date. Payment terms may vary by customer but generally do not exceed 45 days from invoice date. Invoicing for digital engagement services are either monthly or upon achievement of milestones and payment terms for such billings are within the standard terms described above. Invoices for subscriptions and hosting are typically issued monthly and are generally due in the month of service. The Company\u2019s subscription and hosting agreements provide for refunds when service is interrupted for an extended period of time and are reserved for in the month in which they occur, if necessary.\nOur digital engagement services agreements with customers do not provide for any refunds for services or products and therefore no specific reserve for such is maintained. In the infrequent instances where customers raise a concern over delivered products or services, we have endeavored to remedy the concern and all costs related to such matters have been insignificant in all periods presented.\nWarranty\nCertain arrangements include a warranty period, which is generally 30 days from the completion of work. In hosting arrangements, we provide warranties of up-time reliability. We continue to monitor the conditions that are subject to the warranties to identify if a warranty claim may arise. If we determine that a warranty claim is probable, then any related cost to satisfy the warranty obligation is estimated and accrued. Warranty claims to date have been immaterial.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nWe maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts which represents estimated losses resulting from the inability, failure or refusal of our clients to make required payments.\nWe analyze historical percentages of uncollectible accounts and changes in payment history when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts. We use an internal collection effort, which may include our sales and services groups as we deem appropriate. Although we believe that our allowances are adequate, if the financial condition of our clients deteriorates, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, or if we underestimate the allowances required, additional allowances may be necessary, resulting in increased expense in the period in which such determination is made.\nAccounting for Goodwill and Intangible Assets\nGoodwill is tested for impairment annually during the fourth quarter of every fiscal year and more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. The purpose of an impairment test is to identify any potential impairment by comparing the carrying value of a reporting unit including goodwill to its fair value. An impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit\u2019s fair value; however, the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.\nFactors that could lead to a future impairment include material uncertainties such as operational, economic and competitive factors specific to the key assumptions underlying the fair value estimate we use in our impairment testing that have a reasonable possibility of changing. This could include a significant reduction in projected revenues, a deterioration of projected financial performance, future acquisitions and/or mergers, and a decline in our market value as a result of a significant decline in our stock price.\nAccounting for Business Combinations\nThe Company allocates the amount it pays for each acquisition to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values at the date of acquisition, including identifiable intangible assets which arise from a contractual or legal right or are separable from goodwill. The Company bases the fair value of identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination on detailed valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management, which consider management\u2019s best estimates of inputs and assumptions that a market participant would use. The Company allocates any excess purchase price that exceeds the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired to goodwill. The use of alternative valuation assumptions, including estimated growth rates, cash flows and discounts rates and estimated useful lives could result in different purchase price allocations and amortization expense in current and future periods. Transaction costs associated with these acquisitions are expensed as incurred through general and administrative expense on the consolidated statements of operations. In those circumstances where an acquisition involves a contingent consideration arrangement, the Company recognizes a liability equal to the fair value of the contingent payments expected to be made as of the acquisition date. The Company re-measures this liability each reporting period and records changes in the fair value through income (loss) before income taxes within the consolidated statements of operations.\nAccounting for Payroll Protection Program\nU.S. GAAP does not contain authoritative accounting standards for forgivable loans provided by governmental entities to a for-profit entity. Absent authoritative accounting standards, interpretative guidance issued and commonly applied by financial statement preparers allows for the selection of accounting policies amongst acceptable alternatives. Based on the facts and circumstances, the Company determined it most appropriate to account for the PPP loan proceeds as an in-substance government grant by analogy to International Accounting Standards 20 (\u201cIAS 20\u201d), Accounting for Government Grants and Disclosure of Government Assistance. Under the provisions of IAS 20, \u201ca forgivable loan from a government is treated as a government grant when there is reasonable assurance that the entity will meet the terms for forgiveness of the loan.\u201d IAS 20 does not define \u201creasonable assurance\u201d; however, based on certain interpretations, it is analogous to \u201cprobable\u201d as defined in Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) ASC 450-20-20 under U.S. GAAP, which is the definition the Company has applied to its expectations of PPP loan forgiveness. Under IAS 20, government grants are recognized in earnings on a systematic basis over the periods in which the Company recognizes costs for which the grant is intended to compensate (i.e. qualified expenses). Further, IAS 20 permits for the recognition in earnings either separately under a general heading such as other income, or as a reduction of the related expenses. The Company has elected to recognize government grant income separately within other income to present a clearer distinction in its consolidated financial statements between its operating income and the amount of net income resulting from the PPP loan and subsequent expected forgiveness. The Company believes this presentation method promotes greater comparability amongst all periods presented.\nAccounting for Stock-Based Compensation\nAt September 30, 2021, we maintained two stock-based compensation plans, one of which has expired but still contains vested and unvested stock options. The two plans are more fully described in Note 12 of these consolidated financial statements.\nThe Company accounts for stock-based compensation awards in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation-Stock Topic of the Codification. Share-based payments (to the extent they are compensatory) are recognized in our consolidated statements of operations based on their fair values.\nWe recognize stock-based compensation expense for share-based payments issued or assumed after October 1, 2006 that are expected to vest on a straight-line basis over the service period of the award, which is generally three years. We recognize the fair value of the unvested portion of share-based payments granted prior to October 1, 2006 over the remaining service period, net of estimated forfeitures. In determining whether an award is expected to vest, we use an estimated, forward-looking forfeiture rate based upon our historical forfeiture rate and reduce the expense over the recognition period. Estimated forfeiture rates are updated for actual forfeitures quarterly. We also consider, each quarter, whether there have been any significant changes in facts and circumstances that would affect our forfeiture rate. Although we estimate forfeitures based on historical experience, actual forfeitures in the future may differ. In addition, to the extent our actual forfeitures are different than our estimates, we record a true-up for the difference in the period that the awards vest, and such true-ups could materially affect our operating results.\nWe estimate the fair value of stock options using the Black-Scholes-Merton option valuation model. The fair value of an award is affected by our stock price on the date of grant as well as other assumptions, including the estimated volatility of our stock price over the term of the awards and the estimated period of time that we expect employees to hold their stock options. The risk-free interest rate assumption we use is based upon United States Treasury interest rates appropriate for the expected life of the awards. We use the historical volatility of our publicly traded options in order to estimate future stock price trends. In order to determine the estimated period of time that we expect employees to hold their stock options, we use historical trends of employee turnovers. Our expected dividend rate is zero since we do not currently pay cash dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate doing so in the foreseeable future. The aforementioned inputs entered into the option valuation model we use to fair value our stock awards are subjective estimates and changes to these estimates will cause the fair value of our stock awards and related stock-based compensation expense we record to vary.\nWe record deferred tax assets for stock-based awards that result in deductions on our income tax returns, based on the amount of stock-based compensation recognized and the statutory tax rate in the jurisdiction in which we will receive a tax deduction.",

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Shareholders and Board of Directors\nBridgeline Digital, Inc.\nOpinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Bridgeline Digital, Inc. and Subsidiaries (the \u201cCompany\u201d) as of September 30, 2021, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), stockholders\u2019 equity and cash flows for the year ended September 30, 2021, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the \u201cconsolidated financial statements\u201d). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year ended September 30, 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company\u2019s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nBusiness Combinations - Acquisitions of Woorank SRL and Hawk Search, Inc.\nAs described in Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company completed acquisitions of (1) Woorank SRL on March 1, 2021, for purchase consideration of approximately $2.4 million and (2) Hawk Search, Inc. on May 28, 2021 for purchase consideration of approximately $9.9 million. The purchase price allocations resulted in the Company recording $6.3 million of intangible assets and $3.5 million of contingent consideration payable, estimated at the acquisition date.\nThe Company accounted for both acquisitions under the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed have been recorded at their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. The fair value of intangible assets was determined based on valuations using a discounted cash flow model, which requires significant estimates and assumptions, including estimating future revenues and costs. Management, with the assistance of an independent valuation expert, estimated the fair value of the intangible assets using the multi-period excess earnings method (customer relationships) and the relief from royalty methodology (tradename and developed technology). The fair value of contingent consideration payable was determined based on the probability of achievement of the revenue targets and operational goals, which requires significant estimates and assumptions, including estimating future revenues. Management, with the assistance of an independent valuation expert, estimated the fair value of the contingent consideration payable using the Monte Carlo simulation model.\nGiven the fair value determination of the intangible assets and contingent consideration payable requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions related to the forecasts of future cash flows and the selection of the discount rate, performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of these estimates and assumptions required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our valuation specialists.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included:\n\u25cf\nreviewing the purchase and sale agreements and evaluating the transactions to determine that both acquisitions met the requirements of a business combination, and our analysis of the initial allocation of the purchase price accounting as well as the determination of the balance sheet classification of each component of the transaction.\n\u25cf\nobtaining third party valuation reports to gain an understanding of the process and key assumptions for estimating the fair value of intangible assets and contingent consideration payable. We utilized our valuation specialists to evaluate the adequacy and appropriateness of the methodologies and assumptions used in developing the forecast and the discount rates used.\n\u25cf\nagreeing the underlying data used as part of the valuations to source documents, including the purchase and sale agreements, and assessing the reasonableness of management\u2019s forecasts of future cash flows by comparing the projections to historical results.\n\u25cf\nperforming independent shadow calculations to test the reasonableness and mathematical accuracy of the fair values concluded on by the Company.\n\u25cf\nevaluating whether the estimated future cash flows were consistent with projections used by the Company, as well as evidence obtained in other areas of the audit.\nFurthermore, we assessed the appropriateness of the disclosures in the consolidated financial statements.\nDerivative Instruments\nAs described in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements, in May 2021, the Company offered and sold, in a registered direct offering, shares of its common stock and entered into a private placement which consisted of Series D Convertible Preferred Stock and warrants to purchase common stock upon conversion of the Series D Preferred Stock for aggregate gross proceeds of $5.1 million. The Company allocated the proceeds between equity instruments and derivative liabilities using the relative fair value approach. As described in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company classifies warrants on its Series A, C and D convertible preferred stock as liabilities that are subject to re-measurement on a quarterly basis. Management, with the assistance of an independent valuation expert, estimates the fair value of the warrant liabilities using Monte Carlo simulation and Black Scholes models, which take into consideration the volatilities of the Company and comparable public companies.\nGiven the determination of the fair values of equity instruments and derivative liabilities require management to make significant estimates and assumptions regarding the relevant valuation calculations, performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of these estimates and assumptions required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve professionals in our firm having the expertise in the valuation of financial instruments.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included:\n\u25cf\nevaluating management\u2019s assessment and the Company\u2019s accounting analysis as to the classification of equity instruments and derivative liabilities, including the determination of the balance sheet classification of each component of the transaction and identification of any derivatives included in the arrangements.\n\u25cf\nobtaining third party valuation reports to gain an understanding of management\u2019s key assumptions in determining the fair value of warrant liabilities and assessing the source information underlying the valuation assumptions.\n\u25cf\nwith the assistance of our valuation specialists, evaluating the methodologies and assumptions used to assess the Company\u2019s fair value of equity instruments and derivative liabilities, including the selection of the valuation methodology and other significant assumptions used by the Company.\n\u25cf\nperforming independent shadow calculations to test the reasonableness of the fair values for warrant liabilities concluded on by the Company\u2019s specialist. Such calculations assessed the mathematical accuracy of the valuation model and assessed the source information underlying the valuation assumptions used in the model to determine the fair value for the Series D issuance at inception and liability classified warrants on a quarterly basis.\n\u25cf\nassess the appropriateness of the disclosures in the consolidated financial statements.\n/s/ PKF O'Connor Davies, LLP\nPKF O'Connor Davies, LLP\nNew York, New York\nDecember 20, 2021\nWe have served as the Company\u2019s auditor since February 27, 2021.\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Shareholders and Board of Directors of\nBridgeline Digital, Inc.\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Bridgeline Digital, Inc. (the \u201cCompany\u201d) as of September 30, 2020, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income/(loss), stockholders\u2019 equity and cash flows for the year ended September 30, 2020, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the \u201cfinancial statements\u201d). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year ended September 30, 2020, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nExplanatory Paragraph - Going Concern\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As more fully described in Note 1, the Company has a significant working capital deficiency, has incurred significant losses and needs to raise additional funds to meet its obligations and sustain its operations. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 1. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (\"PCAOB\") and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.

As part of our audit we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation\nThe Company\u2019s fiscal year end is September 30th. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d) requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported periods. The most significant estimates included in these consolidated financial statements are the valuation of accounts receivable, including the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts, recognition and measurement of deferred revenues, fair value of contingent consideration and fair value measurements related to the valuation of warrants. The complexity of the estimation process and factors relating to assumptions, risks and uncertainties inherent with the use of the estimates affect the amount of revenue and related expenses reported in the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements. Internal and external factors can affect the Company\u2019s estimates. Actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe Company considers all highly liquid instruments with original maturity of three months or less from the date of purchase to be cash equivalents.\nThe Company\u2019s cash is maintained with what management believes to be high-credit quality financial institutions. At times, deposits held at these banks may exceed the insured limits. Management believes that the financial institutions that hold the Company\u2019s deposits are financially sound and have minimal credit risk. Risks associated with cash and cash equivalents are mitigated by the Company\u2019s investment policy, which limits the Company\u2019s investing of excess cash into only money market mutual funds.\nConcentration of Credit Risk, Significant Customers, and Off-Balance Sheet Risk\nFinancial instruments which potentially expose the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash, cash equivalents, and accounts receivable.\nThe Company extends credit to customers on an unsecured basis in the normal course of business. Management performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers\u2019 financial condition and limits the amount of credit when deemed necessary. Accounts receivable are carried at original invoice amount, less an estimate for doubtful accounts based on a review of all outstanding amounts.\nThe Company has no off-balance sheets risks such as foreign exchange contracts, interest rate swaps, option contracts or other foreign hedging agreements.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nThe Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. For all customers, the Company recognizes allowances for doubtful accounts based on the length of time that the receivables are past due, current business environment and its historical experience. If the financial condition of the Company\u2019s customers were to deteriorate, resulting in impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company derives its revenue from two sources: (i) Software Licenses, which are comprised of subscription fees (\u201cSaaS\u201d), perpetual software licenses, and maintenance for post-customer support (\u201cPCS\u201d) on perpetual licenses, and (ii) Digital Engagement Services, which are professional services to implement our products such as web development, digital strategy, information architecture and usability engineering search. Customers who license the software on a subscription basis, which can be described as \u201cSoftware as a Service\u201d or \u201cSaaS,\u201d do not take possession of the software.\nBRIDGELINE DIGITAL, INC.\nNOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(in thousands, except share and per share data)\nRevenue is recognized when control of these services is transferred to the Company\u2019s customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those services. If the consideration promised in a contract includes a variable amount, for example, overage fees, contingent fees or service level penalties, the Company includes an estimate of the amount it expects to receive for the total transaction price if it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur. The Company\u2019s subscription service arrangements are non-cancelable and do not contain refund-type provisions. Revenue is reported net of applicable sales and use tax.\nThe Company recognizes revenue from contracts with customers using a five-step model, which is described below:\n1.\nIdentify the customer contract;\n2.\nIdentify performance obligations that are distinct;\n3.\nDetermine the transaction price;\n4.\nAllocate the transaction price to the distinct performance obligations; and\n5.\nRecognize revenue as the performance obligations are satisfied.\nIdentify the customer contract\nA customer contract is generally identified when there is approval and commitment from both the Company and its customer, the rights have been identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability and consideration is probable.\nIdentify performance obligations that are distinct\nA performance obligation is a promise to provide a distinct good or service or a series of distinct goods or services. A good or service that is promised to a customer is distinct if the customer can benefit from the good or service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available to the customer, and the Company\u2019s promise to transfer the good or service to the customer is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract.\nDetermine the transaction price\nThe transaction price is the amount of consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to a customer, excluding sales taxes that are collected on behalf of government agencies.\nAllocate the transaction price to distinct performance obligations\nThe transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation based on the relative standalone selling prices (\u201cSSP\u201d) of the goods or services being provided to the customer. The Company determines the SSP of its goods and services based upon the historical average sales prices for each type of software license and professional services sold.\nRecognize revenue as the performance obligations are satisfied\nRevenue is recognized when or as control of the promised goods or services is transferred to customers. Revenue from SaaS licenses is recognized ratably over the subscription period beginning on the date the license is made available to customers. Most subscription contracts are three-year terms. Customers who license the software on a perpetual basis receive rights to use the software for an indefinite time period and an option to purchase post-customer support (\u201cPCS\u201d). PCS revenue is recognized ratably on a straight-line basis over the period of performance and the perpetual license is recognized upon delivery. The Company also offers hosting services for those customers who purchase a perpetual license and do not want to run the software in their environment. Revenue from hosting is recognized ratably over the service period, ranging from one to three-year terms. The Company recognizes revenue from professional services as the services are provided.\nDisaggregation of Revenue\nThe Company provides disaggregation of revenue based on geography and product groupings (see Note 14) as it believes this best depicts how the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors.\nBRIDGELINE DIGITAL, INC.\nNOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(in thousands, except share and per share data)\nCustomer Payment Terms\nPayment terms with customers typically require payment 30 days from invoice date. Payment terms may vary by customer but generally do not exceed 45 days from invoice date. Invoicing for digital engagement services is either monthly or upon achievement of milestones and payment terms for such billings are within the standard terms described above. Invoices for subscriptions and hosting are typically issued monthly and are generally due in the month of service.\nWarranty\nCertain arrangements include a warranty period, which is generally 30 days from the completion of work. In hosting arrangements, the Company provides warranties of up-time reliability. The Company continues to monitor the conditions that are subject to the warranties to identify if a warranty claim may arise. If it is determined that a warranty claim is probable, then any related cost to satisfy the warranty obligation is estimated and accrued. Warranty claims to date have been immaterial.\nProperty and Equipment\nThe components of property and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets (three to five years). Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the lesser of the estimated useful life of the asset or the lease term. Repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.\nInternal-Use Software\nCosts incurred in the preliminary stages of development were expensed as incurred. Once an application had reached the development stage, internal and external costs, if direct and incremental, were capitalized until the software was substantially complete and ready for its intended use. Capitalization ceased upon completion of all substantial testing. The Company also capitalized costs related to specific upgrades and enhancements when it was probable that the expenditures would result in additional functionality. Capitalized costs were recorded as part of equipment and improvements. Training costs were expensed as incurred. Internal use software was amortized on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life, generally three years.\nIn August 2018, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update (\u201cASU\u201d) No. 2018-15, which addresses a customer\u2019s accounting for implementation costs incurred in a cloud-computing arrangement that is a service contract. The effective date of this new standard for the Company was October 1, 2020. Under the new standard, customers will apply the same criteria for capitalizing implementation costs as they would for an arrangement that has a software license. As of October 1, 2020, the Company did not have significant implementation costs incurred in a cloud-computing arrangement that is a service contract and therefore upon adoption the impact of the new standard on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures was not material. All future implementation costs in such arrangements will be capitalized and amortized over the life of the arrangement, which may have a material impact in those future periods if such costs are material.\nResearch and Development and Software Development Costs\nCosts for research and development of a software product to sell, lease or otherwise market are charged to operations as incurred until technological feasibility has been established. Once technological feasibility has been established, certain software development costs incurred during the application development stage are eligible for capitalization. Based on the Company\u2019s software product development process, technological feasibility is established upon completion of a working model.\nSoftware development costs that are capitalized are amortized to cost of sales over the estimated useful life of the software, typically three years. Capitalization ceases when a product is available for general release to customers. Capitalization costs are included in other assets in the consolidated financial statements. The Company did not incur development costs during fiscal 2021 and 2020.\nIntangible Assets\nAll intangible assets have finite lives and are stated at cost, net of amortization. Amortization is computed over the estimated useful life of the related assets on a straight-line method as follows:\nDescription\nEstimated Useful Life (in years)\nTechnology\n3 - 5\nCustomer related\n3 - 10\nDomain and trade names\n1 - 15\nBRIDGELINE DIGITAL, INC.\nNOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(in thousands, except share and per share data)\nGoodwill\nThe carrying value of goodwill is not amortized, but is tested for impairment annually as of September 30, as well as on an interim basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a reporting unity may not be recoverable. An impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit\u2019s fair value. However, the impairment loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. Goodwill is assessed at the consolidated level as one reporting unit.\nValuation of Long-Lived Assets\nThe Company periodically reviews its long-lived assets, which consist primarily of property and equipment and intangible assets with finite lives, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may exceed their fair value. Recoverability of these assets is assessed using a number of factors, including operating results, business plans, budgets, economic projections and undiscounted cash flows.\nIn addition, the Company\u2019s evaluation considers non-financial data such as market trends, product development cycles and changes in management\u2019s market emphasis. For the definite-lived intangible asset impairment review, the carrying value of the intangible assets is compared against the estimated undiscounted cash flows to be generated over the remaining life of the intangible assets. To the extent that the undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying value, the fair value of the asset is determined. If such fair value is less than the current carrying value, the asset is written down to the estimated fair value. There were no impairments of goodwill or long-lived assets in fiscal 2021 or 2020.\nBusiness Combinations\nThe Company allocates the amount it pays for each acquisition to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values at the date of acquisition, including identifiable intangible assets which arise from a contractual or legal right or are separable from goodwill. The Company bases the fair value of identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination on detailed valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management, which consider management\u2019s best estimates of inputs and assumptions that a market participant would use. The Company allocates any excess purchase price that exceeds the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired to goodwill. The use of alternative valuation assumptions, including estimated growth rates, cash flows and discounts rates and estimated useful lives could result in different purchase price allocations and amortization expense in current and future periods. Transaction costs associated with these acquisitions are expensed as incurred through acquisition related expenses on the consolidated statements of operations. In those circumstances where an acquisition involves a contingent consideration arrangement, the Company recognizes a liability equal to the fair value of the contingent payments expected to be made as of the acquisition date. The Company re-measures this liability each reporting period and records changes in the fair value through income before income taxes within the consolidated statements of operations.\nForeign Currency\nThe Company determines the appropriate method of measuring assets and liabilities as to whether the method should be based on the functional currency of the entity in the environment in which it operates or the reporting currency of the Company, the U.S. dollar. The Company has determined that the functional currency of its foreign subsidiaries are the local currencies of their respective jurisdictions. Assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. Equity accounts are translated at historical rates, except for the change in retained earnings as a result of the income statement translation process. Revenue and expense items are translated into U.S. dollars at average exchange rates for the period. The adjustments are recorded as a separate component of stockholders\u2019 equity and are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The Company\u2019s foreign currency translation net gains (losses) for fiscal 2021 and 2020 were $28 and $(43), respectively. Transaction gains and losses related to monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a currency different from a subsidiary\u2019s functional currency are included in the consolidated statements of operations.\nSegment Information\nThe Company has one reportable segment.\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe Company accounts for stock-based compensation in the consolidated statements of operations based on the fair values of the awards on the date of grant on a straight-line basis over their vesting term. Compensation expense is recognized only for share-based payments expected to vest. The Company estimates forfeitures at the date of grant based on the Company\u2019s historical experience and future expectations.\nBRIDGELINE DIGITAL, INC.\nNOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(in thousands, except share and per share data)\nCommon Stock Purchase Warrants\nThe Company estimated the fair value of common stock warrants issued to non-employees using the binomial options pricing model. The Company evaluates common stock warrants as they are issued to determine whether they should be classified as an equity instrument or a liability. Those warrants that are classified as a liability are carried at fair value at each reporting date, with changes in their fair value recorded in change in fair value of warrant liabilities in the consolidated statements of operations.\nAdvertising Costs\nAdvertising costs are expensed when incurred. Such costs were $286 and $149 for fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nEmployee Benefits\nThe Company sponsors a contributory 401(k) plan allowing all full-time employees who meet prescribed service requirements to participate. The Company is not required to make matching contributions, although the plan provides for discretionary contributions by the Company. The Company made no contributions in either fiscal 2021 or fiscal 2020.\nIncome Taxes\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \u201cTax Act\u201d). The Tax Act made broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code that affected the Company\u2019s fiscal year ended September 30, 2018, including, but not limited to, reducing the U.S. federal corporate tax rate. For taxable years after December 31, 2017, the Tax Act reduced the federal corporate tax rate to 21 percent. The Tax Act repealed the Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax (\u201cAMT\u201d).\nThe Tax Act required the Company to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings of the Company's foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred for U.S. income taxes and created new taxes on the Company's foreign-sourced earnings. The Company determined that the repatriation tax was zero because the foreign subsidiary had no positive retained earnings, and no current income.\nOn March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (the \u201cCARES Act\u201d) was enacted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The CARES Act, among other things, contains modifications on the limitation of business interest for tax years beginning in 2019 and 2020, and permits net operating loss carryovers and carrybacks to offset 100% of taxable income for taxable years beginning before 2021. In addition, the CARES Act allows net operating losses incurred in 2018, 2019, and 2020 to be carried back to each of the five preceding taxable years to generate a refund of previously paid income taxes. These provisions of the CARES Act did not have a material effect on the Company\u2019s estimated effective tax rate.\nThe Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements and tax returns. Deferred income taxes are recognized based on temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are provided if based upon the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nThe Company provides for reserves for potential payments of taxes to various tax authorities related to uncertain tax positions. Reserves are based on a determination of whether and how much of a tax benefit taken by the Company in its tax filings or positions is \u201cmore likely than not\u201d to be realized following resolution of any uncertainty related to the tax benefit, assuming that the matter in question will be raised by the tax authorities. Interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions are included in the provision for benefit from income taxes.\nThe Company does not provide for U.S. income taxes on the undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries, which the Company considers to be permanent investments.\nNet Loss Per Share\nThe Company presents basic and diluted earnings per share information for its common stock. The Series D Preferred Stock was considered participating securities, as the security may participate in undistributed earnings with common stock. The holders of the Series D Preferred Stock are entitled to share in dividends, on an as-converted basis, if the holders of common stock were to receive dividends, other than dividends in the form of common stock. The Company is required to use the two-class method when computing earnings per share. The two-class method is an earnings allocation formula that determines earnings per share for each class of common stock and participating security according to dividends declared (or accumulated) and participation rights in undistributed earnings. In determining the amount of net earnings to allocate to common stockholders, earnings are allocated to both common and participating securities based on their respective weighted-average shares outstanding for the period. Securities are deemed not to be participating in losses if there is no obligation to fund such losses. The Series D Preferred Stock does not participate in losses, and as a result, the Company does not allocate losses to these securities in periods of loss. Diluted earnings per share for the common stock is computed using the more dilutive of the two-class method or the \u201cif-converted\u201d and treasury stock methods. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, all Series D Preferred Stock were converted to common shares with no remaining Series D Preferred Stock outstanding at September 30, 2021.\nBRIDGELINE DIGITAL, INC.\nNOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(in thousands, except share and per share data)\nBasic net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss attributable to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted net income per share attributable to common shareholders is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period plus the dilutive effect of outstanding stock options and warrants using the \u201ctreasury stock\u201d method and convertible preferred stock using the as-if-converted method. The computation of diluted earnings per share does not include the effect of outstanding stock options, warrants and convertible preferred stock that are considered anti-dilutive.\nFor the years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, diluted net loss per share was the same as basic net loss per share, as the effects of all the Company\u2019s potential common stock equivalents are anti-dilutive, as the Company reported a net loss attributable to common shareholders for the periods and the impact of in-the-money warrants was also anti-dilutive. Potential common stock equivalents excluded were the Company\u2019s Convertible Preferred Stock, stock options and warrants (See Note 12) and conti\nngently issuable shares associated with acquired businesses (See Note 16).\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Effective\nFinancial Instruments - Credit Losses\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326), which requires entities to measure all expected credit losses for financial assets held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. This replaces the existing incurred loss model and is applicable to the measurement of credit losses on financial assets measured at amortized cost. ASU 2016-13 is effective for smaller reporting companies for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those annual reporting periods, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the new standard on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nDebt with Conversion and Other Options and Derivatives and Hedging\nIn August 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-06, Debt - Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entity\u2019s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity\u2019s Own Equity. The amendments in ASU No. 2020-06 simplify the complexity associated with applying U.S. GAAP for certain financial instruments with characteristics of liabilities and equity. More specifically, the amendments focus on the guidance for convertible instruments and derivative scope exceptions for contracts in an entity\u2019s own equity. ASU 2020-06 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, but no earlier than fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the new standard on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nBusiness Combinations\nIn October 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 606): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers, which requires that an entity recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination in accordance with Topic 606 as if it had originated the contracts. Generally, this should result in an acquirer recognizing and measuring the acquired contract assets and contract liabilities consistent with how they were recognized and measured in the acquiree\u2019s financial statements, if the acquiree prepared financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The amendment in this update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. The guidance should be applied prospectively to business combinations occurring on or after the effective date of the amendment in this update. The Company is evaluating the potential impact of this adoption on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nAll other Accounting Standards Updates issued but not yet effective are not expected to have a material effect on the Company\u2019s future consolidated financial statements or related disclosures.\n3. Accounts Receivable\nAccounts receivable consist of the following:\nAs of September 30,\nAccounts receivable\n$ 1,403 $ 698\nAllowance for doubtful accounts\n(33 )\n(33 )\nAccounts receivable, net\n$ 1,370 $ 665\nAs of and for the year ended September 30, 2021, two customers represented approximately 13%, and 10% of accounts receivable and no customers exceeded 10% of the Company\u2019s total revenues. As of and for the year ended September 30, 2020, three customers represented approximately 15%, 14% and 10% of accounts receivable and one customer represented approximately 12% of total revenues.\n4. Property and equipment\nProperty and equipment consist of the following:\nAs of September 30,\nFurniture and fixtures\n$ 98 $ 73\nPurchased software\n18 18\nComputer equipment\n150 93\nLeasehold improvements\n197 195\nTotal cost\n463 379\nLess accumulated depreciation and amortization\n(211 )\n(141 )\nProperty and equipment, net\n$ 252 $ 238\nDepreciation and amortization on the above assets were $70 and $61 in fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n5. Fair Value Measurement and Fair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe Company\u2019s financial instruments consist principally of accounts receivable, accounts payable, warrant liabilities, contingent consideration and long-term debt arrangements. The Company measures its financial assets and liabilities at fair value. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (i.e., exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Additionally, under U.S. GAAP, companies are required to provide disclosure and categorize assets and liabilities measured at fair value into one of three different levels depending on the assumptions (i.e., inputs) used in the valuation. Level 1 provides the most reliable measure of fair value while Level 3 generally requires significant management judgment. Financial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input significant to the fair value measurement. The fair value hierarchy is defined as follows:\nLevel 1-Valuations are based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\nLevel 2-Valuations are based on quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, or quoted prices in markets that are not active for which significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly.\nLevel 3-Valuations are based on prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement. Inputs reflect management\u2019s best estimate of what market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability at the measurement date.\nThe carrying value of the Company\u2019s accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate their fair value due to their short-term nature. Debts with an aggregate fair value of $1.7 million have an aggregate carrying value of $1.9 million. The fair value is based on interest rates that are currently available to the Company for issuance of debt with similar terms and remaining maturities. If measured at fair value in the financial statements, the debt would be classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.\nBRIDGELINE DIGITAL, INC.\nNOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(in thousands, except share and per share data)\nThe Company\u2019s warrant liabilities are measured at fair value at each reporting period with changes in fair value recognized in earnings during the period. The fair value of the Company\u2019s warrant liabilities are valued utilizing Level 3 inputs. Warrant liabilities are valued using a Monte Carlo option-pricing model, which takes into consideration the volatilities of comparable public companies, due to the relatively low trading volume of the Company\u2019s common stock. The Monte Carlo option-pricing model uses certain assumptions, including expected life and annual volatility. The range and weighted average volatilities of comparable public companies utilized was 28.8% - 66.2% and 55.8%, respectively, as of September 30, 2021, and 26.2% - 70.7% and 43.5%, respectively, as of September 30, 2020. The volatility utilized in the Monte Carlo option-pricing model was determined by weighing 60% to the Company-specific volatility and 40% on comparable public companies. The significant inputs and assumptions utilized were as follows:\nAs of September 30, 2021 As of September 30, 2020\nAt inception\nMontage\nCapital\nSeries C\nPreferred\nSeries D\nPreferred\nMontage\nCapital\nSeries C\nPreferred\nSeries D\nPreferred\nVolatility\n88.7 % 83.9 % 85.7 % 84.0 % 84.1 % 86.3 %\nRisk-free rate\n0.80 % 0.50 % 1.00 % 0.28 % 0.20 % 0.90 %\nStock price\n$ 4.11 $ 4.11 $ 4.11 $ 1.86 $ 1.86 $ 2.50\nThe Company recognized a gain (loss) of ($5,885) and $1,028 for the years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, related to the change in fair value of warrant liabilities. The changes in fair value of warrant liabilities were due to changes in inputs, primarily a change in the stock price and the risk-free rate, to the Monte Carlo option-pricing model.\nThe Company\u2019s contingent consideration obligations are from arrangements resulting from acquisitions that involve potential future payment of consideration that is contingent upon the achievement of the revenue targets and operational goals. Contingent consideration is recognized at its estimated fair value at the date of acquisition based on the Company\u2019s expected probability of future payment, discounted using a weighted average cost of capital in accordance with accepted valuation methodologies.\nThe Company reviews and re-assesses the estimated fair value of contingent consideration liabilities at each reporting period and the updated fair value could differ materially from the initial estimates. The Company measures contingent consideration recognized in connection with acquisitions at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs classified as Level 3 inputs. The Company uses a simulation-based model to estimate the fair value of contingent consideration on the acquisition date and at each reporting period. The simulation model uses certain inputs and assumptions, including revenue projections, an estimate of revenue discount and volatility rate based on comparable public companies\u2019 data, and risk-free rate. Significant increases or decreases to either of these inputs in isolation could result in a significantly higher or lower liability with a higher liability limited to the contractual maximum of the contingent consideration liabilities. Ultimately, the liability will be equivalent to the amount paid, and the difference between the fair value estimate on the acquisition date and each reporting period and the amount paid will be recorded in earnings.

Goodwill\nThe carrying value of goodwill is not amortized, but is tested for impairment annually as of September 30th, as well as whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a reporting unit may not be recoverable. The purpose of an impairment test is to identify any potential impairment by comparing the carrying value of a reporting unit including goodwill to its fair value. An impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit\u2019s fair value; however, the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.\nAnnual tests were performed at September 30, 2021 and 2020. Management performed a qualitative assessment that did not result in any impairment indictors at September 30, 2021 and 2020. Impairment charges are reflected as a reduction in goodwill in the Company\u2019s consolidated balance sheets and an expense in the Company\u2019s consolidated statements of operations.\nChanges in the carrying value of goodwill are as follows:\nAs of September 30,\nBalance at beginning of period\n$ 5,557 $ 5,557\nAcquisitions\n10,428 -\nBalance at end of period\n$ 15,985 $ 5,557\n7.

The estimated amortization expense for fiscal years 2022, 2023, 2024, 2025, 2026 and thereafter is $1,494, $1,415, $1,032, $738, $673 and $2,403, respectively.\n8.

Restructuring and Acquisition Related Expenses\nRestructuring Activities\nIn March 2020, the Company recognized $366 of expenses related to a reduction in workforce in its U.S. and Canada operations aimed at improving efficiencies by combining functions, certain responsibilities and eliminating redundancies which resulted in a reduction of 15 positions. There were no restructuring activities during the year ended September 30, 2021.\nThe following table summarizes the restructuring charges reserve activity:\nEmployee\nSeverance and\nBenefits\nFacility\nClosures\nand Other\nCosts\nTotal\nBalance at beginning of period, October 1, 2019\n$ 59 $ 16 $ 75\nCharges to operations\n366 - 366\nCash disbursements\n(425 )\n(16 )\n(441 )\nChanges in estimates\n- - -\nAccretion expense\n- - -\nBalance at end of period, September 30, 2020\n$ - $ - $ -\nThere were no accrued restructuring costs included in Accrued Liabilities as of September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nAcquisition Related Expenses\nIn connection with the acquisition of businesses completed during the fiscal 2021 second and third quarters (see Note 16), the Company incurred acquisition expenses of $1,235 during the year ended September 30, 2021, which are included in Restructuring and acquisition related expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. There were no acquisition related expenses incurred during the year ended September 30, 2020.\n10. Long-term Debt\nOn March 1, 2021, the Company assumed the outstanding long-term debt obligations of an acquired business and issued a seller note to one of the selling shareholders (see Note 16). The assumed debt obligations and seller note are denominated in Euros.\nAt September 30, 2021, long-term debt consisted of the following:\nVendor loan payable (\u201cVendor loan\u201d), accruing interest at 4.0% per annum. Principal and interest are payable in two lump-sum installments and the loan matures on February 1, 2023.\n$ 718\nTerm loan payable, accruing interest at fixed rates ranging between 0.99% to 1.5% per annum, payable in monthly or quarterly payments of interest and principal and matures on October 10, 2022.\nTerm loan payable, accruing interest at 1.3% per annum, payable in quarterly installments and matures on April 30, 2027.\nSeller\u2019s note payable (\u201cSeller\u2019s note\u201d), due to one of the selling shareholders, accruing interest at a fixed rate of 4.0% per annum. The Seller\u2019s note is payable over 5 installments and matures on January 1, 2026.\nTotal debt\n1,929\nLess current portion:\n(732 )\nLong-term debt, net of current portion\n$ 1,197\nAt September 30, 2021, future maturities of long-term debt are as follows:\nFiscal year:\n$ 732\nThereafter\nTotal debt\n$ 1,929\nPayroll Protection Program\nOn April 17, 2020, Bridgeline Digital, Inc. entered into a loan with BNB Bank as the lender in an aggregate principal amount of $1,048 (\u201cPPP Loan\u201d) pursuant to the Paycheck Protection Program (\u201cPPP\u201d) under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (\u201cCARES Act\u201d). The PPP Loan is evidenced by a promissory note (\u201cNote\u201d). Subject to the terms of the Note, the PPP Loan bears interest at a fixed rate of one percent (1%) per annum, with the first six months of interest deferred, has an initial term of two years, and is unsecured and guaranteed by the U.S. Small Business Administration (\u201cSBA\u201d). Payments are deferred for at least the first six months and payable in 18 equal consecutive monthly installments of principal and interest commencing upon expiration of the deferral period of the PPP Loan date. The Company may apply to the lender for forgiveness of the PPP Loan, with the amount which may be forgiven equal to the sum of payroll costs, covered rent obligations, and covered utility payments incurred by the Company during the twenty-four week period beginning on April 21, 2020, calculated in accordance with the terms of the CARES Act. The Note provides for prepayment and customary events of default, including, among other things, cross-defaults on any other loan with the lender.\nBRIDGELINE DIGITAL, INC.\nNOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(in thousands, except share and per share data)\nU.S. GAAP does not contain authoritative accounting standards for forgivable loans provided by governmental entities to a for-profit entity. Absent authoritative accounting standards, interpretative guidance issued and commonly applied by financial statement preparers allows for the selection of accounting policies amongst acceptable alternatives. Based on facts and circumstances outlined below, the Company determined it most appropriate to account for the PPP Loan proceeds as an in-substance government grant by analogy to International Accounting Standards 20 (\u201cIAS 20\u201d), Accounting for Government Grants and Disclosure of Government Assistance. Under the provisions of IAS 20, \u201ca forgivable loan from government is treated as a government grant when there is reasonable assurance that the entity will meet the terms for forgiveness of the loan.\u201d IAS 20 does not define \u201creasonable assurance\u201d; however, based on certain interpretations, it is analogous to \u201cprobable\u201d as defined in FASB ASC 450-20-20 under U.S. GAAP, which is the definition the Company has applied to its expectations of PPP Loan forgiveness. Under IAS 20, government grants are recognized in earnings on a systematic basis over the periods in which the Company recognizes costs for which the grant is intended to compensate (i.e., qualified expenses). Further, IAS 20 permits for the recognition in earnings either separately under a general heading such as other income, or as a reduction of the related expenses. The Company has elected to recognize government grant income separately within other income to present a clearer distinction in its consolidated financial statements between its operating income and the amount of net income resulting from the PPP Loan and subsequent expected forgiveness. The Company believes this presentation method promotes greater comparability amongst all periods presented. At the time in which the PPP Loan was obtained, U.S. GAAP did not contain authoritative accounting guidance and subsequently, ASU 2021-10, Government Assistance (Topic 832), was issued to address disclosure requirements about transactions with a government that are accounted for by applying a grant model, such as IAS 20.\nThe following provides the balance and activity related to the PPP Loan:\nAs of September 30,\nBalance at beginning of period\n$ 88 $ 1,048\nQualified expenses incurred during the period eligible for forgiveness\n(88 )\n(960 )\nBalance at end of period\n$ - $ 88\nThe Company applied for full PPP Loan forgiveness on March 29, 2021 and received approval from the SBA in August 2021. The Company classified unexpended loan proceeds on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as a current or noncurrent liability based on the contractual maturities of the underlying loan agreement. During the first quarter of fiscal 2021, the remaining loan proceeds were expended on qualified expenses and as a result, the Company recognized $88 as government grant income. As of September 30, 2020, unexpended loan proceeds of $88 were classified as a current liability.\n11. Leases\nThe Company leases facilities in the United States for its corporate and regional field offices. During the years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, the Company was also a lessee/sublessor for certain office locations relating to its restructuring plans commenced in fiscal 2015.\nDetermination of Whether a Contract Contains a Lease\nWe determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception, or upon modification of a contract and classify each lease as either an operating or finance lease at commencement. The Company reassesses lease classification subsequent to commencement upon a change to the expected lease term or a modification to the contract. Operating leases represent the Company\u2019s right to use an underlying asset as lessee for the lease term and lease obligations represent the Company\u2019s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease.\nA contract contains a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of the identified property or equipment, explicitly or implicitly, for a period of time in exchange for consideration. Control of an underlying asset is conveyed if we obtain the rights to direct the use of and obtain substantially all of the economic benefit from the use of the underlying asset. At commencement, contracts containing a lease are further evaluated for classification as an operating lease or finance lease based on their terms.\nROU Model and Determination of Lease Term\nThe Company uses the Right-of-Use (\u201cROU\u201d) model to account for leases, which requires an entity to recognize a lease liability and ROU asset on the lease commencement date. A lease liability is measured equal to the present value of the remaining lease payments over the lease term and is discounted using the incremental borrowing rate, as the rates implicit in the Company\u2019s leases are not readily determinable. The incremental borrowing rate is the rate of interest that the Company would have to pay to borrow, on a collateralized basis over a similar term, an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment. Lease payments include payments made before the commencement date and any residual value guarantees, if applicable. The initial ROU asset consists of the initial measurement of the lease liability, adjusted for any payments made before the commencement date, initial direct costs and lease incentives earned. When determining the lease term, the Company includes option periods when it is reasonably certain that those options will be exercised.\nLease Costs\nFor operating leases, minimum lease payments, including minimum scheduled rent increases, are recognized as operating lease costs on a straight-line basis over the applicable lease terms. Some operating lease arrangements include variable lease costs, including real estate taxes, insurance, common area maintenance or increases in rental costs related to inflation. Such variable payments, other than those dependent upon a market index or rate, are excluded from the measurement of the lease liability and are expensed when the obligation for those payments is incurred.\nBRIDGELINE DIGITAL, INC.\nNOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(in thousands, except share and per share data)\nSignificant Assumptions and Judgments\nManagement makes certain estimates and assumptions regarding each new lease and sublease agreement, renewal and amendment, including, but not limited to, property values, market rents, useful life of the underlying property, discount rate and probable term, all of which can impact (1) the classification as either an operating or finance lease, (2) measurement of lease liabilities and ROU assets and (3) the term over which the ROU asset and leasehold improvements are amortized. The amount of depreciation and amortization, interest and rent expense would vary if different estimates and assumptions were used.\nThe components of net lease costs were as follows:\nAs of September 30,\nCondensed Consolidated Statements of Operations:\nOperating lease cost\n$ 115 $ 273\nVariable lease cost\n55 84\nLess: Sublease income, net\n(101 )\n(73 )\nTotal\n$ 69 $ 284\nCash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities was $225 for the year ended September 30, 2021, all of which represents operating cash flows from operating leases. As of September 30, 2021, the weighted average remaining lease term was 3.3 years and the weighted average discount rate was 7.0%.\nAt September 30, 2021, future minimum rental commitments under non-cancelable leases with initial or remaining terms in excess of one year, which have commenced, were as follows:\nPayments\nOperating\nLeases\nReceipts\nSubleases\nNet Leases\nFiscal year:\n$ 185 $ 101 $ 84\n173 101 72\n116 34 82\n69 - 69\n7 - 7\nTotal lease commitments\n550 $ 236 $ 314\nLess: Amount representing interest\n(69 )\nPresent value of lease liabilities\nLess: Current portion\n(161 )\nOperating lease liabilities, net of current portion\n$ 320\nAs of September 30, 2021, the Company had no lease commitments that extend past 2026.\nBRIDGELINE DIGITAL, INC.\nNOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(in thousands, except share and per share data)\nAt September 30, 2020, future minimum rental commitments under non-cancelable leases with initial or remaining terms in excess of one year were as follows:\nPayments\nOperating\nLeases\nReceipts\nSubleases\nNet Leases\nFiscal year:\n$ 96 $ 101 $ (5 )\n82 101 (19 )\n85 101 (16 )\n87 36 51\n88 - 88\nTotal lease commitments\n$ 438 $ 339 $ 99\n12. Stockholders\u2019 Equity\nSeries A Convertible Preferred Stock\nThe Company has designated 264,000 shares of its preferred stock as Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (\u201cSeries A Preferred Stock\u201d). The shares of Series A Preferred Stock may be converted, at the option of the holder at any time, into such number of shares of common stock (\u201cConversion Shares\u201d) equal to (i) the number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock to be converted, multiplied by the stated value of $10.00 (the \u201cStated Value\u201d) and (ii) divided by the conversion price in effect at the time of conversion.\nOn December 31, 2019 (the \u201cAmendment Date\u201d), the Company filed a First Amended and Restated Certificate of Designations of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (the \u201cSeries A Amendment\u201d) with the Secretary of State for the State of Delaware, which amended and restated the Series A Preferred Stock, as more particularly set forth below:\nConversion Price: Reduces the conversion price from $812.50 per share to $1.75 per share, subject to adjustment in the event of stock splits or stock dividends.\nMandatory Conversion: The Company has the right, in its sole discretion, to require the holders to convert shares of the Series A Preferred Stock into Conversion Shares if (i) the Company\u2019s common stock has closed at or above $2.28 ($32.50 prior to the Series A Amendment) for fifteen (ten prior to the Series A Amendment) consecutive trading days and (ii) the Conversion Shares are (a) registered for resale on an effective registration statement or (b) may be resold pursuant to Rule 144.\nCompany\u2019s Redemption Option: The Company may redeem all or a portion of the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock, at its option, provided that the Company provides ten business days\u2019 prior written notice of its intent to redeem the Series A Preferred Stock to the holder and in cash at a price per share of Series A Preferred Stock equal to 100% of the Stated Value of such shares of Series A Preferred Stock plus all accrued and unpaid dividends. Notwithstanding, the holder may convert its Series A Preferred Stock prior to the exercise of the Company\u2019s redemption option.\nDividends: Each outstanding share of Series A Preferred Stock is entitled to receive cumulative dividends, payable quarterly in arrears, at a rate of 5% per annum for the first eighteen months commencing on January 1, 2020 after which time the dividend rate will increase to 12% per annum (the dividend rate was 12% per annum prior to the Series A Amendment). Dividends are payable in cash or, at the election of the Company, by delivery of additional shares (\u201cPIK Shares\u201d) of Series A Preferred Stock, subject to a cap of 64,000 PIK Shares, in the aggregate. Any accrued but unpaid dividends on the shares of Series A Preferred Stock to be converted shall also be converted into common stock at the conversion price.\nIn the event of any liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the Company, the holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock will be entitled to receive in preference to the holders of common stock, the amount equal to the Stated Value per share of Series A Preferred Stock plus declared and unpaid dividends, if any. After such payment has been made, the remaining assets of the Company will be distributed ratably to the holders of common stock. The Series A Preferred Stock shall vote with the common stock on an as-converted basis.\nPrior to fiscal 2019, the Company had issued 64,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock as PIK Shares to the Series A preferred shareholders, which is the maximum amount of cumulative PIK Shares authorized. Therefore, all future dividend payments will be cash dividends.\nThe Company determined that the Series A Amendment represented an extinguishment for accounting purposes. In making this determination, the Company considered the significance of the contractual terms added and revisions to existing contractual terms, including, but not limited to, the significant change in the conversion price and the addition of the Company\u2019s redemption option. These additions and revisions to existing contractual terms were considered to be qualitatively significant. The extinguishment of equity-classified convertible preferred stock is recognized as a deemed dividend measured as the difference between (1) the fair value of the consideration transferred; that is, the Series A Preferred Stock, as amended, and (2) the carrying value of the Series A Preferred Stock. At the Amendment Date, the fair value of the Series A Preferred Stock, as amended, was approximately $2,629 and its carrying value was approximately $315, resulting in a deemed dividend of $2,314 recognized as an increase to accumulated deficit and an increase to additional paid-in capital, which was included as a component of net loss attributable to common shareholders during fiscal 2020. The estimated Amendment Date fair value of the Series A Preferred Stock was determined using the present value of probability weighted scenario analysis based on the per share publicly traded closing stock price of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nBRIDGELINE DIGITAL, INC.\nNOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(in thousands, except share and per share data)\nAs of September 30, 2020, all previously outstanding shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock were converted into common stock.\nSeries C Convertible Preferred Stock\nThe Company has designated 11,000 shares of its preferred stock as Series C Convertible Preferred Stock (\u201cSeries C Preferred Stock\u201d). The Company may not effect, and a holder will not be entitled to, convert the Series C Preferred Stock or exercise any Series C Preferred Warrants, which, upon giving effect to such conversion or exercise, would cause (i) the aggregate number of shares of common stock beneficially owned by the Purchaser (together with its affiliates) to exceed 4.99% (or, at the election of the holder, 9.99%) of the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to the exercise. As of September 30, 2021, the Company had 350 shares of Series C Preferred Stock outstanding which were convertible into an aggregate of 38,889 shares of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nRegistered Offering of Common Stock and Private Placement of Series D Convertible Preferred Stock (the \u201c May 2021 Offerings\u201d)\nOn May 14, 2021, the Company offered and sold a total of 1,060,000 shares of its common stock, to certain institutional investors at a public offering price of $2.28 per share in a registered direct offering (\u201cRD Offering\u201d). The RD Offering was registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, pursuant to a prospectus supplement to the Company's currently effective registration statement on Form S-3.\nAdditionally, on May 14, 2021, the Company entered into securities purchase agreements with certain institutional investors pursuant to which the Company offered and sold a total of 2,700 units (\u201cUnits\u201d) at a purchase price of $1,000 per Unit (\u201cPrivate Placement\u201d). Each Unit consisted of (i) one share of the Company\u2019s newly designated Series D Convertible Preferred Stock (\u201cSeries D Preferred Stock\u201d) and (ii) warrants to purchase common stock up to one-half of the shares issuable upon conversion of the Series D Preferred Stock as a part of the Units. In total, the Company issued 2,700 shares of Series D Preferred Stock and warrants to purchase up to 592,106 shares of common stock.\nJoseph Gunnar & Company, LLC acted as lead placement agent for both the RD Offering and the Private Placement (collectively, the \u201cMay 2021 Offerings\u201d) and Taglich Brothers, Inc. acted as co-placement agent for the May 2021 Offerings (the \"Placement Agents\"). As compensation for their services, the Company paid to the Placement Agents a fee equal to 8% of the aggregate purchase price paid and reimbursed the Placement Agents for certain expenses incurred in connection with the May 2021 Offerings. In addition, the Company issued to the Placement Agents warrants, in substantially the same form as the Series D Preferred Warrants, to purchase an aggregate of 179,536 shares of common stock.\nIn connection with the Private Placement, the Company filed the Certificate of Designation of Preferences, Rights and Limitations of the Series D Convertible Preferred Stock, with the Secretary of State for the State of Delaware, designating 4,200 shares of the Company\u2019s preferred stock as Series D Preferred. The terms and conditions set forth in the Certificate of Designation are summarized below:\nStated Value: Each share of Series D Preferred Stock has a stated value of $1,000 per share.\nDividends: Commencing six months after the issuance date and terminating upon receipt of Stockholder Approval, as discussed below, Series D Preferred holders are entitled to receive cumulative dividends at a rate of 9% per annum of the stated value per share. The Company will pay dividends, if accrued, on the last day of each calendar quarter with respect to the Series D Preferred Stock held by a holder during such calendar quarter.\nVoting: Shares of Series D Preferred Stock have no general voting rights. However, as long as any shares of Series D Preferred Stock are outstanding, the Company may not, without the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the then outstanding shares of Series D Preferred Stock, (i) alter or change adversely the powers, preferences or rights given to the Series D Preferred Stock or alter or amend the Certificate of Designation, (ii) amend its certificate of incorporation or other charter documents in any manner that adversely affects any rights of the holders of Series D Preferred Stock, (iii) increase the number of authorized shares of Series D Preferred, or (iv) enter into any agreement with respect to any of the foregoing.\nLiquidation Preference: Prior to Stockholder Approval, upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the Company, whether voluntary or involuntary, the holders of Series D Preferred Stock will be entitled to receive out of the Company\u2019s assets an amount equal to the Stated Value, plus any accrued and unpaid dividends thereon and any other fees or liquidated damages then due and owing thereon under the Certificate of Designation, before any distribution or payment is made to the holders of any other securities and if the Company\u2019s assets will be insufficient to pay in full such amounts, then the entire assets to be distributed to the holders of Series D Preferred Stock will be ratably distributed among such holders in accordance with the respective amounts that would be payable on such shares if all amounts payable thereon were paid in full.\nBRIDGELINE DIGITAL, INC.\nNOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(in thousands, except share and per share data)\nAfter Stockholder Approval, the Series D Preferred Stock has no liquidation preference.\nConversion: Each share of Series D Preferred Stock is convertible, at any time after the issuance date at the option of the holder thereof, into that number of shares of common stock determined by dividing the Stated Value by the conversion price which is $2.28 (subject to adjustment for the effect of stock dividends, stock splits, recapitalizations and the like); provided, however, that holders of the Series D Preferred Stock may not convert any of their Series D Preferred Stock into conversion shares unless and until the Stockholder Approval Date. In addition, holders of Series D Preferred Stock are prohibited from converting Series D Preferred Stock into conversion shares if, as a result of such conversion, the holder, together with its affiliates, would own more than 4.99% (or 9.99% upon the election of the holder prior to the issuance of the Series D Preferred Stock) of the total number of shares of common stock then issued and outstanding. Series D Preferred Stock issued in Private Placement, subject to Stockholder Approval, is convertible into an aggregate of 1,184,211 shares of common stock.\nStockholder Approval: The Company\u2019s common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market, and, as such, it is subject to the applicable rules of the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC, including Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635(a), which requires stockholder approval in connection with the acquisition of another company (see Note 16) if the Nasdaq-listed company will issue 20% or more of its common stock. For purposes of Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635(a), the issuance of any common stock in the Acquisition (see Note 16) and the May 2021 Offerings would be aggregated together. Thus, to permit the issuance of common stock upon conversion of the Series D Preferred Stock and upon exercise of the warrants issued in the Private Placement, the Company had to obtain stockholder approval of these issuances. Upon issuance, the Company had determined that such prohibition did not represent an inability for the Company to satisfy its obligation to deliver shares upon conversion, as the holders\u2019 conversion option itself is contingent upon Stockholder Approval. On September 16, 2021, the Company obtained Stockholder Approval. The Company determined that the Series D Preferred Stock should be classified as permanent equity.\nThe Series D Preferred Stock contains an embedded conversion feature that could affect the ultimate settlement of the Series D Preferred Stock. The Company determined that the embedded conversion feature\u2019s economic characteristics and risks were clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the Series D Preferred Stock. As a result, the embedded conversion feature was not required to be bifurcated from the Series D Preferred Stock.\nThe Series D Preferred Stock issued contains a beneficial conversion feature, which arises when a debt or equity security is issued with an embedded conversion option that is deemed beneficial to the investor, that is, in-the-money, at inception, as the conversion option has an effective conversion price that is less than the market price of the underlying stock at the commitment date. An embedded beneficial conversion feature is required to be recognized separately by allocating a portion of the proceeds equal to the intrinsic value, at the commitment date, of the feature to additional paid-in capital. As discussed below, the May 2021 Offerings cash proceeds allocated to the Series D Preferred Stock based on its relative fair value resulted in an effective conversion price of $1.41, which was below the commitment date fair value of the underlying shares of common stock of $2.50, resulting in a beneficial conversion feature measured at $1.3 million. As discussed in Note 16, upon the acquisition of Hawk Search during the third quarter of fiscal 2021, Series D Preferred Stock was issued as part of consideration transferred in which the intrinsic value of the embedded conversion feature was calculated at $724 as of the acquisition date. As of September 30, 2021, the Company recognized the impact of the beneficial conversion feature upon Stockholder Approval, as the beneficial conversion feature became immediately exercisable, at the option of the holder. The Company recognized full accretion of the beneficial conversion feature as a deemed dividend of $2.0 million to the Series D Preferred Stock. Such deemed dividend is recognized as an increase to accumulated deficit and an increase to additional paid-in capital and is included as a component of net loss attributable to common stockholders. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, all Series D Preferred Stock were converted to common shares with no remaining Series D Preferred Stock outstanding at September 30, 2021.\nAs noted above, in connection with the May 2021 Offerings, the Company issued Series D Preferred Warrants and Placement Agents Warrants to purchase up to 592,106 and 179,536 shares of common stock, respectively. The Series D Preferred and Placement Agents Warrants (hereinafter referred to collectively as the \u201cSeries D Warrants\u201d) are puttable at the option of the holder in the event of a Fundamental Transaction, as defined in the respective warrant agreements. The put feature requires the Company to pay holders an amount of cash equal to the Black-Scholes Value, as defined in the respective warrant agreements, of the remaining unexercised portion of the Series D Warrants on the date of consummation of such Fundamental Transaction. The Company determined that the Series D Warrants are required to be classified as liabilities measured at fair value at their issuance date and to be subsequently remeasured at fair value each reporting period with changes in fair value recognized in period earnings (see Note 5).\nAs the common stock in the RD Offering was sold concurrently with the Units sold in the Private Placement, for any common purchasers, inclusive of purchaser affiliated entities, the aggregate proceeds from the May 2021 Offerings were allocated, on an investor-by-investor basis, to the Series D Preferred Warrants based on their fair value and the residual proceeds to the common stock and Series D Preferred Stock based on their relative fair values. Accordingly, the May 2021 Offerings proceeds, net of certain fees due to placement agents, inclusive of the fair value of warrants issued to placement agents, and transaction-related expenses, of $4.3 million were allocated $1.0 million to the Series D Preferred Warrants based on their issuance-date fair value, $1.9 million to common stock and $1.3 million to Series D Preferred Stock based on their respective relative fair values.\nBRIDGELINE DIGITAL, INC.\nNOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(in thousands, except share and per share data)\nThe issuance date fair value of the Series D Warrants issued to placement agents was determined to be incremental cost directly attributable to the May 2021 Offerings and was charged by the Company against proceeds along with other fees paid to the Placement Agents.\nRegistration Rights\nThe registration rights agreement, entered into in connection with the Series D Preferred Stock Units Private Placement, requires the Company to file with the SEC a registration statement no later than 15 days after the Closing Date (issuance date) registering for resale the maximum number of common shares issuable upon conversion of the Series D Preferred Stocks and the exercise of the Series D Warrants. Such registration rights agreement requires the Company to use commercially reasonable best efforts to have the registration statement declared effective by the SEC, as soon as practicable, but in no event later than the effectiveness deadline of 60 days after the closing date (or in the event of a full review by the SEC the effectiveness deadline will be 90 days after the closing date). If such registration statement is not effective by the contractually agreed upon date, or such registration statement effectiveness is not maintained, then, the Company is required to make payments on account of liquidated damages to the investors of 2% of their Series D Preferred Stock Units subscription amount on the date of such events, and on each monthly anniversary thereafter until the effectiveness is cured.\nPursuant to the terms of the registration rights agreement, the Company on May 28, 2021, filed a registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC to register the common shares issuable upon the conversion of the Series D Preferred Stocks and the exercise of the Series D Warrants. As of August 18, 2021, the registration statement was declared effective by the SEC.\nRegistered Offering and Sale of Common Stock\nOn February 4, 2021, the Company offered and sold a total of 880,000 shares of its common stock, par value $0.001 per share, to certain institutional and accredited investors at a public offering price of $3.10 per share in a registered direct offering (the \u201cOffering\u201d). The Offering was registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, pursuant to a prospectus supplement to the Company\u2019s currently effective registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-239104), which was initially filed with the SEC on June 12, 2020, and was declared effective on June 25, 2020. The Company filed the final prospectus supplement for the Offering on or about February 5, 2021. The Offering closed on February 8, 2021, and resulted in proceeds, net of certain fees due to placement agents and transaction expenses, to the Company of approximately $2.5 million. The net proceeds received by the Company will be used for general corporate purposes, including general working capital.\nJoseph Gunnar & Company, LLC acted as lead placement agent for the Offering, and Taglich Brothers, Inc. acted as co-placement agent for the Offering (the \u201cPlacement Agents\u201d). As compensation for their services, the Company paid to the Placement Agents a fee equal to 8% of the aggregate purchase price paid for shares placed by the Placement Agents at closing and reimbursed the Placement Agents for certain expenses incurred in connection with the Offering. In addition, the Company issued to the Placement Agents warrants to purchase an aggregate of 58,169 shares of common stock (the \u201cPlacement Agent Warrants\u201d). The Placement Agent Warrants have a term of five years from the date of issuance and an exercise price of $3.875 per share.\nAmended and Restated Stock Incentive Plan\nThe Company has granted common stock, common stock warrants, and common stock option awards (the \u201cEquity Awards\u201d) to employees, consultants, advisors and former debt holders of the Company and to former owners and employees of acquired companies that have become employees of the Company. The Company\u2019s Amended and Restated Stock Incentive Plan (the \u201cPlan\u201d) provided for the issuance of up to 5,000 shares of common stock. This Plan expired in August 2016. As of September 30, 2021, there were 3,246 options outstanding under the Plan. On April 29, 2016, the stockholders approved a new stock incentive plan, the 2016 Stock Incentive Plan (the \u201c2016 Plan\u201d). The 2016 Plan authorizes the award of incentive stock options, non-statutory stock options, restricted stock, unrestricted stock, performance shares, stock appreciation rights and any combination thereof to employees, officers, directors, consultants, independent contractors and advisors of the Company. In November 2019, the Company increased the number of common shares available for issuance under the 2016 Plan from 10,000 shares to 800,000 shares. There were no revisions to exercise prices, terms or any other underlying provisions of existing stock options outstanding. As of September 30, 2021, there were 799,201 options outstanding and 4,045 shares available for future issuance under the 2016 Plan.\nBRIDGELINE DIGITAL, INC.\nNOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(in thousands, except share and per share data)\nCompensation Expense\nCompensation expense is generally recognized on a graded accelerated basis over the vesting period of grants. Compensation expense is recorded in the consolidated statements of operations with a portion charged to Cost of revenue and a portion to Operating expenses, depending on the employee\u2019s department.\nDuring the years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, compensation expense related to share-based payments was as follows:\nYears ended\nSeptember 30,\nCost of revenue\n$ 25 $ 21\nOperating expenses\n163 173\nInterest expense and other, net\n419 -\n$ 607 $ 194\nInterest expense and other, net includes compensation expense related the fair value of fully-vested stock options granted in August 2021. 100,000 shares were granted to directors, as more fully described below under the caption \u201cSummary of Option and Warrant Activity and Outstanding Shares.\u201d As of September 30, 2021, the Company had approximately $385 of unrecognized compensation costs related to unvested options, which are expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.1 years.\nCommon Stock Warrants\nThe Company typically issues warrants to individual investors and placement agents to purchase shares of the Company\u2019s common stock in connection with public and private placement fund raising activities. Warrants may also be issued to individuals or companies in exchange for services provided to the Company. The warrants are typically exercisable six months after the issue date, expire in five years, and contain a cashless exercise provision and piggyback registration rights.\nMontage Warrant - As additional consideration for a prior loan arrangement which was paid in full in a prior period not presented, the Company issued to Montage Capital an eight-year warrant (the \u201cMontage Warrant\u201d) to purchase the Company\u2019s common stock at a price equal to $132.50 per share. The Montage Warrant contains an equity buy-out provision upon the earlier of (1) dissolution or liquidation of the Company, (2) any sale or distribution of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company, or (3) a \u201cChange in Control\u201d as defined within the meaning of Sections 13(d) and 14(d)(2) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Montage Capital has the right to receive an equity buy-out of $250. If the equity buy-out is exercised, the Montage Warrant will be surrendered to the Company for cancellation. The fair value of the Montage warrant liability at September 30, 2021 and 2020, was $13 and $26, respectively.\nSeries A, B and C Preferred Warrants - In March 2019, in connection with the issuance of the Company\u2019s Series C Preferred Stock, the Company issued warrants to purchase the Company\u2019s common stock.

The Company also issued warrants with an exercise price of $4.00 to purchase shares of the Company\u2019s common stock to the Placement Agents. The Company may not effect, and a holder will not be entitled to convert, the Series C Preferred Stock or exercise any Series C Preferred Warrants, which, upon giving effect to such conversion or exercise, would cause (i) the aggregate number of shares of common stock beneficially owned by the Purchaser (together with its affiliates) to exceed 4.99% (or, at the election of the holder, 9.99%) of the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to the exercise. During year ended September 30, 2021, 1,684,250 Series A Warrants were exercised, 2,556,875 Series B Warrants expired unexercised, 55,557 Series C Warrants were exercised and 236,580 Placement Agent Warrants were exercised.\nAs of September 30, 2021, the number of shares issuable upon exercise of the (i) Series A Warrants were 872,625 shares; (ii) Series C Warrants were 13,738 shares; (iii) the Placement Agent Warrants issued in connection with the Series C Preferred Stock were 11,992 shares and (iv) Investor Warrants were 41,141 shares.\nSeries D Preferred Warrants - The Units sold in Private Placement on May 14, 2021 also consisted of Series D Warrants to purchase up to 592,106 shares of common stock.

Expected volatility is based on historical daily price changes of the Company\u2019s common stock for a period equal to the expected life. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield in effect at the time of grant. The expected dividend yield is zero since the Company does not currently pay cash dividends on its common stock and does not anticipate doing so in the foreseeable future.\nA summary of combined stock option and warrant activity is as follows:\nStock Options\nStock Warrants\nWeighted\nWeighted\nAverage\nAverage\nExercise\nExercise\nOptions\nPrice\nWarrants\nPrice\nOutstanding, October 1, 2019\n8,048 $ 306.41 5,496,966 $ 4.54\nGranted\n702,353 1.41 - -\nExercised\n- - - -\nForfeited\n(97,000 )\n3.96 - -\nExpired\n- - (967 )\n952.11\nOutstanding, September 30, 2020\n613,401 4.76 5,495,999 4.37\nGranted\n240,000 4.35 829,811 2.68\nExercised\n(27,333 ) 1.40\n(1,976,387 ) 3.89\nForfeited\n(26,647 )\n2.38\n- -\nExpired\n(220 )\n470.77 (2,560,678 ) 4.28\nOutstanding, September 30, 2021\n799,201 $ 4.66 1,788,745 $ 4.18\nThere were 339,769 and 5,865 options vested and exercisable as of September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

Commitments and Contingencies\nThe Company leases certain of its buildings under noncancelable lease agreements. Refer to the Leases footnote (Note 11) of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nThe Company frequently warrants that the technology solutions it develops for its clients will operate in accordance with the project specifications without defects for a specified warranty period, subject to certain limitations that the Company believes are standard in the industry. In the event that defects are discovered during the warranty period, and none of the limitations apply, the Company is obligated to remedy the defects until the solution that the Company provided operates within the project specifications. The Company is not typically obligated by contract to provide its clients with any refunds of the fees they have paid, although a small number of its contracts provide for the payment of liquidated damages upon default. The Company has purchased insurance policies covering professional errors and omissions, property damage and general liability that reduce its monetary exposure for warranty-related claims and enable it to recover a portion of any future amounts paid.\nThe Company\u2019s contracts typically provide for testing and client acceptance procedures that are designed to mitigate the likelihood of warranty-related claims, although there can be no assurance that such procedures will be effective for each project. The Company has not paid any material amounts related to warranties for its solutions. The Company sometimes commits unanticipated levels of effort to projects to remedy defects covered by its warranties. The Company\u2019s estimate of its exposure to warranties on contracts is immaterial as of September 30, 2021.\nThe Company\u2019s agreements with customers generally require the Company to indemnify the customer against claims in which the Company\u2019s products infringe third-party patents, copyrights, or trademarks and indemnify against product liability matters. As of September 30, 2021, and 2020, the Company has not experienced any losses related to the indemnification obligations and no significant claims with respect thereto were outstanding. The Company does not expect significant claims related to the indemnification obligations and, consequently, concluded that the fair value of these obligations is negligible, and no related reserves were established.\nLitigation\nThe Company is subject to ordinary routine litigation and claims incidental to its business. As of September 30, 2021, the Company was not engaged in any material legal proceedings.\n14. Revenues and Other Related Items\nDisaggregated Revenues\nThe Company disaggregates revenue from contracts with customers by geography and product grouping, as it believes this best depicts how the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors.\nThe Company\u2019s revenue by geography (based on customer address) is as follows:\nYears Ended September 30,\nRevenues:\nUnited States\n$ 10,266 $ 9,013\nInternational\n2,993 1,894\n$ 13,259 $ 10,907\nThe largest concentration within the Company\u2019s international revenue geography is within Canada.\nLong-lived assets located in foreign jurisdictions aggregated approximately $7.5 million and $3.5 million as of September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nBRIDGELINE DIGITAL, INC.\nNOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(in thousands, except share and per share data)\nThe Company\u2019s revenue by type is as follows:\nYears Ended September 30,\nRevenues:\nDigital Engagement Services\n$ 3,296 $ 3,409\nSubscription\n8,736 6,185\nPerpetual Licenses\n- 20\nMaintenance\n380 349\nHosting\n847 944\n$ 13,259 $ 10,907\nDeferred Revenue\nAmounts that have been invoiced are recognized in accounts receivable, deferred revenue or revenue, depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met. Deferred revenue represents amounts billed for which revenue has not yet been recognized. Deferred revenue that will be recognized during the succeeding 12-month period is recognized as current deferred revenue and the remaining portion is recognized as noncurrent deferred revenue and is included in Other long-term liabilities.\nAs of September 30, 2021, approximately $418 of revenue is expected to be recognized from remaining performance obligations for contracts with original performance obligations that exceed one year. The Company expects to recognize revenue on approximately 99% of these remaining performance obligations over the next 12 months, with the balance recognized thereafter.\nThe following table summarizes the classification and net change in deferred revenue as of and for the years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020:\nDeferred Revenue\nCurrent\nLong Term\nBalance as of October 1, 2019\n$ 1,262 $ 8\nIncrease\n249 7\nBalance as of September 30, 2020\n1,511 15\nIncrease\n586 403\nBalance as of September 30, 2021\n$ 2,097 $ 418\nDeferred Capitalized Commissions Costs\nThe incremental direct costs of obtaining a contract, which primarily consist of sales commissions paid for new subscription contracts, are deferred and amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of approximately three years. The Company evaluated both qualitative and quantitative factors, including the estimated life cycles of its offerings, renewal rates, and its customer attrition to determine the amortization periods for the capitalized costs. The initial amortization period will generally be the customer contract term, which is typically thirty-six (36) months, with some exceptions. Deferred capitalized commission expense that will be recognized as expense during the succeeding 12-month period is recognized as current deferred capitalized commission costs, and the remaining portion is recognized as long-term deferred capitalized commission costs. Total deferred capitalized commissions were $8 and $20 as of September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Current deferred capitalized commission costs are included in Other current assets in the consolidated balance sheets and noncurrent deferred capitalized commission costs are included in Other assets in the consolidated balance sheets. Amortization expense was $2 and $16 the years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n15. Income Taxes\nThe components of the Company\u2019s tax provision (benefit) as of September 30, 2021 and 2020, is as follows:\nYear Ended September 30,\nCurrent:\nFederal\n$ (11 ) $ -\nState\n33 11\nForeign\n- -\nTotal current\n22 11\nDeferred:\nFederal\n(953 ) -\nState\n(217 ) -\nForeign\n(26 ) -\nTotal deferred\n(1,196 ) -\nGrand total\n$ (1,174 ) $ 11\nThe Company\u2019s income tax provision was computed using the federal statutory rate and average state statutory rates, net of related federal benefit. The provision differs from the amount computed by applying the statutory federal income tax rate to pretax income, as follows:\nYear Ended September 30,\nIncome tax provision/(benefit) at the federal statutory rate of 21%\n$ (1,695 )\n$ 67\nPermanent differences, net\n1,503 (682 )\nState income tax provision/(benefit)\n26 14\nForeign tax rate differences\n340 -\nChange in valuation allowance attributable to operations\n(1,202 )\nTrue up to prior year NOL\n(146 )\nAMT tax refundable under CARES act\n- 23\nOther\n- (7 )\nTotal\n$ (1,174 )\n$ 11\nAs of September 30, 2021, the Company has federal net operating loss (\u201cNOL\u201d) carryforwards of approximately $32 million in which the 20-year carryforward expires on various dates through 2037 and the remaining NOL carryforward is indefinite. Internal Revenue Code Section 382 places a limitation on the amount of taxable income which can be offset by NOL carryforwards after a change in control of a loss corporation. Due to these \u201cchange of ownership\u201d provisions, utilization of NOL carryforwards may be subject to an annual limitation in future periods. The Company has not performed a Section 382 analysis. However, if performed, Section 382 may be found to limit potential future utilization of the Company\u2019s NOL carryforwards. The Company also has approximately $30 million in state NOLs which expire on various dates through 2039.\nThe Company has deferred tax assets that are available to offset future taxable income. A valuation allowance is established if it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Management believes that it is more likely than not that all deferred tax assets will not be realized. Accordingly, the Company has established a valuation allowance against a portion of its deferred tax assets at September 30, 2021 and 2020. For the years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets decreased by $1.1 million and increased by $543 thousand, respectively. The acquisition of Hawk Search, Inc. (see Note 16) resulted in the recognition of deferred tax liabilities of approximately $1,181, related to intangible assets. Prior to the business combination, the Company had a full valuation allowance on its net deferred tax assets. The deferred tax liabilities generated from the business combination netted against the Company\u2019s pre-existing deferred tax assets. Consequently, the impact of such resulted in the release of $1,181 of the pre-existing valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets and corresponding deferred tax benefit recognized during the year ended September 30, 2021.\nThe Company recognizes interest accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense. Penalties, if incurred, are recognized as a component of tax expense.\nThe Company is subject to U.S. federal income tax as well as income tax of certain state jurisdictions. The Company has not been audited by the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) or any states in connection with income taxes.

Undistributed earnings of the Company\u2019s foreign subsidiaries amounted to approximately $0 and $85 at September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The 2017 Tax Act subjects a U.S. shareholder to tax on global intangible low-taxed income (\u201cGILTI\u201d) earned by certain foreign subsidiaries. The FASB Staff Q&A, Topic 740, No. 5, Accounting for Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income, provides that an entity may make an accounting policy election to either recognize deferred taxes for temporary basis differences expected to reverse as GILTI in future years, or provide for the tax expense related to GILTI in the year the tax is incurred as a period expense only. Additionally, the 2017 Tax Act provides for a tax benefit to U.S. taxpayers that sell goods or services to foreign customers under the new Foreign Derived Intangible Income Deduction (\"FDII\") rules. As of September 30, 2021, the Company reported no GILTI tax expense for the year ended September 30, 2021. When accounting for uncertain income tax positions, the impact of uncertain tax positions is recognized in the consolidated financial statements if they are more likely than not of being sustained upon examination, based on the technical merits of the position. The Company\u2019s management has determined that the Company has no uncertain tax positions requiring recognition as of September 30, 2021 and 2020. The Company does not expect any change to this determination in the next twelve months.\n16. Acquisitions\nWoorank Acquisition\nOn March 1, 2021, the Company, pursuant to a Share Purchase Agreement (the \u201cWoorank Purchase Agreement\u201d), acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of Woorank, an entity located in Belgium. The Company accounted for the Woorank transaction as a business combination in accordance with ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations. The purchase price consisted of (1) cash paid at closing, (2) deferred cash payable in installments post-closing, (3) a seller note issued to one of the selling shareholders, and (4) amounts payable to one selling shareholder as consideration for assistance with certain matters related to the acquisition for a period of one year from the closing date of the acquisition. The Woorank Purchase Agreement also provides for additional consideration, in the event of achievement of certain revenue targets and operational goals, to the selling shareholders pursuant to three separate earn-out provisions. Under certain conditions, up to \u20ac 600 thousand (approximately $723 thousand) of the purchase price is payable, at the Company\u2019s discretion, in shares of the Company\u2019s common stock, par value $0.001 per share (\u201ccommon stock\u201d), at a price per share equal to the greater of (i) the closing price of the Company\u2019s common stock on the date of issuance or (ii) $3.38. On the closing date, the Company issued 29,433 shares of its common stock for a portion of the purchase price. At September 30, 2021, \u20ac 550 thousand of the remaining purchase price and related earn-out may be settled, at the Company\u2019s option, in shares of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nThe Company accounted for the Woorank transaction as a business combination. The Company determined that the fair value of the gross assets acquired was not concentrated in a single identifiable asset of a group of similar assets. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed have been recognized at their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. The fair value of common stock issued as part of consideration transferred was determined based on the acquisition date closing market price of the Company\u2019s common stock. The estimated fair value of the contingent consideration was determined based on the Company\u2019s expected probability of future payment, discounted using a weighted average cost of capital. The fair value of the contingent consideration is included within Purchase price and contingent consideration payable on the consolidated balance sheets. The fair value of intangible assets was based on valuations using a discounted cash flow model (Level 3 inputs) which requires significant estimates and assumptions, including estimating future revenues and costs. The fair value of debt obligations assumed was based on the interest rates underlying these instruments in relation to the market rates available for similar instruments. The excess of the purchase price over the assets acquired and liabilities assumed was recognized as goodwill. The goodwill is attributable to expected synergies and customer cross selling opportunities between the Company and Woorank.\nBRIDGELINE DIGITAL, INC.\nNOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(in thousands, except share and per share data)\nHawk Search Acquisition\nOn May 28, 2021, the Company, pursuant to a Share Purchase Agreement (the \u201cHawk Purchase Agreement\u201d), acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of Hawk Search, an Illinois corporation. The purchase price consisted of (1) an initial cash payment at closing, (2) issuance of 1,500 shares of the Company\u2019s newly designated Series D Preferred Stock, and (3) deferred cash payable on or before December 31, 2021. The Hawk Purchase Agreement also provides for additional consideration, in the event of achievement of certain revenue targets, to the selling shareholders as an additional earn-out, payable no later than December 31, 2022.\nThe Company accounted for the Hawk Search transaction as a business combination. The Company determined that the fair value of the gross assets acquired was not concentrated in a single identifiable asset of a group of similar assets. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed have be recognized at their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. The fair value of Series D Preferred Stock issued as part of consideration transferred was determined based on the price paid by third-party investors in the Private Placement (see Note 12) which occurred in close proximity to the acquisition date. As more fully described in Note 12, the Series D Preferred Stock contains an embedded beneficial conversion feature. The intrinsic value of $724 was calculated as of the acquisition date. The fair value of contingent consideration was determined based on the probability of achievement of the revenue targets and operational goals, which includes estimating future revenues. The fair value of intangible assets was based on valuations using a discounted cash flow model (Level 3 inputs) which requires significant estimates and assumptions, including estimating future revenues and costs. The excess of the purchase price over the assets acquired and liabilities assumed was recognized as goodwill.

Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure.\n(a) Dismissal of Previous Independent Registered Accounting Firm\nOn February 26, 2021, the Audit Committee of the Company\u2019s board of directors, informed Marcum LLP (\u201cMarcum\u201d) of its decision to dismiss Marcum as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, effective as of that date.\nMarcum\u2019s report on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements as of September 30, 2020 and September 30, 2019 did not contain an adverse opinion or a disclaimer of opinion, nor was it qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles, other than, in each of the years ended September 30, 2020 and September 30, 2019, to include an explanatory paragraph regarding substantial doubt as to the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern.\nDuring the years ended September 30, 2020 and September 30, 2019 and the subsequent interim period through February 26, 2021, there were no \u201cdisagreements\u201d (as such term is defined in Item 304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K and the related instructions to Item 304) with Marcum on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, which disagreements if not resolved to the satisfaction of Marcum would have caused Marcum to make reference to the subject matter of the disagreements or reportable events in connection with its reports on the financial statements for such years. During the years ended September 30, 2020 and September 30, 2019 and the subsequent interim period through February 26, 2021, there have been no \u201creportable events\u201d (as such term is defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K).\nIn accordance with Item 304(a)(3) of Regulation S-K, the Company provided Marcum with a copy of the disclosure it is making in this Current Report on Form 8-K and requested that Marcum furnish the Company with a copy of its letter addressed to the Securities and Exchange Commission stating whether Marcum agrees with the statements made by the Company in response to Item 304(a) of Regulation S-K.\n(b) Appointment of New Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nOn February 27, 2021, the Company\u2019s Audit Committee approved the engagement of PKF O\u2019Connor Davies (\u201cPKF\u201d) as the Company\u2019s new independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2021, effective immediately. During the fiscal years ended September 30, 2020 and September 30, 2019 and through the subsequent interim period as of February 26, 2021, neither the Company, nor any party on behalf of the Company, consulted with PKF regarding either (a) the application of accounting principles to a specified transaction, either completed or proposed, or the audit opinion that might be rendered regarding the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements, and no written report or oral advice was provided to the Company that PKF concluded was an important factor considered by the Company in deciding on any accounting, auditing or financial reporting issue, or (b) any matter subject of any \u201cdisagreement\u201d (as such term is defined in Item 304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K and the related instructions) or a \u201creportable event\u201d (as such term is defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K).",

Controls and Procedures.\nManagement\u2019s Report on Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nWe maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our President and Chief Executive Officer (Principal Executive Officer) and our Chief Financial Officer (Principal Financial and Accounting Officer), as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, as ours are designed to do, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.\nAs of September 30, 2021, the end of our fiscal year covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on the foregoing, we concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this annual report.\nManagement\u2019s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Responsibility estimates and judgments by management are required to assess the expected benefits and related costs of control procedures. The objectives of internal control include providing management with reasonable, but not absolute, assurance that assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorized use or disposition, and that transactions are executed in accordance with management\u2019s authorization and recorded properly to permit the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2021. In making this assessment, our management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (\u201cCOSO\u201d) in the 2013 Internal Control-Integrated Framework. Our management has concluded that as of September 30, 2021, our internal control over financial reporting is effective in providing reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Our management reviewed the results of its assessment with our Board of Directors.\nThis annual report does not include an attestation report of the Company\u2019s registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management\u2019s report was not subject to attestation by the Company\u2019s registered public accounting firm pursuant to a permanent exemption from the internal control audit requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.\nInherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls\nInternal control over financial reporting has inherent limitations which include but are not limited to the use of independent professionals for advice and guidance, interpretation of existing and/or changing rules and principles, segregation of management duties, scale of organization, and personnel factors. Internal control over financial reporting is a process which involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures. Internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper management override. Provided its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis; however, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process and it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere have been no significant changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021 that have materially, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.",
