    "item_1": "ITEM 1. BUSINESS\nDescription of Business\nWe are the world\u2019s leading cloud software company powering social good. Serving the entire social good community-nonprofits, higher education institutions, K-12 schools, healthcare organizations, faith communities, arts and cultural organizations, foundations, companies and individual change agents-we connect and empower organizations and individuals to increase their impact through cloud software, services, data intelligence and expertise. Blackbaud brings nearly four decades of leadership to this sector: since originally incorporating in New York in 1982 and later reincorporating as a South Carolina corporation in 1991 and as a Delaware corporation in 2004, our tailored portfolio of software and services has grown to support the unique needs of vertical markets, with solutions for fundraising and CRM, marketing, advocacy, peer-to-peer fundraising, corporate social responsibility, school management, ticketing, grantmaking, financial management, payment processing and analytics. Our solutions are designed to meet the needs of virtually all types of organizations in the social good community, from major global institutions to small charities to individuals. At the end of 2020, we had over 45,000 customers located in over 100 countries, with millions of users. We are deeply proud to play a part in our customers\u2019 success in their missions to provide healthcare and cure diseases, advance education, preserve and share arts and culture, protect the environment, support those in need and much more.\nMarket Overview\nThe social good industry is significant, spanning far beyond philanthropy, and our addressable market is substantial and growing\nWorldwide there are millions of social good organizations including nonprofits, foundations, companies, education institutions and healthcare organizations. Billions of individuals are also active participants in the social good community by donating funds, volunteering their time, advocating for a cause, receiving services from or otherwise engaging with social good organizations.\nOur estimated current total addressable market (\"TAM\") is greater than $10 billion. This includes expansions into new and near adjacencies in 2019, including our Cloud Solution for Faith Communities, our expanded Cloud Solution for Higher Education, as well as our acquisition of YourCause Holdings, LLC (\"YourCause\") in January 2019.\nTraditional methods of fundraising and organizational management are often costly and inefficient\nMany social good organizations use manual methods or software applications not specifically designed for fundraising and organizational management for institutions like theirs. Such methods are often costly and inefficient because of the difficulties in effectively collecting, sharing and using donation-related information. Furthermore, general purpose software applications frequently have limited functionality for the unique needs of our customer base and do not efficiently integrate multiple databases. Some social good organizations have developed proprietary software, but doing so is expensive, requiring on-site technical personnel for development, implementation and maintenance.\nThe nonprofit industry faces particular operational challenges\nNonprofit organizations, education institutions, healthcare organizations and houses of worship must efficiently:\n\u2022Solicit funds and build relationships with major donors;\n\u2022Garner small cash contributions from numerous contributors;\n\u2022Manage and develop complex relationships with large numbers of constituents;\n2020 Form 10-K\nBlackbaud, Inc.\n\u2022Advocate for policies and behaviors that advance their cause or institution;\n\u2022Communicate their accomplishments and the importance of their mission online and offline;\n\u2022Comply with complex accounting, tax and reporting requirements that differ from those for traditional businesses;\n\u2022Solicit cash and in-kind contributions from businesses to help raise money or deliver products and services;\n\u2022Provide a wide array of programs and services to individual constituents and beneficiaries; and\n\u2022Improve the data collection and information sharing capabilities of their employees, volunteers and donors by creating and providing distributed access to centralized databases.\nBecause of these challenges, we believe nonprofits, education institutions, healthcare organizations and houses of worship can benefit from software applications and services specifically designed to serve their particular needs and workflows to grow revenue, work effectively and accomplish their missions.\nCompanies, grantmaking institutions and foundations also face unique challenges\nCompanies, grantmaking institutions and foundations, face their own unique challenges in their social good efforts, including the need to:\n\u2022Quantify and improve the impact of their grants;\n\u2022Cultivate better relationships with grantees;\n\u2022Achieve better internal collaboration and alignment with board members, reviewers and other stakeholders;\n\u2022Illustrate the impact of their corporate philanthropy efforts to the communities they serve;\n\u2022Engage employees in meaningful volunteering, giving and other activities;\n\u2022Ensure that their philanthropic efforts align with their business initiatives;\n\u2022Manage all of a foundation's activities, including fundraising and accounting;\n\u2022Expand the reach of their fundraising efforts; and\n\u2022Cultivate new and existing donors.\nStrategy\nOur objective is to maintain and extend our position as the leading provider of cloud software and services for the global social good community, supporting our customers' missions from securing resources, managing their operations, to delivering their programs and measuring their impact. Our key strategies for achieving this objective are described below.\n2020 Form 10-K\nBlackbaud, Inc.\nExecute on our Four-Point Growth Strategy\nDuring 2020, we continued to execute our four-point growth strategy targeted to drive solution and service innovation, quality enhancement, increased operating efficiency and improved financial performance:\n1.Delight Customers with Innovative Cloud Solutions\nThis strategy reflects our relentless focus on driving value and outcomes for our customers through our solutions. Blackbaud SKY\u00ae, our platform for cloud innovation, is a core tenant of this strategy and continues to power an elevated level of innovation by our engineers. It is also enabling our growing ecosystem of partners who are also passionate about social good, to extend and expand the capabilities available to our customers. During 2020, we continued making critical investments in research and development and increased our engineering hiring during the fourth quarter. We also released the Blackbaud Marketplace during 2020, offering curated third-party apps, enabling organizations of all types and sizes to discover new ways to amplify their impact by enhancing their best-of-breed Blackbaud solutions with specialized capabilities like connecting bidders at fundraising auctions, tracking branded merchandise purchased in an online store or texting volunteers about an upcoming event.\nThe customers we serve require vertical specific business solutions to automate their operations. Throughout 2020, we have remained focused on driving value and outcomes for our customers. We reprioritized and expedited product enhancements to support our customers' needs, especially in light of COVID-19 and the continued shift to virtual, digital-first operating models. For example, we released fitness tracking integration in Blackbaud\u2019s peer-to-peer fundraising portfolio, a new virtual prayer wall enabling congregants at houses of worship to share and respond to prayer requests online, text messaging capabilities for scholarship directors and higher education institutions to ensure no funds were going unutilized and expanded the global capabilities of YourCause CSRConnect making it easier for companies to bring employees across geographies together in support of causes around the world.\nBlackbaud Peer-to-Peer Fundraising powered by JustGiving continues to gain traction. During 2020, we migrated everydayhero customers over to Blackbaud Peer-to-Peer Fundraising powered by JustGiving and sunset the everydayhero product as we continue to rationalize our portfolio while continuing to delight our customers with innovative cloud solutions.\n2.Drive Sales Effectiveness\nWe have been investing in sales and marketing to better address our market opportunity with a focus on digital lead generation. One way we are equipping our salesforce to be more effective is by investing in the necessary technology and resources to efficiently drive an increased number of quality leads and better cover our large addressable market. We have implemented software tools to enhance our digital footprint and drive lead generation across the company. We are taking a multi-touch attribution approach to measuring the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns to drive efficiency in our go-to-market efforts and improve returns on our marketing dollars. This is just one of many examples of how we are optimizing our structure, tools and processes to better address our large vertical market opportunities. We have also taken lessons learned throughout 2020 and re-evaluated elements of our go-to-market strategy with a digital-first mindset and we have a significant opportunity to leverage the investments into digital to reduce our customer acquisition cost and increase our sales velocity, ultimately, driving a more scalable and cost-effective go-to-market model.\n3.Expand TAM\nWe did not complete any acquisitions during 2020 as we have remained vigilantly focused on supporting our customers and employees during this time. We remain active in the evaluation of opportunities to further expand our addressable market through acquisitions and internal product development. We believe we have significant opportunities in front of us as we are less than 10% penetrated into a total addressable market of over $10 billion.\n4.Improve Operating Efficiency\nWe are also focused on operational efficiency to strengthen the business and position us for long-term success. During 2020, we pivoted to place a greater emphasis on profit in alignment with the balanced approach management takes to operating the business. As a result of the pandemic, our near term visibility into revenue growth was impacted and we took certain actions early on to ensure our liquidity (see Note 2 to our consolidated\n2020 Form 10-K\nBlackbaud, Inc.\nfinancial statements in this report for a discussion of some of these actions) and shifted more of our focus to profitability. Our employees switched to working fully remote at the onset of the pandemic and the business continued operating smoothly. This caused us to re-evaluate our workforce strategy and when employees return to the office, we will have more employees working remotely either part-time or full-time, even within our hub locations. As a result, we revisited our real estate strategy with a focus on optimizing our footprint for the future of work at Blackbaud, including the purchase of our LEED (Leadership in Energy & Environmental Design) Gold certified global headquarters facility in Charleston, South Carolina (\"Global Headquarters Facility\") and exit of certain office leases globally, as we will not need as much of an office footprint going forward. Our aim is optimizing our office utilization, improving our geographic sales coverage and enhancing our employees' daily experience to improve productivity and effectiveness.\nDelight Our Customers\nWe intend to make our customers' experience with us effective, efficient and satisfying from their initial interest in our solutions and services through their decision to purchase, engage with customer support and implement and use our solutions. We continue to focus on initiatives aimed at improving the consistency and quality of user experience across our offerings. We also continue to evolve the way we package and sell our offerings to provide high quality and value combined with flexibility to meet the unique needs of our existing and prospective customers. For example, we have increased the number of our cloud solutions sold under a subscription pricing model, which can make it easier for customers to purchase our solutions. In addition, we are continuing to integrate value-adding capabilities such as payment services, analytics and business intelligence into our suite of solutions to better address our customers' needs with comprehensive offerings. We will continue to focus on providing the highest level of solution support, enhancing our existing solutions, extending our solutions through open APIs and developing new solutions and services designed to help our customers be more effective and achieve their missions.\nAttract and Retain Top Talent and Actively Engage Employee Base\nOur higher purpose is to help good take over the world, and we have incredible customers whose missions make the world a better place. Driven by this purpose, our employees come to work every day knowing that they can make a real difference with our customers as they pursue their missions. Collaboration, innovation and high standards are core to our culture and help to enable the great work we do. We strive to hire and retain the best employees and provide a workplace where their talents and potential are realized. For additional information, see \u201cHuman Capital Resources\u201d below.\nDrive Strength in Our Sector as an Industry Thought Leader\nIn our nearly 40 years of operation, we have gained significant insight into the overall market and industry segments in which we operate. We produce a wide range of thought leadership resources, including blogs, monthly indices and white papers, which provide insights and guidance to the social good community. We also participate in and convene a number of industry forums, where we exchange views and engage with industry and government leaders. Our annual user conference, bbcon\u00ae, serves in part as a forum to offer thought leadership to our customers, as do other market-specific user conferences, events and customer gatherings. The Blackbaud Institute for Philanthropic Impact (the \"Blackbaud Institute\") brings together leading experts in philanthropy to develop and share leading-edge research and insight that accelerates the impact of the social good community. The research and reports the Blackbaud Institute produces serve to strengthen the social good community as a whole. sgENGAGE, our blog and podcast, provides free best practices resources that drive impact across the social good community, as well.\nLast year, we announced our partnership with One Million by One Million (\"1Mby1M\") to launch the Social Good Start-up Challenge focused on tech start-ups on a mission to solve problems that matter to the social good community. In 2020, we announced we\u2019ve expanded this initiative into the Blackbaud Social Good Startup Program, a year-long accelerator designed to support innovative startups with the potential to impact the ecosystem of good. In alignment with our commitment to diversity in the tech community, we focused our January 2021 cohort on founders from underrepresented backgrounds. Last year, we also announced The Explorer by Blackbaud Institute, the premier online knowledge base for information and statistics about social good. Content is updated regularly and is provided free of charge to the public as a part of Blackbaud\u2019s give-back philosophy. We intend to expand these activities and further build our reputation as a thought leader within the industry.\n2020 Form 10-K\nBlackbaud, Inc.\nSolutions and Services\nWe offer the social good community comprehensive cloud solutions to advance their missions, backed by our data intelligence services, which deliver insights powered by what we believe to be the world's most robust philanthropic data set.

There are millions of users of our solutions in more than 100 countries. Our largest single customer accounted for less than 1% of our 2020 consolidated revenue.\nSales and Marketing\nMost of our solutions and related services are sold through our direct sales force. Our direct sales force is complemented by a team of business development representatives responsible for sales lead generation and qualification. These sales and marketing professionals are primarily located throughout the United States, the U.K., Canada and Australia. As of December 31, 2020, we had 367 direct sales employees.\nWe conduct marketing programs to create brand recognition and market awareness for our solutions and services. Our marketing efforts include participation at trade shows, technical conferences and technology seminars, publication of technical and educational articles in industry journals, preparation of competitive analyses and the use of software tools to enhance our digital footprint and drive lead generation. Our customers and strategic partners provide references and recommendations that we often feature in our advertising and promotional activities.\nWe believe relationships with third parties can enhance our sales and marketing efforts. We have and will continue to establish additional relationships with companies that provide services to the philanthropic industry, such as consultants, educators, publishers, financial service providers, complementary technology providers and data providers. These companies promote or complement our solutions and provide us access to new customers.\nCompetition\nThe market for software and related services in the philanthropic industry is competitive and highly fragmented. For certain areas of the market, entry barriers are low, as general tools for small businesses can usually be configured to manage the most basic marketing, contact management, and accounting needs of social good organizations. In parallel, as software development evolves from a highly-complex tradecraft with nuanced understanding of architectural patterns and discrete languages, to click-to-code and drag-and-drop development with natively cloud-based infrastructure, it becomes easier for competitors to quickly spin up basic applications with embedded security and functionality. However, once basic needs are met, programs unique to social good organizations like fundraising, gift and grant management, and peer-to-peer activism require highly specialized tools to configure and transform general business software to match the complexities of the industry. These specialized applications have a higher barrier of entry as they require industry insight to accurately articulate the business workflow that generates the requirements for software products. Moreover, because social good organizations rely heavily on relationships with and among their supporters, integration of systems drives value beyond mere efficiency. Hence, we believe our insight, the full spectrum of our current solutions and our ability to deliver on future solutions makes us a strong competitor. We expect to continue to see new entrants as focus on social investment solutions increases to satisfy Millennial and Gen Z donors, the barriers of entry continue to decline with natively cloud solutions and social good organizations more readily require digital transformation of business processes and data-driven decision making.\n2020 Form 10-K\nBlackbaud, Inc.\nOur competition falls into four primary categories:\n\u2022Niche products are usually developed as a solution for a single problem at an organization and are adopted by similar organizations to solve a specialized need. These are typically offered by vendors who may have deep industry expertise but may not have the resources to expand beyond a specialized area. We believe we compete against these solutions by offering a set of integrated solutions rather than a single point solution, which we believe improves the overall customer experience. In addition, our open platform allows integration to specialized applications so the opportunity for disruption from these competitors is minimized.\n\u2022Vertical-specific solutions are offered by competitors seeking to meet the enterprise-wide needs of a specific sub-segment of social good community. Typically, these solutions are offered by vendors who may offer either a point solution or integrated suite of products used by a vertical. We believe we compete successfully against these competitors through a combination of our integrated suite of offerings within verticals where we compete, offering solutions with market leading robustness as well as the scale, reach, and reputation of our organization.\n\u2022General business software vendors, such as Salesforce.com and Oracle, compete with us in certain areas of our business. While there is a growing trend toward social investment that is prompting philanthropic solutions from these general business vendors, most do not have a complete nonprofit specific focus and, therefore, do not offer or intend to offer nonprofit-specific versions for outside sales. However, there is a subset of general business software competitors who have introduced nonprofit-specific versions of their products. These products generally do not satisfy the needs of nonprofits from end-to-end as they were not designed to support the specific needs of nonprofits during the original architecture, design, and requirements elicitation phases; therefore, we believe that because these products were not originally designed for nonprofits, they are not yet fully capable of meeting market needs without significant customization. The significant customization required to transform general business products into nonprofit solutions often requires the use of consultants to guide the implementation, without which, leave the adoption of general business software limited to very basic operations and simple needs. We believe our solutions compete successfully against general business software as a nonprofit\u2019s needs grow more complex. As a result, we believe we can compete successfully to meet nonprofit-specific requirements, often integrating with general business platforms used for their more generalized operations.\n\u2022Consumer-oriented fundraising platforms, such as GoFundMe, Virgin Money Giving and Facebook compete with our business where consumers raise funds directly. To drive adoption of their platforms, these vendors rely on a combination of direct-to-consumer marketing, marketing to nonprofits who in turn market to their supporters, and marketing to intermediate entities such as an event sponsor who will market to participants. We believe we compete well in this market through a combination of positive brand recognition among all three of these groups and the combination of our consumer- and organization-oriented tools relative to those of the competition.\nLess frequently, we compete with providers of traditional, non-automated fundraising service providers, including parties providing services in support of traditional direct mail or email campaigns, special events fundraising, peer to peer, telemarketing and personal solicitations. We believe we compete successfully against these traditional fundraising service providers, primarily because our solutions and services are more automated, more robust, more tailored to the needs of nonprofit organization and more efficient.\nTechnology and Architecture\nBlackbaud SKY provides the foundation for all of Blackbaud\u2019s cloud solutions, enabling highly available and easy-to-use cloud capabilities that integrate seamlessly and offering best-in-class infrastructure, integrated shared services, and modern, effective, purpose-built solutions.

SKY API enables developers to augment Blackbaud solutions with industry-standard REST APIs, standards-based authentication protocols, and a best-in-class developer experience. SKY UX allows developers to create applications with the same consistent, cohesive user interface\n2020 Form 10-K\nBlackbaud, Inc.\nas Blackbaud\u2019s native solutions using an open source framework that implements Blackbaud design patterns and provides guidelines and tooling for the entire application lifecycle. These tools enable Blackbaud customers to benefit not just from the innovation of Blackbaud\u2019s own large team of developers, but also from an exponentially larger community of partners and third-party developers.\nThe development strategy for all Blackbaud cloud solutions emphasizes:\n\u2022Flexibility: Customers can extend our component-based architecture to accommodate changing demands without modifying source code.\n\u2022Adaptability: The architecture of our applications allows us to easily add functionality or integrate with third-party applications to adapt to customer needs and market demands.\n\u2022Scalability: Scalable architecture and the performance, capacity and load balancing of our customers' industry-standard web servers and databases ensure that applications can scale to meet the needs of large organizations.\nIntellectual Property and Other Proprietary Rights\nTo protect our intellectual property, we rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws in various jurisdictions, as well as employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements and confidentiality procedures. We maintain many trademarks, including, but not limited to \u201cBlackbaud,\u201d \u201cRaiser's Edge NXT\u201d and \u201cLuminate.\u201d We currently have one active patent on our technology and have two pending patent applications.\nHuman Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had over 3,100 employees, none of whom are represented by unions or are covered by collective bargaining agreements. We are not involved in any material disputes with any of our employees, and we believe that relations with our employees are strong.\nWe benefit from an engaged and driven employee base motivated to join the company by our higher purpose, which is \"to help good take over the world.\" Our purpose attracts talented, competitive applicants, with 92% of employees saying our focus on social good organizations was a driver in their decision to join the company. This differentiator not only builds stronger employee engagement, but it helps us to provide a higher level of service to our customers across the social good community, with 92% of employees reporting that they actively serve as volunteers and 23% serving on a nonprofit board or committee - direct experience that enables them to better serve our customer base.\nBlackbaud also attracts talented employees through effective and targeted recruiting strategies. In 2020, Blackbaud announced the launch of a new workforce strategy, allowing for many employees to have the option to work from other geographic locations within the country of the position, helping to expand the pool of qualified applicants for roles.\nEmployee engagement is a focus at Blackbaud, and we continually work to understand what matters and to make our workplace better to attract, develop, and retain talent. Every manager at Blackbaud is required to take a multi-course \"Engagement Labs\" training designed to equip them with the practical skills to ensure their teams are highly engaged. We assess and measure progress on engagement and growth opportunities at the individual level through quarterly check-ins and a global career framework that guides employee progression on both management and individual contributor career paths; we also assess engagement on the team and company level through regular employee surveying. We enable employees to have opportunities for career development through on-demand and company-led trainings. Our compensation framework is designed so that employees are compensated equitably and competitively, including through base salary, variable pay, equity awards and benefits. We also seek to support the whole person, through benefits that support wellness and financial health.\nUltimately, we believe that Blackbaud is an excellent place to work due to our active participation in the Ecosystem of Good\u00ae: we govern our business ethically, contribute to causes and communities that matter to our employees through corporate philanthropy, we pursue sustainability, and we work every day to ensure our workplace is supportive, inclusive and engaging. We offer an array of philanthropy programs aimed at engaging our employees as agents of good, including matching gifts, competitive grants that honor noteworthy examples of volunteerism, employee-led\n2020 Form 10-K\nBlackbaud, Inc.\ngrant committees, skills-based volunteerism initiatives, as well as science, technology, engineering and mathematics focused community programs.\nOur commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion supports our efforts to attract, develop and retain a high-performing employee base. In September 2020, we welcomed our first Diversity and Inclusion Officer, as part of our strategy to further accelerate our diversity, inclusion and belonging efforts, while continuing to strengthen relationships with our people and the communities in which we operate. This new leadership focus will amplify and accelerate the significant initiatives already in place at Blackbaud, including: ongoing unconscious bias workshops; respect in the workplace training for all employees and enhanced training for managers; business networking affinity groups, including veterans, LGBTQ employees, women in technology, women in sales, African American employees and employees interested in sustainability.\nSeasonality\nFor a discussion of seasonal variations in our business, see \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations - Seasonality\u201d in Item 7 in this report.\nWorking Capital\nFor a discussion of our working capital practices, see \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d in Item 7 in this report.\nAvailable Information\nOur website address is www.blackbaud.com.

    "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nOur business operations face a number of risks. These risks should be read and considered with other information provided in this report.\nStrategic Risks\nOur failure to compete successfully could cause our revenue or market share to decline.\nOur market is highly competitive and rapidly evolving, and there are limited barriers to entry for many segments of this market.\nThe companies we compete with and other potential competitors may have greater financial, technical and marketing resources and generate greater revenue and better name recognition than we do. Also, a large diversified software enterprise could decide to enter the market directly, including through acquisitions. Competitive pressures can adversely impact our business by limiting the prices we can charge our customers and making the adoption and renewal of our solutions more difficult.\nOur competitors might also establish or strengthen cooperative relationships with resellers and third-party consulting firms or other parties with whom we have had relationships, thereby limiting our ability to promote our solutions.\nThese competitive pressures could cause our revenue and market share to decline.\nBecause competition for highly qualified personnel is intense, we might not be able to attract and retain key personnel needed to support our planned growth.\nTo meet our objectives successfully, we must attract and retain highly qualified personnel with specialized skill sets. If we are unable to attract and retain suitably qualified management, there could be a material adverse impact on our business.\nFurther, we use equity incentive programs and equity awards in lieu of cash as part of our overall employee compensation agreements to both attract and retain personnel. A decline in our stock price could negatively impact the value of these equity incentive and related compensation programs as retention and recruiting tools. We may need to create new or additional equity incentive programs and/or compensation packages to remain competitive, which could be dilutive to our existing stockholders and/or adversely affect our results of operations.\nMore rapid than expected success in implementing our strategic shift from a license-based and one-time services business model to a cloud subscription business model could negatively impact our total revenue growth and financial performance.\nWe continue to intentionally shift our focus towards selling cloud subscription solutions, which generally require less customization services. Also, our cloud solution contracts now frequently include subscription-based professional, analytic and training services. This strategic shift to migrate our existing customers and sell new customers our cloud subscription solutions results in a decrease in our one-time services contracts and revenue. Although our business model seeks to anticipate the rate of migration and resulting negative impact on our total revenue growth, more rapid than\n2020 Form 10-K\nBlackbaud, Inc.\nexpected success in implementing this strategic shift could negatively impact our total revenue growth and financial performance.\nThe market for software and services for the social good community might not grow and the organizations in that community might not continue to adopt our solutions and services.\nMany organizations in the social good community, including nonprofits, foundations, companies, education institutions and healthcare organizations, have not traditionally used integrated and comprehensive software and services for their specific needs. We cannot be certain that the market for such solutions and services will continue to develop and grow or that these organizations will elect to adopt our solutions and services rather than continue to use traditional, less automated methods, attempt to develop software internally, rely upon legacy software systems, or use software solutions not specifically designed for this market. Organizations that have already invested substantial resources in other fundraising methods or other non-integrated software solutions might be reluctant to adopt our solutions and services to supplement or replace their existing systems or methods. In addition, the implementation of one or more of our software solutions can involve significant capital commitments by our customers, which they may be unwilling or unable to make, especially due to disruption in the social good community due to COVID-19. If demand for and market acceptance of our solutions and services does not increase, we might not grow our business as we expect.\nIf we fail to respond to technological changes or successfully introduce new and improved solutions, our competitive position may be harmed and our business may suffer.\nThe introduction of solutions encompassing new technologies can render existing solutions obsolete and unmarketable. As a result, our future success will depend, in part, upon our ability to continue to enhance existing solutions and develop and introduce in a timely manner or acquire new solutions that keep pace with technological developments, satisfy increasingly sophisticated customer requirements and achieve market acceptance. If we are unable to develop or acquire on a timely and cost-effective basis new software solutions or enhancements to existing solutions or if such new solutions or enhancements do not achieve market acceptance, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected.\nIf we do not successfully address the risks inherent in the expansion of our international operations, our business could suffer.\nWe currently have non-U.S. operations primarily in the U.K., Canada, Australia and Costa Rica, and we intend to expand further into international markets. Expansion of our international operations will require a significant amount of attention from our management and substantial financial resources and might require us to add qualified management in these markets. Our direct sales model requires us to attract, retain and manage qualified sales personnel capable of selling into markets outside the United States. In some cases, our costs of sales might increase if our customers require us to sell through local distributors. If we are unable to grow our international operations in a cost-effective and timely manner, our business and operating results could be harmed.\nWe expect that an increasing portion of our international revenues will be denominated in foreign currencies, subjecting us to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. If we expand our international operations, exposures to gains and losses on foreign currency transactions may increase.\nDoing business internationally involves additional risks that could harm our operating results. Along with risks similar to those faced by our U.S. operations, our international operations are also subject to risks related to differing legal, political, social and regulatory requirements and economic conditions, including:\n\u2022the imposition of additional withholding taxes or other tax on our foreign income, tariffs or restrictions on foreign trade or investment, including currency exchange controls;\n\u2022greater risk of a failure of our employees and partners to comply with both U.S. and foreign laws, including antitrust regulations, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010, and any trade regulations ensuring fair trade practices; and\n\u2022the imposition of, or unexpected adverse changes in, foreign laws or regulatory requirements, including those pertaining to export restrictions, privacy and data protection, trade and employment restrictions and intellectual protections.\n2020 Form 10-K\nBlackbaud, Inc.\nUnfavorable media coverage related to peer-to-peer fundraising campaigns on our social platforms could negatively impact our business.\nOur online social giving platforms receive a high degree of media coverage for particularly news-worthy or controversial fundraising campaigns, as well as for our fee-based business model. Although our terms of service provide express limitations on the platforms' user-initiated fundraising campaigns and reserve our right to remove content that violates our terms of service, it may not always be possible to remove such content prior to it receiving attention in the media. Negative publicity related to our online social giving platforms could have an adverse effect on the size, engagement and loyalty of our user base and could result in decreased revenue, which could adversely affect our business and financial results.\nAcquisitions could be difficult to consummate and integrate into our operations, and they could disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value or impair our financial results.\nAs part of our business strategy, we will continue from time to time to seek to grow our business through acquisitions of new or complementary businesses, technologies or products that we believe can improve our ability to compete in our existing customer markets or allow us to enter new markets. The potential risks associated with acquisitions and investment transactions include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022failure to realize anticipated returns on investment, cost savings and synergies;\n\u2022difficulty in assimilating the operations, policies and personnel of the acquired company;\n\u2022unanticipated costs associated with acquisitions;\n\u2022challenges in combining product offerings and entering into new markets in which we may not have experience;\n\u2022distraction of management\u2019s attention from normal business operations;\n\u2022potential loss of key employees of the acquired company;\n\u2022difficulty implementing effective internal controls over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures;\n\u2022impairment of relationships with customers or suppliers; and\n\u2022issues not discovered in due diligence, which may include product quality issues or legal or other contingencies.\nAcquisitions may also result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities, the expenditure of available cash, and amortization expenses or write-downs related to intangible assets such as goodwill, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results or financial condition. We may experience risks relating to the challenges and costs of closing a business combination and the risk that an announced business combination may not close. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in making additional acquisitions in the future or in integrating or executing on our business plan for existing or future acquisitions.\nA reduction in the growth or amount of charitable giving could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nA large percentage of our customers are nonprofits, foundations, education institutions, healthcare organizations and other members of the social good community that fully or partially rely on charitable donations. If charitable giving, including online giving, does not continue to grow or declines, it could limit our current and potential customers' ability to use and pay for our solutions and services, which could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nIn addition, we derive a significant portion of our revenue from transaction-based payment processing fees that we collect from our customers through our Blackbaud Merchant Services solution, which enables our customers' donors to make donations and purchase goods and services using various payment options. A reduction in the growth of, or a decline in, charitable giving to these customers, whether due to deteriorating general economic conditions, the impact of recent or future changes to applicable tax laws, or otherwise, could negatively impact the volume and size of such payment processing transactions and thereby adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\n2020 Form 10-K\nBlackbaud, Inc.\nOur failure to obtain licenses for, or our use of, third-party technologies could harm our business.\nWe expect to continue licensing technologies from third parties, including applications used in our research and development activities, technologies which are integrated into our solutions and solutions that we resell. We believe that the loss of any third-party technologies currently integrated into our solutions could have a material adverse effect on our business. Our inability in the future to obtain any third-party licenses on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, could delay future solution development until equivalent technology can be identified, licensed or developed and integrated. This inability in turn could harm our business and operating results.\nOur use of third-party technologies also exposes us to increased risks including, but not limited to, risks associated with the integration of new technology into our solutions, the diversion of our resources from development of our own proprietary technology and our inability to generate revenue from licensed technology sufficient to offset associated acquisition and maintenance costs.\nThe U.K.'s departure from the European Union (\"E.U.\") could adversely affect us.\nThe U.K. held a referendum on June 23, 2016 on its membership in the E.U., in which a majority of U.K. voters voted to exit the E.U. (commonly referred to as \"Brexit\"). Thereafter, the E.U. and the U.K. engaged in extensive negotiations designed to reach agreement regarding the future terms of the U.K.'s relationship with the E.U. Effective January 31, 2020, the U.K. is no longer a member of the E.U., and an agreed post-Brexit transition period expired on December 31, 2020. Effective January 1, 2021, the relationship between the U.K. and the E.U. is governed primarily by the new Trade and Cooperation Agreement (the \u201cTCA\u201d), which sets forth, among other things, terms regarding the trade of goods and services, workers\u2019 rights and social and environmental matters. Separate negotiations are expected to continue regarding, among other things, data sharing, data privacy and financial services, and certain terms of the TCA contain agreed expiration dates. Because we currently conduct business in the U.K. and in Europe, the U.K.\u2019s exit from the E.U. under such circumstances creates uncertainty and could affect the business of and/or our relationships with our customers and partners as well as the value of the British Pound and the Euro relative to the U.S. dollar. The ultimate effects of Brexit on us, including those mentioned above and others we cannot now anticipate, are difficult to predict and could adversely affect our business, business opportunities, results of operations or financial condition in both the short-term and thereafter.\nOperational Risks\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted, and is expected to continue to disrupt, our business, which is likely to adversely affect our operations and financial performance.\nThe outbreak of COVID-19 in countries across the globe, including each country in which we currently operate, has adversely impacted the U.S. and global economies. We have experienced disruptions to our business thus far from COVID-19, and the pandemic continues to impact each of our markets. Governmental authorities have taken, and continue to take, countermeasures to slow the outbreak, including shelter-in-place and business closure orders and large-scale restrictions on travel. Furthermore, because the pandemic is a rapidly evolving situation, we cannot anticipate with certainty the length, scope or severity of such restrictions in the jurisdictions in which we operate.\nCertain vertical markets we serve are especially vulnerable to the ongoing global business disruption. For example:\n\u2022Many arts and cultural organizations, including museums, zoos, performing arts centers and theaters, among others, have had to cancel events or have seen a significant decline in attendance due to COVID-19. Many of these organizations have also suspended their operations temporarily.\n\u2022We believe that a number of K-12 private schools, that would have ordinarily considered purchasing our cloud solutions for the 2020-2021 academic school year, have delayed their expenditure decisions due to the uncertainty of COVID-19.\n\u2022A number of our nonprofit customers have also been negatively impacted by the postponement or cancellation of mass-participation events, such as marathons and other endurance sporting events, galas, auctions and other fundraisers.\n2020 Form 10-K\nBlackbaud, Inc.\nWe believe that COVID-19 has impacted and will continue to impact all of our vertical markets across all of our geographies to some degree, but the significance and duration of the impact on our business cannot be determined at this time due to numerous uncertainties, including the duration of the outbreak, travel restrictions and business closures, the effectiveness of vaccination programs and other actions taken to contain the disease and other unforeseeable consequences. This impact could include:\n\u2022further declines in customer demand and our ability to build pipeline of new customer contracts;\n\u2022continued elongated sales cycles;\n\u2022our relationship with, and the financial and operational capacities of, our service providers, suppliers and business partners, including their ability to fulfill their obligations to us;\n\u2022further declines in our customers' ability to pay for our solutions and services;\n\u2022reduced workforce availability and productivity due to working remotely using different technologies and potential health effects and concerns;\n\u2022risks associated with our indebtedness (including available borrowing capacity, compliance with financial covenants and ability to refinance or repay indebtedness on favorable terms);\n\u2022the adequacy of our cash flows and earnings and other conditions that may affect our liquidity;\n\u2022disruptions to our technology network and other critical systems; and\n\u2022impairment charges against our goodwill and other intangible assets, operating lease right-of-use assets and other long-lived assets.\nWe believe that business disruption relating to COVID-19 will continue to negatively impact the U.S. and global economies and may continue to materially adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nDefects, delays or interruptions in our cloud solutions and hosting services could diminish demand for these services and subject us to substantial liability.\nWe currently utilize data center hosting facilities to provide cloud solutions to most of our subscription customers and hosting services to our on-premise license customers. Any damage to, or failure of, these data center systems generally could result in interruptions in service to our customers, notwithstanding any business continuity or disaster recovery agreements that may currently be in place at these facilities. Because our cloud solutions and hosting service offerings are complex and we have incorporated a variety of new computer hardware and software systems at our data centers, our services might have errors or defects that users identify after they begin using our services. This could result in unanticipated downtime for our customers and harm to our reputation and business results. Internet-based services sometimes contain undetected errors when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released. We have from time to time found defects in our web-based services and new errors might again be detected in the future. In addition, our customers might use our Internet-based offerings in unanticipated ways that cause a disruption in service for other customers attempting to access their data.\nBecause our customers use these services for important aspects of their businesses, any defects, delays or disruptions in service or other performance problems with our services could hurt our reputation and damage our customers' businesses. If that occurs, customers could elect to cancel their service, delay or withhold payment to us, not purchase from us in the future or make claims against us, which could result in an increase in our provision for credit losses, an increase in collection cycles for accounts receivable or the expense and risk of litigation. Any of these could harm our business and reputation.\nMaterial defects or errors in the software we use to deliver our services could harm our reputation, result in significant costs to us and impair our ability to sell our services.\nThe software applications underlying our services are inherently complex and may contain material defects or errors, particularly when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released. We have from time to time found defects in our software, and new errors in our existing software may be detected in the future.\n2020 Form 10-K\nBlackbaud, Inc.\nAfter the release of our software, defects or errors may also be identified from time to time by our internal team and our customers. The costs incurred in correcting any material defects or errors in our software may be substantial and could harm our operating results. Furthermore, our customers may use our software together with solutions from other companies. As a result, when problems occur, it might be difficult to identify the source of the problem. Even when our software does not cause these problems, the existence of these errors might cause us to incur significant costs, divert the attention of our technical personnel from our solution development efforts, impact our reputation and cause significant customer relations problems.\nIf we are unable, or our customers believe we may be unable, to detect and prevent unauthorized use of payment card or other private financial or personal information, we could be subject to financial liability, our reputation could be harmed and customers may be reluctant to use our solutions and services.\nThe rules of payment card associations in which we participate require that we comply with Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (\"PCI DSS\") in order to preserve security of payment card data. Under PCI DSS, we are required to adopt and implement internal controls over the use, storage and security of payment card data to help prevent card fraud. Conforming our solutions and services to PCI DSS or other payment services related regulations or requirements imposed by payment networks or our customers or payment processing partners is expensive and time-consuming. However, failure to comply may subject us to fines, penalties, damages and civil liability, may impair the security of payment card data in our possession, and may harm our reputation and our business prospects, including by limiting our ability to process transactions. All Blackbaud products in scope for PCI DSS compliance meet applicable PCI DSS security requirements.\nIn addition, we routinely subject our various data protection processes and controls to voluntary third-party review, audit or reporting, including, for example, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants\u2019 System and Organization Controls (\u201cSOC\u201d) reporting. Failure to conduct these voluntary data protection process and control reviews or to obtain and maintain unqualified audits or reports covering our data protection processes and controls may harm our reputation or our business prospects and our ability to market our solutions to our customers.\nIf the security of our software is breached, we fail to securely collect, store and transmit customer information, or we fail to safeguard confidential donor data, we could be exposed to liability, litigation, penalties and remedial costs and our reputation and business could suffer.\nFundamental to the use of our solutions is the secure collection, storage and transmission of confidential donor and end user data and transaction data, including in our payment services. Despite the network, application and physical security procedures and internal control measures we employ to safeguard our systems, we may still be vulnerable to a security breach, intrusion, loss or theft of confidential donor data and transaction data, which may harm our business, reputation and future financial results. Furthermore, our increased reliance on remote access to information systems and global disruptions in response to COVID-19, as described above, increase our exposure to potential cybersecurity incidents.\nLike many major businesses, we are, from time to time, a target of cyberattacks, phishing and social engineering schemes, such as the Security Incident (as described in Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements in this report), and we expect these threats to continue, some of which may be successful to varying degrees. Because the numerous and evolving cybersecurity threats used to obtain unauthorized access, disable, degrade or sabotage systems have become increasingly more complex and sophisticated, it may be difficult to anticipate these acts or to detect them for periods of time, as with the Security Incident, and we may be unable to respond adequately or timely. As these threats continue to evolve and increase, we may be required to devote significant additional resources in order to modify and enhance our security controls and to identify and remediate any security vulnerabilities.\nA compromise of our data security, such as the Security Incident, that results in customer or customer constituent personal or payment card data being obtained by unauthorized persons could adversely affect our reputation with our customers and others, as well as our operations, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity and could result in litigation against us or the imposition of fines and penalties. We might be required to expend significant additional capital and other resources to rectify problems caused by a security breach, including notification under data privacy laws and regulations, and incur expenses related to remediating our information security systems. (See Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements in this report for such information related to the Security Incident.) Even though we carry cyber-technology insurance policies that may provide insurance coverage under certain circumstances, we might\n2020 Form 10-K\nBlackbaud, Inc.\nsuffer losses as a result of a security breach that exceed the coverage available under our insurance policies or for which we do not have coverage. A security breach and any efforts we make to address such breach could also result in a disruption of our operations, particularly our online sales operations.\nThe occurrence of actual cyber security events, such as the Security Incident, could magnify the severity of the adverse effects of future incidents on our business. The techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage information systems can be difficult to detect for long periods of time and can involve difficult or prolonged assessment or remediation periods even once detected. We, therefore, cannot assure you that all potential causes of past significant incidents, including the Security Incident, have been fully identified and remediated. The steps we take may not be sufficient to prevent future significant incidents and, as a result, such incidents may occur again.\nThe Security Incident could have numerous adverse effects on our business.\nAs previously disclosed, on July 16, 2020, we first contacted certain customers to inform them about the Security Incident, including that in May 2020 we discovered and stopped a ransomware attack. Prior to our successfully preventing the cybercriminal from blocking our system access and fully encrypting files, and ultimately expelling them from our system with no significant disruption to our operations, the cybercriminal removed a copy of a subset of data from our self-hosted environment. Although the nature of the incident, our research and third party (including law enforcement) investigation have provided no reason to believe that any data went beyond the cybercriminal, was or will be misused, or will be disseminated or otherwise made available publicly, our investigation into the Security Incident remains ongoing and may provide additional information.\nTo date, we have received approximately 570 claims for reimbursement of expenses from customers or their attorneys related to the Security Incident (none of which have as yet been filed in court or in arbitration) and are in the process of assessing what, if any, liability may exist pursuant to such claims. Possible exposure could result from our customers\u2019 costs and expenses associated with notifying their own constituents of the Security Incident and taking steps to assure that personal information has not been compromised as a result of the Security Incident. In addition, presently, we are a defendant in 30 putative consumer class action cases [27 in U.S. federal courts (some of which have been consolidated under multi district litigation to a single federal court), 1 in a U.S. state court and 2 in Canadian courts] alleging harm from the Security Incident. The plaintiffs in these cases, who generally purport to represent various classes of individual constituents of our customers, generally claim to have been harmed by alleged actions and/or omissions by us in connection with the Security Incident and assert a variety of common law and statutory claims seeking monetary damages, injunctive relief, costs and attorneys\u2019 fees, and other related relief. To date, we also have received a consolidated, multi-state Civil Investigative Demand issued on behalf of 44 state Attorneys General and the District of Columbia relating to the Security Incident. In addition, we have received communications, inquires and requests from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office in the United Kingdom (the \u201cICO\u201d) under the U.K. Data Protection Act 2018, the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner and the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada. (See Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements included in this report for a more detailed description of the Security Incident and related matters.)\nWe may be named as a party in additional lawsuits, other claims may be asserted by or on behalf of our customers or their constituents, and we may be subject to additional governmental inquires, requests or investigations. Responding to and resolving these current and any future lawsuits, claims and/or investigations could result in material remedial and other expenses that may not be covered by insurance. Governmental authorities also may seek to impose undertakings, injunctive relief, consent decrees, or other civil or criminal penalties, which could, among other things, materially increase our data security costs or otherwise require us to alter how we operate our business. Although we intend to defend ourselves vigorously against the claims asserted against us, we cannot predict the potential outcomes, cost and expenses associated with current and any future claims, lawsuits, inquiries and investigations.\nSignificant management time and Company resources have been, and are expected to continue to be, devoted to the Security Incident. (See Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.) Although we carry cyber-technology insurance designed to protect us against certain losses related to cybersecurity events, that insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover all expenses or other losses (including fines) or all types of claims that may arise in connection with cyberattacks, security compromises and other related incidents. Furthermore, in the future such insurance may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.\n2020 Form 10-K\nBlackbaud, Inc.\nFuture publicity or developments related to the Security Incident could have a range of other adverse effects on our business or prospects, including causing or contributing to loss of customer confidence, reduced customer demand, reduced customer retention, strategic growth opportunities, and associated retention and recruiting difficulties.\nOur operations might be affected by the occurrence of a natural disaster or other catastrophic event.\nWe depend on our principal executive offices and other facilities for the continued operation of our business. Although we have contingency plans in effect for natural disasters or other catastrophic events, these events, including terrorist attacks, computer hacker attacks and natural disasters such as hurricanes, flooding and earthquakes, could disrupt one or more of these facilities and adversely affect our operations. Our principal executive offices are located in a coastal region that has experienced hurricanes and earthquakes in the past. Even though we carry business interruption insurance policies and typically have provisions in our commercial contracts that protect us in certain events, we might suffer losses as a result of business interruptions that exceed the coverage available under our insurance policies or for which we do not have coverage. Any natural disaster or catastrophic event affecting us could have a significant negative impact on our operations.\nComplications with the design or implementation of our new global enterprise resource planning (\"ERP\") system could adversely affect our operations and operating results\nWe rely extensively on information systems and technology to manage our business and summarize our operating results. We are in the process of a multi-year implementation of a new ERP system, which will replace our existing core financial systems. Such an implementation is a major undertaking, both financially and from a management and personnel perspective. The new ERP system is designed to accurately maintain our financial records, enhance the flow of financial information, improve data management, and provide timely information to our management team. We may not be able to successfully implement the ERP system without experiencing delays, unexpected additional costs and other difficulties. Failure to successfully design and implement the new ERP system as planned could harm our business, financial condition and operating results. Additionally, if we do not effectively implement the ERP system as planned or the ERP system does not operate as intended, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting could be negatively affected.\nFinancial Risks\nBecause a significant portion of our revenue is recognized over time on a ratable basis over the contract term, downturns in sales may not be immediately reflected in our revenue.\nWe generally recognize our subscription and maintenance revenue ratably over time over the contract term. Our subscription arrangements are generally for a term of three years at contract inception with one to three-year renewals thereafter. Most of our maintenance arrangements are for a one-year term. As a result, much of the revenue we report in each quarter is attributable to arrangements entered into during previous quarters. Consequently, a decline in sales to new customers, renewals by existing customers or market acceptance of our solutions in any one quarter will not necessarily be fully reflected in the revenues in that quarter and could negatively affect our revenues and profitability in future quarters.\nIf our customers do not renew their subscriptions for our solutions or annual maintenance and support arrangements or if they do not renew them on terms that are favorable to us, our business might suffer.\nOur subscription arrangements are generally for a term of three years at contract inception with one to three-year renewals thereafter. Most of our maintenance arrangements are for a one-year term. As the end of the contract term approaches, we seek the renewal of the agreement with the customer. Historically, subscription and maintenance renewals have represented a significant portion of our total revenue. Because of this characteristic of our business, if our customers choose not to renew their subscriptions or maintenance and support arrangements with us on beneficial terms or at all, our business, operating results and financial condition could be harmed. Our customers' renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including their level of satisfaction with our solutions and services and their ability to continue their operations and spending levels due to COVID-19 or otherwise.\n2020 Form 10-K\nBlackbaud, Inc.\nWe significantly increased our leverage in connection with acquisitions.\nWe incurred a substantial amount of indebtedness in connection with acquisitions and the purchase of our Global Headquarters Facility. As a result of this indebtedness, our interest payment obligations have increased. The degree to which we are leveraged could have adverse effects on our business, including the following:\n\u2022Requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, dividends, share repurchases and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022Limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industries in which we operate;\n\u2022Restricting us from making additional strategic acquisitions or exploiting business opportunities;\n\u2022Placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt;\n\u2022Limiting our ability to borrow additional funds; and\n\u2022Decreasing our ability to compete effectively or operate successfully under adverse economic and industry conditions.\nIf we incur additional debt, these risks may intensify. Our ability to meet our debt service obligations will depend upon our future performance, which will be subject to the financial, business and other factors affecting our operations, many of which are beyond our control.\nOur balance sheet includes significant amounts of goodwill and intangible assets. The impairment of a significant portion of these assets could negatively affect our operating results.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had $635.9 million and $277.5 million of goodwill and intangible assets, respectively. On at least an annual basis, we assess whether there have been impairments in the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets. If the carrying value of an asset is determined to be impaired, then it is written down to fair value by a non-cash charge to operating earnings. Changes in circumstances that could indicate that the carrying value of goodwill or intangible assets may not be recoverable include declines in our stock price, market capitalization, cash flows and slower growth rates in our industry. We cannot accurately predict the likelihood or potential amount and timing of any impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets. An impairment of a significant portion of goodwill or intangible assets could materially and negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nRestrictions in our credit facility may limit our activities, including dividend payments, share repurchases and acquisitions.\nOur credit facility contains restrictions, including covenants limiting our ability to incur additional debt, grant liens, make acquisitions and other investments, prepay specified debt, consolidate, merge or acquire other businesses, sell assets, pay dividends and other distributions, repurchase stock and enter into transactions with affiliates. There can be no assurance that we will be able to remain in compliance with the covenants to which we are subject in the future and, if we fail to do so, that we will be able to obtain waivers from our lenders or amend the covenants.\nIn the event of a default under our credit facility, we could be required to immediately repay all outstanding borrowings, which we might not be able to do. In addition, certain of our material domestic subsidiaries are required to guarantee amounts borrowed under the credit facility, and we have pledged the shares of certain of our subsidiaries as collateral for our obligations under the credit facility. Any such default could have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate, including allowing lenders under the credit facility to enforce guarantees of our subsidiaries, if any, or exercise their rights with respect to the shares pledged as collateral.\n2020 Form 10-K\nBlackbaud, Inc.\nWe cannot guarantee that our stock repurchase program will be fully consummated or that it will enhance long-term stockholder value. Share repurchases could also increase the volatility of the trading price of our stock and will diminish our cash reserves.\nAlthough our board of directors has authorized a stock repurchase program that does not have an expiration date, the program does not obligate us to repurchase any specific dollar amount or to acquire any specific number of shares of our common stock. We cannot guarantee that the program will be fully consummated or that it will enhance long-term stockholder value. The program could affect the trading price of our stock and increase volatility, and any announcement of a termination of this program may result in a decrease in the trading price of our stock. In addition, this program will diminish our cash reserves, which may impact our ability to finance future growth and to pursue possible future strategic opportunities and acquisitions. (See Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements in this report for additional information related to our stock repurchase program.)\nWe have recorded significant deferred tax assets, and we might never realize their full value, which would result in a charge against our earnings.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had deferred tax assets of $92.7 million. Realization of our deferred tax assets is dependent upon our generating sufficient taxable income in future years to realize the tax benefit from those assets. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at least annually for realizability. A charge against our earnings would result if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized beyond our existing valuation allowance. This could be caused by, among other things, deterioration in performance, adverse market conditions, adverse changes in applicable laws or regulations, including changes that restrict the activities of or affect the solutions sold by our business and a variety of other factors. For example, during 2020, we recorded an increase in our valuation allowance attributable to state tax credit carryforwards for which we do not expect to realize benefit. (See Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements in this report for additional details.) If a deferred tax asset net of our valuation allowance was determined to be not realizable in a future period, the charge to earnings would be recognized as an expense in our results of operations in the period the determination is made. Additionally, if we are unable to utilize our deferred tax assets, our cash flow available to fund operations could be adversely affected.\nDepending on future circumstances, it is possible that we might never realize the full value of our deferred tax assets. Any future impairment charges related to a significant portion of our deferred tax assets would have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nLegal and Compliance Risks\nPrivacy and data protection concerns, including evolving domestic and international government regulation in the area of consumer data privacy or data protection, could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nThe effectiveness of our software solutions relies on our customers' storage and use of data concerning their customers, including financial, personally identifying or other sensitive data. Our customers' collection and use of this data for donor profiling, data analytics or communications outreach might raise privacy and data protection concerns and negatively impact the demand for our solutions and services. For example, our custom modeling and analytical services rely heavily on processing and using of data we gather from customers and various sources. Privacy and data protection laws could add restrictions or regulatory burdens, which could limit to our ability to market and profit from those services.\nGovernments in some jurisdictions have enacted or are considering enacting consumer data privacy or data protection legislation, including laws and regulations applying to the solicitation, collection, transfer, processing and use of personal data. This legislation could reduce the demand for our software solutions if we fail to design or enhance our solutions to enable our customers to comply with the privacy and data protection measures required by the legislation. Moreover, we may be exposed to liability under existing or new consumer privacy or data protection legislation. For example, when providing our solutions to certain customers in the healthcare industry, we must comply with applicable provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (\"HIPAA\"), and might be subject to similar provisions of other legislation, including, without limitation, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and related regulations, and\n2020 Form 10-K\nBlackbaud, Inc.\nthe California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, which became effective January 1, 2020, and may apply to some of our customers and areas of business. Even technical violations of these laws may result in penalties that are assessed for each non-compliant transaction.\nBlackbaud, and some of our customers, may be subject to the E.U. General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d), which became effective in the E.U. in May 2018 and its provisions continue to apply in the U.K. after Brexit by virtue of legislation incorporating the GDPR into U.K. data protection law, known as the \"UK GDPR.\" The law requires companies to meet requirements regarding the handling of personal data, including rights such as the portability of personal data. We completed an extensive program of product and operational changes to address GDPR requirements and all future solutions sold to customers subject to GDPR must include GDPR features. The implementation of GDPR has affected our ability to offer some features and services to customers in the E.U. and U.K. Furthermore, actions and investigations by regulatory authorities related to data security incidents and privacy violations continue to increase, which could impact us through increased costs or restrictions on our business, and noncompliance could result in significant regulatory penalties and legal liability.\nIf our customers or we were found to be subject to and in violation of any privacy or data protection laws or regulations, our business may be materially and adversely impacted and we and/or our customers would likely have to change our business practices. In addition, these laws and regulations could impose significant costs on our customers and us and make it more difficult for donors to make online donations. (See Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements included in this report for a description of the Security Incident and related legal proceedings and regulatory matters.)\nWe are in the information technology business, and our solutions and services store, retrieve, transfer, manipulate and manage our customers\u2019 information and data. The effectiveness of our software solutions relies on our customers\u2019 storage and use of data concerning their donors, including financial, personally identifying and other sensitive data and our business uses similar systems that require us to store and use data with respect to our customers and personnel. Our collection and our customers\u2019 collection and use of this data might raise privacy and data protection concerns and negatively impact our business or the demand for our solutions and services. If a breach of data security, such as the Security Incident, were to occur, or other violation of privacy or data protection laws and regulations were to be alleged, our business may be materially and adversely impacted and solutions may be perceived as less desirable, which would negatively affect our business and operating results.\nClaims that we or our technologies infringe upon the intellectual property or other proprietary rights of a third party may require us to incur significant costs, enter into royalty or licensing agreements or develop or license substitute technology.\nWe may be subject to claims that the technologies in our solutions and services infringe upon the intellectual property or other proprietary rights of a third party. In addition, the vendors providing us with technology that we use in our own solutions could become subject to similar infringement claims. Although we believe that our solutions and services do not infringe any intellectual property or other proprietary rights, we cannot be certain that our solutions and services do not, or that they will not in the future, infringe intellectual property or other proprietary rights held by others. Any claims of infringement could cause us to incur substantial costs to defend against the claim, even if the claim is without merit, and could distract our management from our business. Moreover, any settlement or adverse judgment resulting from the claim could require us to pay substantial amounts, or obtain a license to continue to use the technology and services that are the subject of the claim, and/or otherwise restrict or prohibit our use of the same. There can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain a license on commercially reasonable terms from the third party asserting any particular claim, or that we would be able to successfully develop alternative technology on a timely basis, or that we would be able to obtain a license from another provider of suitable alternative technology to permit us to continue offering, and our customers to continue using, the solutions and services. In addition, we generally provide in our customer arrangements for certain solutions and services that we will indemnify our customers against third-party infringement claims relating to technology we provide to those customers, which could obligate us to pay damages if the solutions and services were found to be infringing. Infringement claims asserted against us, our vendors or our customers may have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\n2020 Form 10-K\nBlackbaud, Inc.\nOur solutions utilize open source software, which may subject us to litigation, require us to re-engineer our solutions, or otherwise divert resources away from our development efforts.\nWe use open source software in connection with certain of our solutions. Such open source software is generally licensed by its authors or other third parties under open source licenses, including, for example, the GNU General Public License, the GNU Lesser General Public License, \u201cApache-style\u201d licenses, \u201cBSD-style\u201d licenses and other open source licenses. There is little legal precedent governing the interpretation of many of the terms of some of these licenses and, therefore, the potential impact of these terms on our business is currently unable to be determined and may result in unanticipated obligations regarding our solutions and technologies. From time to time, companies that incorporate open source software into their products have faced claims challenging the ownership of open source software and/or compliance with open source license terms. Therefore, we could be subject to litigation by parties claiming ownership of open source software or noncompliance with open source licensing terms. Some open source software licenses require users who distribute open source software as part of their own software to publicly disclose all or part of the source code to such software and/or make available any derivative works of the open source code on unfavorable terms or at no cost. While we monitor our use of open source software and try to ensure that none is used in a manner that would require us to disclose the source code or that would otherwise breach the terms of an open source agreement, such use could inadvertently occur and we may be required to release proprietary source code, pay damages for breach of contract, re-engineer our applications, discontinue sales in the event re-engineering cannot be accomplished on a timely basis, or take other remedial action that may divert resources away from our development efforts, any of which could adversely affect our business.\nWe rely upon trademark, copyright, patent and trade secret laws to protect our proprietary rights, which might not provide us with adequate protection.\nOur success and ability to compete depends to a significant degree upon the protection of our proprietary technology rights. We might not be successful in protecting our proprietary technology and our proprietary rights might not provide us with a meaningful competitive advantage. To protect our core proprietary technology, we rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, as well as nondisclosure agreements, each of which affords only limited protection.\nIncreasing and evolving domestic and international government financial regulation could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nCertain of our solutions, in particular, our financial management and payment services solutions, relate to activity heavily regulated in the U.S. by federal and state government regulatory agencies and in other countries in which we operate by local regulatory agencies. The laws and regulations enforced by these agencies are proposed or enacted to deter fraud and other illicit financial transactions and to protect consumers and the financial system. We have procedures and controls in place to monitor compliance with numerous federal, state and foreign laws and regulations. However, because these laws and regulations are complex, differ between jurisdictions, and are often subject to interpretation, or as a result of unintended errors, we may, from time to time, inadvertently violate these laws and regulations. Compliance with these laws and regulations is expensive and requires the time and attention of management. These costs divert capital and focus away from efforts intended to grow our business. If we do not successfully comply with laws, regulations, or policies, we could incur fines or penalties, be subject to litigation, lose existing or new customer contracts or other business, and suffer damage to our reputation. Changes in these laws and regulations can alter our business environment, limit business operations, require substantial investments to achieve compliance and increase costs of doing business, and we cannot predict the impact such changes would have on our operating results and financial condition.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and Delaware law may delay or prevent an acquisition of our company.\nProvisions of Delaware law, our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our company or deterring tender offers for our common stock that other stockholders may consider in their best interests. Our certificate of incorporation authorizes \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock, which could be issued by the board of directors without stockholder approval and may contain voting, liquidation, dividend and other rights superior to our common stock. Stockholder approval is not necessary to issue preferred stock in this\n2020 Form 10-K\nBlackbaud, Inc.\nmanner. Issuance of these shares of preferred stock could have the effect of making it more difficult and more expensive for a person or group to acquire control of us, and could effectively be used as an anti-takeover device. Currently there are no shares of our preferred stock issued or outstanding. Our bylaws provide for an advance notice procedure for stockholders to nominate director candidates for election or to bring business before an annual meeting of stockholders, including proposed nominations of persons for election to our board of directors, and limit the persons who may call special meetings of stockholders. The anti-takeover provisions of Delaware law and provisions in our organizational documents may prevent our stockholders from receiving the benefit from any premium to the market price of our common stock offered by a bidder in a takeover context. Even in the absence of a takeover attempt, the existence of these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock if they are viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the future.",

As a result, we paid a first quarter dividend of $0.12 per share in 2020 resulting in aggregate dividend payments to stockholders of $6.0 million, but no further dividends were declared or paid in 2020. We currently do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends for the foreseeable future.\n2020 Form 10-K\nBlackbaud, Inc.",

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with Item 1A Risk factors and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following discussion and analysis presents financial information denominated in millions of dollars which can lead to differences from rounding when compared to similar information contained in the consolidated financial statements and related notes, which are primarily denominated in thousands of dollars.\nExecutive Summary\nWe are the world\u2019s leading cloud software company powering social good. Serving the entire social good community-nonprofits, higher education institutions, K-12 schools, healthcare organizations, faith communities, arts and cultural organizations, foundations, companies and individual change agents-we connect and empower organizations and individuals to increase their impact through cloud software, services, expertise and data intelligence. Our portfolio is tailored to the unique needs of vertical markets, with solutions for fundraising and CRM, marketing, advocacy, peer-to-peer fundraising, corporate social responsibility, school management, ticketing, grantmaking, financial management, payment processing and analytics. Serving the industry for nearly four decades, we are headquartered in Charleston, South Carolina, and have operations in the United States, Australia, Canada, Costa Rica and the United Kingdom. As of December 31, 2020, we had over 45,000 global customers.\nOur revenue is primarily generated from the following sources: (i) charging for the use of our software solutions in cloud and hosted environments; (ii) providing payment and transaction services; (iii) providing software maintenance and support services; and (iv) providing professional services, including implementation, consulting, training, analytic and other services.\nCOVID-19 Impact\nThe outbreak of COVID-19 in countries across the globe, including each country in which we currently operate, has adversely impacted the U.S. and global economies. We began 2020 with strong execution against our financial plan. In March 2020, we began to experience disruptions to our business from COVID-19, and the pandemic continues to impact each of our markets.\nTo better enable us to weather the extraordinary business challenges brought about by the global COVID-19 pandemic, to protect the safety and welfare of our employees, and to further effect our long-term strategy to deliver the greatest value to our stockholders, we have taken several actions. These measures taken are expected to provide us the financial flexibility needed to manage a wide array of outcomes that may result from COVID-19. See Note 2 to our condensed consolidated financial statements in this report for a discussion of some of these actions. In addition to the actions we have taken to date, we are continuously evaluating further possible actions in order to respond quickly to rapidly changing conditions, if needed.\nThe economic impact of COVID-19 on the social good industry remains uncertain. With our existing and prospective customers remaining cautious in their purchase decisions, we expect that our operating environment may continue to be challenging in 2021 and potentially beyond, as discussed below. Notwithstanding these conditions, we remain focused on continuing to execute our four-point growth strategy and strengthening our leadership position.\n2020 Form 10-K\nBlackbaud, Inc.\nFour-Point Growth Strategy\n1 Delight Customers with Innovative Cloud Solutions\n2 Drive Sales Effectiveness\n3 Expand Total Addressable Market\n4 Improve Operating Efficiency\n1.Delight Customers with Innovative Cloud Solutions\nThis strategy reflects our relentless focus on driving value and outcomes for our customers through our solutions. Blackbaud SKY\u00ae, our platform for cloud innovation, is a core tenant of this strategy and continues to power an elevated level of innovation by our engineers. It is also enabling our growing ecosystem of partners who are also passionate about social good, to extend and expand the capabilities available to our customers. During 2020, we continued making critical investments in research and development and increased our engineering hiring during the fourth quarter. We also released the Blackbaud Marketplace during 2020, offering curated third-party apps, enabling organizations of all types and sizes to discover new ways to amplify their impact by enhancing their best-of-breed Blackbaud solutions with specialized capabilities like connecting bidders at fundraising auctions, tracking branded merchandise purchased in an online store or texting volunteers about an upcoming event.\nThe customers we serve require vertical specific business solutions to automate their operations. Throughout 2020 we have remained focused on driving value and outcomes for our customers. We reprioritized and expedited product enhancements to support our customers needs, especially in light of COVID-19 and the continued shift to virtual, digital-first operating models. For example, we released fitness tracking integration in Blackbaud\u2019s peer-to-peer fundraising portfolio, a new virtual prayer wall enabling congregants at houses of worship to share and respond to prayer requests online, text messaging capabilities for scholarship directors and higher education institutions to ensure no funds were going unutilized and expanded the global capabilities of YourCause CSRConnect making it easier for companies to bring employees across geographies together in support of causes around the world.\nBlackbaud Peer-to-Peer Fundraising powered by JustGiving continues to gain traction. During 2020, we migrated everydayhero customers over to Blackbaud Peer-to-Peer Fundraising powered by JustGiving and sunset the everydayhero product as we continue to rationalize our portfolio while continuing to delight our customers with innovative cloud solutions.\n2.Drive Sales Effectiveness\nWe have been investing in sales and marketing to better address our market opportunity with a focus on digital lead generation. One way we are equipping our salesforce to be more effective is by investing in the necessary technology and resources to efficiently drive an increased number of quality leads and better cover our large addressable market. We have implemented software tools to enhance our digital footprint and drive lead generation across the company. We are taking a multi-touch attribution approach to measuring the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns to drive efficiency in our go-to-market efforts and improve returns on our marketing dollars. This is just one of many examples of how we are optimizing our structure, tools and processes to better address our large vertical market opportunities. We have also taken lessons learned throughout 2020 and re-evaluated elements of our go-to-market strategy with a digital-first mindset and we have a significant opportunity to leverage the investments into digital to reduce our customer acquisition cost and increase our sales velocity, ultimately, driving a more scalable and cost-effective go-to-market model.\n3.Expand TAM\nWe did not complete any acquisitions during 2020 as we have remained vigilantly focused on supporting our customers and employees during this time. We remain active in the evaluation of opportunities to further expand\n2020 Form 10-K\nBlackbaud, Inc.\nour addressable market through acquisitions and internal product development. We believe we have significant opportunities in front of us as we are less than 10% penetrated into a total addressable market of over $10 billion.\n4.Improve Operating Efficiency\nWe are also focused on operational efficiency to strengthen the business and position us for long-term success. During 2020, we pivoted to place a greater emphasis on profit in alignment with the balanced approach management takes to operating the business. As a result of the pandemic, our near term visibility into revenue growth was impacted and we took certain actions early on to ensure our near-term liquidity (as discussed above) and shifted more of our focus to profitability. Our employees switched to working fully remote at the onset of the pandemic and the business continued operating smoothly. This caused us to re-evaluate our workforce strategy and when employees return to the office, we expect to have more employees working remotely either part-time or full time, even within our hub locations. As a result, we revisited our real estate strategy with a focus on optimizing our footprint for the future of work at Blackbaud, including the purchase of our LEED Gold certified Global Headquarters Facility and exit of certain office leases globally. Our aim is optimizing our office utilization, improving our geographic sales coverage and enhancing our employees' daily experience to improve productivity and effectiveness.\nFinancial Summary\nTotal Revenue ($M) Income from Operations ($M)\nYoY Growth (%) YoY Growth (%)\nTotal revenue increased by $12.8 million during 2020, driven largely by the following:\n+ Increase in transactional revenue, including an accelerated shift toward virtual and online fundraising and charitable giving related to COVID-19\n+ Increase in contractual recurring revenue related to positive demand from customers across our portfolio of cloud solutions\n- Decrease in one-time consulting revenue primarily from less one-time sales related to changes in our compensation plans to place greater emphasis on subscription sales of our cloud solutions\n- Decrease in one-time analytics revenue as analytics are generally integrated in our cloud solutions\n2020 Form 10-K\nBlackbaud, Inc.\nIncome from operations increased by $10.1 million during 2020, driven largely by the following:\n+ Growth in total revenue, as described above\n+ Decrease in compensation costs (excluding stock-based compensation expense) of $43.7 million primarily associated with the decision to replace our 2020 cash bonus plans with grants of performance-based equity awards, which are being recognized as stock-based compensation expense between May 1, 2020 and May 1, 2021. These awards may be earned and become eligible for vesting on May 1, 2021 subject to meeting certain performance conditions and the recipient's continued employment with us\n+ Decrease in travel costs of $11.0 million due to our restriction on non-essential employee travel in response to the COVID-19 pandemic\n+ Decrease in amortization of intangible assets from business combinations of $8.2 million\n+ Decrease in restructuring costs of $5.6 million as our facilities optimization restructuring plan was largely completed as of December 31, 2019\n+ Decrease in acquisition-related expenses and integration costs of $3.3 million\n- Increase in stock-based compensation expense of $28.6 million primarily related to the decision to replace our 2020 cash bonus plans with grants of performance-based equity awards\n- Increase in real estate activity costs of $23.1 million due to our workforce strategy changes in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. For additional details, see \"Results of Operations - General and administrative\" below.\n- Increase in corporate costs of $6.3 million primarily related to increases in bad debt expense; for additional details, see Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements in this report\n- Increase in cost of revenue from a $4.3 million impairment charge during the three months ended June 30, 2020, against certain previously capitalized software development costs, resulting from our decision to accelerate the end of customer support for certain solutions\n- Other increases in cost of revenue related to increases in data center costs, amortization of software development costs and transaction-based costs\nThere are three primary revenue categories with related business drivers that we continue to monitor closely in light of the COVID-19 pandemic:\n1.Contractual Recurring Revenue (approximately two thirds of total revenue in 2020)\nRecurring subscription contracts are typically for a term of three years at contract inception, billed annually in advance, and we have been for several years successfully shifting our legacy customer base away from annual renewals and moving them onto multi-year renewal contracts. Our contracted recurring revenue has performed well as our renewal rate during 2020 finished favorable to our original plan. We expect the shortfall in bookings during 2020 to put pressure on our revenue growth during 2021. We are closely monitoring our customer receivable balances, payment terms, and creditworthiness. While we experienced an increase in our aging of receivables during the second and third quarters of 2020 primarily associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, we have seen some improvement in our customers' payment behavior since that time. We also saw fewer of our customers go out of business during 2020 than 2019, which demonstrated the resiliency of our market.\n2.Transactional Revenue (approximately one quarter of total revenue in 2020)\nTransactional revenue is non-contractual and less predictable given the susceptibility to certain drivers such as timing and number of events and marketing campaigns, as well as fluctuations in donation volumes and tuition payments. We have historically experienced seasonal highs during the fourth quarter due to year-end giving campaigns and during the second quarter when a large number of events are held. During the fourth quarter, we saw our payments transaction volumes exceed our expectations due primarily to year-end giving to our customers. For the full year, we saw the negative impact of many in-person events being postponed or canceled. Social good organizations have been forced to employ new strategies to maintain momentum with current supporters while capturing the attention of potential new donors. We continue to support our customers in adapting to these circumstances through virtual campaigns and events.\n2020 Form 10-K\nBlackbaud, Inc.\n3.Bookings\nOur first quarter has historically been the seasonal low for bookings, with the second and fourth quarters historically being seasonally higher, and our bookings tend to be back-end loaded within individual quarters given our quarterly quota plans. During 2020, we had a significant shortfall in bookings compared to both our original plan for the year and our prior year performance, as we experienced challenges in building pipeline after the start of the pandemic. Given our ratable revenue recognition model for our recurring subscription contracts and implementation periods, we expect that the declines in our 2020 bookings performance will have a greater negative impact on our 2021 revenue than it did our 2020 revenue. We believe the current environment has put a greater emphasis on investing in digital and cloud solutions and are optimistic this may result in an increase in pipeline and bookings at some point in 2021.\nOur strategy has historically relied on a balanced approach to growth and profitability. As discussed above, the pandemic has created short-term uncertainty in our revenue outlook and the early impacts on pipeline and bookings will likely limit our ability to drive near-term revenue growth at our originally planned levels. Therefore, in line with our strategy, we have made a pivot to greater emphasis on delivering shareholder value through increased profitability and cash flow, which are more controllable.\nCustomer Retention\nOur recurring revenue contracts are generally for a term of three years at contract inception with one to three-year renewals thereafter. We anticipate a continued decrease in maintenance contract renewals as we transition our solution portfolio and maintenance customers from a perpetual license-based model to a cloud subscription delivery model. In the long term, we also anticipate an increase in recurring subscription contract renewals as we continue focusing on innovation, quality and the integration of our cloud solutions, which we believe will provide value-adding capabilities to better address our customers' needs. Due primarily to these factors, we believe a recurring revenue customer retention measure that combines recurring subscription, maintenance and service customer contracts provides a better representation of our customers' overall behavior. During 2020 and 2019, approximately 93% and 92%, respectively, of our customers with recurring revenue contracts were retained. This customer retention rate reflects our efforts to rationalize our portfolio of solutions and migrate customers from legacy solutions towards our next generation cloud solutions. We are investing in innovation, which we believe will increase customer retention over the long-term.\nBalance Sheet and Cash Flow\nAt December 31, 2020, our cash and cash equivalents were $35.8 million and the carrying amount of our debt under the 2020 Credit Facility was $467.1 million. Our net leverage ratio was 1.75 to 1.00.\nDuring 2020, we generated $148.0 million in cash flow from operations, primarily from operating cost reductions put in place in response to COVID-19 and the increased use of stock-based compensation. During 2020, we had a net increase in borrowings of $0.9 million, we returned $47.0 million to stockholders by way of share repurchases and dividends, and had cash outlays of $71.8 million for purchases of property and equipment and capitalized software development costs. A larger amount of cash was spent on property and equipment during 2020 primarily due to the purchase of our Global Headquarters Facility.\n2020 Form 10-K\nBlackbaud, Inc.\nResults of Operations\nReportable segment\nWe report our operating results and financial information in one operating and reportable segment. See Note 16 of our consolidated financial statements in this report for additional information.\nComparison of 2020 vs. 2019 and 2019 vs. 2018\nAcquisitions\nDuring 2019 and 2018, we acquired companies that provided us with strategic opportunities to expand our TAM and share of the philanthropic giving market through the integration of complementary solutions and services to serve the changing needs of our customers. The following are the companies we acquired and their respective acquisition dates:\n\u2022YourCause Holdings, LLC (\"YourCause\") on January 2, 2019\n\u2022Reeher LLC (\"Reeher\") on April 30, 2018\nWe have included the results of operations of acquired companies in our consolidated results of operations from the date of their respective acquisition. We determined that the YourCause and Reeher acquisitions were not material business combinations; therefore, revenue and earnings since the acquisition dates and pro forma information are not required or presented. See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements in this report for a summary of these acquisitions.\nRevenue and Cost of Revenue\nRecurring\nRevenue ($M) Cost of revenue ($M) Gross profit ($M)\nand gross margin (%)\nYoY Growth (%) YoY Growth (%)\nRecurring revenue is comprised of fees for the use of our subscription-based software solutions, which includes providing access to cloud solutions, hosting services, payment services, online training programs, subscription-based analytic services, such as donor acquisitions and data enrichment services. Recurring revenue also includes fees from maintenance services for our on-premises solutions, services included in our renewable subscription contracts, retained and managed services contracts that we expect to have a term consistent with our cloud solution contracts, and variable transaction revenue associated with the use of our solutions.\nCost of recurring revenue is primarily comprised of compensation costs for customer support and production IT personnel, hosting and data center costs, third-party contractor expenses, third-party royalty and data expenses, allocated depreciation, facilities and IT support costs, amortization of intangible assets from business combinations, amortization of software development costs, transaction-based costs related to payments services including remittances of amounts due to third-parties and other costs incurred in providing support and recurring services to our customers.\n2020 Form 10-K\nBlackbaud, Inc.\nOur customers continue to prefer cloud subscription offerings with integrated analytics, training and payment services. Recurring subscription contracts are typically for a term of three years at contract inception with one to three-year renewals thereafter. We intend to continue focusing on innovation, quality and integration of our cloud solutions, which we believe will drive future revenue growth.\n2020 vs. 2019\nRecurring revenue increased by $19.1 million, or 2.3%, driven primarily by the following:\n+ Increase in transactional revenue of $18.3 million, including an accelerated shift toward virtual and online fundraising and charitable giving related to COVID-19\n+ Increase in contractual recurring revenue of $15.5 million related to positive demand from customers across our portfolio of cloud solutions\n- Decrease in maintenance revenue of $14.7 million primarily related to our continuing efforts to migrate customers from legacy on-premises solutions onto our solutions powered by Blackbaud SKY, our modern cloud platform\nPartially offsetting contractual recurring revenue was a decrease in the mix of retained and managed services contracts we present in recurring revenue. Revenue from retained and managed service contracts that we do not expect to have a term consistent with our cloud solution contracts is included in one-time services and other revenue beginning January 1, 2020. This change in presentation resulted in a decrease in recurring revenue and an offsetting increase to one-time services and other revenue of $16.7 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020.\nCost of recurring revenue increased by $11.7 million, or 3.3%, driven primarily by the following:\n+ Increase in transaction-based costs of $7.5 million related to payment services integrated in our cloud solutions\n+ Increase in amortization of software development costs of $6.8 million due to investments made on innovation, quality and the integration of our cloud solutions\n+ Impairment charge of $4.3 million during the three months ended June 30, 2020, against certain previously capitalized software development costs that reduced the carrying value of those assets to zero. The impairment charge resulted primarily from our decision to accelerate the end of customer support for certain solutions.\n+ Increase in hosting and data center costs of $3.8 million as we are migrating our cloud infrastructure to leading public cloud service providers\n- Decrease in amortization of intangible assets from business combinations of $5.7 million\n- Decrease in compensation costs primarily associated with the decision to replace our 2020 cash bonus plans with grants of performance-based equity awards, which are being recognized as stock-based compensation expense between May 1, 2020 and May 1, 2021. These awards may be earned and become eligible for vesting on May 1, 2021 subject to meeting certain performance conditions and the recipient's continued employment with us\n- Decrease in costs associated with certain retained and managed services contracts for which revenue is included in one-time services and other revenue beginning January 1, 2020, as discussed above\nRecurring gross margin decreased by 0.4%, driven primarily by an increase in the mix of payments revenue, which generally have lower gross margins than our contractual recurring revenue, the impairment of previously capitalized software development costs, and incremental costs associated with our continued shift toward selling cloud solutions, including data center costs and amortization of software development costs. We expect continued pressure on recurring gross margin largely driven by duplicate data center costs as we migrate our cloud infrastructure to leading cloud service providers.\n2019 vs. 2018\nRecurring revenue increased by $69.4 million, or 9.1%, driven primarily by the following:\n+ Increase in subscriptions revenue of $87.8 million related to positive demand across our portfolio of cloud solutions and, to a lesser extent, the inclusion of YourCause, an increase in services embedded in our renewable cloud solution contracts and increased sales of subscription-based retained professional services\n- Decrease in maintenance revenue of $18.4 million primarily related to our continuing efforts to migrate customers from legacy on-premises solutions onto our solutions powered by Blackbaud SKY, our modern cloud platform\n2020 Form 10-K\nBlackbaud, Inc.\nCost of recurring revenue increased by $52.5 million, or 17.2%, driven primarily by the following:\n+ Increase in transaction-based costs of $13.0 million, related to payment services integrated in our cloud solutions\n+ Increase in compensation costs of $11.2 million, primarily attributable to an increasing portion of our resources providing subscription-based retained services as opposed to one-time\n+ Increase in hosting and data center costs of $5.4 million due to the migration of our cloud infrastructure to leading public cloud service providers\n+ Increase in third-party data and tool costs of $5.1 million\n+ Increase in allocated corporate costs of $5.1 million primarily due to investments in corporate IT, including cyber security and increases in related headcount\n+ Increase in amortization of software development costs of $4.1 million due to investments made on innovation, quality and the integration of our cloud solutions\nRecurring gross margin decreased by 3.0%, driven primarily by incremental costs associated with our continued shift toward selling cloud solutions and retained services, including hosting and data center costs, compensation costs and amortization of software development costs.\nOne-time services and other\nRevenue ($M) Cost of revenue ($M) Gross profit ($M)\nand gross margin (%)\nYoY Growth (%) YoY Growth (%)\nOne-time services and other revenue is comprised of fees for one-time consulting, analytic and onsite training services, fees for retained and managed services contracts that we do not expect to have a term consistent with our cloud solution contracts, revenue from the sale of our software sold under perpetual license arrangements, fees from user conferences and third-party software referral fees.\nCost of one-time services and other is primarily comprised of compensation costs for professional services and onsite training personnel, other costs incurred in providing onsite customer training, third-party contractor expenses, data expense incurred to perform one-time analytic services, third-party software royalties, costs of user conferences, allocated depreciation, facilities and IT support costs and amortization of intangible assets from business combinations.\n2020 Form 10-K\nBlackbaud, Inc.\n2020 vs. 2019\nOne-time services and other revenue decreased by $6.3 million, or 9.2%, driven primarily by the following:\n+ Increase in the mix of retained and managed services contracts we present in one-time services and other. Revenue from retained and managed service contracts that we do not expect to have a term consistent with our cloud solution contracts is included in one-time services and other revenue beginning January 1, 2020. This change in presentation resulted in an increase to one-time services and other revenue and an offsetting decrease in recurring revenue of $16.7 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020.\n- Decrease in one-time consulting revenue of $12.1 million primarily from less one-time sales related to changes in our compensation plans to place greater emphasis on subscription sales of our cloud solutions. Services increasingly being embedded in our renewable cloud solution contracts also contributed to the decrease in one-time services revenue. Our embedded services are recorded as recurring revenue.\n- Decrease in one-time analytics revenue of $4.2 million as analytics are generally integrated in our cloud solutions\n- Decrease in conference revenue of $3.6 million as our annual conference, bbcon, was held virtually and provided free of charge\n- Decrease in onsite training revenue of $1.3 million due to COVID-19\nCost of one-time services and other decreased $2.1 million or 3.4%, primarily driven by the following:\n+ Increase in compensation costs of $3.4 million primarily related to an increase in stock-based compensation expense as we replaced our 2020 cash bonus plans and annual merit-based salary increases for our employees with grants of equity awards\n- Decrease of $4.2 million in costs related to providing our annual user conference, bbcon, virtually\n- Insignificant decrease in travel costs due to our restriction on non-essential employee travel in response to COVID-19\nOne-time services and other gross margin decreased by 5.6%, primarily as the reductions in one-time consulting and analytics revenue discussed above outpaced the decrease in related costs.\n2019 vs. 2018\nOne-time services and other revenue decreased by $17.6 million, or 20.4%, driven primarily by the following:\n- Decrease in one-time consulting revenue of $12.6 million. Services are increasingly embedded in our renewable cloud solution contracts and we are selling more subscription-based contracts for retained professional services. Our embedded services are recorded as recurring revenue.\n- Decrease in one-time analytics revenue of $3.8 million as analytics are generally integrated in our cloud solutions\nCost of one-time services and other decreased by $15.8 million, or 20.8%, driven primarily by a decrease in compensation costs of $13.3 million. The decrease in compensation costs was in line with the decrease in one-time services sold and delivered as an increasing portion of our resources provided subscription-based retained services as opposed to one-time.\nOne-time services and other gross margin increased by 0.4%, as the reductions in costs of one-time services and other discussed above slightly outpaced the declines in one-time consulting revenue and analytics revenue associated with the shift in our go-to-market strategy.\n2020 Form 10-K\nBlackbaud, Inc.\nOperating Expenses\nSales, marketing and\ncustomer success ($M) Research and development ($M) General and administrative ($M)\nPercentages indicate expenses as a percentage of total revenue\nSales, marketing and customer success\nSales, marketing and customer success expense includes compensation costs, variable sales commissions, travel-related expenses, advertising and marketing materials, public relations costs, variable reseller commissions and allocated depreciation, facilities and IT support costs.\nWe see a large market opportunity in the long-term and will continue to make investments to drive sales effectiveness, which is a component of our four-point growth strategy. We have also implemented software tools to enhance our digital footprint and drive lead generation. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented a modest and targeted headcount reduction during the second quarter, including a reduction in our sales headcount with a focus on retaining our most highly productive sales executives. The enhancements we are making in our go-to-market approach are expected to significantly reduce the payback period for our customer acquisition costs while increasing sales velocity. As a result, we do not expect our sales, marketing and customer success expense to return to pre-pandemic levels.\n2020 vs. 2019\nSales, marketing and customer success expenses decreased by $14.4 million, or 6.4%. The decreases in dollars and as a percentage of total revenue were primarily driven by the following:\n- Decrease in compensation costs of $6.5 million primarily related to the decision to replace our 2020 cash bonus plans with grants of performance-based equity awards, which are being recognized as stock-based compensation expense between May 1, 2020 and May 1, 2021.

The increases in dollars and as a percentage of total revenue were primarily driven by the following:\n+ Increase in compensation costs of $21.2 million primarily associated with our efforts beginning in the second half of 2018 to increase our direct sales force as well as incremental headcount associated with the inclusion of YourCause. As a result, our direct sales headcount increased 8% during 2019.\n+ Increases in allocated corporate costs of $7.0 million primarily driven by investments made in corporate IT, including cyber security and increases in related headcount\n+ Increase in commission expense of $2.2 million primarily driven by an increase in commissionable sales\n2020 Form 10-K\nBlackbaud, Inc.\nResearch and development\nResearch and development expense includes compensation costs for engineering and product management personnel, third-party contractor expenses, software development tools and other expenses related to developing new solutions or upgrading and enhancing existing solutions that do not qualify for capitalization, and allocated depreciation, facilities and IT support costs.\n2020 vs. 2019\nWe continue to make investments to delight our customers with innovative cloud solutions, which is a component of our four-point growth strategy. We also increased engineering hiring during the fourth quarter of 2020. Research and development expenses decreased by $6.0 million, or 5.7%. The decreases in dollars and as a percentage of total revenue were primarily driven by the following:\n- Decrease in compensation costs of $5.8 million primarily associated with the decision to replace our 2020 cash bonus plans with grants of performance-based equity awards, which are being recognized as stock-based compensation expense between May 1, 2020 and May 1, 2021.

Qualifying capitalized software development costs associated with our cloud solutions are subsequently amortized to cost of subscriptions revenue over the related asset's estimated useful life, which generally range from three to seven years. We expect that the amount of software development costs capitalized will be relatively consistent in the near-term as we continue making investments in innovation, quality and the integration of our solutions, which we believe will drive long-term revenue growth.\n2019 vs. 2018\nResearch and development expenses increased by $7.4 million, or 7.4%, primarily driven by the following:\n+ Increase in compensation costs of $11.6 million primarily associated with the inclusion of YourCause's engineering resources\n+ Increases in allocations of depreciation, facilities and IT support costs of $3.5 million primarily driven by investments made in corporate IT, including cyber security and increases in related headcount\n- Partially offset by an increase in software development costs of $9.5 million that were required to be capitalized under the internal-use software guidance\nNot included in research and development expense for 2019 and 2018 were $46.0 million and $36.5 million, respectively, of qualifying costs associated with development activities that are required to be capitalized under the internal-use software accounting guidance such as those for our cloud solutions, as well as development costs associated with acquired companies. Qualifying capitalized software development costs associated with our cloud solutions are subsequently amortized to cost of subscriptions revenue over the related asset's estimated useful life, which generally range from three to seven years.\nGeneral and administrative\nGeneral and administrative expense consists primarily of compensation costs for general corporate functions, including senior management, finance, accounting, legal, human resources and corporate development, third-party professional fees, insurance, allocated depreciation, facilities and IT support costs, acquisition-related expenses and other administrative expenses.\n2020 Form 10-K\nBlackbaud, Inc.\nDuring the third quarter of 2020, we adjusted our workforce strategy to provide more flexibility for our employees after our offices reopen and we expect to have more employees working remotely either part-time or full time, even within our hub locations. This change is expected to create efficiencies within our real estate footprint as we shift toward more collaborative workspaces within our offices. As a result, during the three months ended September 30, 2020, we reduced the estimated useful lives of our operating lease ROU assets for certain of our office locations we expected to exit, which resulted in an increase in operating lease costs during the third and fourth quarters of 2020. For these same office locations, we also reduced the estimated useful lives of certain facilities-related fixed assets, which resulted in an increase in depreciation expense. We incurred approximately $23.1 million of pre-tax costs related to these real estate activities during the third and fourth quarters of 2020, which we do not expect to recur in 2021. These activities are expected to result in future annual before-tax savings of approximately $14.0 million beginning in 2021.\n2020 vs. 2019\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased by $21.4 million, or 18.9%. The increases in dollars and as a percentage of total revenue were primarily driven by the following:\n+ Increase in real estate activity costs of $23.1 million due to our workforce strategy changes in response to COVID-19, as discussed above\n+ Increase in corporate costs $5.9 million primarily related to an increase in bad debt expense; for additional details, see Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements in this report\n- Decrease in rent expense of $4.1 million primarily related to the purchase of our Global Headquarters Facility, see Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements in this report\n- Decrease in travel costs of $2.4 million due to our restriction on non-essential employee travel in response to COVID-19\n- Decrease in compensation costs of $1.8 million primarily related to the decision to replace our 2020 cash bonus plans with grants of performance-based equity awards, which are being recognized as stock-based compensation expense between May 1, 2020 and May 1, 2021. These awards may be earned and become eligible for vesting on May 1, 2021 subject to meeting certain performance conditions and the recipient's continued employment with us\n2019 vs. 2018\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased by $7.1 million, or 6.6%, primarily driven by the following:\n+ Increase in compensation costs of $13.2 million primarily related to stock-based compensation and our acquisition of YourCause. The increase in stock-based compensation was primarily driven by increases in the grant date fair values of our annual equity awards granted to employees between 2017 and 2019 as our headcount had grown.\n- Decrease in acquisition-related expenses and integration costs of $3.0 million related to our purchase of YourCause\nRestructuring\nDuring 2017, in an effort to further our organizational objectives including, improved operating efficiency, customer outcomes and employee satisfaction, we initiated a multi-year plan to consolidate and relocate some of our existing offices to highly modern and more collaborative workspaces with short-term financial commitments. We substantially completed our facilities optimization restructuring plan as of December 2019. During the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we incurred $5.8 million and $4.6 million, respectively, in before-tax restructuring charges related to these activities. Such charges during the year ended December 31, 2020 were insignificant.\nRestructuring costs incurred prior to our adoption of ASU 2016-02 on January 1, 2019 consisted primarily of costs to terminate lease agreements, contractual lease payments, net of estimated sublease income, upon vacating space as part of the plan, as well as insignificant costs to relocate affected employees and write-off facilities-related fixed assets that we would no longer use.\nUpon adoption of ASU 2016-02 at January 1, 2019, we reduced our operating lease ROU assets recognized at transition by the carrying amounts of the restructuring liabilities for certain leased office spaces that we ceased using prior to December 31, 2018. Restructuring costs incurred during the year ended December 31, 2019 consisted primarily of\n2020 Form 10-K\nBlackbaud, Inc.\noperating lease ROU asset impairment costs and, to a lesser extent, lease payments for offices we had ceased using and write-offs of facilities-related fixed assets that we would no longer use.\nInterest Expense\nYears ended December 31,\n(dollars in millions) 2020 Change 2019 Change 2018\nInterest expense $ 17.3 (16.2) % $ 20.6 29.7 % $ 15.9\n% of total revenue 1.9 % 2.3 % 1.9 %\n2020 vs. 2019\nInterest expense decreased in dollars and as a percentage of revenue during 2020, when compared to 2019, primarily due to a decrease in our average daily borrowings. Our acquisition of YourCause in January 2019 drove the increase in borrowings during 2019 and no business acquisitions were made in 2020.\n2019 vs. 2018\nInterest expense increased during 2019, when compared to 2018, primarily due to an increase in our average daily borrowings related to our acquisition of YourCause in January 2019.\nDeferred Revenue\nThe table below compares the components of deferred revenue from our consolidated balance sheets:\n(dollars in millions) Timing of recognition December 31,\n2020 December 31,\n2019 Change\nRecurring Over the period billed in advance, generally one year $ 303.8 $ 302.8 0.4 %\nOne-time services and other As services are delivered 13.1 13.4 (2.3) %\nTotal deferred revenue(1)\n316.9 316.1 0.2 %\nLess: Long-term portion 4.7 1.8 159.6 %\nCurrent portion(1)\n$ 312.2 $ 314.3 (0.7) %\n(1)The individual amounts for each year may not sum to total deferred revenue or current portion of deferred revenue due to rounding.\nTo the extent that our customers are billed for our solutions and services in advance of delivery, we record such amounts in deferred revenue. Our recurring revenue contracts are generally for a term of three years at contract inception with one to three-year renewals thereafter, billed annually in advance and non-cancelable. We generally invoice our customers with recurring revenue contracts in annual cycles 30 days prior to the end of the contract term.\nDeferred revenue from recurring revenue contracts as well as one-time services and other were held flat during 2020, primarily due to declines in our 2020 bookings performance compared to our budgeted expectations as a result of COVID-19.\nWe have acquired businesses whose net tangible assets include deferred revenue. In accordance with GAAP reporting requirements, we recorded write-downs of deferred revenue from customer arrangements predating the acquisition to fair value, which resulted in lower recorded deferred revenue as of the acquisition date than the actual amounts paid in advance for solutions and services under those customer arrangements. Therefore, our deferred revenue after an acquisition will not reflect the full amount of deferred revenue that would have been reported if the acquired deferred revenue was not written down to fair value. Further explanation of this impact is included below under the caption \"Non-GAAP financial measures\".\n2020 Form 10-K\nBlackbaud, Inc.\nIncome Taxes\nOur income tax expense (benefit) and effective income tax rates, including the effects of period-specific events, were:\nYears ended December 31,\n(dollars in millions) 2020 2019 2018\nIncome tax expense (benefit) $ 13.9 $ (1.3) $ (0.2)\nEffective income tax rate 64.3 % (12.5) % (0.5) %\nOur effective income tax rate may fluctuate quarterly and annually as a result of factors, including changes in tax law in jurisdictions where we conduct business, transactions entered into, changes in the geographic distribution of our earnings or losses, and our assessment of certain tax contingencies and valuation allowances.\nWe have deferred tax assets for federal, state, and international net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits. The federal and state net operating loss carryforwards are subject to various Internal Revenue Code limitations and applicable state tax laws. A portion of the foreign and state net operating loss carryforwards and a portion of state tax credits have a valuation reserve due to the uncertainty of realizing such carryforwards and credits in the future.\nWe file income tax returns in the U.S. for federal and various state jurisdictions as well as in foreign jurisdictions including Canada, the U.K., Australia, Ireland and Costa Rica. We are generally subject to U.S. federal income tax examination for calendar tax years ending 2016 through 2020, as well as state and foreign income tax examinations for various years depending on statute of limitations of those jurisdictions.\nWe have taken federal and state tax positions for which it is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits may decrease within the next twelve months. The possible decrease could result from the expiration of statutes of limitations. The reasonably possible decrease at December 31, 2020 was $1.1 million.\nWe recognize accrued interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.\n2020 vs. 2019\nThe increase in our effective tax rate in 2020 when compared to 2019, was primarily due to increase in valuation allowance attributable to state tax credit carryforwards for which we do not expect to realize benefit. Furthermore, our 2020 effective tax rate was negatively impacted by reduced benefit attributable to research tax credit and stock based compensation deduction. Lastly, higher 2020 earnings lessened impact of other non-deductible items.\nThe total amount of unrecognized tax benefit that, if recognized, would favorably affect the effective income tax rate, was $4.2 million and $3.9 million at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively.\n2019 vs. 2018\nThe decrease in our effective income tax rate in 2019, when compared to 2018, was primarily due to the heightened impact of research credit generation net of Section 162(m) nondeductible compensation. Furthermore, the 2019 effective tax rate was favorably impacted by other state tax credits net of an overall increase to uncertain tax positions. Lastly, the effective tax rate was negatively impacted by Global Intangible Low-Tax Income (\"GILTI\"), net of Foreign-Derived Intangible Income (\"FDII\") benefit, resulting from an increase in non-US earnings. The reduced base further magnified the impact of other nondeductible items.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe operating results analyzed below are presented on a non-GAAP basis. We use non-GAAP financial measures internally in analyzing our operational performance. Accordingly, we believe these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors, as a supplement to GAAP measures, in evaluating our ongoing operational performance. While we believe these non-GAAP measures provide useful supplemental information, non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures may not be completely comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies due to potential differences in the exact method of calculation between companies.\n2020 Form 10-K\nBlackbaud, Inc.\nWe have acquired businesses whose net tangible assets include deferred revenue. In accordance with GAAP reporting requirements, we recorded write-downs of deferred revenue under arrangements predating the acquisition to fair value, which resulted in lower recognized revenue than the contributed purchase price until the related obligations to provide services under such arrangements are fulfilled. Therefore, our GAAP revenues after the acquisitions will not reflect the full amount of revenue that would have been reported if the acquired deferred revenue was not written down to fair value. The non-GAAP measures described below reverse the acquisition-related deferred revenue write-downs so that the full amount of revenue booked by the acquired companies is included, which we believe provides a more accurate representation of a revenue run-rate in a given period and, therefore, will provide more meaningful comparative results in future periods.\nThe non-GAAP financial measures discussed below exclude the impact of certain transactions because we believe they are not directly related to our operating performance in any particular period, but are for our long-term benefit over multiple periods. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures reflect our ongoing business in a manner that allows for meaningful period-to-period comparisons and analysis of trends in our business.\nYears ended December 31,\n(dollars in millions) 2020 Change 2019 Change 2018\nGAAP Revenue $ 913.2 1.4 % $ 900.4 6.1 % $ 848.6\nNon-GAAP adjustments:\nAdd: Acquisition-related deferred revenue write-down - (100.0) % 1.9 (19.8) % 2.4\nNon-GAAP revenue(1)\n$ 913.2 1.2 % $ 902.4 6.0 % $ 851.0\nGAAP gross profit $ 485.2 0.7 % $ 482.0 3.2 % $ 466.9\nGAAP gross margin 53.1 % 53.5 % 55.0 %\nNon-GAAP adjustments:\nAdd: Acquisition-related deferred revenue write-down - (100.0) % 1.9 (19.8) % 2.4\nAdd: Stock-based compensation expense 13.4 297.3 % 3.4 (35.8) % 5.2\nAdd: Amortization of intangibles from business combinations 39.0 (13.0) % 44.8 6.0 % 42.2\nAdd: Employee severance 0.9 (25.7) % 1.2 33.0 % 0.9\nSubtotal(1)\n53.2 3.8 % 51.3 0.9 % 50.8\nNon-GAAP gross profit(1)\n$ 538.4 1.0 % $ 533.3 3.0 % $ 517.7\nNon-GAAP gross margin 59.0 % 59.1 % 60.8 %\n(1)The individual amounts for each year may not sum to non-GAAP revenue, subtotal or non-GAAP gross profit due to rounding.\n2020 Form 10-K\nBlackbaud, Inc.\nYears ended December 31,\n(dollars in millions, except per share amounts) 2020 Change 2019 Change 2018\nGAAP income from operations $ 37.2 37.2 % $ 27.1 (54.3) % $ 59.4\nGAAP operating margin 4.1 % 3.0 % 7.0 %\nNon-GAAP adjustments:\nAdd: Acquisition-related deferred revenue write-down - (100.0) % 1.9 (19.8) % 2.4\nAdd: Stock-based compensation expense 87.3 48.8 % 58.6 21.5 % 48.3\nAdd: Amortization of intangibles from business combinations 41.9 (16.4) % 50.1 6.4 % 47.1\nAdd: Employee severance 4.9 10.2 % 4.4 97.0 % 2.2\nAdd: Acquisition-related integration costs (0.1) (105.6) % 2.4 (35.0) % 3.7\nAdd: Acquisition-related expenses 0.4 (69.6) % 1.2 (59.2) % 2.8\nAdd: Restructuring and other real estate activities 23.3 301.0 % 5.8 26.5 % 4.6\nSubtotal(1)\n157.5 26.6 % 124.4 12.0 % 111.1\nNon-GAAP income from operations(1)\n$ 194.8 28.5 % $ 151.6 (11.1) % $ 170.5\nNon-GAAP operating margin 21.3 % 16.8 % 20.0 %\nGAAP income before provision for income taxes $ 21.6 104.2 % $ 10.6 (76.3) % $ 44.6\nGAAP net income $ 7.7 (35.2) % $ 11.9 (73.4) % $ 44.8\nShares used in computing GAAP diluted earnings per share 48,696,341 0.8 % 48,312,271 0.6 % 48,045,084\nGAAP diluted earnings per share $ 0.16 (36.0) % $ 0.25 (73.1) % $ 0.93\nNon-GAAP adjustments:\nAdd: GAAP income tax provision (benefit) 13.9 (1,150.4) % (1.3) 504.1 % (0.2)\nAdd: Total Non-GAAP adjustments affecting loss from operations 157.5 26.6 % 124.4 12.0 % 111.1\nNon-GAAP income before provision for income taxes 179.1 32.7 % 135.0 (13.3) % 155.7\nAssumed non-GAAP income tax provision(2)\n35.8 32.7 % 27.0 (13.3) % 31.1\nNon-GAAP net income(1)\n$ 143.3 32.7 % $ 108.0 (13.3) % $ 124.6\nShares used in computing Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share 48,696,341 0.8 % 48,312,271 0.6 % 48,045,084\nNon-GAAP diluted earnings per share $ 2.94 31.3 % $ 2.24 (13.5) % $ 2.59\n(1)The individual amounts for each year may not sum to subtotal, non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP income before provision for income taxes or non-GAAP net income due to rounding.\n(2)We apply a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 20.0% when calculating non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share.\n2020 Form 10-K\nBlackbaud, Inc.\nNon-GAAP free cash flow\nNon-GAAP free cash flow is defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures, including costs required to be capitalized for software development, and capital expenditures for property and equipment.\nYears ended December 31,\n(dollars in millions) 2020 Change 2019 Change 2018\nGAAP net cash provided by operating activities $ 148.0 (18.9) % $ 182.5 (9.4) % $ 201.4\nLess: purchase of property and equipment (29.7) 158.4 % (11.5) (21.9) % (14.7)\nLess: capitalized software development costs (42.2) (10.1) % (46.9) 24.6 % (37.6)\nNon-GAAP free cash flow $ 76.1 (38.7) % $ 124.1 (16.7) % $ 149.0\nNon-GAAP organic revenue growth\nIn addition, we use non-GAAP organic revenue growth, non-GAAP organic revenue growth on a constant currency basis and non-GAAP organic recurring revenue growth, in analyzing our operating performance. We believe that these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors, as a supplement to GAAP measures, for evaluating the periodic growth of our business on a consistent basis. Each of these measures of non-GAAP organic revenue growth excludes incremental acquisition-related revenue attributable to companies acquired in the current fiscal year. For companies, if any, acquired in the immediately preceding fiscal year, each of these non-GAAP organic revenue growth measures reflects presentation of full year incremental non-GAAP revenue derived from such companies as if they were combined throughout the prior period, and they include the non-GAAP revenue attributable to those companies, as if there were no acquisition-related write-downs of acquired deferred revenue to fair value as required by GAAP. In addition, each of these non-GAAP organic revenue growth measures excludes prior period revenue associated with divested businesses. The exclusion of the prior period revenue is to present the results of the divested businesses within the results of the combined company for the same period of time in both the prior and current periods.

See Non-GAAP organic revenue growth table above.\nSeasonality\nOur revenues normally fluctuate as a result of certain seasonal variations in our business. Our transaction revenue has historically been at its lowest in the first quarter due to the timing of customer fundraising initiatives and events. Our revenue from payment services has historically increased during the fourth quarter due to year-end giving. Our revenue from professional services has historically been lower in the first quarter when many of those services commence and in the fourth quarter due to the holiday season. As a result of these and other factors, our total revenue has historically been lower in the first quarter than in the remainder of our fiscal year, with the fourth quarter historically achieving the highest total revenue. Our expenses, however, do not vary significantly as a result of these factors, but do fluctuate on a quarterly basis due to varying timing of expenditures. Our cash flow from operations normally fluctuates quarterly due to the combination of the timing of customer contract renewals including renewals associated with customers of\n2020 Form 10-K\nBlackbaud, Inc.\nacquired companies, delivery of professional services and occurrence of customer events, the payment of bonuses, as well as merit-based salary increases, among other factors. Historically, due to lower revenues in our first quarter, combined with the payment of bonuses from the prior year in our first quarter and the payment of certain annual vendor contracts, our cash flow from operations has been lowest in our first quarter. Due to the timing of customer contract renewals and student enrollments, many of which take place at or near the beginning of our third quarter, our cash flow from operations has been lower in our second quarter as compared to our third and fourth quarters. Partially offsetting these favorable drivers of cash flow from operations in our third and fourth quarters are merit-based salary increases, which have historically been effective in April each year. Annual merit-based salary increases are expected to return in July 2021. In addition, deferred revenues can vary on a seasonal basis for the same reasons. Our cash flow from financing is negatively impacted in our first quarter when most of our equity awards vest, as we pay taxes on behalf of our employees related to the settlement or exercise of equity awards. These patterns may change as a result of the continued shift to online giving, growth in volume of transactions for which we process payments, or as a result of acquisitions, new market opportunities, new solution introductions, the COVID-19 pandemic or other factors.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe following table presents selected financial information about our financial position:\n(dollars in millions) December 31,\n2020 December 31,\n2019 Change\nCash and cash equivalents $ 35.8 $ 31.8 12.4 %\nProperty and equipment, net 105.2 35.5 195.9 %\nSoftware development costs, net 111.8 101.3 10.4 %\nTotal carrying value of debt 531.0 467.1 13.7 %\nWorking capital (194.3) (254.3) 23.6 %\nThe following table presents selected financial information about our cash flows:\nYears ended December 31,\n(dollars in millions) 2020 Change 2019 Change 2018\nNet cash provided by operating activities $ 148.0 (18.9) % $ 182.5 (9.4) % $ 201.4\nNet cash used in investing activities (71.8) (57.0) % (167.2) (71.0) % (97.8)\nNet cash (used in) provided by financing activities (10.7) (109.6) % 111.2 (138.1) % (291.9)\nOur principal sources of liquidity are operating cash flow, funds available under the 2020 Credit Facility and cash on hand. Our operating cash flow depends on continued customer renewal of our subscription and maintenance arrangements and market acceptance of our solutions and services. Based on current estimates of revenue and expenses, we believe that the currently available sources of funds and anticipated cash flows from operations will be adequate for at least the next twelve months to finance our operations, fund anticipated capital expenditures and meet our debt obligations. To the extent we undertake future material acquisitions, investments or unanticipated capital expenditures, we may require additional capital. In that context, we regularly evaluate opportunities to enhance our capital structure including through potential debt or equity issuances.\n2020 Form 10-K\nBlackbaud, Inc.\nTo better enable us to weather the extraordinary business challenges brought about by the global COVID-19 pandemic, to protect the safety and welfare of our employees, and to further effect our long-term strategy to deliver the greatest value to our stockholders, we have taken several actions. These initial measures taken are expected to provide us the financial flexibility needed to manage a wide array of outcomes that may result from the pandemic. Some of these actions include the following:\n\u2022Temporarily closed our offices worldwide and transitioned our employees to work remotely;\n\u2022Rescinded our previously announced policy to pay an annual dividend at a rate of $0.48 per share of common stock and discontinued the declaration and payment of all cash dividends, beginning with the second quarter of 2020 and thereafter until such time, if any, as our Board of Directors may otherwise determine in its sole discretion;\n\u2022Suspended our 401(k)-match program, whereby we have historically matched 50% of qualified U.S. employees' contributions to our 401(k) plan up to 6% of their salaries, between April 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020;\n\u2022Made a discretionary matching contribution to eligible employees 401(k) plans in December 2020 totaling $1.2 million, given our financial performance during the fourth quarter;\n\u2022Temporarily froze our hiring efforts and implemented a modest and targeted headcount reduction, though we have since begun backfilling key roles, including engineering positions;\n\u2022Michael Gianoni, our President and Chief Executive Officer, elected to forego receipt of all but that portion of his base salary necessary to fund, on a pre-tax basis, his contributions to continue to participate in our health benefits plan, between April 1, 2020 and June 16, 2020;\n\u2022Restricted non-essential employee travel and put in place other operating cost containment actions;\n\u2022All of our employees with a base salary equal to or less than $75 thousand received financial support in the form of a one-time bonus of $1 thousand on April 30, 2020;\n\u2022On May 1, 2020, we granted RSUs to our employees that were eligible for base salary merit increases in lieu of such increases, which will vest on May 1, 2021 subject to the recipient's continued employment with us;\n\u2022On May 1, 2020, we granted PRSUs to our employees that were eligible for a 2020 cash bonus plan in lieu of such cash bonus, which may be earned and become eligible for vesting on May 1, 2021 subject to meeting certain performance conditions and the recipient's continued employment with us; and\n\u2022During the third quarter of 2020, we adjusted our workforce strategy to provide more flexibility for our employees to work remotely when our offices reopen. This change also expands our access to a larger and more diverse talent pool, empowers our leaders to make decisions based on skills and business need rather than location, and it is expected to create efficiencies within our real estate strategy as we optimize our footprint and shift toward more collaborative workspaces within our offices. Most of the transactions related to these real estate activities closed during the fourth quarter of 2020 with an aggregate one-time cash outlay of $21.9 million during the third and fourth quarters of 2020. We incurred approximately $23.1 million of pre-tax costs related to these real estate activities during the third and fourth quarters of 2020. These activities are expected to result in future annual before-tax savings of approximately $14.0 million beginning in 2021.\nIn addition to the initial actions we have taken to date, we are continuously evaluating further possible actions in order to respond quickly to rapidly changing conditions, if needed.\nWhile we experienced an increase in our aging of receivables during the second and third quarters of 2020 primarily associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, we have seen some improvement in our customers' payment behavior since that time. We have received short-term payment relief requests as a result of COVID-19, most often in the form of payment deferral requests. We are evaluating each request on a case-by-case basis to assess the customer's ability to pay. Not all customer requests ultimately result in modified payment terms, nor are we forgoing our contractual rights under customer agreements. During 2020, our bad debt expense increased by $4.6 million, compared to 2019. We are continually monitoring our customer receivable balances, payment terms, and creditworthiness for changes that could have a significant impact on the collectability of our accounts receivables, our operating results and financial position.\nAt December 31, 2020, our total cash and cash equivalents balance included approximately $18.5 million of cash that was held outside the U.S. While these funds may not be needed to fund our U.S. operations for at least the next twelve months, if we need these funds, we may be required to accrue and pay taxes to repatriate a portion of the funds. We currently do not intend or anticipate a need to repatriate our cash held outside the U.S.\n2020 Form 10-K\nBlackbaud, Inc.\nOperating Cash Flow\nDuring 2021, we expect our total operating cash flow to increase when compared to 2020, primarily due to:\n\u2022the replacement of our 2020 cash bonus plans with performance-based equity awards (which we expect will continue going forward);\n\u2022the one-time cash payments associated with the exit of a number of our leases in 2020 that will not recur in 2021; and\n\u2022improvements to working capital management (an expected increase in trade accounts payable); partially offset by\n\u2022an increase in the payment of payroll taxes as we deferred payments of the employer's portion of Social Security taxes during 2020 under the Coronavirus, Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (\"CARES Act\");\n\u2022the return of annual merit-based salary increases to our employees in July 2021; and\n\u2022the return of our 401(k)-match program effective January 1, 2021.\nThroughout 2020, 2019 and 2018, our cash flows from operations were derived principally from: (i) our earnings from on-going operations prior to non-cash expenses such as depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation, deferred income taxes, amortization of deferred financing costs and debt discount and adjustments to our provision for credit losses and sales returns; and (ii) changes in our working capital.\nWorking capital changes are comprised of changes in accounts receivable, prepaid expenses and other assets, trade accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities and deferred revenue.\n2020 vs. 2019\nNet cash provided by operating activities decreased by $34.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2020, when compared to the same period in 2019, primarily due a $81.0 million decrease in cash flow from operations associated with working capital, partially offset by a $46.5 million increase in net income adjusted for non-cash expenses.\nThe decrease in cash flow from operations associated with working capital during 2020, when compared to 2019, was primarily due to:\n\u2022an increase in current period bonus payments as a result of an increase in amounts accrued as of December 31, 2019 for over-performance against 2019 targets;\n\u2022a decrease in current period bonus accrual due to our decision to replace cash payments for our 2020 bonus plans with performance-based equity awards;\n\u2022a decrease in customer billings and payment collections due to the declines in our 2020 bookings performance compared to 2019 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022an increase in the aging of customer receivable balances, primarily due to COVID-19;\n\u2022an increase in one-time cash payments associated with the exit of a number of our leases; and\n\u2022fluctuations in the timing of vendor payments.\n2019 vs. 2018\nNet cash provided by operating activities decreased by $18.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2019, when compared to the same period in 2018, primarily due to a $10.8 million decrease in net income adjusted for non-cash expenses, and a decrease in cash flow from operations associated with working capital.\n2020 Form 10-K\nBlackbaud, Inc.\nCash flow from operations associated with working capital decreased $8.1 million during 2019, when compared to 2018, primarily due to:\n\u2022an increase in the amount of deferred revenue recognized slightly outpacing customer billings;\n\u2022an increase in collection of customer account balances in 2018 from an aging improvement initiative; and\n\u2022an income tax refund received in 2018 which did not recur in 2019; partially offset by\n\u2022an increase in accrued bonuses as of December 31, 2019 when compared the same date in 2018; and\n\u2022fluctuations in the timing of vendor payments.\nInvesting Cash Flow\nDuring 2021, we expect our total capital expenditures to decrease when compared to 2020, primarily due to the purchase of our Global Headquarters Facility in 2020 that will not recur in 2021.\n2020 vs. 2019\nNet cash used in investing activities of $71.8 million decreased by $95.4 million during 2020, when compared to 2019.\nWe spent $109.4 million for our acquisition of YourCause in 2019 and we did not make any similar investments during 2020. We used $42.2 million for software development costs, which was down $4.7 million from cash spent during 2019. We continue to invest in our innovative cloud solutions, as well as development activities for Blackbaud SKY, our modern cloud platform.\nWe also spent $29.7 million of cash for purchases of property and equipment during 2020, which was up $18.2 million from cash spent in 2019. The additional cash expended was primarily used to purchase our Global Headquarters Facility.\n2019 vs. 2018\nNet cash used in investing activities of $167.2 million increased by $69.4 million during 2019, when compared to 2018.\nDuring 2019, we used net cash of $109.4 million, for our acquisition of YourCause, while we spent $44.9 million on investments in acquired companies in 2018. We used $46.9 million for software development costs, which was up $9.2 million from cash spent during 2018. The increase in cash outlays for software development costs was primarily related to our innovative cloud solutions as well as development activities for Blackbaud SKY, our modern cloud platform.\nWe also spent $11.5 million of cash for purchases of property and equipment during 2019, which was down $3.2 million from cash spent in 2018. The higher cash outlays for property and equipment during 2018 was primarily driven by leasehold improvements for our Global Headquarters Facility.\nFinancing Cash Flow\n2020 vs. 2019\nDuring 2020, we had a net increase in borrowings of $0.9 million, compared to a net increase in borrowings of $79.5 million in 2019, which was primarily attributable to our acquisition of YourCause. During 2020, we spent $41.0 million on repurchases of our common stock (see additional details below regarding our stock repurchase program). In addition, during 2020, we paid dividends of $6.0 million, which was down compared to 2019, as we discontinued the declaration and payment of all cash dividends beginning with the second quarter of 2020.\nWe paid $21.4 million to satisfy tax obligations of employees upon settlement or exercise of equity awards during 2020 compared to $23.8 million during 2019. The amount of taxes paid by us on behalf of employees related to the settlement or exercise of equity awards varies from period to period based upon the timing of grants and vesting, employee exercise decisions, as well as the market price for shares of our common stock at the time of settlement. Most of our equity awards currently vest in our first quarter.\n2020 Form 10-K\nBlackbaud, Inc.\nCash flow from financing activities associated with changes in restricted cash due to customers decreased $16.6 million during 2020, when compared to 2019, as the amount of restricted cash held and payable by us to customers as of December 31, 2019 was significantly larger than at the same date in 2018 primarily due to the timing of year-end donations. Additionally, effective August 3, 2020, a significant amount of restricted cash related to charitable giving transacted through our social responsibility and grantmaking solutions is now held and disbursed by the Blackbaud Giving Fund, an independent nonprofit organization, strategic partner of ours, and sponsoring organization for a donor advised fund. This change was made primarily to better support our YourCause CSR Connect and YourCause Grants Connect solutions.\n2019 vs. 2018\nDuring 2019, we had a net increase in borrowings of $79.5 million, which was primarily attributable to our acquisition of YourCause, compared to a net decrease in borrowings of $51.6 million in 2018.\nWe paid $23.8 million to satisfy tax obligations of employees upon settlement or exercise of equity awards during 2019 compared to $27.7 million during 2018. In addition, during 2019, we paid dividends of $23.6 million, which was relatively consistent with 2018.\nCash flow from financing activities associated with changes in restricted cash due to customers increased $266.3 million during 2019, when compared to 2018. The amount of restricted cash held and payable by us to customers as of December 31, 2017 was significantly larger than at the same date in 2018 primarily due to the timing of year-end donations.\nStock repurchase program\nIn November 2020, our Board of Directors reauthorized and expanded a stock repurchase program that authorizes us to purchase up to $250.0 million of our outstanding shares of common stock. The program does not have an expiration date. Under the stock repurchase program, we are authorized to repurchase shares from time to time in accordance with applicable laws both on the open market, including under trading plans established pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and in privately negotiated transactions. The timing and amount of repurchases depends on several factors, including market and business conditions, the trading price of our common stock and the nature of other investment opportunities. The repurchase program may be limited, suspended or discontinued at any time without prior notice. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we purchased 714,000 shares for $41.0 million. Between January 1, 2021 and February 19, 2021, we repurchased an additional 465,821 shares for $28.1 million.\n2020 Credit Facility\nIn October 2020, we entered into a 5-year $900.0 million Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the \u201c2020 Credit Facility\u201d). Upon closing, we drew $400.0 million on a term loan and used the proceeds to repay the outstanding principal balance of the term loan under the previous credit facility, and repay $124.4 million of outstanding revolving credit loans under the previous credit facility.\nHistorically, we have drawn on our credit facility from time to time to help us meet financial needs primarily due to the seasonality of our cash flows from operations and financing for business acquisitions. At December 31, 2020, our available borrowing capacity under the 2020 Credit Facility was $429.3 million. The 2020 Credit Facility matures in October 2025.\nAt December 31, 2020, the carrying amount of our debt under the 2020 Credit Facility was $467.1 million. Our average daily borrowings were $482.4 million during 2020.\nFollowing is a summary of the financial covenants under the 2020 Credit Facility:\nFinancial Covenant Requirement Ratio as of December 31, 2020\nNet Leverage Ratio \u2264 4.00 to 1.00 1.75 to 1.00\nInterest Coverage Ratio \u2265 2.50 to 1.00 15.95 to 1.00\n2020 Form 10-K\nBlackbaud, Inc.\nUnder the 2020 Credit Facility, we also have restrictions on our ability to declare and pay dividends and our ability to repurchase shares of our common stock. In order to pay any cash dividends and/or repurchase shares of stock: (i) no default or event of default shall have occurred and be continuing under the 2020 Credit Facility, and (ii) our pro forma net leverage ratio, as set forth in the 2020 Credit Facility, must be 0.25 less than the net leverage ratio requirement at the time of dividend declaration or share repurchase. At December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with our debt covenants under the 2020 Credit Facility.\nCommitments and Contingencies\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had contractual obligations with future minimum commitments as follows:\nPayments due by period\n(in millions) Total(1)\nLess than 1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years More than 5 years\nRecorded contractual obligations:\nDebt(2)\n$ 534.2 $ 12.8 $ 25.0 $ 443.0 $ 53.4\nOperating leases(3)\n29.5 10.4 10.2 5.1 3.8\nInterest payments on debt(4)\n4.5 3.4 1.1 - -\nUnrecorded contractual obligations:\nPurchase obligations(5)\n94.8 59.1 34.6 1.0 -\nInterest payments on debt(6)\n79.5 11.5 23.4 21.0 23.6\nTotal contractual obligations(1)\n$ 742.5 $ 97.2 $ 94.3 $ 470.2 $ 80.8\n(1)The individual amounts for each obligation may not sum to total or total contractual obligations due to rounding.\n(2)Represents principal payments only, under the following assumptions: (i) that the amounts outstanding under the 2020 Credit Facility, our real estate loans and our other debt at December 31, 2020 will remain outstanding until maturity, with minimum payments occurring as currently scheduled, and (ii) that there are no assumed future borrowings on the 2020 Revolving Facility for the purposes of determining minimum commitment amounts.\n(3)Our commitments related to operating leases have not been reduced by sublease income, incentive payments, reimbursement of leasehold improvements and the amount representing imputed interest of $2.8 million.\n(4)Represents interest payment obligations related to our interest rate swap agreements.\n(5)We have contractual obligations for third-party technology used in our solutions and for other services we purchase as part of our normal operations. In certain cases, these arrangements require a minimum annual purchase commitment by us.\n(6)The actual interest expense recognized in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income will depend on the amount of debt, the length of time the debt is outstanding and the interest rate, which could be different from our assumptions described in (2) above.\nThe term loan under the 2020 Credit Facility and our other debt require periodic principal payments. The balance of the term loans and any amounts drawn on the revolving credit loans are due upon maturity of the 2020 Credit Facility in October 2025. The Real Estate Loans also require periodic principal payments and the balance of the real estate loans are due upon maturity in April 2038.\nThe total liability for uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, was $4.6 million and $4.3 million, respectively. Our accrued interest and penalties related to tax positions taken on our tax returns was $1.1 million and $1.0 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2020, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC, that have or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.\n2020 Form 10-K\nBlackbaud, Inc.\nForeign Currency Exchange Rates\nApproximately 15% of our total revenue for 2020 was generated by operations outside the U.S. We do not have significant operations in countries in which the economy is considered to be highly inflationary. Our consolidated financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars and, accordingly, changes in the exchange rate between foreign currencies and the U.S. dollar will affect the translation of our subsidiaries\u2019 financial results into U.S. dollars for purposes of reporting our consolidated financial results. The accumulated currency translation adjustment, recorded within other comprehensive loss as a component of stockholders\u2019 equity, was a gain of $0.6 million as of December 31, 2020 and a loss of $4.0 million as of December 31, 2019.\nThe vast majority of our contracts are entered into by our U.S. or U.K. entities. The contracts entered into by the U.S. entity are almost always denominated in U.S. dollars or Canadian dollars, and contracts entered into by our U.K., Australian and Irish subsidiaries are generally denominated in British Pounds, Australian dollars and Euros, respectively. Historically, as the U.S. dollar weakened, foreign currency translation resulted in an increase in our revenues and expenses denominated in non-U.S. currencies. Conversely, as the U.S. dollar strengthened, foreign currency translation resulted in a decrease in our revenues and expenses denominated in non-U.S. currencies. During 2020, foreign translation resulted in decreases in our revenues and expenses denominated in non-U.S. currencies. Though we have exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, the impact has generally not been material to our consolidated results of operations or financial position. During 2020, the fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates reduced our total revenue and our income from operations by $0.8 million and $0.7 million, respectively. We will continue monitoring such exposure and take action as appropriate. To determine the impacts on revenue (or income from operations) from fluctuations in currency exchange rates, current period revenues (or income from operations) from entities reporting in foreign currencies were translated into U.S. dollars using the comparable prior year period's weighted average foreign currency exchange rates. These impacts are non-GAAP financial information and are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, information prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nInflation\nWe do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. If our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases. Our inability or failure to do so could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, if inflationary pressures impact the rate of giving to our customers, there could be adverse impacts to our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOur discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\"GAAP\"). The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. On an ongoing basis, we reconsider and evaluate our estimates and assumptions.\nWe base our estimates on historical experience, current trends and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could materially differ from any of our estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements in this report. We believe the accounting estimates listed below are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results, and they require our most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain.\n2020 Form 10-K\nBlackbaud, Inc.\nRevenue Recognition\nDescription Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ\nFrom Assumptions\nSee Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements in this report for a complete discussion of our revenue recognition policies.\nRevenues are recognized when control of our services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those services.\nWe determine revenue recognition through the following steps:\n(1) Identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer;\n(2) Identification of the performance obligations in the contract;\n(3) Determination of the transaction price;\n(4) Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and\n(5) Recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation.\nOur revenue recognition accounting methodology contains uncertainties because it requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions, and to apply judgment.\nFor example, for arrangements that have multiple performance obligations, we must exercise judgment and use estimates in order to (1) determine whether performance obligations are distinct and should be accounted for separately; (2) determine the standalone selling price of each performance obligation; (3) allocate the transaction price among the various performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price basis; and (4) determine whether revenue for each performance obligation should be recognized at a point in time or over time.\nIn addition, we exercise judgment in certain transactions when determining whether we should recognize revenue based on the gross amount billed to a customer (as a principal) or the net amount retained (as an agent). These judgments are based on our determination of whether or not we control the service before it is transferred to the customer.\nIf we were to change any of these judgments or estimates, it could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue or deferred revenue that we report in a particular period.\nCosts of Obtaining Contracts\nDescription Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ\nFrom Assumptions\nWe pay sales commissions at the time contracts with customers are signed or shortly thereafter, depending on the size and duration of the sales contract. Sales commissions and related fringe benefits earned by our sales force are considered incremental and recoverable costs of obtaining a contract with a customer. These costs are deferred and then amortized in a manner that aligns with the expected period of benefit, which we have determined to be five years. We do not generally pay commissions for contract renewals. The related amortization expense is included in sales, marketing and customer success expense in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income.\nOur accounting methodology for determining the period over which we amortize costs of obtaining contracts with customers contains uncertainties because it requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions, and to apply judgment.\nFor example, we must exercise judgment and use estimates in order to determine the expected period of benefit of our sales commissions. We take into consideration our customer contracts, including renewals, retention, our technology and other factors.\nIf we were to change any of these judgments or estimates, it could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of assets, operating expenses or income that we report in a particular period.\n2020 Form 10-K\nBlackbaud, Inc.\nBusiness Combinations\nDescription Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ\nFrom Assumptions\nWe allocate the purchase price of an acquired business to its identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date based upon their estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the amount allocated to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed, if any, is recorded as goodwill.\nWe use available information to estimate fair values. We typically engage outside appraisal firms to assist in the fair value determination of long-lived and identifiable intangible assets, and any other significant assets or liabilities. We adjust the preliminary purchase price allocation, as necessary, up to one year after the acquisition closing date as we obtain new information about facts and circumstances that existed as of the closing date.\nOur purchase price allocation methodology contains uncertainties because it requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions, and to apply judgment to estimate the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, especially with respect to long-lived and intangible assets.\nManagement estimates the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on quoted market prices, the carrying value of the acquired assets and widely accepted valuation techniques, including discounted cash flows and market multiple analyses.\nCritical estimates in valuing intangible assets include, but are not limited to, estimates about: expected future cash flows from customers, including revenue and operating expenses; royalty and customer attrition rates; proprietary technology obsolescence curve; the acquired company's brand awareness and market position; the market awareness of the acquired company's branded technology solutions and services; assumptions about the period of time the brands will continue to be valuable; as well as expected costs to develop any in-process research and development into commercially viable solutions and estimated cash flows from the projects when completed, and discount rates. Our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions we believe to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. Assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate, and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur.\nIf actual results are materially different than the assumptions we used to determine fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed through a business combination as well as the estimated useful lives of the acquired intangible assets, it is possible that adjustments to the carrying values of such assets and liabilities will have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations.\nSee Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements in this report for information regarding our business acquisitions.\nIncome Taxes\nDescription Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ\nFrom Assumptions\nWe make estimates and judgments in accounting for income taxes. Our income tax returns, like those of most companies, are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities.\nWe measure and recognize uncertain tax positions. To recognize uncertain tax positions, we must first determine if it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon audit. We must then measure the benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement.\nWe make estimates in determining tax assets and liabilities, which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial reporting purposes. We record valuation allowances to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.\nThe calculation of our income tax provision requires estimates due to transactions, credits and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Uncertainties arise as a consequence of the actual source of taxable income between domestic and foreign locations, the outcome of tax audits and the ultimate utilization of tax credits.\nOur effective income tax rate is also affected by changes in the geographic distribution of our earnings or losses, changes in tax law in jurisdictions where we conduct business.\nSignificant judgment is required in the identification and measurement of uncertain tax positions. Our liability for unrecognized tax benefits contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various filing positions.\nIn assessing the adequacy of a recorded valuation allowance significant judgment is required. We consider all positive and negative evidence and a variety of factors including the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, historical and projected future taxable income, and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies.\nAlthough we believe that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable, actual results could differ, and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material.\nTo the extent actual results differ from estimated amounts recorded, such differences will impact the income tax provision in the period in which the determination is made.\nIf we determine there is less than a 50% likelihood that we will be able to use a deferred tax asset in the future in excess of its net carrying value, then an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance is made to increase income tax expense, thereby reducing net income in the period such determination was made.\n2020 Form 10-K\nBlackbaud, Inc.\nLong-lived Assets and Intangible Assets Other Than Goodwill\nDescription Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ\nFrom Assumptions\nWe review our long-lived assets and intangible assets other than goodwill for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If such events or changes in circumstances occur, we use the undiscounted cash flow method to determine whether our long-lived and intangible assets other than goodwill are impaired. To the extent that the carrying value of the asset exceeds the undiscounted cash flows over the estimated remaining life of the asset, we measure the impairment using discounted cash flows.\nWhen measuring impairment of an asset using discounted cash flows, we make assumptions and apply judgment in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values, including annual revenue growth rates, a terminal year growth rate and selecting a discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows.\nWe have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology we use to assess impairment loss during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nDuring 2020, we recorded impairment charges against certain property and equipment assets and certain operating lease ROU assets. For additional information, see Notes 7 and 11 to our consolidated financial statements in this report.\nWe do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to assess impairment losses. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to an impairment charge that could materially adversely impact our consolidated financial position and results of operations.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nFor a discussion of the impact that recently issued accounting pronouncements are expected to have on our financial position and results of operations when adopted in the future, see Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements in this report.\n2020 Form 10-K\nBlackbaud, Inc.",
    "item_7A": "ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nWe have market rate sensitivity for interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates.\nInterest Rate Risk\nOur variable rate debt is our primary financial instrument with market risk exposure for changing interest rates. We manage our variable rate interest rate risk through a combination of short-term and long-term borrowings and the use of derivative instruments entered into for hedging purposes. Our interest rate exposure includes LIBOR rates. The Financial Conduct Authority in the U.K. has stated that it plans to phase out LIBOR by the end of calendar year 2021. We do not currently anticipate a significant impact to our financial position or results of operations as a result of this action as we expect that our financial contracts currently indexed to LIBOR will either expire or be modified without significant financial impact before the phase out occurs. Due to the nature of our debt, the materiality of the fair values of the derivative instruments and the highly liquid, short-term nature and level of our cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2020, we believe there is no material risk of exposure to changing interest rates for those positions. There were no significant changes in how we manage interest rate risk between December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2020.\nForeign Currency Risk\nFor a discussion of our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, see \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Foreign Currency Exchange Rates\u201d in Item 7 of this report.\n2020 Form 10-K\nBlackbaud, Inc.",

We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.\nChange in Accounting Principle\nAs discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts\nfor leases in 2019.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management's Report on Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with\n2020 Form 10-K\ngenerally accepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nRevenue recognition - Contracts with Multiple Performance Obligations\nAs described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has some contracts with customers that contain multiple performance obligations. For these contracts, management accounts for individual performance obligations separately if they are distinct. As described by management, management exercises judgment and uses estimates in order to (1) determine whether performance obligations are distinct and should be accounted for separately; (2) determine the standalone selling price of each performance obligation; (3) allocate the transaction price among the various performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price basis; and (4) determine whether revenue for each performance obligation should be recognized at a point in time or over time. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company\u2019s total revenue was $913.2 million.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to revenue recognition, contracts with multiple performance obligations, is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management in identifying, evaluating and accounting for performance obligations in contracts with multiple performance obligations, which led to significant auditor judgment and effort in performing procedures to evaluate whether contracts with multiple performance obligations were appropriately identified, evaluated and accounted for by management.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the revenue recognition process, including controls over the identification, evaluation and accounting for contracts with multiple performance obligations. These procedures also included, among others, testing management\u2019s process for identifying, evaluating and accounting for performance obligations. This included, (i) examining revenue arrangements on a test basis, including evaluating the terms and conditions of the arrangements and testing the identification, evaluation and accounting of the performance obligations; (ii) testing the allocation of the transaction price between performance obligations based on the estimated standalone selling prices on a test basis; (iii) performing procedures to test the completeness and accuracy of the data used to determine stand-alone selling price; and (iv) evaluating the reasonableness of the approach used to determine stand-alone selling price.\n/S/ PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS LLP\nAtlanta, Georgia\nFebruary 23, 2021\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2000.\n2020 Form 10-K\nBlackbaud, Inc.\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\n(dollars

As of December 31, 2020, we had over 45,000 global customers.\n2. Basis of Presentation\nBasis of presentation\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\u201cGAAP\u201d).\nBasis of consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Blackbaud, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nRisks and uncertainties related to COVID-19\nWe are subject to risks and uncertainties as a result of the global COVID-19 pandemic. We believe that COVID-19 has impacted and will continue to impact all of our vertical markets across all of our geographies to some degree, but the significance and duration of the impact on our business cannot be determined at this time due to numerous uncertainties, including, the duration of the outbreak, travel restrictions and business closures, the effectiveness of vaccination programs and other actions taken to contain the disease and other unforeseeable consequences.\nUse of estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. On an ongoing basis, we reconsider and evaluate our estimates and assumptions, including those that impact revenue recognition, long-lived and intangible assets, income taxes, business combinations, stock-based compensation, capitalization of software development costs, our allowances for credit losses and sales returns, costs of obtaining contracts, valuation of derivative instruments and loss contingencies, among others. Changes in the facts or circumstances underlying these estimates, including due to COVID-19, could result in material changes and actual results could materially differ from these estimates.\n2020 Form 10-K\nBlackbaud, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nResponse to COVID-19\nTo better enable us to weather the extraordinary business challenges brought about by the global COVID-19 pandemic, to protect the safety and welfare of our employees, and to further effect our long-term strategy to deliver the greatest value to our stockholders, we have taken several actions. These measures taken are expected to provide us the financial flexibility needed to manage a wide array of outcomes that may result from the pandemic. Some of these actions include the following:\n\u2022Temporarily closed our offices worldwide and transitioned our employees to work remotely;\n\u2022Rescinded our previously announced policy to pay an annual dividend at a rate of $0.48 per share of common stock and discontinued the declaration and payment of all cash dividends, beginning with the second quarter of 2020 and thereafter until such time, if any, as our Board of Directors may otherwise determine in its sole discretion;\n\u2022Suspended our 401(k)-match program, whereby we have historically matched 50% of qualified U.S. employees' contributions to our 401(k) plan up to 6% of their salaries, between April 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020;\n\u2022Made a discretionary matching contribution to eligible employees 401(k) plans in December 2020 totaling $1.2 million, given our financial performance during the fourth quarter;\n\u2022Temporarily froze our hiring efforts and implemented a modest and targeted headcount reduction, though we have since begun backfilling key roles, including engineering positions;\n\u2022Michael Gianoni, our President and Chief Executive Officer, elected to forego receipt of all but that portion of his base salary necessary to fund, on a pre-tax basis, his contributions to continue to participate in our health benefits plan, between April 1, 2020 and June 16, 2020;\n\u2022Restricted non-essential employee travel and put in place other operating cost containment actions;\n\u2022All of our employees with a base salary equal to or less than $75 thousand received financial support in the form of a one-time bonus of $1 thousand on April 30, 2020;\n\u2022On May 1, 2020, we granted restricted stock units with a total grant date fair value of $8.3 million to our employees that were eligible for base salary merit increases in lieu of such increases, which will vest on May 1, 2021 subject to the recipient's continued employment with us;\n\u2022On May 1, 2020, we granted performance-based restricted stock units with a total grant date fair value of $34.4 million to our employees that were eligible for a 2020 cash bonus plan in lieu of such cash bonus, which may be earned and become eligible for vesting on May 1, 2021 subject to meeting certain performance conditions and the recipient's continued employment with us; and\n\u2022During the third quarter of 2020, we adjusted our workforce strategy to provide more flexibility for our employees to work remotely when our offices reopen. This change also expands our access to a larger and more diverse talent pool, empowers our leaders to make decisions based on skills and business need rather than location, and it is expected to create efficiencies within our real estate strategy as we optimize our footprint and shift toward more collaborative workspaces within our offices. Most of the transactions related to these real estate activities closed during the fourth quarter of 2020 with an aggregate one-time cash outlay of $21.9 million during the third and fourth quarters of 2020. We incurred approximately $23.1 million of pre-tax costs related to these real estate activities during the third and fourth quarters of 2020. These activities are expected to result in future annual before-tax savings of approximately $14.0 million beginning in 2021.\nRecently adopted accounting pronouncements\nIn June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update (\u201cASU\u201d) 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (\u201cASU 2016-13\u201d). ASU 2016-13 requires certain types of financial instruments, including trade receivables, to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected based on historical events, current conditions and forward-looking information. We adopted ASU 2016-13 as of the January 1, 2020 effective date and the adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-15, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other-Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer\u2019s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That Is a Service Contract (\u201cASU 2018-15\u201d). ASU 2018-15 aligns the accounting for implementation costs related to a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the guidance on capitalizing costs associated with developing or obtaining internal-use software. We adopted ASU 2018-15 prospectively as of the January 1, 2020 effective date and the adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\n2020 Form 10-K\nBlackbaud, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (\"ASU 2016-02\"). ASU 2016-02 requires lessees to record most leases on their balance sheet but recognize expenses in the income statement in a manner similar to previous guidance. The way in which entities classify leases determines how to recognize lease-related revenue and expense.\nWe adopted ASU 2016-02 as of January 1, 2019 using the transition method that allowed us to initially apply the guidance at the adoption date of January 1, 2019 without adjusting comparative periods presented. We elected to use the package of practical expedients that allowed us to not reassess: (1) whether any expired or existing contracts are or contain leases, (2) lease classification for any expired or existing leases and (3) initial direct costs for any existing leases. We did not elect to use the hindsight practical expedient, which permits entities to use hindsight in determining the lease term and assessing impairment. Additionally, we elected not to apply the recognition requirements of the new lease accounting standard to short-term leases. Adopting ASU 2016-02 had a material impact on our consolidated balance sheet as of January 1, 2019, as we recognized $121.6 million of lease liabilities and $113.4 million of right-of-use (\"ROU\") assets for those leases classified as operating leases.\nRecently issued accounting pronouncements\nThere are no recently issued accounting pronouncements that are expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations when adopted in the future.\nSummary of significant accounting policies\nRevenue recognition\nOur revenue is primarily generated from the following sources: (i) charging for the use of our software solutions in cloud and hosted environments; (ii) providing payment and transaction services; (iii) providing software maintenance and support services; and (iv) providing professional services, including implementation, consulting, training, analytic and other services. Revenues are recognized when control of these services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those services.\nWe determine revenue recognition through the following steps:\n\u2022Identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer;\n\u2022Identification of the performance obligations in the contract;\n\u2022Determination of the transaction price;\n\u2022Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and\n\u2022Recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation.\nRecurring\nRecurring revenue represents stand-ready performance obligations in which we are making our solutions or services available to our customers continuously over time or the value of the contract renews. Therefore, recurring revenue is generally recognized over time on a ratable basis over the contract term, beginning on the date that the solution or service is made available to the customer. Our recurring revenue contracts are generally for a term of 3 years at contract inception with 1 to 3-year renewals thereafter, billed annually in advance and non-cancelable.\nRecurring revenue is comprised of fees for the use of our subscription-based software solutions, which includes providing access to cloud solutions, hosting services, payment services, online training programs, subscription-based analytic services, such as donor acquisitions and data enrichment services. Recurring revenue also includes fees from maintenance services for our on-premises solutions, services included in our renewable subscription contracts, retained and managed services contracts that we expect to have a term consistent with our cloud solution contracts, and variable transaction revenue associated with the use of our solutions.\nOur payment services are offered with the assistance of third-party vendors. In general, when we are the principal in a transaction based on the factors identified in ASC 606-10-55-36 through 55-40, we record the revenue and related\n2020 Form 10-K\nBlackbaud, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\ncosts on a gross basis. Otherwise, we net the cost of revenue associated with the service against the gross revenue (amount billed to the customer) and record the net amount as revenue. For payment and transaction services, we have the right to invoice the customer in an amount that directly corresponds with the value to the customer of our performance to date. Therefore, we recognize revenue for these services over time based on the amount billable to the customer in accordance with the 'as invoiced' practical expedient in ASC 606-10-55-18.\nOne-time services and other\nOne-time services and other revenue is primarily comprised of fees for one-time consulting, analytic and onsite training services, fees for retained and managed services contracts that we do not expect to have a term consistent with our cloud solution contracts, and fees from user conferences.\nWe generally bill consulting services based on hourly rates plus reimbursable travel-related expenses. Fixed price consulting engagements are generally billed as milestones towards completion are reached. Revenue for all consulting services is recognized over time as the services are performed.\nWe generally recognize analytic services revenue from donor prospect research engagements, the sale of lists of potential donors, data enrichment engagements and benchmarking studies at a point in time (upon delivery).\nIn certain cases, we sell training at a fixed rate for each specific class at a per attendee price or at a packaged price for several attendees, and recognize the related revenue upon the customer attending and completing training.\nFees for retained and managed services contracts are generally billed in advance and recognized over time on a ratable basis over the contract term, beginning on the date the service is made available to the customer.\nContracts with multiple performance obligations\nSome of our contracts with customers contain multiple performance obligations. For these contracts, we account for individual performance obligations separately if they are distinct. The transaction price is allocated to the separate performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price basis. Standalone selling prices of our solutions and services are typically estimated based on observable transactions when the solutions or services are sold on a standalone basis.\nCosts of obtaining contracts, contract assets and deferred revenue\nWe pay sales commissions at the time contracts with customers are signed or shortly thereafter, depending on the size and duration of the sales contract. Sales commissions and related fringe benefits earned by our sales force are considered incremental and recoverable costs of obtaining a contract with a customer. These costs are deferred and then amortized in a manner that aligns with the expected period of benefit, which we have determined to be 5 years. We determined the period of benefit by taking into consideration our customer contracts, including renewals, retention, our technology and other factors. We do not generally pay commissions for contract renewals. The related amortization expense is included in sales, marketing and customer success expense in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income.\nA contract asset is recorded when revenue is recognized in advance of our right to receive consideration (i.e., we must satisfy additional performance obligations in order to receive consideration). Amounts are recorded as receivables when our right to consideration is unconditional (i.e., only the passage of time is required before payment of the consideration is due). Our contract assets are recorded within prepaid expenses and other current assets on our consolidated balance sheets. To the extent that our customers are billed for our solutions and services in advance of us satisfying the related performance obligations, we record such amounts in deferred revenue.\nSales taxes\nWe present sales taxes and other taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities on a net basis and, as such, exclude them from revenues.\n2020 Form 10-K\nBlackbaud, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nFair value measurements\nWe measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis, including derivative instruments. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. An active market is defined as a market in which transactions for the asset or liability take place with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. We use a three-tier fair value hierarchy to measure fair value. This hierarchy prioritizes the inputs into three broad levels as follows:\n\u2022Level 1 - Quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets;\n\u2022Level 2 - Quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets in markets that are not active, and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets; and\n\u2022Level 3 - Valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs are unobservable.\nOur financial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety within the hierarchy based on the lowest level of input that is significant to fair value measurement. Changes to a financial asset's or liability's level within the fair value hierarchy are determined as of the end of a reporting period. All methods of assessing fair value result in a general approximation of value, and such value may never actually be realized.\nDerivative instruments\nWe generally use derivative instruments to manage interest rate risk. We view derivative instruments as risk management tools and do not use them for trading or speculative purposes. Our policy requires that derivatives used for hedging purposes be designated and effective as a hedge of the identified risk exposure at the inception of the contract. Accordingly, changes in fair value of the derivative contract must be highly correlated with changes in the fair value of the underlying hedged item at inception of the hedge and over the life of the hedge contract.\nWe record all derivative instruments on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value as either an asset or liability. If the derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge, the effective portions of the changes in fair value of the derivative are recorded in other comprehensive income and reclassified to earnings in a manner that matches the timing of the earnings impact of the hedged transactions. Ineffective portions of the changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are recognized currently in earnings. See Note 10 to these consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our derivative instruments.\nCash and cash equivalents\nWe consider all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less and cash items in transit to be cash equivalents.\nRestricted cash due to customers; Customer funds receivable; Due to customers\nRestricted cash due to customers consists of monies collected by us and payable to our customers, net of the associated transaction fees earned. Monies associated with amounts due to customers are segregated in separate bank accounts and used exclusively for the payment of amounts due to customers. This usage restriction is either legally or internally imposed and reflects our intention with regard to such deposits. Customer funds receivable consists of monies we expect to collect and remit to our customers.\nConcentration of credit risk\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash due to customers and accounts receivable. Our cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash due to customers are placed with high credit-quality financial institutions. Our accounts receivable is derived from sales to customers who primarily operate in the nonprofit sector. With respect to accounts receivable, we perform ongoing evaluations of our customers and maintain an allowance for credit losses based on historical experience and our\n2020 Form 10-K\nBlackbaud, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nexpectations of future credit losses. As of and for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, there were no significant concentrations with respect to our consolidated revenues or accounts receivable.\nProperty and equipment\nWe record property and equipment assets at cost and depreciate them over their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the lesser of the term of the lease or the estimated useful life of the asset. Upon retirement or sale, the cost of assets disposed of and the related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is credited or charged to earnings. Repair and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.\nConstruction-in-progress primarily related to purchases of facilities and information technology assets which had not been placed in service at the respective balance sheet dates. We transfer these assets to the applicable property and equipment category on the date they are placed in service. There was no capitalized interest applicable to construction-in-progress for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.\nBusiness combinations\nWe include the operating results of acquired companies as well as the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. We are required to allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date based upon their estimated fair values. Goodwill as of the acquisition date represents the excess of the purchase consideration of an acquired business over the fair value of the underlying net tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed. This allocation and valuation require management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to long-lived and intangible assets.\nCritical estimates in valuing intangible assets include, but are not limited to, estimates about: expected future cash flows from customers, including revenue and operating expenses; royalty and customer attrition rates; proprietary technology obsolescence curve; the acquired company's brand awareness and market position, the market awareness of the acquired company's branded technology solutions and services; assumptions about the period of time the brand will continue to be valuable; as well as expected costs to develop any in-process research and development into commercially viable solutions and estimated cash flows from the projects when completed, and discount rates. Our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions we believe to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable, and unanticipated events and changes in circumstances may occur.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the purchase price in excess of the net amount assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed by us in a business combination. Goodwill is not amortized, but tested annually for impairment on the first day of our fourth quarter, or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment arise.\nAccounting guidance permits entities to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis to determine whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative impairment test. Significant judgment is required in the assessment of qualitative factors, including but not limited to an evaluation of macroeconomic conditions as they relate to our business, industry and market trends, as well as the overall future financial performance of identified reporting units and future opportunities in the markets in which we operate.\nThe quantitative impairment test compares the fair values of identified reporting units with their respective carrying amounts. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. Based on our current internal reporting structure, we currently have one operating segment, one reportable segment, and one reporting unit. In each of 2020, 2019 and 2018, we performed the quantitative impairment test, which indicated that the estimated fair values of the identified reporting units significantly exceeded their respective carrying values. There was no impairment of goodwill during 2020, 2019 and 2018.\n2020 Form 10-K\nBlackbaud, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nIntangible assets other than goodwill\nWe amortize finite-lived intangible assets over their estimated useful lives as follows.\nBasis of amortization Amortization\nperiod\n(in years)\nCustomer relationships Straight-line and accelerated(1)\n8-17\nMarketing assets Straight-line 2-15\nAcquired software and technology Straight-line and accelerated(1)\n5-14\n(1)Certain of the customer relationships and acquired software and technology assets are amortized on an accelerated basis.\nWe write off the gross carrying amount and accumulated amortization balances for all fully amortized intangible assets. We evaluate the estimated useful lives and the potential for impairment of finite and indefinite-lived intangible assets on an annual basis or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate revised estimates of useful lives may be appropriate or that the carrying amount may be impaired. If the carrying amount of a finite-lived intangible asset is no longer recoverable based upon the undiscounted cash flows of the asset, the amount of impairment is the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset. Substantially all of our intangible assets were acquired in business combinations. See Note 6 to these consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our impairment of certain acquired intangible assets during 2019. There were no impairments of acquired intangible assets during 2020 and 2018.\nImpairment of long-lived assets\nWe review long-lived assets for impairment when events change or circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Events or changes in circumstances that indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable include, but are not limited to, a significant decrease in the market value of the business or asset acquired, a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which the business or asset acquired is used or significant adverse change in the business climate. If such events or changes in circumstances are present, the undiscounted cash flow method is used to determine whether the asset is impaired. See Note 6 to these consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our impairment of certain long-lived assets during 2020 and 2019. There was no impairment of long-lived assets during 2018.\nDeferred financing costs and debt discount\nDeferred financing costs included in other assets represent the direct third-party costs of entering into the revolving (line-of-credit) portion of our credit facility in October 2020 and portions of the unamortized deferred financing costs from prior facilities. These costs are amortized ratably over the term of the credit facility as interest expense.\nOther debt issuance costs, as well as the debt discount associated with our 2020 Credit facility (as defined below) and portions of the unamortized balances from prior facilities, are recorded as a direct deduction from debt. These costs are amortized over the term of the credit facility as interest expense.\nStock-based compensation\nWe measure stock-based compensation cost at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and recognize it as expense over the requisite service period, which is the vesting period. We determine the fair value of stock options and stock appreciation rights using a Black-Scholes option pricing model, which requires us to use significant judgment to make estimates regarding the life of the award, volatility of our stock price, the risk-free interest rate and the dividend yield of our stock over the life of the award. We determine the fair value of awards that contain market conditions using a Monte Carlo simulation model. Changes to these estimates would result in different fair values of awards.\nWe recognize the effect of awards for which the requisite service period is not rendered when the award is forfeited (that is, we recognize the effect of forfeitures in compensation cost when they occur). Previously recognized compensation cost for an award is reversed in the period that the award is forfeited. Income tax benefits resulting from\n2020 Form 10-K\nBlackbaud, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nthe vesting and exercise of stock-based compensation awards are recognized in the period the unit or award is vested or option or right is exercised.\nIncome taxes\nWe make estimates and judgments in accounting for income taxes. The calculation of the income tax provision requires estimates due to transactions, credits and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Uncertainties arise as a consequence of the actual source of taxable income between domestic and foreign locations, the outcome of tax audits and the ultimate utilization of tax credits. To the extent actual results differ from estimated amounts recorded, such differences will impact the income tax provision in the period in which the determination is made.\nWe make estimates in determining tax assets and liabilities, which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes. We record valuation allowances to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. In assessing the adequacy of a recorded valuation allowance significant judgment is required. We consider all positive and negative evidence and a variety of factors including the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, historical and projected future taxable income, and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. If we determine there is less than a 50% likelihood that we will be able to use a deferred tax asset in the future in excess of its net carrying value, then an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance is made to increase income tax expense, thereby reducing net income in the period such determination was made.\nWe measure and recognize uncertain tax positions. To recognize such positions, we must first determine if it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon audit. We must then measure the benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Significant judgment is required in the identification and measurement of uncertain tax positions.\nForeign currency\nNet assets recorded in a foreign currency are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Revenue and expense items are translated using an average of monthly exchange rates. The resulting translation adjustments are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income.\nGains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions denominated in currency other than the functional currency are recorded at the approximate rate of exchange at the transaction date in other income, net. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2018, we recorded net foreign currency losses of $1.1 million and $0.9 million, respectively. For the year ended 2019, we recorded a net foreign currency loss that was insignificant.\nResearch and development\nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred except as noted below under Software development costs. These costs include compensation costs for engineering and product management personnel, third-party contractor expenses, software development tools and other expenses related to researching and developing new solutions or upgrading and enhancing existing solutions that do not qualify for capitalization, and allocated depreciation, facilities and IT support costs.\nSoftware development costs\nWe incur certain costs associated with the development of internal-use software, which are primarily related to activities performed to develop our cloud solutions. Internal and external costs incurred in the preliminary project stage of internal-use software development are expensed as incurred. Once the software being developed has reached the application development stage, qualifying internal costs including payroll and payroll-related costs of employees who are directly associated with and devote time to the software project as well as external direct costs of materials and services are capitalized. Capitalization ceases at the point at which the developed software is substantially complete and ready for its intended use, which is typically upon completion of all substantial testing. Qualifying costs capitalized during the application development stage include those related to specific upgrades and enhancements when it is probable that those costs incurred will result in additional functionality. Overhead costs, including general and administrative costs, as well as maintenance, training and all other costs associated with post-implementation stage\n2020 Form 10-K\nBlackbaud, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nactivities are expensed as incurred. In addition, internal costs that cannot be reasonably separated between maintenance and relatively minor upgrades and enhancements are expensed as incurred.\nQualifying capitalized software development costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the software asset's estimated useful life, which is generally 3 to 7 years. We evaluate the useful lives of these assets on an annual basis and test for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets. See Note 6 to these consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our impairment of certain capitalized software development costs during 2020. There were no impairment charges related to capitalized software development costs during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. We write off the gross carrying amount and accumulated amortization balances for all fully amortized software development cost assets.\nAllowance for credit losses\nOur accounts receivable consist of a single portfolio segment. Accounts receivable are recorded at original invoice amounts less an allowance for credit losses, an amount we estimate to be sufficient to provide adequate protection against lifetime expected losses resulting from extending credit to our customers. In judging the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses, we consider multiple factors including historical bad debt experience, the current aging of our receivables and current economic conditions that may affect our customers' ability to pay. A considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing these factors and if any receivables were to deteriorate, an additional provision for credit losses could be required. Accounts are written off after all means of collection are exhausted and recovery is considered remote. Provisions for credit losses are recorded in general and administrative expense.\nBelow is a summary of the changes in our allowance for credit losses.\nYears ended December 31,\n(in thousands) Balance at\nbeginning of year Provision/\nadjustment Write-off Recovery Balance at\nend of year\n2020(1)\n$ 4,011 $ 6,787 $ (2,363) $ 581 $ 9,016\n2019 1,345 2,476 (2,617) 679 1,883\n2018 741 2,446 (2,663) 821 1,345\n(1)Upon adoption of ASU 2016-13 at January 1, 2020, we reclassified certain balances previously disclosed within the allowance for sales returns to the allowance for credit losses, as these amounts reflect the credit risk associated with our accounts receivable. The amount reclassified was $2.1 million.\nThe increase in our allowance for credit losses during the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily due to an increase in the aging of our receivables during the second and third quarters of 2020 associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. We saw some improvement in our customers' payment behavior during the fourth quarter. The amount of write-offs during the year ended December 31, 2020 was lower than the amount of write-offs during the same period in 2019 as we temporarily suspended sending past due customer accounts to collections during the second and third quarters due to payment delays related to COVID-19.\nAllowance for sales returns\nWe maintain a reserve for returns and credits which is estimated based on several factors including historical experience, known credits yet to be issued, the aging of customer accounts and the nature of service level commitments. A considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing these factors. Provisions for sales returns and credits are charged against the related revenue items.\nBelow is a summary of the changes in our allowance for sales returns.\nYears ended December 31,\n(in thousands) Balance at\nbeginning of year Provision/\nadjustment Deduction Balance at\nend of year\n2020(1)\n$ 1,518 $ 6,443 $ (6,685) $ 1,276\n2019 3,377 6,232 (5,963) 3,646\n2018 4,400 4,952 (5,975) 3,377\n(1)As discussed above, we reclassified certain balances previously disclosed within the allowance for sales returns to the allowance for credit losses upon adoption of ASU 2016-13 at January 1, 2020. The amount reclassified was $2.1 million.\n2020 Form 10-K\nBlackbaud, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nAdvertising costs\nWe expense advertising costs as incurred, which were $3.0 million, $3.1 million and $4.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nRestructuring costs\nRestructuring costs include charges for the costs of exit or disposal activities. The liability for costs associated with exit or disposal activities is measured initially at fair value and only recognized when the liability is incurred. For details of our restructuring activities, see Note 19 to these consolidated financial statements.\nLeases\nWe determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating leases are included in operating lease ROU assets, accrued expense and other current liabilities, and operating lease liabilities, net of current portion in our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020.\nROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we generally use our incremental borrowing rate in determining the present value of lease payments. Our incremental borrowing rate is based on the estimated rate of interest for collateralized borrowing over a similar term of the lease payments at the commencement date. We use the implicit rate when readily determinable. The operating lease ROU asset also includes any initial direct costs and lease payments made and excludes lease incentives. Our lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Lease expense for lease payments related to our operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. We have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, which are generally accounted for separately. We do not recognize short-term leases (those that, at the commencement date, have a lease term of 12 months or less) on our consolidated balance sheets. Variable lease payments, which are primarily comprised of common-area maintenance, utilities and real estate taxes that are passed on from the lessor in proportion to the space leased by us, are recognized in operating expenses in the period in which the obligation for those payments is incurred.\nContingencies\nWe are subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies in the normal course of business. We record an accrual for a contingency when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Often these issues are subject to substantial uncertainties and, therefore, the probability of loss and the estimation of damages are difficult to ascertain. These assessments can involve a series of complex judgments about future events and can rely heavily on estimates and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by us. Although we believe we have substantial defenses in these matters, we could incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims that could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows in any particular period.\nEarnings per share\nWe compute basic earnings per share by dividing net income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing net income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares and dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share reflect the assumed exercise, settlement and vesting of all dilutive securities using the \u201ctreasury stock method\u201d except when the effect is anti-dilutive. Potentially dilutive securities consist of shares issuable upon the exercise of stock options and stock appreciation rights and vesting of restricted stock awards and units.\n2020 Form 10-K\nBlackbaud, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n3. Business Combinations\n2019 Acquisition\nYourCause\nOn January 2, 2019, we acquired all of the outstanding equity securities, including all voting equity interests, of YourCause Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (\"YourCause\"), pursuant to a purchase agreement and plan of merger. The acquisition expanded our footprint in corporate social responsibility and employee engagement and enhanced our position as a leader in providing solutions to both nonprofit organizations and for-profit companies committed to addressing social issues. We acquired the equity securities for an aggregate purchase price of $157.7 million in cash, net of closing adjustments. The purchase price and related expenses were funded primarily through borrowings under the 2017 Credit Facility. As a result of the acquisition, YourCause became a wholly owned subsidiary of ours. We finalized the purchase price allocation of YourCause, including the valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, during the fourth quarter of 2019. All measurement period adjustments were insignificant. We determined that the impact of this acquisition was not material to our consolidated financial statements; therefore, revenue and earnings since the acquisition date and pro forma information are not required or presented.\n2018 Acquisition\nReeher\nOn April 30, 2018, we acquired all of the outstanding equity securities, including all voting equity interests, of Reeher LLC, a Minnesota limited liability company (\u201cReeher\u201d), pursuant to a securities purchase agreement. The acquisition expanded our fundraising performance management capabilities with the goal of driving more effective fundraising and greater social good outcomes for our customers. We acquired the equity securities for an aggregate purchase price of $41.2 million in cash, net of closing adjustments. The purchase price and related expenses were funded primarily through borrowings under the 2017 Credit Facility. As a result of the acquisition, Reeher became a wholly owned subsidiary of ours. We finalized the purchase price allocation of Reeher, including the valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, during the second quarter of 2019. All measurement period adjustments were insignificant. We determined that the impact of this acquisition was not material to our consolidated financial statements; therefore, revenue and earnings since the acquisition date and pro forma information are not required or presented.\n4. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nThe change in our goodwill during 2020 consisted of the following:\n(dollars in thousands) Total\nBalance at December 31, 2019 $ 634,088\nEffect of foreign currency translation 1,766\nBalance at December 31, 2020 $ 635,854\n2020 Form 10-K\nBlackbaud, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nWe have recorded intangible assets acquired in various business combinations based on their fair values at the date of acquisition. The table below sets forth the balances of each class of intangible asset and related amortization as of:\nDecember 31,\n(dollars in thousands) 2020 2019\nFinite-lived gross carrying amount\nCustomer relationships $ 287,116 $ 286,951\nMarketing assets 34,642 34,246\nAcquired software and technology 232,339 233,094\nNon-compete agreements - 2,200\nTotal finite-lived gross carrying amount 554,097 556,491\nAccumulated amortization\nCustomer relationships (138,635) (118,031)\nMarketing assets (5,918) (3,648)\nAcquired software and technology (132,038) (115,048)\nNon-compete agreements - (1,869)\nTotal accumulated amortization (276,591) (238,596)\nIntangible assets, net $ 277,506 $ 317,895\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, changes to the gross carrying amounts of intangible asset classes were primarily related to write-offs of fully amortized intangible assets and the effect of foreign currency translation.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded an impairment charge of $0.9 million against an acquired marketing asset that reduced the carrying value of the asset to zero. The impairment charge resulted from our decision during the year to rebrand the solution to which the asset related. This impairment charge was recorded as amortization on our consolidated statements of comprehensive income.\nAmortization expense\nAmortization expense related to finite-lived intangible assets acquired in business combinations is allocated to cost of revenue on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income based on the revenue stream to which the asset contributes, except for marketing assets and non-compete agreements, for which the associated amortization expense is included in operating expenses.\nThe following table summarizes amortization expense of our finite-lived intangible assets:\nYears ended December 31,\n(dollars in thousands) 2020 2019 2018\nIncluded in cost of revenue:\nCost of recurring $ 36,835 $ 42,565 $ 39,877\nCost of one-time services and other 2,133 2,204 2,356\nTotal included in cost of revenue 38,968 44,769 42,233\nIncluded in operating expenses 2,915 5,316 4,844\nTotal amortization of intangibles from business combinations $ 41,883 $ 50,085 $ 47,077\n2020 Form 10-K\nBlackbaud, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nThe following table outlines the estimated future amortization expense for each of the next five years for our finite-lived intangible assets as of December 31, 2020:\nYears ending December 31,\n(dollars in thousands) Amortization\nexpense\n2021 36,933\n2022 34,739\n2023 33,735\n2024 33,222\n2025 30,482\nTotal $ 169,111\n5.

Fair Value Measurements\nRecurring fair value measurements\nAssets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis consisted of the following, as of the dates indicated below:\nFair value measurement using\n(dollars in thousands) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nFair value as of December 31, 2020\nFinancial liabilities:\nDerivative instruments $ - $ 4,159 $ - $ 4,159\nTotal financial liabilities $ - $ 4,159 $ - $ 4,159\nFair value as of December 31, 2019\nFinancial liabilities:\nDerivative instruments $ - $ 1,757 $ - $ 1,757\nTotal financial liabilities $ - $ 1,757 $ - $ 1,757\nOur derivative instruments within the scope of Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") 815, Derivatives and Hedging, are required to be recorded at fair value. Our derivative instruments that are recorded at fair value include interest rate swaps.\nThe fair value of our interest rate swaps was based on model-driven valuations using LIBOR rates, which are observable at commonly quoted intervals. Accordingly, our interest rate swaps are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The Financial Conduct Authority in the U.K. has stated that it plans to phase out LIBOR by the end of calendar year 2021. We do not currently anticipate a significant impact to our financial position or results of operations as a result of this action as we expect that our financial contracts currently indexed to LIBOR will either expire or be modified without significant financial impact before the phase out occurs.\nWe believe the carrying amounts of our cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable, trade accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities and due to customers approximate their fair values at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, due to the immediate or short-term maturity of these instruments.\nWe believe the carrying amount of our debt approximates its fair value at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, as the debt bears interest rates that approximate market value. As LIBOR rates are observable at commonly quoted intervals, our debt under the 2020 Credit Facility (as defined below) is classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Our fixed rate debt is also classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.\nWe did not transfer any assets or liabilities among the levels within the fair value hierarchy during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. Additionally, we did not hold any Level 3 assets or liabilities during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.\nNon-recurring fair value measurements\nAssets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis include long-lived assets, intangible assets, goodwill and operating lease ROU assets, which are recognized at fair value during the period in which an acquisition is completed or at lease commencement, from updated estimates and assumptions during the measurement period, or when they are considered to be impaired. These non-recurring fair value measurements, primarily for long-lived assets, intangible assets acquired and operating lease ROU assets, are based on Level 3 unobservable inputs. In the event of an impairment, we determine the fair value of these assets other than goodwill using a discounted cash flow approach, which contains significant unobservable inputs and, therefore, is considered a Level 3 fair value measurement. The unobservable inputs in the analysis generally include future cash flow projections and a discount rate. For goodwill\n2020 Form 10-K\nBlackbaud, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nimpairment testing, we estimate fair value using market-based methods including the use of market capitalization and consideration of a control premium.\nAs more fully described in Note 7 and Note 11, during the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded impairment charges of $4.3 million against certain previously capitalized software development costs and $4.0 million against our operating lease ROU assets.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded impairment charges of $3.8 million against our operating lease ROU assets, $1.4 million against certain property and equipment assets and $0.9 million against certain finite-lived intangible assets. See Notes 11, 7 and 4, respectively, to these consolidated financial statements for additional details.\nThere were no other non-recurring fair value adjustments during 2020, 2019 and 2018 except for certain business combination accounting adjustments to the initial fair value estimates of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date from updated estimates and assumptions during the measurement period. See Note 3 to these consolidated financial statements for additional details.\n7. Property and Equipment and Software Development Costs\nPurchase of Global Headquarters Facility\nIn August 2020, we completed the purchase of the building, fixtures and other improvements and parcels of land of our Global Headquarters Facility in Charleston, South Carolina, pursuant to a Purchase and Sale Agreement (the \"PSA\") with HPBB1, LLC, a Georgia limited liability company (the \"Seller\") (the \"Transaction\"). Prior to the completion of the Transaction, we leased the Global Headquarters Facility from the Seller. We paid the Seller a purchase price that included the assumption of the Seller's obligations of $61.1 million, cash of $15.2 million and certain lender fees, closing costs, adjustments and prorations as set forth in the PSA. We funded the cash portion of the purchase price through borrowings under our then-existing credit facility. We capitalized the insignificant direct transaction costs we incurred as a component of the assets acquired.\nAs a result of the Transaction, we derecognized the ROU asset and lease liability associated with the former lease and recorded the following long-lived assets on a relative fair value basis in property and equipment, net upon closing:\n(dollars in thousands) Assets\nacquired Estimated useful life (years)\nLand $ 9,548 -\nBuilding 61,284 39\nBuilding improvements 4,393 7 - 15\nTotal long-lived assets $ 75,225\n2020 Form 10-K\nBlackbaud, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nProperty and equipment\nProperty and equipment consisted of the following as of:\nEstimated\nuseful life\n(years) December 31,\n(dollars in thousands) 2020 2019\nLand - $ 9,548 $ -\nBuilding 39 61,284 -\nBuilding improvements(1)\n7 - 20\n9,942 -\nEquipment 1 - 5\n2,865 4,512\nComputer hardware 1 - 5\n56,202 67,045\nComputer software 1 - 5\n23,116 35,726\nConstruction in progress - 3,435 213\nFurniture and fixtures 1 - 7\n2,796 7,823\nLeasehold improvements Lesser of lease term or estimated useful life 6,044 24,295\nTotal property and equipment 175,232 139,614\nLess: accumulated depreciation (70,055) (104,068)\nProperty and equipment, net $ 105,177 $ 35,546\n(1)Upon acquisition of our Global Headquarters Facility in August 2020, we reclassified related leasehold improvement costs of $5.5 million to building improvements given the acquisition of the underlying assets.\nDepreciation expense was $19.2 million, $15.0 million and $15.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded impairment charges of $1.4 million against certain property and equipment assets that reduced the carrying value of the assets to zero. These impairment charges are reflected in restructuring on the statements of comprehensive income and resulted primarily from our facilities optimization restructuring as we wrote-off facilities-related fixed assets that we would no longer use. See Note 19 to these consolidated financial statements for additional details regarding our facilities optimization restructuring.\nSoftware development costs\nSoftware development costs consisted of the following as of:\nEstimated\nuseful life\n(years) December 31,\n(dollars in thousands) 2020 2019\nSoftware development costs 3 - 7\n$ 164,665 $ 139,014\nLess: accumulated amortization (52,838) (37,712)\nSoftware development costs, net $ 111,827 $ 101,302\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded an impairment charge of $4.3 million against certain previously capitalized software development costs that reduced the carrying value of those assets to zero. The impairment charge is reflected in cost of recurring revenue and resulted primarily from our decision to accelerate the end of customer support for certain solutions. Other changes to the gross carrying amount of software development costs were primarily related to qualifying costs associated with development activities that are required to be capitalized under the internal-use software accounting guidance such as those for our cloud solutions, write-offs of fully amortized assets, and the effect of foreign currency translation.\nAmortization expense related to software development costs was $31.7 million, $20.7 million and $16.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and is included primarily in cost of recurring.\n2020 Form 10-K\nBlackbaud, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n8.

The credit facility included: a dollar and a designated currency revolving credit facility with sublimits for letters of credit, swingline loans and multicurrency borrowings (the \u201c2017 Revolving Facility\u201d) and a term loan (the \u201c2017 Term Loan\u201d) together, (the \u201c2017 Credit Facility\u201d).\nIn October 2020, we entered into a 5-year $900.0 million Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the \u201c2020 Credit Facility\u201d). The 2020 Credit Facility matures in October 2025 and replaced the 2017 Credit Facility by amending and restating it to include a $500.0 million revolving credit facility (the \u201c2020 Revolving Facility\u201d) and a $400.0 million term loan facility (the \u201c2020 Term Loan\u201d). Upon closing, we borrowed $400.0 million pursuant to the 2020 Term Loan and used the proceeds to repay the outstanding principal balance of the term loan under the 2017 Credit Facility, and repay $124.4 million of outstanding revolving credit loans under the 2017 Revolving Facility.\nIn connection with the amendment and restatement of the 2017 Credit Facility, the existing Pledge Agreement dated June 2, 2017 (as amended, supplemented or modified from time to time, the \u201c2017 Pledge Agreement\u201d), by us in favor of Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, was likewise amended and restated.\nCertain lenders of the 2020 Term Loan participated in the 2017 Term Loan and the change in present value of our future cash flows to these lenders under the 2017 Term Loan and under the 2020 Term Loan was less than 10%. Accordingly, we accounted for the refinancing event as a debt modification. Certain lenders of the 2017 Term Loan did not participate in the 2020 Term Loan. Accordingly, we accounted for the refinancing event for these lenders as a debt extinguishment. Certain lenders of the 2017 Revolving Facility participated in the 2020 Revolving Facility and provided increased borrowing capacities. Accordingly, we accounted for the refinancing event for these lenders as a debt modification. Certain lenders of the 2017 Revolving Facility did not participate in the 2020 Revolving Facility. Accordingly, we accounted for the refinancing event for these lenders as a debt extinguishment.\nWe recorded an insignificant loss on debt extinguishment related to the write-off of debt discount and deferred financing costs for the portions of the 2017 Credit Facility considered to be extinguished. This loss was recognized in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income within other income, net.\nIn connection with our entry into the 2020 Credit Facility, we paid $4.0 million in financing costs, of which $1.2 million were capitalized in other assets and, together with a portion of the unamortized deferred financing costs from the 2017 Credit Facility and prior facilities, are being amortized into interest expense over the term of the new facility. As of December 31, 2020, deferred financing costs totaling $1.5 million were included in other assets on our consolidated balance sheets. We recorded aggregate financing costs of $2.0 million as a direct deduction from the carrying amount\n2020 Form 10-K\nBlackbaud, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nof our debt liability, which related to debt discount (fees paid to lenders) and debt issuance costs for the 2020 Term Loan.\nSummary of the 2020 Credit Facility\nThe 2020 Revolving Facility includes (i) a $50.0 million sublimit available for the issuance of standby letters of credit, (ii) a $50.0 million sublimit available for swingline loans, and (iii) a $100.0 million sublimit available for multicurrency borrowings.\nOur obligations under the 2020 Credit Facility are secured by the stock and limited liability company interests of certain of our direct subsidiaries and any of our material domestic subsidiaries, if any, and the proceeds therefrom pledged pursuant to an Amended and Restated Pledge Agreement dated as of October 30, 2020 (the \u201c2020 Pledge Agreement\u201d), by us in favor of Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, for the ratable benefit of itself and the secured parties referred to therein.\nDollar tranche loans under the 2020 Revolving Facility and 2020 Term Loan bear interest at a rate per annum equal to (a) a base rate equal to the highest of (i) the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.50%, (ii) the prime rate announced by Bank of America, N.A., and (iii) the Eurocurrency Rate (which varies depending on the currency in which the loan is denominated) plus 1.00% (the \u201cBase Rate\u201d), plus (b) an applicable margin as specified in the 2020 Credit Facility (the \u201cApplicable Margin\u201d). Each Eurocurrency Rate Loan under the 2020 Credit Facility shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Eurocurrency Rate, plus the Applicable Margin. The Applicable Margin shall be adjusted quarterly, varies based on our net leverage ratio and varies based on whether the loan is a Base Rate Loan (0.375% to 1.125%) or a Eurocurrency Rate Loan (1.375% to 2.125%).\nWe also pay a quarterly commitment fee on the unused portion of the 2020 Revolving Facility from 0.250% to 0.375% per annum, depending on our net leverage ratio. At December 31, 2020, the commitment fee was 0.25%.\nThe term loan under the 2020 Credit Facility requires periodic principal payments. The balance of the term loan and any amounts drawn on the revolving credit loans are due upon maturity of the 2020 Credit Facility in October 2025. We evaluate the classification of our debt as current or non-current based on the required annual maturities of the 2020 Credit Facility. We may prepay the 2020 Credit Facility in whole or in part at any time without premium or penalty, other than customary breakage costs with respect to certain types of loans.\nThe 2020 Credit Facility contains various representations, warranties and affirmative, negative and financial covenants customary for financings of this type. Financial covenants include a net leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio. At December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with our debt covenants under the 2020 Credit Facility.\nUnder the terms of the 2020 Credit Facility, we are entitled on one or more occasions, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, to request an increase in the commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility and/or request additional incremental term loans in the aggregate principal amount of up to $250.0 million plus an amount, if any, such that the net leverage ratio shall be no greater than 3.25 to 1.00. At December 31, 2020, our available borrowing capacity under the 2020 Credit Facility was $429.3 million.\nReal estate loans\nIn August 2020, we completed the purchase of our Global Headquarters Facility. As part of the purchase price, we assumed the Seller\u2019s obligations under (i) a 5.12% Senior Secured Note, Series A1, in the outstanding principal amount of $49.1 million, dated May 2, 2018, and (ii) a 5.61% Senior Secured Note, Series A2, in the outstanding principal amount of $12.0 million, dated May 2, 2018, or an aggregate outstanding principal amount of $61.1 million (collectively, the \u201cReal Estate Loans\u201d). The Series A1 Note provides that we will pay the remaining principal amount due thereunder together with interest thereon at the rate indicated above, in monthly installments until it matures in April 2038. The Series A2 Note provides that we pay interest only in monthly installments at the rate indicated above with the principal amount due at maturity in April 2038. The Real Estate Loans are secured by a first priority lien on the real property constituting the Global Headquarters Facility. Our assumption of the Real Estate Loans was a noncash investing and financing transaction and is reflected in our supplemental disclosure of cash flow information. At December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with our debt covenants under the Real Estate Loans.\n2020 Form 10-K\nBlackbaud, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nOther debt\nIn December 2019, we entered into a 51-month $2.2 million agreement to finance our purchase of software and related services for our internal use. The agreement is a non-interest-bearing note requiring four equal annual payments, where the first payment was due in January 2020. Interest associated with the note has been imputed at the rate we would incur for amounts borrowed under our then-existing credit facility.\nIn January 2020, we entered into an additional 39-month $3.5 million agreement to finance our purchase of software and related services for our internal use. The agreement is a non-interest-bearing note requiring three equal annual payments, where the first payment was due in March 2020. Interest associated with the note has been imputed at the rate we would incur for amounts borrowed under our then-existing credit facility.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the required annual maturities related to the 2020 Credit Facility, the Real Estate Loans and our other debt were as follows:\nYears ending December 31,\n(dollars in thousands) Annual\nmaturities\n2021 $ 12,840\n2022 12,985\n2023 11,983\n2024 11,609\n2025 431,408\nThereafter 53,352\nTotal required maturities $ 534,177\n10. Derivative Instruments\nCash flow hedges\nWe generally use derivative instruments to manage our variable interest rate risk. We have entered into interest rate swap agreements, which effectively convert portions of our variable rate debt under the 2020 Credit Facility to a fixed rate for the term of the swap agreements. We designated each of the interest rate swap agreements as a cash flow hedge at the inception of the contracts.\nThe terms and notional values of our derivative instruments were as follows as of December 31, 2020:\n(dollars in thousands) Term of derivative instrument Notional\nvalue\nDerivative instruments designated as hedging instruments:\nInterest rate swap July 2017 - July 2021 $ 150,000\nInterest rate swap February 2018 - June 2021 50,000\nInterest rate swap June 2019 - June 2021 75,000\nInterest rate swap November 2020 - October 2024 60,000\nInterest rate swap November 2020 - October 2024 60,000\n$ 395,000\nForward-starting interest rate swap June 2021 - October 2024 120,000\nForward-starting interest rate swap July 2021 - October 2024 120,000\n$ 240,000\n2020 Form 10-K\nBlackbaud, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nThe fair values of our derivative instruments were as follows as of:\nLiability Derivatives\n(dollars in thousands) Balance sheet location December 31,\n2020 December 31,\nDerivative instruments designated as hedging instruments:\nInterest rate swaps, current portion Accrued expenses\nand other current liabilities $ 2,698 $ -\nInterest rate swaps, long-term portion Other liabilities 1,461 1,757\nTotal derivative instruments designated as hedging instruments $ 4,159 $ 1,757\nThe effects of derivative instruments in cash flow hedging relationships were as follows:\nGain (loss) recognized\nin accumulated other\ncomprehensive\nloss as of Location\nof gain (loss)\nreclassified from\naccumulated other\ncomprehensive\nloss into income Gain (loss) reclassified from accumulated\nother comprehensive loss into income\n(dollars in thousands) December 31,\n2020 Year ended\nDecember 31, 2020\nInterest rate swaps $ (4,159) Interest expense $ (3,827)\nDecember 31,\n2019 Year ended\nDecember 31, 2019\nInterest rate swaps $ (1,757) Interest expense $ 573\nDecember 31,\n2018 Year ended\nDecember 31, 2018\nInterest rate swaps $ 2,074 Interest expense $ 118\nOur policy requires that derivatives used for hedging purposes be designated and effective as a hedge of the identified risk exposure at the inception of the contract. Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) includes unrealized gains or losses from the change in fair value measurement of our derivative instruments each reporting period and the related income tax expense or benefit. Changes in the fair value measurements of the derivative instruments and the related income tax expense or benefit are reflected as adjustments to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) until the actual hedged expense is incurred or until the hedge is terminated at which point the unrealized gain (loss) is reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to current earnings. The estimated accumulated other comprehensive loss as of December 31, 2020 that is expected to be reclassified into earnings within the next twelve months is $3.4 million. There were no ineffective portions of our interest rate swap derivatives during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. See Note 14 to these consolidated financial statements for a summary of the changes in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) by component.\nWe did not have any undesignated derivative instruments during 2020, 2019 and 2018.\n11. Commitments and Contingencies\nLeases\nWe have operating leases for corporate offices, subleased offices and certain equipment and furniture. In August 2020, we completed the purchase of our Global Headquarters Facility that we previously leased (see Note 7). As of December 31, 2020, we had operating leases for office space that had not yet commenced with future rent payments of $3.5 million with a lease term of approximately 3 years.\n2020 Form 10-K\nBlackbaud, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nThe components of lease expense for the year ended December 31, 2020, were as follows:\nYear ended\nDecember 31,\n(dollars in thousands) 2020 2019\nOperating lease cost(1)\n$ 41,210 $ 27,519\nVariable lease cost 4,266 4,035\nSublease income (3,120) (3,189)\nNet lease cost $ 42,356 $ 28,365\n(1)Includes short-term lease costs, which were immaterial.\nDuring the third quarter of 2020, we adjusted our workforce strategy to provide more flexibility for our employees to work remotely when our offices reopen. This change is expected to create efficiencies within our real estate strategy as we optimize our footprint and shift toward more collaborative workspaces within our offices. As a result, during the three months ended September 30, 2020, we reduced the estimated useful lives of our operating lease ROU assets for certain of our office locations we expected to exit. We recorded $16.2 million in incremental operating lease costs during 2020 related to this change in accounting estimate, which accounts for a substantial portion of the increase in operating lease costs during 2020. For these same office locations, we also reduced the estimated useful lives of certain facilities-related fixed assets, which resulted in incremental depreciation expense of $4.6 million during 2020 (see Note 7). During the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, we also recorded $4.0 million in impairments of operating lease ROU assets associated with certain leased office spaces we have ceased using as a result of our adjusted workforce strategy. These impairment charges are reflected in general and administrative expense.\nDuring the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, we recorded $3.8 million in impairments of operating lease ROU assets associated with certain leased office spaces we ceased using as part of our facilities optimization restructuring. These impairments, which were based on our estimates about our inability to sublease the office spaces, were recorded as restructuring expense on our consolidated statements of comprehensive income. See Note 19 to these consolidated financial statements for additional details regarding our facilities optimization restructuring.\nTotal rent expense as determined under ASC 840 was $22.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nMaturities of our operating lease liabilities as of December 31, 2020 were as follows:\nYears ending December 31,\n(dollars in thousands) Operating leases\n2021 10,353\n2022 5,796\n2023 4,417\n2024 3,211\n2025 1,905\nThereafter 3,847\nTotal lease payments 29,529\nLess: Amount representing interest 2,813\nPresent value of future payments $ 26,716\n2020 Form 10-K\nBlackbaud, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nOur ROU assets and lease liabilities are included in the following line items in our consolidated balance sheet:\n(dollars in thousands) December 31,\n2020 December 31,\nOperating leases\nOperating lease right-of-use assets $ 22,671 $ 104,400\nAccrued expenses and other current liabilities $ 9,359 $ 19,784\nOperating lease liabilities, net of current portion 17,357 95,624\nTotal operating lease liabilities $ 26,716 $ 115,408\nAs of December 31, 2020, the weighted average remaining lease terms and discount rates were as follows:\n(dollars in thousands) December 31,\n2020 December 31,\nOperating leases\nWeighted average remaining lease term (years) 4.6 12.5\nWeighted average discount rate 5.70 % 5.96 %\nSupplemental cash flow information related to leases during the year ended December 31, 2020, was as follows:\nYear ended\nDecember 31,\n(dollars in thousands) 2020 2019\nCash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities:\nOperating cash flows from operating leases $ 25,120 $ 24,569\nRight-of-use assets obtained in exchange for lease obligations (non-cash):\nOperating leases 11,002 102,245\nOther commitments\nThe term loans under the 2020 Credit Facility require periodic principal payments. The balance of the term loans and any amounts drawn on the revolving credit loans are due upon maturity of the 2020 Credit Facility in October 2025. The Real Estate Loans also require periodic principal payments and the balance of the Real Estate Loans are due upon maturity in April 2038.\nWe have contractual obligations for third-party technology used in our solutions and for other services we purchase as part of our normal operations. In certain cases, these arrangements require a minimum annual purchase commitment by us. As of December 31, 2020, the remaining aggregate minimum purchase commitment under these arrangements was approximately $94.8 million through 2024.\nSolution and service indemnifications\nIn the ordinary course of business, we provide certain indemnifications of varying scope to customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our solutions or services. If we determine that it is probable that a loss has been incurred related to solution or service indemnifications, any such loss that could be reasonably estimated would be recognized. We have not identified any losses and, accordingly, we have not recorded a liability related to these indemnifications.\nGuarantees and indemnification obligations\nWe enter into agreements in the ordinary course of business with, among others, customers, creditors, vendors and service providers. Pursuant to certain of these agreements we have agreed to indemnify the other party for certain matters, such as property damage, personal injury, acts or omissions of ours, or our employees, agents or representatives, or third-party claims alleging that the activities of its contractual partner pursuant to the contract infringe a patent, trademark or copyright of such third party.\n2020 Form 10-K\nBlackbaud, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nLegal proceedings\nWe are subject to legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, as well as certain other non-ordinary course proceedings, claims and inquiries, as described below. We make a provision for a loss contingency when it is both probable that a material liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. If only a range of estimated losses can be determined, we accrue an amount within the range that, in our judgment, reflects the most likely outcome; if none of the estimates within that range is a better estimate than any other amount, we accrue the low end of the range. For proceedings in which an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible but not probable and an estimate of the loss or range of losses arising from the proceeding can be made, we disclose such an estimate, if material. If such a loss or range of losses is not reasonably estimable, we disclose that fact. We review any such loss contingency provisions at least quarterly and adjust them to reflect the impacts of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel and other information and events pertaining to a particular case. We recognize insurance recoveries, if any, when they are probable of receipt. All associated legal costs are expensed as incurred.\nLegal proceedings are inherently unpredictable. However, we believe that we have valid defenses with respect to the legal matters pending or threatened against us and intend to defend ourselves vigorously against all claims asserted. We further believe that the amount or range of reasonably possible losses related to such pending or threatened legal proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, cash flows, or financial condition should such litigation be resolved unfavorably. It is possible, nevertheless, that our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows could be negatively affected in any particular period by an unfavorable resolution of one or more of such legal proceedings.\nSecurity incident\nAs previously disclosed, we are subject to risks and uncertainties as a result of a ransomware attack against us in May 2020 in which a cybercriminal removed a copy of a subset of data from our self-hosted environment (the \"Security Incident\"). Based on the nature of the Security Incident, our research and third party (including law enforcement) investigation, we have no reason to believe that any data went beyond the cybercriminal, was or will be misused, or will be disseminated or otherwise made available publicly. Our investigation into the Security Incident by our cybersecurity team and third-party forensic advisors remains ongoing.\nDuring 2020, we recorded $10.4 million of expenses related to the Security Incident and offsetting probable insurance recoveries of $9.4 million. Due to the time required to submit and process such insurance claims, we have not yet received all of the accrued insurance recoveries. Of the insurance recoveries recorded, $3.1 million had been paid as of December 31, 2020. Recorded expenses consisted primarily of payments to third-party service providers and consultants, including legal fees, and enhancements to our cybersecurity measures. We present expenses and insurance recoveries related to the Security Incident in general and administrative expense on our condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income. We expect to continue to experience increased costs related to our response to the Security Incident and our efforts to further enhance our security measures, which may or may not be material.\nAs a result of the Security Incident, we are currently subject to certain legal proceedings, claims, inquiries and investigations, as discussed below, and could be the subject of additional legal proceedings, claims, inquires and investigations in the future that might result in adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, or other resolution. Although we carry insurance policies that we believe will provide coverage for a significant portion of our current and expected future losses and expenses related to the Security Incident, there can be no assurance that they will do so.\nBased on our analysis of the factors described above, we have not recorded a liability related to the Security Incident as of December 31, 2020 because we are unable at this time to reasonably estimate the possible loss or range of loss.\nCustomer claims. To date, we have received approximately 570 claims for reimbursement of expenses from customers or their attorneys in the U.S., U.K. and Canada related to the Security Incident (none of which have as yet been filed in court or in arbitration). Possible exposure could result from our customers\u2019 costs and expenses associated with notifying their own customers of the Security Incident and taking steps to assure that personal information has not been compromised as a result of the Security Incident. We are in the process of analyzing individual customer contracts into which we have entered, the specific claims made and applicable law. At this time we cannot determine what, if any, exposure we have in the context of customer claims.\n2020 Form 10-K\nBlackbaud, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nCustomer constituent class actions. Presently, we are a defendant in 30 putative consumer class action cases [27 in U.S. federal courts (some of which have been consolidated under multi district litigation to a single federal court), 1 in a U.S. state court and 2 in Canadian courts] alleging harm from the Security Incident. The plaintiffs in these cases, who purport to represent various classes of individual constituents of our customers, generally claim to have been harmed by alleged actions and/or omissions by us in connection with the Security Incident and assert a variety of common law and statutory claims seeking monetary damages, injunctive relief, costs and attorneys\u2019 fees, and other related relief.\nLawsuits that are putative class actions require a plaintiff to satisfy a number of procedural requirements before proceeding to trial. These requirements include, among others, demonstration to a court that the law proscribes in some manner our activities, the making of factual allegations sufficient to suggest that our activities exceeded the limits of the law and a determination by the court-known as class certification-that the law permits a group of individuals to pursue the case together as a class. If these procedural requirements are not met, the lawsuit cannot proceed as a class action and the plaintiff may lose the financial incentive to proceed with the case. Frequently, a court\u2019s determination as to these procedural requirements is subject to appeal to a higher court. As a result of these uncertainties, we may be unable to determine the probability of loss until, or after, a court has finally determined that a plaintiff has satisfied the applicable class action procedural requirements.\nFurthermore, for putative class actions, it is often not possible to estimate the possible loss or a range of loss amounts, even where we have determined that a loss is reasonably possible. Generally, class actions involve a large number of people and raise complex legal and factual issues that result in uncertainty as to their outcome and, ultimately, making it difficult for us to estimate the amount of damages that a plaintiff might successfully prove. This analysis is further complicated by the fact that the plaintiffs lack contractual privity with us.\nGovernmental inquiries. To date, we have received a consolidated, multi-state Civil Investigative Demand issued on behalf of 44 state Attorneys General and the District of Columbia relating to the Security Incident. In addition, we have received communications, inquires and requests from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office in the United Kingdom (the \u201cICO\u201d) under the U.K. Data Protection Act 2018, the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner and the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada. We are cooperating with these offices and responding to their inquiries.\n12. Income Taxes\nWe file income tax returns in the U.S. for federal and various state jurisdictions as well as in foreign jurisdictions including Canada, the U.K., Australia, Ireland and Costa Rica. We are generally subject to U.S. federal income tax examination for calendar tax years 2016 through 2020 as well as state and foreign income tax examinations for various years depending on statutes of limitations of those jurisdictions. We are currently under U.S. federal income tax examination for the calendar year 2016.\n2020 Form 10-K\nBlackbaud, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nThe following summarizes the components of income tax expense (benefit):\nYears ended December 31,\n(dollars in thousands) 2020 2019 2018\nCurrent taxes:\nU.S. Federal $ (407) $ 1,534 $ (1,088)\nU.S. State and local 1,563 613 1,182\nInternational 3,904 130 306\nTotal current taxes 5,060 2,277 400\nDeferred taxes:\nU.S. Federal (1,064) (1,724) 659\nU.S. State and local 7,725 (2,235) 45\nInternational 2,176 359 (1,323)\nTotal deferred taxes 8,837 (3,600) (619)\nTotal income tax provision (benefit) $ 13,897 $ (1,323) $ (219)\nThe following summarizes the components of income before provision for income taxes:\nYears ended December 31,\n(dollars in thousands) 2020 2019 2018\nU.S. $ (4,112) $ 5,149 $ 47,532\nInternational 25,726 5,436 (2,910)\nIncome before provision for income taxes $ 21,614 $ 10,585 $ 44,622\n2020 Form 10-K\nBlackbaud, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nA reconciliation between the effect of applying the federal statutory rate and the effective income tax rate used to calculate our income tax provision (benefit) is as follows:\nYears ended December 31,\n2020 2019 2018\nFederal statutory rate 21.0 % 21.0 % 21.0 %\nEffect of:\nState income taxes, net of federal benefit 5.9 (1.7) 4.1\nChange in foreign income tax rate applied to deferred tax balances 4.0 2.0 -\nChange in state income tax rate applied to deferred tax balances 0.1 (3.1) (0.4)\nChange in valuation reserve (primarily state credit reserves) 38.2 3.7 0.4\nSection 162(m) limitation 17.5 30.8 4.2\nNondeductible meals, entertainment and transportation 3.3 11.3 2.6\nUnrecognized tax benefit 1.3 4.4 (2.6)\nGILTI inclusion 1.3 5.9 -\nFDII benefit - (1.5) (0.7)\nStock-based compensation (1.2) (20.2) (17.4)\nForeign tax rate (1.7) 0.3 0.2\nState credits, net of federal benefit (2.3) (15.4) (1.9)\nDTA Adjustment - NOLs (3.3) - -\nReturn to accrual adjustment (4.1) (10.6) (1.6)\nFederal credits generated (17.4) (37.6) (10.4)\nOther 1.7 (1.8) 2.0\nIncome tax provision (benefit) effective rate 64.3 % (12.5) % (0.5) %\nThe increase in our effective tax rate in 2020 when compared to 2019, was primarily due to increase in valuation allowance attributable to state tax credit carryforwards for which we do not expect to realize benefit. Furthermore, our 2020 effective tax rate was negatively impacted by reduced benefit attributable to research tax credit and stock based compensation deduction. Lastly, higher 2020 earnings lessened impact of other non-deductible items.\n2020 Form 10-K\nBlackbaud, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nThe significant components of our deferred tax assets and liabilities were as follows:\nDecember 31,\n(dollars in thousands) 2020 2019\nDeferred tax assets relating to:\nFederal and state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards $ 5,592 $ 9,203\nFederal, state and foreign tax credits 42,598 24,435\nStock-based compensation 17,434 11,717\nOperating leases 13,375 35,620\nAllowance for credit losses 2,399 1,374\nIntangible assets 1,663 1,560\nDeferred revenue 524 682\nAccrued bonuses - 1,713\nOther 9,111 7,487\nTotal deferred tax assets 92,696 93,791\nDeferred tax liabilities relating to:\nIntangible assets (45,757) (46,569)\nCapitalized software development costs (28,804) (26,107)\nCosts of obtaining contracts (20,256) (21,128)\nOperating leases (12,333) (32,888)\nFixed assets (8,458) (4,446)\nOther (398) (315)\nTotal deferred tax liabilities (116,006) (131,453)\nValuation allowance (29,184) (6,453)\nNet deferred tax liability $ (52,494) $ (44,115)\nAs of December 31, 2020, our federal, foreign and state net operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes were approximately $18.5 million, $2.1 million and $21.4 million, respectively. The federal and state net operating loss carryforwards are subject to various Internal Revenue Code limitations and applicable state tax laws. If not utilized, the federal net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2028 and the state net operating loss carryforwards will expire over various periods beginning in 2021. Our foreign net operating loss carryforwards have an unlimited carryforward period. As of December 31, 2020, our foreign tax credit carryforwards for income tax purposes were insignificant. Our federal tax credit carryforwards for income tax purposes were approximately $14.1 million. Our state tax credit carryforwards for income tax purposes were approximately $30.9 million, net of federal benefit. If not utilized, the federal tax credit carryforwards will begin to expire in 2036 and the state tax credit carryforwards will begin to expire in 2021. A portion of the foreign and state net operating loss carryforwards and state credit carryforwards have a valuation reserve due to management's uncertainty regarding the future ability to use such carryforwards.\nAs of each reporting date, management considers new evidence, both positive and negative, that could affect its view of the future realization of deferred tax assets. As of December 31, 2020, in part because requisite tax planning strategies are no longer considered feasible and prudent, management determined that it is more likely than not that the benefit from certain state tax credit carryforwards will not be realized. In recognition of this risk, we have provided a valuation allowance of $28.2 million on the deferred tax assets related to these state tax credit carryforwards. The increase in valuation allowance resulted in $8.3 million charge to income tax expense and non-recognition of benefit attributable to credits generated in the current year.\n2020 Form 10-K\nBlackbaud, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nThe following table illustrates the change in our deferred tax asset valuation allowance:\nYears ended December 31,\n(dollars in thousands) Balance\nat beginning\nof year Acquisition-\nrelated\nchange Charges to\nexpense Balance at\nend of\nyear\n2020 $ 6,453 $ - $ 22,731 $ 29,184\n2019 6,855 - (402) 6,453\n2018 7,205 16 (366) 6,855\nThe following table sets forth the change to our unrecognized tax benefit for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018:\nYears ended December 31,\n(dollars in thousands) 2020 2019 2018\nBalance at beginning of year $ 4,346 $ 3,704 $ 5,160\nIncreases from prior period positions 414 1,183 104\nDecreases in prior year positions (614) (385) (413)\nIncreases from current period positions 491 456 58\nLapse of statute of limitations (12) (612) (1,205)\nBalance at end of year $ 4,625 $ 4,346 $ 3,704\nThe total amount of unrecognized tax benefit that, if recognized, would favorably affect the effective tax rate was $4.2 million at December 31, 2020. Certain prior period amounts relating to our 2014 acquisitions are covered under indemnification agreements and, therefore, we have recorded a corresponding indemnification asset. We recognize accrued interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. The total amount of accrued interest and penalties included in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 was $1.1 million and $1.0 million, respectively. The total amount of interest and penalties included in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income as an increase or decrease in income tax expense for 2020, 2019 and 2018 was insignificant.\nWe have taken federal and state tax positions for which it is reasonably possible that the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits might decrease within the next twelve months. This possible decrease could result from the expiration of statutes of limitations. The reasonably possible decrease at December 31, 2020 was $1.1 million.\nFor our undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries, which we do not consider to be significant, we concluded that these earnings would be permanently reinvested in the local jurisdictions and not repatriated to the United States. Accordingly, we have not provided for U.S. state income taxes and foreign withholding taxes on those undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries. If some or all of such earnings were to be remitted, the amount of taxes payable would be insignificant.\n13. Stock-based Compensation\nEmployee stock-based compensation plans\nUnder the 2016 Equity and Incentive Compensation Plan Amended and Restated as of June 13, 2019 (the \"2016 Equity Plan\"), we may grant incentive stock options, nonstatutory stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, other stock awards and cash incentive awards to employees, directors and consultants. We maintain other stock-based compensation plans including the 2008 Equity Incentive Plan (the \u201c2008 Equity Plan\u201d), under which no additional grants may be made.\nIn connection with the acquisition of Convio in May 2012, we maintain the Convio, Inc. 1999 Stock Option/Stock Issuance Plan, as amended (the \u201cConvio 1999 Plan\u201d) and Convio, Inc. 2009 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended (the \u201cConvio 2009 Plan\u201d), which we assumed upon the acquisition of Convio. Our Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors administers all of these plans and the stock-based awards are granted under terms determined by them.\n2020 Form 10-K\nBlackbaud, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nThe total number of authorized stock-based awards available under our plans was 4,779,951 as of December 31, 2020. We issue common stock from our pool of authorized stock upon exercise of stock options and stock appreciation rights, vesting of restricted stock units or upon granting of restricted stock.\nHistorically, we have issued four types of awards under these plans: restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, stock options and stock appreciation rights (\"SARs\"). There have been no new stock options or SARs granted since 2005 and 2013, respectively. The following table sets forth the number of awards outstanding for each award type as of:\nOutstanding at December 31,\nAward type 2020 2019\nRestricted stock awards 1,277,109 1,316,764\nRestricted stock units 1,170,885 501,487\nStock options - 206\nThe majority of the stock-based awards granted under these plans have a 10-year contractual term. Awards granted to our executive officers and certain members of management are subject to accelerated vesting upon a change in control as defined in the employees\u2019 retention agreement.\nExpense recognition\nWe recognize compensation expense associated with stock options and awards with performance or market based vesting conditions on an accelerated basis over the requisite service period of the individual grantees, which generally equals the vesting period. We recognize compensation expense associated with restricted stock awards and SARs on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the individual grantees, which generally equals the vesting period. We recognize the effect of awards for which the requisite service period is not rendered when the award is forfeited (that is, we recognize the effect of forfeitures in compensation cost when they occur). Previously recognized compensation cost for an award is reversed in the period that the award is forfeited.\nStock-based compensation expense is allocated to cost of revenue and operating expenses on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income based on where the associated employee\u2019s compensation is recorded. The following table summarizes stock-based compensation expense:\nYears ended December 31,\n(in thousands) 2020 2019 2018\nIncluded in cost of revenue:\nCost of recurring $ 5,793 $ 1,879 $ 2,464\nCost of one-time services and other 7,581 1,487 2,778\nTotal included in cost of revenue 13,374 3,366 5,242\nIncluded in operating expenses:\nSales, marketing and customer success 15,514 11,203 9,285\nResearch and development 18,527 11,115 9,048\nGeneral and administrative 39,842 32,949 24,699\nTotal included in operating expenses 73,883 55,267 43,032\nTotal stock-based compensation expense $ 87,257 $ 58,633 $ 48,274\nSee Note 2 for discussion of the additional equity award grants we made in response to COVID-19.\nThe total amount of compensation cost related to unvested awards not recognized was $98.7 million at December 31, 2020. It is expected that this amount will be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.4 years.\n2020 Form 10-K\nBlackbaud, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nRestricted stock awards\nWe have granted shares of common stock subject to certain restrictions under the 2016 Equity Plan and the 2008 Equity Plan. Restricted stock awards granted to employees vest in equal annual installments generally over 4 years from the grant date subject to the recipient\u2019s continued employment with us. Restricted stock awards granted to non-employee directors vest after one year from the date of grant or, if earlier, immediately prior to the next annual election of directors, provided the non-employee director is serving as a director at that time. The fair market value of the stock at the time of the grant is amortized on a straight-line basis to expense over the period of vesting. Recipients of restricted stock awards have the right to vote such shares and receive dividends, if declared.\nThe following table summarizes our unvested restricted stock awards as of December 31, 2020, and changes during the year then ended:\nRestricted stock awards Restricted\nstock awards Weighted\naverage\ngrant-date\nfair value Weighted\naverage\nremaining\ncontractual\nterm\n(in years) Aggregate\nintrinsic value(1)\n(in thousands)\nUnvested at January 1, 2020 1,316,764 $ 79.92\nGranted 657,718 77.16\nVested (520,296) 76.66\nForfeited (177,077) 80.71\nUnvested at December 31, 2020 1,277,109 79.54 8.4 $ 73,510\n(1)The intrinsic value is calculated as the market value as of the end of the fiscal period.\nThe total fair value of restricted stock awards that vested during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $39.9 million, $37.5 million and $24.2 million, respectively. The weighted average grant-date fair value of restricted stock awards granted during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 was $78.39 and $94.51, respectively.\nRestricted stock units\nWe have also granted restricted stock units subject to certain restrictions under the 2016 Equity Plan and the 2008 Equity Plan. Restricted stock units granted to employees vest in equal annual installments generally over 3 years from the grant date subject to the recipient\u2019s continued employment with us. We have also granted restricted stock units for which vesting is subject to meeting certain performance and/or market conditions. Restricted stock units granted with a market condition had a fair market value assigned at the grant date based on the use of a Monte Carlo simulation model. The fair market value of the stock at the time of the grant is amortized to expense on a straight-line basis over the period of vesting except for awards with market or performance conditions, which are amortized on an accelerated basis over the period of vesting.\nThe following table summarizes our unvested restricted stock units as of December 31, 2020, and changes during the year then ended:\nRestricted stock units Restricted\nstock units Weighted\naverage\ngrant-date\nfair value Weighted\naverage\nremaining\ncontractual\nterm\n(in years) Aggregate\nintrinsic value(1)\n(in thousands)\nUnvested at January 1, 2020 501,487 $ 80.49\nGranted 1,020,381 59.59\nForfeited (111,450) 67.75\nVested (239,533) 78.97\nUnvested at December 31, 2020 1,170,885 63.62 9.0 $ 67,396\n(1)The intrinsic value is calculated as the market value as of the end of the fiscal period.\n2020 Form 10-K\nBlackbaud, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nThe total fair value of restricted stock units that vested during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $18.9 million, $19.2 million, and $13.7 million, respectively. The weighted average grant date fair value of restricted stock units granted for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 was $77.90 and $95.59, respectively.\nStock appreciation rights\nAll SARs previously granted were fully vested as of December 31, 2017. The total intrinsic value of SARs exercised during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 was $3.6 million and $12.4 million, respectively. SARs granted with a market condition had a fair market value assigned at the grant date based on the use of a Monte Carlo simulation model. All other SARs granted had a fair market value assigned at the grant date based on the use of the Black-Scholes option pricing model.\n14. Stockholders' Equity\nPreferred stock\nOur Board of Directors may fix the relative rights and preferences of each series of preferred stock in a resolution of the Board of Directors.\nDividends\nIn March 2020, in response to the global COVID-19 pandemic, our Board of Directors rescinded its previously announced policy to pay an annual dividend at a rate of $0.48 per share of common stock and discontinued the declaration and payment of all cash dividends beginning with the second quarter of 2020 and thereafter until such time, if any, as it may otherwise determine in its sole discretion.\nThe following table provides information with respect to quarterly dividends paid on common stock during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nDeclaration Date Dividend\nper Share Record Date Payable Date\nFebruary 10, 2020 $ 0.12 February 28 March 13\nStock repurchase program\nIn November 2020, our Board of Directors reauthorized and expanded a stock repurchase program that authorizes us to purchase up to $250.0 million of our outstanding shares of common stock. The program does not have an expiration date. Under the stock repurchase program, we are authorized to repurchase shares from time to time in accordance with applicable laws both on the open market, including under trading plans established pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and in privately negotiated transactions. The timing and amount of repurchases depends on several factors, including market and business conditions, the trading price of our common stock and the nature of other investment opportunities. The repurchase program may be limited, suspended or discontinued at any time without prior notice. Under the 2020 Credit Facility, we have restrictions on our ability to repurchase shares of our common stock.\nWe account for purchases of treasury stock under the cost method. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we purchased 714,000 shares for $41.0 million. The remaining amount available to purchase stock under the stock repurchase program was $209.0 million as of December 31, 2020.\nBetween January 1, 2021 and February 19, 2021, we repurchased an additional 465,821 shares for $28.1 million.\n2020 Form 10-K\nBlackbaud, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nChanges in accumulated other comprehensive loss by component\nThe changes in accumulated other comprehensive loss by component, consisted of the following:\nYears ended December 31,\n(in thousands) 2020 2019 2018\nAccumulated other comprehensive loss, beginning of period $ (5,290) $ (5,110) $ (642)\nBy component:\nGains and losses on cash flow hedges:\nAccumulated other comprehensive (loss) income balance, beginning of period $ (1,323) $ 1,498 $ 748\nOther comprehensive (loss) income before reclassifications, net of tax effects of $1,625, $860 and $(239)\n(4,602) (2,399) 670\nAmounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income to interest expense 3,827 (573) (118)\nTax (benefit) expense included in provision for income taxes (1,003) 151 31\nTotal amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income 2,824 (422) (87)\nNet current-period other comprehensive (loss) income (1,778) (2,821) 583\nReclassification upon adoption of ASU 2018-02 - - 167\nAccumulated other comprehensive (loss) income balance, end of period $ (3,101) $ (1,323) $ 1,498\nForeign currency translation adjustment:\nAccumulated other comprehensive loss balance, beginning of period $ (3,967) $ (6,608) $ (1,390)\nTranslation adjustments 4,571 2,641 (5,218)\nAccumulated other comprehensive income (loss) balance, end of period 604 (3,967) (6,608)\nAccumulated other comprehensive loss, end of period $ (2,497) $ (5,290) $ (5,110)\n15. Defined Contribution Plan\nWe have a defined contribution 401(k) plan (the \"401K Plan\") covering substantially all employees. Employees were able to contribute between 1% and 75% of their salaries in 2020, 2019 and 2018. We match 50% of qualified employees\u2019 contributions up to 6% of their salary. The 401K Plan also provides for additional employer contributions to be made at our discretion. We suspended our 401(k) match program between April 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020 in response to COVID-19. Total matching contributions to the 401K Plan for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 were $1.9 million, $8.7 million and $8.1 million, respectively.\nWe made a discretionary matching contribution to eligible employees 401(k) plans in December 2020 totaling $1.2 million, given our financial performance during the fourth quarter. There were no discretionary contributions by us to the 401K Plan in 2019 and 2018.\n2020 Form 10-K\nBlackbaud, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n16. Segment Information\nOur chief operating decision maker is our chief executive officer (\"CEO\").

Revenue Recognition\nTransaction price allocated to the remaining performance obligations\nAs of December 31, 2020, approximately $755 million of revenue is expected to be recognized from remaining performance obligations. We expect to recognize revenue on approximately 60% of these remaining performance obligations over the next 12 months, with the remainder recognized thereafter.\nWe applied the practical expedient in ASC 606-10-50-14 and have excluded the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for (i) contracts with an original expected length of one year or less (one-time services); and (ii) contracts for which we recognize revenue at the amount to which we have the right to invoice for services performed (payment services and usage).\nWe also applied the practical expedient in ASC 606-10-65-1-(f)(3), whereby the transaction price allocated to the remaining performance obligations, or an explanation of when we expect to recognize that amount as revenue for all reporting periods presented before the date of the initial application, is not disclosed.\nContract balances\nOur contract assets as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 were insignificant. Our opening and closing balances of deferred revenue were as follows:\n(in thousands) December 31,\n2020 December 31,\nTotal deferred revenue $ 316,914 $ 316,137\nDeferred revenue was held flat during 2020, primarily due to declines in our 2020 bookings performance compared to our budgeted expectations as a result of COVID-19. The amount of revenue recognized during the 2020 that was included in the deferred revenue balance at the beginning of the period was approximately $311 million. The amount of revenue recognized during the 2020 from performance obligations satisfied in prior periods was insignificant.\n2020 Form 10-K\nBlackbaud, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nDisaggregation of revenue\nWe sell our cloud solutions and related services in three primary geographical markets: to customers in the United States, to customers in the United Kingdom and to customers located in other countries.

Restructuring\nDuring 2017, in an effort to further our organizational objectives, including improved operating efficiency, customer outcomes and employee satisfaction, we initiated a multi-year plan to consolidate and relocate some of our existing offices to highly modern and more collaborative workspaces with short-term financial commitments. We substantially completed our facilities optimization restructuring plan as of December 2019. During the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we incurred $5.8 million and $4.6 million, respectively, in before-tax restructuring charges related to these activities. Such charges during the year ended December 31, 2020 were insignificant.\nRestructuring costs incurred prior to our adoption of ASU 2016-02 on January 1, 2019 consisted primarily of costs to terminate lease agreements, contractual lease payments, net of estimated sublease income, upon vacating space as part of the plan, as well as insignificant costs to relocate affected employees and write-off facilities-related fixed assets that we would no longer use.\nUpon adoption of ASU 2016-02 at January 1, 2019, we reduced our operating lease ROU assets recognized at transition by the carrying amounts of the restructuring liabilities for certain leased office spaces that we ceased using prior to December 31, 2018. Restructuring costs incurred during the year ended December 31, 2019 consisted primarily of operating lease ROU asset impairment costs and, to a lesser extent, lease payments for offices we had ceased using and write-offs of facilities-related fixed assets that we would no longer use.\n2020 Form 10-K\nBlackbaud, Inc.",
